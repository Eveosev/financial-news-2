OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the oil producer run by billionaire  Eike Batista , extended a 15
percent slump last week to the lowest in more than four years
after Deutsche Bank AG cut its target price for the shares.  OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro, fell 4.6 percent to 2.90
reais at the close in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Nov. 12, 2008.
OGX led losses and was the most-traded stock by volume on the
benchmark Bovespa index, which declined 0.7 percent.  OGX is likely to relinquish areas in  Brazil ’s Campos basin
by a March 12 deadline and that would lead to lower recoverable
oil volumes, Deutsche’s Marcus Sequeira, the stock’s most
accurate analyst in a Bloomberg Absolute Return  Ranking (OGXP3) , said in
a note to clients today. OGX is still trading at expensive
levels, Sequeira said, after he cut the target price for the
company to 2 reais from 3.8 reais.  “There is a high likelihood of OGX returning blocks, thus
supporting our much lower than consensus recoverable volume
estimates,” Sequeira wrote. “Despite the sharp decline in the
shares, the stock is still expensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
