Smartphones will overtake so-called
feature phones in worldwide shipments for the first time this
year, lifted by more affordable models and surging demand for
Internet-connected mobile devices overseas, IDC said.  Manufacturers will ship 918.6 million smartphones in 2013,
representing 50.1 percent of the industry’s total, the research
firm said today in a report. Smartphones, such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 's
iPhone or  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.'s Galaxy S III, typically 
differ from feature phones by making it easier to surf the Web,
run applications and play videos.  By the end of 2017, smartphones will reach shipments of 1.5
billion, or more than two-thirds of the total, IDC predicts. The
growth is being fueled by demand for the devices in economies
such as China, Brazil and India. The spread of fourth-generation
networks also is making smartphones more attractive, IDC said.  “Even as China starts to mature, there remains enormous
untapped potential in other  emerging markets  like India,” said
Melissa Chau, a senior research manager for IDC’s Asia-Pacific
coverage.  China will the largest smartphone market in 2013, with
301.2 million shipments, followed by the U.S., the U.K., Japan
and Brazil, according to IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
