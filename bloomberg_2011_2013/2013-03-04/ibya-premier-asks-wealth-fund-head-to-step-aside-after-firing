Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zaidan
said the head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund should step
aside and allow his successor to take over after he was fired.  “We are hoping that Mr Derregia will do the right thing
and step down,” Prime Minister Ali Zaidan told reporters
yesterday in Tripoli, referring to Mohsen Derregia, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of the fund, who was fired recently.  Derregia is refusing to leave his post and hasn’t given a
reason for his attempts to remain in his position. Ali Mohamed Salem Hebri, deputy governor of the  Central Bank  of  Libya , is
set to take over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
