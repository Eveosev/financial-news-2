Golf’s European Tour supports a move
to ban the anchored putting stroke, placing it at odds with its
American counterpart.  The tour agrees with a proposal by the  Royal & Ancient Golf
Club  and the  U.S. Golf Association  to outlaw the shot in 2016,
Chief Executive Officer George O’Grady said today in a
statement. The U.S.  PGA Tour  said Feb. 24 it opposes a ban.  “Virtually all our tournament committee and player
representatives support the proposed rule,” O’Grady said.  The USGA sets golf rules for the U.S. and  Mexico , while the
R&A covers the rest of the world. They are reviewing responses
to their planned ban, which has received more objections in the
U.S., O’Grady said.  The stroke, where the putter rests against the body to
create a pendulum-like swing, was used by 15 percent of
professional golfers in 2012. That’s up from 6 percent from 2006
through 2010, according to the two ruling bodies.  Many of golf’s top players, including 14-time major
tournament winner  Tiger Woods , are among those opposed to the
use of anchored putters.  The U.S. PGA Tour’s opposition to the planned ban yields
the possibility that events on the sport’s richest circuit may
eventually have different rules concerning putting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
