Egypt ’s benchmark dollar bonds fell
for the first time in three days and the pound weakened as the
country’s  foreign reserves  fell for a fourth month to the lowest
level in at least 15 years.  The yield on the government’s $1 billion of benchmark 5.75
percent dollar-denominated bonds due in April 2020 gained four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.15 percent, near
the highest level on a closing basis since June, at 4:28 p.m. in
Cairo. The currency depreciated 0.1 percent, the most since Feb.
25, to 6.7442 a dollar, prices compiled by Bloomberg show.  Egypt’s foreign reserves fell by about $100 million in
February to $13.5 billion, the lowest since Bloomberg started
tracking the data in 1997, the central bank said today. That
beat the median estimate of five economists compiled by
Bloomberg for a decline to $13.2 billion. The central bank
trimmed by 41 percent the amount of dollars made available to
banks at foreign exchange auctions in February to $518 million
compared with January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The regulator sold $39.6 million to local lenders at
today’s auction at a weighted average exchange rate of 6.7342
pounds a dollar, according to its data on Bloomberg. The
currency has lost 8.2 percent of its value since the sales
started on Dec. 30 to ration the use of the U.S. currency. Banks
received less than a quarter of the dollars they bid for, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
