Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed as the motor fuel slipped more than the biofuel.  The spread narrowed 1.95 cents to 69.51 cents a gallon as
gasoline declined on the completion of seasonal refinery
maintenance. Ethanol declined in line with corn, which remained
near $7 a bushel.  “Corn is still at a pretty high price,” said Will Babler,
a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,
 Illinois . “And the market is going to remain tight.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery declined 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.403 a gallon at 12:49 p.m. New York time on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The March contract, which expires
tomorrow, fell 1.1 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.395.  Gasoline for April delivery dropped 3.05 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0981 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  Corn for May delivery slipped 9 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$6.995 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. The March contract fell 5.75 cents to $7.185
a bushel.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was 15 cents a gallon
based on May contracts. The amount doesn’t include revenue from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production, which can be fed to livestock.  In cash market trading, the biofuel rose 3.5 cents to $2.55
a gallon in  New York , 2.5 cents to $2.42 in Chicago, 2.5 cents
to $2.47 on the  Gulf Coast , and 0.5 cent to $2.625 on the West
Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
