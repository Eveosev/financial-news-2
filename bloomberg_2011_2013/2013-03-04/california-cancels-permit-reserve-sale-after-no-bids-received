California canceled a supplementary
sale of carbon permits scheduled this week after receiving no
expressions of interest from factories and power stations, the
state emissions market administrator said.  “As of the bid guarantee deadline of February 27, 2013, no
covered entities or opt-in entities had indicated an intent to
bid at the March 2013 reserve sale and provided a bid
guarantee,” the State Air Resources Board said in an e-mailed
 statement . “Therefore, the Air Resources Board will not be
holding the reserve sale scheduled for March 8, 2013.”  California’s emissions-trading system allows industrial
plants with limits on greenhouse-gas discharges under the system
to buy allowances directly from the administrator in quarterly
sales. These are in addition to periodic auctions in which banks
and trading companies can also participate.  The state sold 12.9 million allowances for 2013 at $13.62 a
metric ton in an auction on Feb. 19, the second such sale of
permits since the market started last year. The program seeks to
reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  The unsold permits from March will be offered in the next
reserve sale scheduled for June, the Air Resources Board said.
These supplementary sales have a  reserve price  of $40 a ton to
$50 a ton and are scheduled to help control the price ceiling
for the system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
