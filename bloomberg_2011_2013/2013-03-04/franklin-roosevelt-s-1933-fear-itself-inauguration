Not since Abraham Lincoln’s 1861 inauguration had an incoming U.S. president faced so comprehensive a crisis as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in early 1933. The U.S. banking system was crumbling, millions of Americans were unemployed, international relations were strained, and efforts to reverse the Great Depression’s effects had floundered. In mid-February, the president-elect survived an assassination attempt in Miami. Five people where hit, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who died three weeks later. Two weeks after the shooting, Roosevelt's nominee for attorney general, Senator Thomas Walsh of Montana, died suddenly aboard a train. Not good omens for the new administration. Even so, on Saturday, March 4, Roosevelt and President Herbert Hoover rode in an open car from the White House to the Capitol’s East Portico. There, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes administered the oath of office, and the U.S.'s 32nd chief executive turned to address the nation. More than 175 radio stations broadcast his words globally. The address proved a touchstone for many Americans. Roosevelt then turned to those he judged responsible for the U.S.'s unfolding economic disaster: Looking forward, his agenda was clear: getting the U.S. economy moving again. Public response was immediate and positive. The Chattanooga (Tennessee) Times wrote, "President Roosevelt’s inaugural address marked him as a man of vision and purpose, who understands the seriousness of the existing situation and knows what he wants to do about it."  The St. Paul (Minnesota) Dispatch added: "His address was a courageous call for action, based on a robust confidence in the fundamental strength of the country and in his own powers." Plainly, the central task for the new administration was to realize the promise of his words by enacting policies in the months ahead.
