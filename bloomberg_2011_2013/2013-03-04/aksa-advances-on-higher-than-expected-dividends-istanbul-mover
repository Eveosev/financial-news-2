Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii (AKSA)  AS rose
the most in more than a month after the Turkish maker of acrylic
fiber proposed a dividend.  The  shares  jumped 3.2 percent to 5.24 liras at the close in
Istanbul, its biggest gain since Jan. 24. About 2.3 million
shares changed hands, or 1.8 times the stock’s three-month
average daily volume. The  ISE National 100 (XU100)  index advanced 0.9
percent.  Aksa will pay a cash dividend of 0.484 lira a share for
last year, the board said after the market closed on March 1.
The payment -- 89.6 million liras ($49.7 million) -- will be
made on March 28 after the board secures shareholders’ approval,
according to a company filing with the Istanbul Stock Exchange.  “This amounts to a dividend yield of about 10 percent and,
as the stock’s gain shows, that’s higher than what investors
were expecting,” Hasan Bayhan, an analyst at Global Securities
in Istanbul, said in a phone interview today. “We may see a
continuation of this strong performance to March 28.”  Bayhan, who said he was expecting a dividend yield of 6
percent, has a buy recommendation on Aksa shares with a 12-month
price target of 6.5 liras.  Aksa’s consolidated net income was 166 million liras ($92.1
million) in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Operating income surged 66 percent to 236.2 million liras, while
sales declined 3 percent to 1.63 billion liras, according to a
company filing on Feb. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
