Gold futures climbed for the first
time in four sessions on speculation that central banks will
continue stimulus measures to spur economic growth.  Haruhiko Kuroda, the nominee to be  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor,
said he would do whatever is needed to end 15 years of
deflation. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said the
U.S. central bank should press on with $85 billion in monthly
bond buying. Gold advanced 7 percent last year as nations from
the U.S. to  China  pledged more stimulus to bolster economic
growth.  “It seems as if accommodative monetary policies are here
to stay for some time,” Lance Roberts, the chief executive
officer of Streettalk Advisors LLC in Houston, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery rose 10 cents to settle at
$1,572.40 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  The metal pared gains of as much as 0.8 percent after
 Italy ’s inconclusive election spurred mounting debt concerns in
 Europe . The euro fell for the third straight session against the
dollar.  “The weaker euro is pushing gold lower,”  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview.  The metal, down 2.7 percent in the previous three sessions,
has dropped 6.2 percent this year.  Physical demand picked up “markedly” below $1,600,
Standard Bank Plc’s SBG Securities (Pty) Ltd. said today.  Silver futures for May delivery climbed less than 0.1
percent to $28.496 an ounce on the Comex. On March 1, the price
touched $27.925, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Aug. 16. The metal has declined 5.7 percent this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,566.20 an ounce. The price
dropped for the fifth straight session, the longest slump since
Dec. 24.  Palladium futures for June delivery declined 0.8 percent to
$714.45 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
