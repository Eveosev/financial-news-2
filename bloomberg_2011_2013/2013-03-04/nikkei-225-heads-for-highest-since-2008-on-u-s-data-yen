Japan  stocks rose a third day, with
the  Topix Index (TPX)  touching 1,000 for the first time since 2010, as
Bank of Japan nominee Haruhiko Kuroda vowed to fight deflation.
Volume fell after a system error halted trading of Nikkei 225
Stock Average futures and options in  Osaka .  Jowa Holdings Co. led property stocks higher on a Nikkei
newspaper report real estate investment trusts may have raised
record funds in anticipation of more easing. Hitachi Zosen Corp.
led gains on the Nikkei 225 on a report it will sell reactor
vessels in the U.S. East Japan Railway Co. gained 4.1 percent on
a report it will resume bullet-train service to Akita following
a derailment.  The Topix advanced 0.8 percent to close at 992.25 in  Tokyo ,
the highest level since April 27, 2010. It earlier climbed above
1,000 for the first time since April 15, 2010. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
gained 0.4 percent to 11,652.29, with volume 21 percent below
the 30-day intraday average.  “Kuroda formally made his intention clear and that’s why
investors appreciated his resolve even though his stance was
well-known,” said Tamiji Shinada, Tokyo-based executive
director of investment research at Nomura Securities Co.,
Japan’s biggest brokerage. “Shares pared gains after digesting
his comments and due to a technical issue tied to the system
error.”  The Topix surged 37 percent from Nov. 14 amid optimism a
new government will push bold policy to beat deflation and after
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated easing proponent Kuroda to
lead the central bank. The measure is trading at 1.2 times  book
value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Kuroda’s Pledge  Kuroda said the central bank will do whatever needed to end
15 years of deflation should he be named governor and indicated
that open-ended asset purchases could begin sooner than 2014.
The Asian Development Bank president, who was speaking today at
his confirmation hearing at parliament, would take office after
sitting BOJ head  Masaaki Shirakawa  retires March 19.  “Kuroda will do what he’s supposed to do in the long run,
which is to continue to ease step-by-step,” said Kenichi Kubo,
a senior  fund manager  at Tokio Marine Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($54 billion). “The focus
will be on how he proceeds, how he manages expectations, and how
he communicates with the market.”  Developers and banks advanced today on optimism additional
monetary easing by the BOJ will boost land prices and lending.  Developers Jump  Jowa Holdings surged 11 percent to 2,202 yen and Nomura
Real Estate Holdings soared 10 percent to 1,985 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender by
market value, gained 1.7 percent to 3,835 yen. Shinsei Bank Ltd.
added 6.4 percent to 217 yen.  Trading of Nikkei 225 derivatives restarted at 2:10 p.m. in
Osaka. The reason for the system error is unclear, Japan
Exchange Group Inc. spokeswoman Miwa Aonuma said by phone today.
It’s the first outage for the J-Gate derivatives-trading
platform since the Osaka bourse adopted it in February 2011. The
failure began with options at 10:20 a.m. and spread to futures
at 10:51 a.m., with trades of individual  stock options  not
affected, Aonuma said.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 2.4 percent
to 27.14, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.8 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. The gauge earlier
plunged 26 percent, the biggest drop in volatility since March
22, 2011. Turnover on the Nikkei 225 was 1.38 trillion yen, 9.2
percent below the 30-day moving average.  Hitachi Zosen surged 13 percent to 160 yen after the Nikkei
said it will sell the U.S. vessels that convert natural gas into
synthetic oils.  Back on Track  East Japan Railway Co. gained 4.1 percent to 7,350 yen
after the national broadcaster NHK said it will resume bullet-
train service to Akita following safety checks. The service was
halted after blizzard conditions caused a derailment on March 2.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slid 0.5 percent today. The
U.S. equity gauge advanced 0.2 percent on March 1, when the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s gauge of factory activity
climbed to 54.2, the highest reading since June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
