German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , a
habitual user of text messaging, will be able to upgrade to a
secure smartphone this year as the government orders 10,000
hack-proof devices,  WirtschaftsWoche  magazine reported.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  unit T-Systems and Secusmart, a
Dusseldorf-based security specialist, won orders for the new
devices, which will now be able to encrypt phone conversations
as well as e-mail messages, the magazine said. Top-level
officials will also be able to access Facebook and Twitter.  The Telekom software will be installed on Galaxy S2 and S3
models from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , while Secusmart will offer
a  BlackBerry (BB)  Z10. Germany’s  Federal Office Information Security
Technology , the BSI, had previously determined that BlackBerry
devices were unfit for national security because data was routed
through a server in the U.K., the magazine said.  German officials will now be able to send and receive
classified documents over the devices, WirtschaftsWoche said.  The Bonn-based BSI didn’t immediately respond to a request
seeking confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
