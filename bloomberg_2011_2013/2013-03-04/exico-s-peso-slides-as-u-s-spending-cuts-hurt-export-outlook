Mexico’s longer-term peso bond
yields tumbled to record lows as investors bet policy makers led
by central bank Governor Agustin Carstens would cut the
reference rate this week for the first time since 2009.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2042 fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 5.99 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the lowest closing level since the
debt was issued last April. The price rose 0.77 centavo to
124.45 centavos per peso today. The peso appreciated 0.1 percent
to 12.7454 per dollar.  Speculation has been mounting that Banco de Mexico will
reduce its 4.5 percent benchmark rate since policy makers said
Jan. 18 a reduction “may be advisable” if cost-of-living
increases continue to ebb. The rate of consumer price increases
slowed for four straight months through January, with the rate
falling to 3.25 percent that month.  “If there’s a cut and the whole curve moves down in terms
of yield then you have capital gains on the price,” Alejandro Urbina, who helps oversee $800 million in emerging-market assets
at Silva Capital Management, said by phone from Chicago. “Your
maximum gains on that price is with the highest duration at the
very long end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
