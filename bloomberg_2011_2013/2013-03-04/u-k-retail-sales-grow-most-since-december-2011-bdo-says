U.K. retail sales grew at the
fastest pace for more than a year in February as consumers kept
indoors by snow in January returned to the shops, according to a
survey by BDO LLP.  Like-for-like sales climbed by 3.9 percent, the most since
December 2011, BDO said in its High Street Sales Tracker report
released today. Retailers extended start-of-year promotions,
boosting sales of clothing, footwear and homeware. The data
include companies with annual revenue between 5 million pounds
($7.5 million) and 500 million pounds.  “Retailers have given people a reason to spend by
extending the January sales and shoppers have responded
extremely positively,” Don Williams, BDO’s national head of
retail and wholesale, said in the statement. “The high street
tends to dread February, but these results will be a fillip for
retailers. The fact this year’s major snowfall was earlier
flatter the figures slightly, but there is no doubt they reflect
increasing  consumer confidence .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
