Peru ’s sol dropped to its lowest
level in three months as local banks purchased U.S. currency to
meet increased  reserve requirements .  The sol depreciated almost 0.1 percent to 2.5973 per dollar
at the close in Lima, its weakest level since Nov. 20, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Peru’s central bank told lenders to set aside more dollars
in reserve for a third time this year on Feb. 27 to help weaken
the sol, which touched a 16-year high on Jan. 14. The sol has
fallen 1.8 percent this year as U.S. currency purchases by the
monetary authority and local pension funds’ increasing
investments abroad tightened the supply of greenbacks.  “The domestic dollar liquidity situation appears to be
extremely tight,”  Clyde Wardle , a currency strategist at HSBC
Holdings Plc, said in a phone interview from  New York . The sol
may “snap back relatively quickly” to about 2.58 if dollar
liquidity recovers.  The one-month implied yield on sol forwards fell to -5.68
percent today, the lowest level on a closing basis since March
2008, indicating demand for greenbacks.  The yield on the sol-denominated bond due in August 2017
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.40
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
0.14 centimo to 125.84 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
