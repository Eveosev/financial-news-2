Moleskine, the Italian maker of
notebooks once favored by  Ernest Hemingway , is seeking about 350
million euros ($455 million) in an initial public offering
announced today, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company is seeking a valuation of about 700 million
euros, said the people, who asked not to be named before the
sale is completed. Appunti Sarl and Pentavest Sarl are selling a
50 percent stake of the company in the IPO, according to a term
sheet obtained by Bloomberg News today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Mediobanca SpA (MB)  are
managing the sale in Italy, along with BNP Paribas SA, the terms
showed. A price range will be announced by mid-March and the
deal will be completed toward the end of the month, according to
the terms.  Syntegra Capital, which owns about 68 percent of Moleskine,
will retain a significant share in the company after the IPO,
the company said last week. Appunti is indirectly controlled by
Syntegra and Pentavest is controlled by Index Ventures Growth I
(Jersey), according to a  filing  to the Italian market regulator
Consob.  A spokesman for Syntegra didnâ€™t immediately respond to
requests for comment. A spokesman for Moleskine declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
