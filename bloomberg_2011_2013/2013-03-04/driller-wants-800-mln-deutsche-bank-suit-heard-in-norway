Petromena ASA, an oil services firm
in bankruptcy, said its $800 million lawsuit against  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  accusing the lender of putting its interest before the
company’s by pulling out of a refinancing deal should be heard
in  Norway .  Deutsche Bank, which owned about a quarter of Petromena’s
debt, offered in 2008 to help provide financing so the company
could complete construction of deep-water drilling rigs,
according to documents filed by Petromena’s lawyers with a
London court. Deutsche Bank then withdrew its support and sold
the bonds to a competing offshore driller --  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) 
Petromena filed for bankruptcy in 2009.  “Without the funds to complete the rig construction,
Petromena’s business fell apart,” lawyers acting for the
company’s chairman said in the documents.  Petromena filed a lawsuit seeking damages from Deutsche
Bank in Oslo in September 2012. The Frankfurt-based lender, in
court documents asking a London court to hear the dispute and
throw it out, called the claim “ambitious.”  Kathryn Hanes, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined to
immediately comment.  Petromena’s lawyer David Wolfson, at a London court hearing
today, said Norway was the correct venue for a trial.  The case is Deutsche Bank AG London Branch v. Petromena
ASA, High Court of Justice, Queen’s  Bench Division , Commercial
Court, 12-842.  To contact the reporter on this story:
