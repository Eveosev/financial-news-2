GMR Group, an Indian infrastructure
builder, agreed to sell its 70 percent stake in a Singapore
power station development to a venture between First Pacific Co.
and  Manila Electric Co. (MER)  for S$600 million ($482 million).  The venture, FPM Power Holdings Ltd., will invest a further
S$60 million in the 800-megawatt plant that will burn liquefied
natural gas, Bangalore-based GMR said in an e-mailed statement.  A 13.56 billion rupee ($247 million) gain on the sale will
be used by GMR to speed up development of 5.5 gigawatts of power
projects in  India , it said. The company sold 30 percent of the
Singapore development to Petronas International Corp. in 2011.  GMR Infrastructure Ltd. (GMRI)   rose  3.9 percent to 18.75 rupees in
Mumbai.  The plant, on Jurong island, is 96 percent complete and
expected to begin operations by the end of the year. The stake
sale needs approval from the project’s lenders and is due to
close by the end of the month, according to the statement.  FPM is a venture between Hong Kong-based First Pacific and
MERALCO PowerGen Corp., a unit of the Philippines’ biggest power
retailer. The plant is held by GMR Energy (Singapore) Pte Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
