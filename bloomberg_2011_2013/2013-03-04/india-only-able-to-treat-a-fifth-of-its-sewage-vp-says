India  is able to treat just a fifth
of its sewage, fueling domestic conflicts as growing cities
battle for water resources, pushing up prices and increasing
leaks, Vice President Hamid Ansari said.  “To quench their ever-increasing thirst, India’s expanding
cities have started sourcing water from further and further
away,” Ansari said today at a conference in  New Delhi . “This
has pushed up the cost of water, increased leakages to around 40
percent and sparked conflicts.”  Shortages of clean water in India, the second most-
populated country after  China , have led to agricultural,
industrial and domestic clashes with struggles over water
supplies expected to escalate, according to a United Nations
Children’s Fund  report  this year. Most cities lack policy on how
to remedy the disposal of raw sewage in water bodies, according
to a study by the Centre for Science and Environment.  “There is a serious lack of foresight in urban sewage and
wastewater management in our country,”  Ansari said.
“Untreated sewage is killing our water.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
