Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) ,
the deep-water oil explorer with wells in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico and West Africa, surged the most since its 2009 initial
share sale amid plans to prolong drilling on prospects that may
hold 2 billion barrels of crude.  Cobalt rose 22 percent to $11 at the close in  New York , the
biggest gain since the company first sold shares to the public
two years ago.  Cobalt extended its $360,000-a-day lease on  Diamond
Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO) ’s Ocean Confidence rig by as much as two
weeks to mid-March 2012, the rig owner said today in a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  The vessel, which has been under lease to Cobalt since July,
is being used to search for crude in the Cameia and Bicuar
prospects in Angolan waters, the Houston-based company said last
month in a presentation on its website. The fields lie 23,000
feet (7,010 meters) to 26,000 feet beneath the sea surface and
contain at least 1 billion barrels of oil each, according to the
presentation.  Lynne Hackedorn, a Cobalt spokeswoman, didn’t return a
telephone message left at her office.  Cobalt’s previous exploration successes have included the
Heidelberg and Shenandoah discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico co-
owned by Andarko Petroleum Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
