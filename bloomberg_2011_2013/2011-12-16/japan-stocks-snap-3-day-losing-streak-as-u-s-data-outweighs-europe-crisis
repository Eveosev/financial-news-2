     Dec. 16 (Bloomberg) --　Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
rose, set to snap a three-day losing streak, after U.S.
unemployment claims fell to the lowest level in three years,
easing concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will drag the global economy
into a recession.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the world’s biggest maker of factory robots,
added 1.3 percent. Nippon Yusen K.K. led gains among shipping
lines after Citigroup Inc. said the industry is likely to
outperform next year.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  fell 3.6 on speculation the
camera-maker will struggle to rebuild capital after it inflated
its assets by $1.3 billion.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent to 8,401.72 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo. The benchmark fell 1.6 percent for
the week. The broader Topix index slipped 0.2 percent today
after  Christine Lagarde , the International Monetary Fund’s
managing director, yesterday said Europe’s crisis is
“escalating.”  “The  U.S. economy  is ending the year in a bit better shape
than people had anticipated, and that is good, but Europe is
obviously not,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “The European
economy is heading toward recession next year, and I think it’s
going to continue to weigh on markets.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  gained 0.4
percent today. The index rose 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday
after U.S. initial jobless claims  fell  last week to the lowest
level since 2008. Stocks also advanced after reports showed
manufacturing in New York and Philadelphia expanded more than
forecast in December.  No ‘Buyback Trigger’  “Stocks are being bought back following gains in the U.S.
and Europe,” saidSoichiro Monji, chief strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of
$37 billion. “People know Japanese shares are cheap, but we
won’t see a big buyback without some kind of a trigger.”  Fanuc gained 1.3 percent to 12,230 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, rose 1.1 percent to
1,360 yen.  Shipping companies gained the most among the 33 Topix
industry groups after Citigroup said the sector, which has
dropped 48 percent this year, will lead a rebound in the Topix
next year. The gauge will recover 20 percent to 870 in 2012, the
bank said in a note dated yesterday.  Nippon Yusen, Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales,
jumped 4.8 percent to 196 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , its
closest rival, gained 5.1 percent to 287 yen.  Kicked While Down  Japanese shares have been hit not only by the European
sovereign-debt crisis, now in its third year, but also by a
strengthening yen and the nation’s worst earthquake on record.
Thai floods also damaged production for companies including
Toyota and Sony. The Topix has fallen 20 percent this year,
compared with a 3.3 percent loss in the  S&P 500  and a 20 decline
in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility at the center of the
worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has been the worst
performer in the Topix this year, losing 89 percent. SxL Corp.,
a homebuilder that benefited from post-quake reconstruction
efforts, jumped 256 percent to 178 yen, the biggest winner on
the gauge.  Olympus fell 3.6 percent to 1,004 yen after President
Shuichi Takayama said he will consider all options to restore
capital, including a tie-up with other companies.  Tokyo  Stock
Exchange rules permit companies to issue new shares to a third
party with a dilutive effect of as much as 25 percent without
seeking shareholder approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
