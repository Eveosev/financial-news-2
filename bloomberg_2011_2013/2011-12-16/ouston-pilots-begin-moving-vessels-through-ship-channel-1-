The Houston Pilots Association has
started moving vessels through the  Houston Ship Channel ,
according to the U.S. Coast Guard.  Outbound ships began moving at 5 a.m. local time and
inbound vessels an hour later, U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant
Michael Scott said in a telephone interview.  Fifty-one inbound ships were waiting to pass through the
waterway, he said. No outbound vessels were backed up.  Vessel traffic was suspended Dec. 13 because fog hampered
visibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
