Accor SA (AC) , owner of the Novotel
lodging brand, agreed to pay 195 million euros ($254 million)
for Mirvac Group’s hotel management business to expand in the
Asia-Pacific region.  The transaction will add 48 hotels, increasing Accor’s
total in Australia and  New Zealand  to 241, the Paris-based
company said in a statement today. The addition of 6,100 rooms
will help the hotelier toward its worldwide room-opening target
for the next two years of 40,000 a year.  “This operation is a major success in a high-growth
market,” Accor Chief Executive Officer  Denis Hennequin  said.
“I am confident in our capacity to reach our objective.”  Accor, Europe’s largest hotel group, has exited catering
and casino businesses to focus on hotels. To cut debt, the
French company is selling hotel freeholds, while signing
agreements to operate or franchise most of them.  Accor rose as much as 3.2 percent in Paris trading and was
up 2.7 percent at 18.30 euros as of 10:39 a.m.  Mirvac Group (MGR) 
shares gained 1.6 percent to A$1.27 in Sydney.  Accor said it will pay 149 million euros for Mirvac Hotels
& Resorts. Together with Singapore real-estate developer
Ascendas, it will also acquire Mirvac’s 49.2 percent stake in a
fund that owns 7 percent of the hotels for 46 million euros.  Most of the hotels are located in Australia and four are in
New Zealand. They will be integrated into Accor’s upscale and
midscale brands. The French company said the purchase will give
it more than 500 hotels in the Asia-Pacific region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
