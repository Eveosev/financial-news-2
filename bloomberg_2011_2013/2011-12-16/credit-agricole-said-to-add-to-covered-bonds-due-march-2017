Credit Agricole Home Loan SFH is
adding at least 125 million euros to its covered bonds maturing
in March 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the
sale.  The bonds may be priced to yield 140 to 145 basis points
more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, the people said.  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  is managing the re-opening.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
