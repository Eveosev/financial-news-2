Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra
received a contract extension after leading the team to the
National Basketball Association Finals last season.  “We have one of the great young coaches in the league,”
Heat President Pat Riley said at a news conference while
confirming that Spoelstra had received the extension.  Spoelstra was entering the final year of his contract and
Riley didn’t give any details regarding the new deal, according
to the  Associated Press .  The 41-year-old Spoelstra has a 148-98 record since being
named Heat coach prior to the 2008-09 season. Last season, he
was responsible for managing a roster that included former
league Most Valuable Players LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as
well as All-Star Chris Bosh.  The team struggled early, posting a 9-8 record before
reeling off 12 straight wins. The Heat finished second in the
Eastern Conference behind the Chicago Bulls with a 58-24 record.
In the playoffs, Miami topped the  Philadelphia 76ers ,  Boston
Celtics  and Bulls before falling in six games to the  Dallas
Mavericks  in the Finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
