Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
fourth day against the dollar, the longest winning streak in
three weeks, as dollar inflows increased while businesses
preparing for the year-end reduced demand.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 2.2 percent to 83.10 per dollar and was trading 1.9
percent stronger at 83.35 at 12:03 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at
this level will be the highest since May 2.  “There is an increase in dollar inflow from non-
governmental organizations, diaspora remittances and proceeds
from tea sales at a time of low demand from the businesses as
the year comes to an end, leading to the  strengthening of the
shilling,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Kenya’s central bank increased the  cash reserve ratio , the
percentage of total deposits commercial banks are prohibited
from lending, by 50 basis points to 5.25 percent as of
yesterday. The bank will stay out of  repurchase agreements 
today, Donald Murgor, a dealer at the Nairobi-based bank, said
in an interview.  The bank has mopped up 6.25 billion shillings ($74.8
million) from the market through repurchase agreements in the
last three days. In a repo, the regulator sells securities in a
bid to withdraw  money supply  from the system.  Uganda ’s currency remained unchanged at 2,385 per dollar
while the Tanzanian shilling gained for a third day this week,
rising 0.4 percent to 1,603 per dollar.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
