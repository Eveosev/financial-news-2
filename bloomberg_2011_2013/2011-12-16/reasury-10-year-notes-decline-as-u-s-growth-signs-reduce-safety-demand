Treasury 10-year notes declined for
a second day as signs the  U.S. economy  is gathering momentum
eased concern that the European debt crisis is weighing on
American growth.  Longer-maturity  bonds  led losses before a government report
that economists said will show consumer prices increased in
November. Manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions
improved this month, according to reports released yesterday.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley
said he doesn’t foresee the U.S. central bank taking additional
steps to curb the impact of  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “It’s a bit of risk very lightly creeping back on, and
that’s just taking some of the wind out of Treasuries’ sails,”
said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets in  London . “Demand is there across all the
markets so that should keep the front end of the Treasury curve
relatively underpinned and 10-years will probably take most of
the strain if we do see some decent data.”  The  10-year yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.93 percent at 11:12 a.m. London time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note due November
2021 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 21/32.
The 30-year yield increased one basis point to 2.93 percent.  Stocks Gain  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.2 percent, and
futures on the Standard and Poor’s 500 index expiring in March
gained 0.6 percent.  U.S. consumer prices climbed 0.1 percent in November from a
month earlier, and gained 3.5 percent versus a year earlier,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before today’s data. Prices
fell 0.1 percent in October.  U.S. reports yesterday showed applications for jobless
benefits fell to the lowest level since May 2008, and
manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions improved
in December.  “U.S. economic indicators are resilient,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, a strategist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd. in  Tokyo , a
unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “Should an easing of
European tensions spur risk-on sentiment in markets and U.S.
economic data show significant improvement, there’s a decent
chance 10-year yields will touch 2.4 percent.”  The 10-year yield will climb to 2.17 percent by March 31,
according to the Bloomberg average forecast from banks and
securities companies with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.  Inflation Debt  Inflation-linked debt has returned 14 percent to investors
this year, set for the biggest annual gain since 2002, according
to an index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. U.S.
government debt has handed investors 9.6 percent in the same
period, including reinvested interest, the index shows.  Treasuries still headed for the biggest weekly advance in a
month on concern European countries are struggling to contain
the region’s debt crisis, boosting demand for  U.S. government
debt  as a haven.  “The U.S. has attractions as a haven, so Treasury yields
will continue to be weighed down,” RBS’s Shigemi said. “Market
participants are focused on headlines about developments in
Europe.”  Benchmark 10-year yields fell 15 basis points this week,
the biggest decline since the period ended Nov. 4.  Debt Sales  The government is scheduled to sell $35 billion of two-year
notes on Dec. 19, the same amount of five-year securities the
next day and $29 billion of seven-year debt on Dec. 21.  The two-year notes on offer next week yielded 0.23 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.28 percent at the  prior
sale  in November. Investors bid for 4.07 times the amount for
sale last month, more than the average of 3.38 for the past 10
auctions.  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of shorter maturities in
its holdings of Treasuries with longer-term debt to cap
borrowing costs in a plan it announced in September. The central
bank is today scheduled to buy as much as $2.75 billion of debt
due from 2036 to 2041, and up to $5 billion of notes maturing
between 2020 and 2021 as part of the program, according to the
New York Fed’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
