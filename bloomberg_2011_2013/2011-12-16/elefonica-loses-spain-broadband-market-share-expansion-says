Telefonica SA (TEF)  now controls less than
50 percent of the Spanish broadband market after losing three
points in market share in the past year,  Expansion  reported,
citing data from the countryâ€™s telecommunications regulator.  The company is also at risk of falling below a 40 percent
market share in mobile services after losing 71,000 clients in
October and 78,000 in September, despite applying discounts, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
