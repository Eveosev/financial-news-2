United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, said the euro currency crisis may
cause a “cyclical panic” in commodity markets, prompting a
decline in metal demand from smaller manufacturers.  A concern for the industry is “how quickly the euro goes
down and what’s the transition mechanism in  China ,” Rusal Chief
Executive Officer Oleg Deripaska said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. Smaller customers may be affected more than larger
companies and may reduce orders next year, he said.  Commodity prices have dropped on mounting concern that
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis will cripple the global economy
and curb metals demand. Signs of increased funding stress in the
region have helped drive the dollar to the highest since January
against the euro, which has fallen by about 13 percent against
the U.S. currency since the debt crisis began two years ago.  Prices for aluminum, used in beverage cans, cars and
airplanes, have fallen 29 percent from this year’s May 3 high of
$2,797 a metric ton.  Declining prices help create a “healthy environment” to
close the gap between oversupply and demand, Deripaska said. Low
prices may force as much as 3 million metric tons of aluminum
capacity to be closed or mothballed, restoring the balance, he
said. “People like commodities with the shortage trends.”  Prices won’t fall to the $1,300 a ton seen after the global
financial crisis in 2009, according to Deripaska. “That’s
impossible,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
