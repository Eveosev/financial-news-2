Carrier IQ Inc. failed to adequately
answer questions regarding the data that the company’s software
captures from mobile phone users and shares with wireless
providers, two U.S. senators said.  Al Franken , a Minnesota Democrat, said he was “still very
troubled by what’s going on” after reviewing information
submitted this week by the  Mountain View , California-based
company and by mobile carriers including  AT&T Inc. (T)  and Sprint
Nextel Corp.  “It appears that Carrier IQ has been receiving the
contents of a number of  text messages  -- even though they had
told the public that they did not,” Franken, who chairs a
Senate subcommittee on privacy, said in a statement yesterday.
“I’m also bothered by the software’s ability to capture the
contents of our online searches -- even when users wish to
encrypt them. So there are still many questions to be answered
here and things that need to be fixed.”  Carrier IQ is at the center of a growing controversy over
how mobile-phone user data is collected and the extent to which
users’ privacy may be jeopardized. European privacy regulators
started investigating the company’s software after a security
researcher posted a 17-minute  YouTube video  Nov. 28 detailing
data logs collected by Carrier IQ and showing keys pressed and
features activated by a phone user.  “We appreciate subcommittee chairman Franken’s continued
interest in protecting consumer privacy and look forward to our
ongoing dialogue with the Senator to answer his additional
questions,”  Andrew Coward , Carrier IQ’s vice president of
marketing, said in a statement late yesterday.  Letters Released  Aides from the office of Senator Christopher Coons, a
Democrat from  Delaware , met with company executives this week,
Ian Koski, a spokesman for Coons, said in an interview.  “Carrier IQ has been very responsive to our questions,”
Koski said. “But we do have other questions. We hope and expect
that this meeting is the first of several constructive
conversations to get answers to the questions the senator has
and the public deserves to know.”  Franken’s office released letters yesterday from Carrier
IQ, AT&T, Sprint,  HTC Corp. (2498)  and Samsung Telecommunications
America sent in response to the senator’s questions. All the
letters were dated Dec. 14.  Carrier IQ said that it had found a bug in its software
that allowed some text messages to be collected. The messages
were “not human readable,” the company said in  its letter . The
company also said it doesn’t gather or transmit the contents of
e-mails, keystrokes or any details from mobile phone users’
address books. The software does allow the collection of URLs,
which could include online search histories, Carrier IQ said.  ‘Transparent’ Notice  AT&T, the nation’s largest second-largest wireless
operator, said Carrier IQ software is integrated and active on
11 of its consumer mobile devices. That represents 1 percent of
the handsets on AT&T’s wireless network, or about 900,000
devices, with 575,000 of them collecting and reporting service
performance information, the Dallas-based company said in  its
letter  to Franken.  “We know well that personal data and privacy are of
paramount concern to our customers,” Tim McKone, AT&T’s senior
vice president federal relations. “We strive to provide
transparent, easy-to-understand notice to our customers
concerning the information we collect and how we use it.”  Sprint (S) , the third-largest U.S. wireless provider, said
Carrier IQ software is installed on about 26 million of the
company’s devices and that the application doesn’t gather data
unless directed by Sprint, according to the  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based company’s  letter  to Franken.  Network Performance  AT&T and Sprint said they use data gathered by Carrier IQ
software to monitor network performance, including dropped calls
and Internet service outages. The carriers said they receive
customer location data and don’t collect the contents of e-mails
or text messages, keystroke data, the contents of user’s search
queries, or the names and contact information from user’s
address books.  AT&T said it doesn’t collect the URLs of websites that
customers visit, while Sprint said that it does. The companies
said they believe customers are informed about the data
collection through licensing agreements.  Samsung Telecommunications America, based in Richardson,
 Texas , listed 35 devices that have Carrier IQ software installed
and said it has sold 25 million phones to wireless providers
that had the application pre-installed, according to  its letter .
The company, a unit of Suwon, South Korea-based  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) , said it doesn’t receive any data from Carrier
IQ’s software.  HTC, a Taoyuan, Taiwan-based handset maker that was the
biggest seller of smartphones in the U.S. in the third quarter,
said about 6.3 million of its devices carry the software. The
company doesn’t receive any Carrier IQ data, according to HTC’s
letter to Franken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
