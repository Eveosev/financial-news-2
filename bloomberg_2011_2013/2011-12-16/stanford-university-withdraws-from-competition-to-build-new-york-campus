Stanford University  withdrew its
bid to the city of New York to build an applied sciences and
engineering campus on Roosevelt island.  After several weeks of talks with the city, university
leaders and the Stanford board of trustees decided it wouldn’t
be in the best interests of the university to contiue to pursue
the venture, the university said in a statement today.  The university couldn’t be certain it could proceed in a
way that would ensure success of the campus and decided to
withdraw, so the city could move forward with its selection
process, Stanford President  John Hennessy .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
