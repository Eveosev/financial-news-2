BP Plc , the U.K.’s biggest oil
company, bought aviation-fuel assets in Brazil from  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio (CSAN3)  for $100 million.  The deal includes  storage tanks , vehicles and pipelines for
plane refueling at seven airports in the South American country,
BP said today in a statement. Upon completion, expected in the
first quarter, Air BP will be present at 18 Brazilian airports
and account for about 66 percent of aviation-fuel demand there.  “Demand growth for aviation fuel in Brazil is well above
the average global rates at around 16 percent,” Ricardo
Paganini, Air BP’s manager for Brazil, said in the statement.
“The purchase of these new assets will allow Air BP to
accelerate its ambitious plans to grow its share of supply.”  Brazil ’s antitrust regulator ordered the sale after Shell
and Cosan combined some assets in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
