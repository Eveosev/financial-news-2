Nigerian banks rose for a fifth day,
the longest winning streak for four months, as investors took
positions for “attractive” gains, with the lenders’ financial
years ending on Dec. 31, PAC Securities Ltd. said.  The  Bloomberg Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks the performance
of the 10 most capitalized banks, added 2.2 percent, the most
since Oct. 19, to 263.39 by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos.  First
Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the country’s third-biggest lender by
market value, gained the maximum daily limit of 5 percent, its
highest daily rise since Feb. 8, to 8.40 naira, while  Stanbic
IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , gained a
fifth day, rising 5 percent to 8.02 naira. Access Bank Plc,
which acquired  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , one of the eight
lenders bailed out by the central bank two years ago, climbed 5
percent to 4.65 naira.  “We expect attractive dividends from some of them, given
the results they posted in the third quarter,” Eugene Ezenwa,
chief operating officer of PAC Securities Ltd., said by phone
from Lagos today. “Their prices are low now not because they
are not doing well, but because of high  interest rates  that have
shifted attention from equities.”  The Central Bank of  Nigeria  changed to a December common
year-end for all the country’s lenders as part of reforms to the
industry after a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 threatened the
banking system of Africa’s most populous nation. The central
bank fired eight chief executives of the country’s 24 lenders
and set up the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria to buy bad
debts to stabilize the industry.  First Bank posted a 32 percent jump in profit for the third
quarter through Sept., it said on Oct. 13., with net income
rising to 42.9 billion naira ($265 million). Stanbic reported a
10 percent rise in profit to 7.9 billion naira for the nine
months through September, the Lagos-based lender said on Oct.
28.  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  reported a 34 percent rise in profit for the
nine months through December to 12.81 billion naira.  The banking index has lost 34 percent this year compared
with a 19 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-
Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
