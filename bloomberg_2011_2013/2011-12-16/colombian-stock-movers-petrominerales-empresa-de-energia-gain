The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:40 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  rose 0.7 percent to 12,404.00, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.5 percent to 1,548.96.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, climbed 2.2 percent to
1,145 pesos. Investors are betting the plan of Bogota Mayor-
elect Gustavo Petro to merge the company with other city-run
public utilities may not be viable, said Omar Escorcia, an
analyst at Asesores en Valores SA.  Petro’s plan to reduce utility costs for Bogota residents
by merging EEB, as the company is known, with other companies
will be complicated by the fact that Emgesa and Coensa, EEB-
controlled electricity generation and distribution companies,
also have other shareholders, he said.  Petrominerales Ltd.  (PMGC CB), a Calgary-based company that
explores for and produces oil in  Colombia , rose 2.6 percent to
30,300 pesos. The company will pay fourth-quarter dividends on
Jan. 13 to shareholders registered as of Dec. 31. The dividend
will be C$0.125 per share, according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
