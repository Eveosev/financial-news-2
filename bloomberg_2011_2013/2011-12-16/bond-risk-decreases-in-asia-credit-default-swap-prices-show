The cost of insuring Asia corporate
and sovereign bonds against non-payment decreased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 4 basis points to 212 basis points
as of 8:02 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since Dec.
15, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index slid 2 basis points to 189 as
of 9:01 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The index
is headed for its lowest close since Dec. 13, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 196
basis points as of 11:01 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
