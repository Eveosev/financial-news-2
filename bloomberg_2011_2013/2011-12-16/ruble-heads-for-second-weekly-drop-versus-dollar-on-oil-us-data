The ruble fell for a second week
against the dollar, as oil,  Russia ’s chief export, traded near
its lowest level in six weeks.  The Russian currency weakened 0.7 percent to 32.0125 at the
7 p.m. close in Moscow, a 1.7 percent weekly drop. The ruble
fell 0.7 percent to 41.7050 versus the euro, leaving it 0.7
percent down at 36.3741 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Oil futures dropped as much as 0.5 percent to $93.39 a
barrel in  New York  after falling 1.1 percent yesterday to their
lowest close since Nov. 2. U.S. industrial production shrank for
the first time since April and European factory output
contracted, damping bets crude demand will rise.  Investors increased wagers the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
32.4242 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 32.2590 per dollar yesterday.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 rose,
lowering the yield eight basis points to 4.674 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
