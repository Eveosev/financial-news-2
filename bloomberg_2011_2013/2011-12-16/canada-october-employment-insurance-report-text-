Insurance (EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations,
including people becoming beneficiaries, people going back
to work, and people exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data
sources provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and
Skills Development Canada. These statistics may, from time
to time, be affected by changes to the Employment
Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The number of
regular beneficiaries and the number of claims received
for September and October are preliminary. In this
release, large centres correspond to those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from October 9 to 15. This period
coincides with the reference week of the Labour Force
Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.
