European Union leaders who agreed to
tighten fiscal rules amid the debt crisis last week may water
down the plan over fears the U.K. could oppose the step in
court, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, without citing
anyone.  In amending the rules, the states that signed up for the
plan may no longer insist on binding commitments to tighter
fiscal rules and instead substitute voluntary agreements on some
points, the newspaper reported. EU officials will meet on Dec.
20 in Brussels to resume work on the measures, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
