Polyus Gold International Ltd., 
 Russia ’s largest gold producer, plans to cancel its Russian
unit’s American Depositary Share program after completing a
mandatory buyback offer for the company’s shares.  OAO Polyus Gold will apply to the U.K. Listing Authority
and the London Stock Exchange to cancel the listing and
admission for trading of the ADS, it said in a statement today.
The termination may be effective from Jan. 20, it said.  Polyus Gold International owns 92.95 percent of the Russian
unit after completing a mandatory offer to buy back shares from
minorities in November, it said. Together with ADS controlled by
its Jenington International unit, the Jersey-registered company
holds 95.31 percent of OAO Polyus Gold, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
