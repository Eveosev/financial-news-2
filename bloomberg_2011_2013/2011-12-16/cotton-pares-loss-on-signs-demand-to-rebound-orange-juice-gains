Cotton futures pared losses on the
dollar’s decline and prospects for a rebound in fiber demand
after prices approached a 15-month low.  Orange juice  advanced.  The  dollar  dropped as much as 0.5 percent against a six-
currency basket, boosting demand for commodities as alternative
assets, after U.S. economic data this week suggested the
recovery is gaining traction. Buying from mills and other
commercial cotton users increased after the fiber touched 84.35
cents a pound on Dec. 14, the lowest since Aug. 24, 2010, said
Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging.  “This market has gotten pretty cheap, and I think we’re
getting a little better demand at these prices from the end-
users,” Smith said in a telephone interview from  St. Paul ,
 Minnesota .  Cotton futures for March delivery settled unchanged at
86.29 cents at 2:39 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
capping a 4.6 percent decline for the week. Earlier, the price
dropped as much as 0.8 percent after gaining as much as 2.3
percent this morning. The fiber has plunged 40 percent this
year.  “The upside is extremely limited” for prices, Smith said.
“The dismal outlook for  Europe  is going to continue to weigh on
cotton.”  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 0.4 percent
to $1.6705 a pound on ICE. The commodity lost 1.7 percent this
week. It has advanced 2.1 percent this year, heading for a third
straight annual gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
