Delta Petroleum Corp. (DPTR) , an oil and
natural-gas explorer and developer whose largest shareholder is
 Kirk Kerkorian , sought  bankruptcy protection  after failing to
find a buyer. Its shares plunged as much as 45 percent.  The Denver-based company listed $375.5 million in assets
and $310.7 million in debt in Chapter 11 papers filed yesterday
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Delta executives and advisers “unanimously determined that
the Chapter 11 process would provide the opportunity for the
best result for our creditors, shareholders, suppliers,
employees and customers,” Chief Executive Officer Carl E. Lakey
said today in a statement.  Delta predominately operates out of the Piceance Basin in
the Rocky Mountain region of  Colorado . Kerkorian, the
billionaire founder of  MGM Resorts International (MGM) , owns a
33 percent stake in Delta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Delta fell 33 percent to 22 cents at 12:51 New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock, which had lost about
96 percent of its value this year before today, dropped as low
as 18 cents.  Delta will seek court approval to borrow as much as
$57.5 million to help fund operations while in bankruptcy,
according to the statement. Delta said it will have enough cash
to pay court costs and maintain business operations in the
short-term.  Restructuring Officer  The company said Nov. 9 it would probably have to
restructure its debt after it wasn’t able to find a buyer
willing to pay more than it owed or obtain alternative
financing, according to a statement. Delta hired John T. Young
of Conway MacKenzie Inc. as chief restructuring officer last
month to explore its options.  Delta lost money in seven of the last eight quarters,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The net loss was
$429.4 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30.  Delta owes its 30 largest unsecured creditors about
$275.4 million, according to court papers. U.S. Bank NA is the

noteholders with debt totaling $267.7 million.  The company owes $152.2 million on 7 percent notes due in
2015 and $115.5 million on 3.75 percent notes due in 2037,
according to court documents. The 7 percent notes traded at 90.4
cents on the dollar as of yesterday, and the 3.75 percent notes
traded at 70 cents on the dollar as of Dec. 14, according to
