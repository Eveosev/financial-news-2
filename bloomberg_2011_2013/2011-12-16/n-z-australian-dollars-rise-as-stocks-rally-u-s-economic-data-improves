The  New Zealand  dollar advanced for
a second day as Asian equities extended a global rally,
supporting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Australian and New Zealand dollars rebounded from two-
week lows yesterday after reports added to signs the U.S.
economy is gaining momentum even as  Europe  struggles to contain
its debt crisis. Gains in the so-called Aussie were limited
before the  Reserve Bank  of Australia releases minutes next week
of its Dec. 6 meeting when the central bank implemented a
second-straight interest-rate cut.  “The market has already factored in a fairly negative
outcome from Europe and there’s some scope for sentiment to
improve,” said Greg Gibbs, a foreign-exchange strategist in
Sydney at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.5 percent to 75.67 U.S. cents
at 11:29 a.m. in Sydney from 75.34 at the close in  New York 
yesterday. It dropped as low as 74.62 yesterday, its weakest
level since Nov. 28. It climbed 0.5 percent to 58.93 yen.  The Australian dollar advanced to 99.48 U.S. cents from
99.22 yesterday, when it tumbled as low as 98.62, also the least
since Nov. 28. It rose 0.2 percent to 77.43 yen.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index of shares advanced 0.4 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks gained yesterday
for the first time this week.  The number of U.S. applications for unemployment payments
dropped by 19,000 to 366,000 in the week ended Dec. 10, less
than the lowest forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and the least since May 2008, according to Labor Department
figures issued yesterday in Washington. Other reports showed
manufacturing accelerated this month after pausing in November.  “The  U.S. economy  has certainly been pretty stable for
several months,” said RBS’s Gibbs. Recent demand for  U.S.
dollar  may have been “excessive,” he said.  The RBA is scheduled to release on Dec. 20 the minutes of
its most recent policy meeting. The board cut the central bank’s
overnight cash rate target to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent at
its Dec. 6 gathering, its second reduction in two months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
