The U.K.’s main opposition  Labour
Party  won a special election in west London for a vacant House
of Commons seat, with an increased majority over Prime Minister
 David Cameron ’s Conservative Party.  Labour candidate Seema Malhotra received 12,639 votes, a
majority of 6,203 over Conservative candidate  Mark Bowen , who
gained 6,436 votes in yesterday’s election in the Feltham and
Heston constituency, close to Heathrow Airport, according to
results early this morning. Malhotra gained 54 percent of the
vote, the BBC reported.  Labour’s Alan Keen, whose death last month led to the
ballot, received 43.6 percent of the vote in the May 2010
general election, giving him a majority of 4,658. The Tories
have moved ahead of Labour in some national polls this week
after Cameron refused to back a European Union-wide treaty to
rescue the euro on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
