Royal Dutch Shell Plc  won
conditional U.S. approval for a plan to drill as many as six
exploration wells in  Alaska ’s  Chukchi Sea  next year, the  Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management  said.  Final approval requires Shell to meet safety and
environmental-protection measures, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Interior Department bureau. Shell will
have to stop drilling 38 days before ice appears in the Arctic,
to avoid an end-of-the season spill when cleanup is difficult,
the agency said. The U.S. projects ice will form by Nov. 1.  “We will continue to work closely with agencies across the
federal government to ensure that Shell complies with the
conditions we have imposed on its exploration plan,” Tommy Beaudreau, bureau director, said in the statement.  Shell, which has invested about $4 billion in the Arctic
leases since 2005, hasn’t drilled any wells in the region while
opponents won delays with appeals and lawsuits. Environmental
organizations and Alaskan native groups have said it would take
too long for equipment to reach the remote and icy region during
an  oil spill .  Shell acquired its leases to the Chukchi Sea in 2008.  The Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement must approve Shell’s oil-spill
response plan before drilling can start, according to the
statement.  The company needs permits from the Environmental Protection
Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National
Marine Fisheries Service, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
