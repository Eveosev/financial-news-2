After World War II, U.S. workers got
a decent piece of the economic pie, and saw their children do
even better. But in the 1970s, notes David Graeber, author of
“Debt: The First 5,000 Years,” it became clear that capitalism
couldn’t provide that level of affluence to everyone.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  For Cullen Murphy, author of “Are We Rome? The Fall of an
Empire and the Fate of America,” democracy in the U.S. is under
fire from a system in which, increasingly, “fewer have more.”  I spoke with both of them during a symposium at Bloomberg
world headquarters in  New York City  on the following topics:  1. Private vs. Public Power  2. Moral Assumptions About Debt  3. Fewer Have More  4. Soft Power of Money  5. Evolution of Democracy  To buy these books in  North America , click  here  for
