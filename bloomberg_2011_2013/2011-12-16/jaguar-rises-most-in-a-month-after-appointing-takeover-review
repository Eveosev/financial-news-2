Jaguar Mining Inc. (JAG) , target of a
proposed takeover by  China ’s Shangdong Gold Group Co., jumped
the most in a month after Jaguar said it would review any
further bids.  Jaguar, which operates mines in Brazil, rose 8.4 percent to
$6.08 at 11:27 a.m. in New York. The shares earlier rose as much
as 10.3 percent, the most since Nov. 16.  The company appointed a committee of independent directors
to evaluate offers and determine whether a sale would be more
desirable than continuing to operate the company, Concord, New
Hampshire-based Jaguar said in a statement yesterday.  Shandong Gold, parent of China’s second-largest gold
producer by market value, made a $785 million offer to buy
Jaguar, two people familiar with the deal said Nov. 16. Jaguar
said the same day it had received “proposals” in recent weeks
and that it had begun a strategic review to explore its options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
