Fitch Ratings  said it may cut the
ratings of nations from  Italy  to Spain and  Belgium  as  Europe ’s
debt crisis defies the “comprehensive solution” pledged by the
region’s leaders.  All investment-grade countries in the euro region rated
below AAA are subject to a “Rating Watch Negative” review,
which Fitch expects to complete by the end of January, according
to a statement released today in London.  “The concerns held by Fitch prior to the summit remain
pressing and have not been materially eased” after this month’s
meeting of leaders, Fitch’s statement said. “Of particular
concern is the absence of a credible financial backstop. In
Fitch’s opinion this requires more active and explicit
commitment from the ECB.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
