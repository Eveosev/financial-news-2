Delivery delays with  Raytheon Co. (RTN) ’s
most advanced air-to-air missile for the U.S.  Air Force  and Navy
prompted House and Senate budget negotiators to cut $190 million
from the program.  The House and Senate are scheduled to vote on the
legislation starting today, a $518 billion spending program for
the Pentagon that’s contained in a catchall spending bill.
Lawmakers cited continued contract delays as they cut about 38
percent from an original $498 million to buy additional
missiles.  Raytheon’s Tucson, Arizona-based  Missile Systems  unit, as
of May 31, was 136 missiles behind schedule, delivering 225 of
361 due by that date, according to the most recent data
available from the Air Force. The backlog grew from 87 in
December 2010, increasing each month to 129 in April to 136,
according to service figures.  The missiles are the newest  version  of the Advanced Medium-
Range Air-to-Air Missile. These are operational missiles
intended for deployment to Air Force fighter wings and Navy
aircraft carriers once testing is done and it’s declared combat-
ready in fiscal 2013.  Raytheon spokesman  John Patterson  referred all comment to
the Air Force. Air Force spokeswoman Jennifer Cassidy didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking updated contract
information.  The Raytheon missile has been bought by more than 33
allies, including Jordan, Morocco and  Kuwait .  To contact the reporter on this story:
