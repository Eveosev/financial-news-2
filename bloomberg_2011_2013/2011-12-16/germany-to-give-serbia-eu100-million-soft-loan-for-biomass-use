Germany  will lend  Serbia  100 million
euros ($130.3 million) and add a 10 million-euro grant to help
the country’s efforts to expand the use of biomass, a
representative of Germany’s development bank said.  Pending a final agreement between the governments, the loan
will probably have a 15 year maturity, a grace period of 3 to 5
years and 2.5 percent to 3 percent interest, said Juergen
Welschof, who represents Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau in
Serbia. He spoke after German ambassador Wolfram Maas signed a
memorandum of understanding on the planned loan with Serbian
officials in the country’s capital Belgrade today.  Serbia’a biomass potential, estimated at 2.7 million tons
of oil equivalent, is “vastly underused” and the country needs
to tap it to cut reliance on oil and gas imports that currently
account for 45 percent of all energy consumed, Environment
Minister Oliver Dulic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
