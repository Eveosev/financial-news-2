The New York Police Department
arrested 141 people for allegedly selling stolen  iPhones and
iPads , stepping up an effort to combat robberies of handheld
electronic devices.  Officers made the arrests at  convenience stores ,
newsstands, barber shops and other businesses, the department
said in a statement yesterday. The suspects were charged with
criminal possession of stolen property after being apprehended
for allegedly purchasing the gadgets from undercover police.  “This was a two-prong approach to apprehend both thieves
and receivers of stolen property,” Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in the statement. “Suspects at both ends of the
equation are learning the hard way that ‘victims’ and ‘sellers’
may in fact be undercover police officers.”  The arrests are an attempt to cope with a rash of robberies
of the iPhone and iPad,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s best-selling products. The
department also is working to capture thieves stealing the
products from inattentive subway riders, according to the
statement.  Robberies involving handheld electronic devices have caused
a slight increase in grand larcenies in  New York City , the
police department said. The iPhone and iPad arrests were made
this week, the department said. Prices for the merchandise
ranged from $50 to $200.  Of the 141 arrests, 42 were in Brooklyn, 41 in  Manhattan ,
31 in the Bronx, 21 in Queens and six on Staten Island, the
police department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
