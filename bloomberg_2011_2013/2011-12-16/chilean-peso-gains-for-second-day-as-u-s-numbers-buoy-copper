Chile ’s peso strengthened for a
second day, trimming a weekly decline, as copper rose on signs
the world’s biggest economy is healthier than expected.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 517.45 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:35 a.m. in Santiago from 518.5 yesterday, reducing a drop
this week to 1.5 percent. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American
Currency Index  rose  0.6 percent today.  Copper, which accounts for more than half of Chile’s
exports, rose as much as 3.4 percent in  New York . U.S. stock
futures rose after initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a
tree-year low yesterday and Federal Reserve measures of
manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions beat
estimates.  “Markets are positive basically because of yesterday’s
data and the employment numbers especially,” said Ronald Volpi,
head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa
SA. “Commodities are up, and that means the dollar is down.
There is still dollar buying though.”  The peso may trade between 151 and 518 today, Volpi said.  Offshore investors increased their net short position in
the Chilean peso in the local forwards market to $5.2 billion on
Dec. 14 from $5 billion a day earlier, according to central bank
