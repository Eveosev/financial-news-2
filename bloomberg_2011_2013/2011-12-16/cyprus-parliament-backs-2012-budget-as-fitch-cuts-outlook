Cyprus’s parliament approved the
2012 budget today, slashing as much as 110 million euros ($143
million) in spending and earmarking a further 100 million euros
in cuts for future consideration.  The parliament also passed “a complete freeze” on hiring
in the public sector, reductions of overtime pay to civil
servants and the abolishment of interest-free loans to civil
servants, Nicholas Papadopoulos, who chairs the finance
committee, told reporters in Nicosia.  The spending reductions, which come on top of a fiscal
consolidation package approved two days ago worth 855 million
euros over three years, “may hopefully reduce next year’s
budget deficit” to below 2 percent of gross domestic product
from a forecast 2.5 percent, Papadopoulos said.  Cyprus, the euro area’s third-smallest economy, has been
shut out of the markets since May and was rocked by a July 11
explosion that knocked out half of its electricity production
capacity.  Fitch Ratings  placed Cyprus’s BBB sovereign credit
grade on negative outlook today along with five other countries,
citing doubts that a comprehensive solution to the debt crisis
was achieved by European leaders at a Dec. 9 summit.  With “strong political consensus” on a medium-term fiscal
consolidation program, “the government will follow strict
budgetary rules in the future,” the country’s finance ministry
said in an e-mailed statement in response to Fitch’s decision.
In addition, Cyprus “has already covered in advance most of its
2012 financing needs. There are therefore no serious causes of
particular concern for Cyprus.”  Ratings Cut  Moody’s Investors Service lowered Cyprus’s credit rating
two levels on Nov. 4 to Baa3 by after  Standard & Poor’s  cut it
on Oct. 27 to BBB from BBB+. Both cited fiscal concerns and
Cypriot banks’ holdings of Greek debt.  The  ministry of finance  budgeted overall expenses at 7.5
billion euros for 2012, when the economy is forecast to grow 0.2
percent, compared to 8 billion euros for 2011, according to a
statement emailed on Dec. 8. Total revenue in 2012 is expected
to rise to 6.2 billion euros compared with 5.6 billion euros in
2011. Public debt is expected to rise to 66 percent of economic
output next year from 65 percent in 2011, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
