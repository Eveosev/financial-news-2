Airbus (EAD)  SAS predicted it will deliver
at least 30 of its A380 double-decker aircraft to customers next
year as it irons out production glitches that hobbled on the
world’s largest passenger jet for years.  The target compares with at least 25 A380s that Toulouse,
France-based Airbus aims to hand over to carriers in 2011,
according to a presentation by Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier posted on the company’s website today. Airbus has 238
firm orders for the jet, with 63 units delivered so far.  The A380 will break even in 2015 on an operating basis,
excluding research and development costs, Airbus said,
reiterating its target. The super-jumbo entered service years
late because of production glitches in areas such as wiring, and
production ramp-up was slower as airlines seized on the jet’s
size to customize interiors, adding lounges and showers.  Bregier is slated to become head of Airbus after current
Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  takes the helm at parent
company European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. next year. The
A380, flown by airlines including Emirates, Singapore Airline
sand  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , typically seats about 525 passengers
in a three-class configuration on two full-length flight decks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
