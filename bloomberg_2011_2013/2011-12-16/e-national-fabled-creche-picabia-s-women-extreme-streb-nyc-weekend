Brooklyn-based band The National
crafts compelling music about growing up. Hear their moody songs
Friday night at the Beacon Theatre.  Evocative lyrics get charged with the rich baritone of lead
man Matt Berninger, adding just the right dose of gravitas.  The two pairs of highly-talented brothers backing him up --
Dessners and Devendorfs -- don’t hurt either.  Beacon Theatre, Broadway at 74th St. Information: +1-212-
465-6500;  http://www.beacontheatre.com .  Saturday  A leggy blonde struggles with a blanket that reveals demure
closed eyes in Francis Picabia’s “Printemps” (1942-43), while
the man -- naked, tanned torso ablaze with light -- smiles into
the wind.  It’s part of the exhibit of the artist’s “Late Paintings”
at  Michael Werner . Often derided by critics as insincere kitsch,
Picabia’s work from the 1930s experimented with images from
Hollywood and girlie mags and influenced subsequent generations.  At Michael Werner, 4 E. 77th St., through Jan. 14.
Information: +1-212-988-1623;  http://www.michaelwerner.com .  Saturday Matinee  Elizabeth Streb’s fearless dancers work with ziplines,
trampolines, bungee cords and moving ladders to push the laws of
gravity.  For “Kiss the Air!” they’ve taken over the 55,000-square-
foot, 85-foot-high drill hall at the Park Avenue Armory.  Combining extreme sports with dance, Streb’s choreography
celebrates young, strong bodies and exuberant physicality.  Front and center seats are for those who don’t mind getting
wet.  Runs through Dec. 22 at 643 Park Avenue. Information: +1-
212-616-3930;  http://www.armoryonpark.org .  Saturday Late Afternoon  Pop in for a short and sweet “Nutcracker” suitable for
the barely sentient.  The small-scale New York Theatre Ballet has a new, hour-
long version choreographed by Keith Michael.  Soldiers ride rocking horses to battle mice, clockwork imps
jump around and a snowy owl flies over the audience.  Runs through Dec. 18 at Florence Gould Hall, 55 E. 59th St.
Information: +1-212-679-0401;  http://www.nytb.org .  Saturday Night  For a walk on the naughty side of Christmas, check out the
Gotham Burlesque’s holiday extravaganza, starring Miss Dirty
Martini.  A mix of comedy, magic and performance art -- and a little
old-fashioned hoochie coochie -- the show features Legs Malone,
Amber Ray and Tigger, among others, and is hosted by “World-
famous ‘Bob.’”  Triad Theatre, 158 W. 72nd St. Information: +1-212-362-
2590;  http://gothamburlesque.com .  Sunday  Audra McDonald is worth a visit to “Porgy and Bess” in
the new staging by Diane Paulus, who has been babbling
alarmingly about how the story didn’t make sense for her, and so
she had to improve it. She runs the American Repertory Theater
in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , where the production went through
some changes en route to Broadway.  In previews at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, 226 W. 46th
St., for a Jan. 12 opening. Information: +1-212-221-1211;
 http://richardrodgerstheatre.com .  Sunday Evening  Cherubs and silk-clad angels adorn the great spruce at the
 Metropolitan Museum .  Surrounding the tree’s base is the museum’s beloved
Neapolitan Baroque creche with hundreds of diminutive figures,
including shepherds and critters -- even an elephant -- who have
come to adore the newborn babe.  Colorful townspeople abound and the three Magi with their
exotic retinue are also on the way.  This evening at 8:30 p.m. hear the Voices of Ascension
Chorus sing nativity motets and Christmas carols in front of the
tree.  Post-concert, stay for a 3-course prix fixe dinner in the
Petrie Court Cafe.  At 1000 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-535-7710;
 http://www.metmuseum.org .  Looking Ahead: Monday  A high-singing orphan adopted by a bunch of soldiers is at
the heart of Donizetti’s charming “La Fille du Regiment.” Her
tenor suitor gets to sing nine high Cs. What fun!  Director Christian Rath brings a light touch to this
revival of the popular 2008 production by Laurent Pelly.  Nino Machaidze is Marie and Lawrence Brownlee struts around
happily as Tonio. An extra bonus: Dame Kiri Te Kanawa appears in
the speaking role of the Duchess of Krakenthorp.  In the pit, the splendid Yves Abel keeps things bubbling
along.  Runs through Jan. 6 at the  Metropolitan Opera ,  Lincoln
Center . Information: +1-212-362-6000;
