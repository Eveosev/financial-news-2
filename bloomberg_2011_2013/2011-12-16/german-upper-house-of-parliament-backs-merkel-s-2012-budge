Germany ’s upper house of parliament,
the  Bundesrat , today backed the 2012 budget of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s federal government, a Bundesrat press spokeswoman said.  The budget, which went through the lower house of
parliament on Nov. 25, foresees net new borrowing of 26.1
billion euros ($34 billion) to help finance spending of 306.2
billion euros.  While the Bundesrat, which represents Germany’s 16 states,
has the right to object to the Berlin-based government’s budget,
the Bundestag, Germany’s lower house, can overrule Bundesrat
opposition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
