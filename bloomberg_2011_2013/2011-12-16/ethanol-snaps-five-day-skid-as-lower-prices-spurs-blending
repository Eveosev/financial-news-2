Ethanol futures snapped the longest
losing streak since September as lower prices for the fuel
spurred blending demand.  The biofuel gained as ethanol’s 41.2-cent discount to
gasoline encouraged refiners to blend more of the additive to
take advantage of the spread between the two.  Production of
conventional gasoline blended with ethanol  averaged 5.15 million
barrels a day last week, according to the Energy Department, 3.6
percent higher than a year earlier.  “This latest break really took away producer margin, but
you’ve returned margin back to the blender,” said Jerrod Kitt,
an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “Yes, this has been an
ugly break but you are turning on some demand here.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery advanced 1.3 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.075 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the first gain since Dec. 8. Futures fell 1.9 percent
this week and are down 13 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  sank 3 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $2.28 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel declined 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.315, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  slipped 0.5 cent to $2.185 a gallon and
on the West Coast the additive decreased 0.5 cent to $2.295.  Corn for March delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$5.83 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
