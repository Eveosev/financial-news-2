Mexico ’s top phone regulator
approved contracts totaling $200,000 to businesses run by two
friends, one of whom lobbies on behalf of telecommunications
companies, Reuters  reported .  There is no evidence that Mony de Swaan, president of the
Federal Telecommunications Commission, benefited financially
from the contracts, which were for public relations and legal
work, Reuters said today. Mexican law says officials should
recuse themselves from decisions in which they have personal
interest, the  news agency  said.  De Swaan told Reuters he has done nothing wrong, the news
agency said. He didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail from
Bloomberg seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
