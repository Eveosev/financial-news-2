U.S. stocks (SPX)  fell, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to this month’s first weekly loss,
as European leaders struggled to solve the region’s debt crisis
and the  Federal Reserve  refrained from additional stimulus.  Equities rose the last two days of the week as data on
jobless claims and manufacturing offset concern  Europe ’s crisis
is escalating. Energy producers dropped 4.9 percent in the week,
the most among  10 groups (SPXL1)  in the S&P 500.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)  slumped at least 8.6 percent. Intel Corp. slid 7.1
percent, pacing declines among technology companies.  Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIM)  tumbled 18 percent after delaying the next
generation BlackBerry, which is designed to fuel a comeback.  The  S&P 500  fell 2.8 percent to 1,219.66, breaking a two-
week streak of gains. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  sank
317.87 points, or 2.6 percent, to 11,866.39 for the week.  “The market continues to be driven by headline stories
about Europe, although the economic news has been more positive
with respect to the U.S.,” John Carey, a Boston-based money
manager at Pioneer Investments, said in a telephone interview.
The firm oversees about $220 billion. “On alternate days,
people are either paying attention to those improving
fundamentals or worrying about what’s going on in Europe.”  Stocks slumped on Dec. 12 as Moody’s Investors Service said
a European Union summit failed to produce “decisive policy
measures” and  Fitch Ratings  said a comprehensive solution has
not yet been offered. The S&P 500 extended its decline the next
day following the Fed’s decision.  Jobless Claims  The S&P 500 rebounded from a three-day slump on Dec. 15
after Labor Department figures showed  initial jobless claims 
fell by 19,000 to 366,000 in the week ended Dec. 10, the fewest
since May 2008, and two reports showed manufacturing in the New
York and Philadelphia regions expanded more than forecast in
December.  The index has failed to maintain gains, falling 3 percent
since the end of 2010 after being up for the year on nine days
since Oct. 27. It fell within 1 percent of a bear market, or a
20 percent plunge, from its high on April 29 with its slump
through Oct. 3. The measure has rebounded 11 percent since then.  “I’m pretty cautious to be honest with you,” Adam Parker,
the New York-based U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance
Midday” with  Tom Keene . “The risk-reward is still skewed
toward the negative for the market over the medium-term.”  Energy producers posted the biggest declines for the week
as a group, falling 4.9 percent as oil posted the biggest weekly
loss since September.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. oil
producer, fell 3.3 percent to $100.86.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  retreated
7.9 percent to $39.83.  Brazilian Prosecutor  Chevron and Transocean should halt operations in Brazil and
pay 20 billion reais ($10.7 billion) in damages after an oil
spill last month, prosecutors urged a federal court.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , a coal company, slid 16
percent to $19.62.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth slipped 4.9 percent. So-called defensive
industries, which some investors consider safer during an
economic slowdown, posted the smallest losses in the S&P 500.
Utilities slumped 0.2 percent, telephone companies retreated 0.3
percent, health-care companies slipped 0.4 percent and consumer-
staples stocks dropped 0.5 percent.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, tumbled 9.1 percent to $87.20. Alcoa, the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, sank 8.6 percent to $8.81.  Supply Shortages  Intel tumbled 7.1 percent to $23.23 this week, pacing
declines with technology companies which had the second-biggest
decline as a group in the S&P 500. The world’s largest maker of
semiconductors cut its forecast for  fourth-quarter revenue (INTC) ,
saying supply shortages for hard drives are prompting computer
producers to cut orders for other components.  Research In Motion fell 18 percent to $13.44, the lowest
level in almost eight years, after saying a new generation of
BlackBerrys designed to fuel a comeback won’t be out until the
“latter part” of 2012.  Zynga Inc. fell 5 percent to $9.50 on its first day of
trading after raising $1 billion in an initial public offering.
The largest maker of games for Facebook Inc.’s website sold 100
million shares for $10 each, the top of a proposed range.  First Solar Inc., the world’s largest maker of thin-film
solar panels, had the biggest decline in the S&P 500, falling 30
percent to $31.91. The company reduced  profit estimates (FSLR)  for this
year and next and said it will cut about 100 jobs as it closes a
California research center.  Best Buy Co., the largest consumer-electronics retailer,
slumped 18 percent to $23.19. Its profit declined more than
analysts estimated, hurt by Black Friday discounts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
