Gulf Coast  gasoline rose for a fifth
straight session as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Delek US Holdings
Inc. (DK)  reported refinery problems in Texas and Louisiana.  Shell reported an “operations upset” at the Norco,
Louisiana, refinery when furnaces were swapped yesterday,
according to a filing with the National Response Center. Delek
had emissions at its Tyler, Texas, plant, according to a filing
with state regulators.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline’s discount on the  Gulf
Coast  narrowed 0.50 cent to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:41 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level since Nov. 9.
Prompt delivery rose 0.93 cents to $2.4545 a gallon.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  shut a hydrotreater at its Philadelphia
refinery for maintenance, according to a person familiar with
operations at the plant. The work on Unit 859, a distillate
hydrotreater, is unplanned, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the person is not authorized to speak for the
refinery.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor 
slipped 0.12 cent to 2.88 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:56 p.m.
The differential rose 1 cent a gallon yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
