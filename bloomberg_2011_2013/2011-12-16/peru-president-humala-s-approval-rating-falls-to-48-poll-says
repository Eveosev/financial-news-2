Peruvian President  Ollanta Humala ’s
approval rating dropped nine percentage points after he declared
a state of emergency to quell protests in the northern Andes and
removed 10 ministers from his cabinet, a poll showed.  Humala, who formed a new cabinet Dec. 11 to speed up the
resolution of anti-mining protests, had a 48 percent approval
rating in the poll by researcher Datum Internacional, compared
with 57 percent a month ago and 66 percent in October.  Datum questioned people from Dec. 12 to Dec. 13, according
to the website of Lima-based newspaper  Peru21 , which published
the poll. The newspaper didn’t say how many people the company
questioned or give the poll’s margin of error.  Of those questioned, 40 percent approved of the new
cabinet, according to Datum. A Datum survey conducted Dec. 8 to
Dec. 10 and also published by Peru21 today, showed 68 percent of
those questioned said Humala should make ministerial changes.  Humala lifted today the state of emergency, which affected
four provinces of the Cajamarca region, after local political
leaders suspended their protests against  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s
$4.8 billion gold mine expansion and agreed to talks with the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
