The Slovak unit of  United States
Steel Corp. (X)  will cut working hours from January as the euro-
region’s economic slowdown hurts orders,  Sme  reported, citing
Jan Baca, spokesman for the Slovak plant.  Workers will stay at home every Friday, receiving 60
percent of salary, the newspaper said. U.S. Steel’s plant in
Kosice, eastern Slovakia, has about 13,000 employees and its
output accounts for 0.5 percent of the east European country’s
gross domestic product, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
