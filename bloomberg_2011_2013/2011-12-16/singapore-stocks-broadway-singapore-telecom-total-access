member gauge today.  The following were among the most active shares in the

names.  Exporters: Singapore’s exports unexpectedly rose in
November as pharmaceutical sales outweighed weak demand for
electronics amid a faltering global recovery.  Broadway Industrial Group Ltd. (BWAY)  , a supplier of
packaging materials, climbed 3.5 percent to 30 Singapore cents.  Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (ST)  , Southeast Asia’s
biggest phone company, advanced 2.6 percent to S$3.18. The
telecom said it sold its entire 40 percent stake in Teletech
Park Pte to Ascendas Land (Singapore) Pte for S$15 million
($11.5 million). SingTel, as the company is known, said it will
book an exceptional gain of S$4 million from the sale.  Total Access Communication Pcl (DTAC)  , Thailand’s
second-biggest mobile phone carrier, jumped 11 percent to a
$2.84, closing at its highest level since at least 1995, after
