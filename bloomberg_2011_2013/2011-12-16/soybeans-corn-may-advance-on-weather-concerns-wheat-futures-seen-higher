What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as dry weather and forecasts for
warmer temperatures in Argentina and  Brazil  erode crop
prospects,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.1 cent to
0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to
$2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures were called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago as dry weather threatens yields in  South
America  and  South Africa , Schultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as the dollarâ€™s decline enhances the appeal of
U.S. exports and boosts investor demand, Schultz said.
