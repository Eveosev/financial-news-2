Marine Le Pen, leader of  France ’s
anti-euro National Front, is gaining support as backing for
President Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist candidate Francois Hollande stalls, an Ifop poll showed.  About 20 percent would back Le Pen if an election were held
now, up from 19 percent a month ago and 17 percent in October,
according to an Ifop poll for  Le Journal du Dimanche  published
today. Support for Sarkozy has dropped to 24 percent from 26
percent a month ago and backing for Hollande has declined to
27.5 percent from 32.5 percent, the poll showed.  The results suggest that both the leading candidates
suffered after Francois Bayrou and Dominique de Villepin
declared their intentions to seek the presidency. The 2012
election consists of two rounds, with the two leading candidates
from balloting in April 22 holding a face-off May 6.  Voting intentions for the second round were unchanged, with
Hollande holding at 56 percent support and Sarkozy 44 percent,
Ifop said.  Ifop interviewed 937 voters between Dec. 13 and 15. The
margin of error for the results on the three leading candidates
is between 2 and 3 percentage points, it said.  A separate Ipsos poll for Le Monde daily showed Hollande
would win the first round with 32 percent, down 3 percentage
points from a month earlier. Sarkozy would gather 25.5 percent,
up 1.5 points and Le Pen would get 17 percent, down 2 points.
The pollster called 5,415 registered voters between Nov. 30 and
Dec. 5 and didn’t publish margins of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
