Soybeans gained for a second day on
concern that dry weather in parts of  South America  may hurt
crops, curbing global supply.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $11.265
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:13 p.m. Singapore
time. Futures have gained 1.8 percent this week and are set for
a 20 percent decline this year.  Argentina’s soybean, corn and wheat growing areas will have
hot weather ahead of a cold front expected in the middle of next
week, Telvent DTN Inc. said yesterday. Soybean and corn areas in
the southern part of  Brazil  may turn hotter early next week and
parts of Rio Grande do Sul and southern Parana states have had
below normal rainfall so far this month, it said.  Soybeans “were supported by continued concerns about
patchy dryness in South America’s growing regions,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia , said in a report today.  Rio Grande do Sul, which produces about 14 percent of
Brazil’s soybeans and 10 percent of its corn, had six weeks of
dry weather, the Brazilian government said Dec. 12. Brazil is
set to be the world’s largest soybean shipper in the 2011-2012
season, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Wheat for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $5.8025 a
bushel, trimming the weekly loss to 2.6 percent. Futures earlier
fell to $5.7725 a bushel equaling the lowest price in more than
16 months reached yesterday. Futures are set for a 27 percent
slump this year.  Export Sales  Export  sales  of wheat from the U.S., the largest shipper,
fell 25 percent to 318,357 metric tons in the week ended Dec. 8
from a week earlier, the USDA said yesterday. The harvest in
 Argentina , South America’s largest exporter, will likely reach
13.6 million tons, more than the 13 million tons forecast a week
ago, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said yesterday.  “The U.S. wheat markets remain firmly entrenched in their
10-month downtrend,” Commonwealth Bank’s Mathews said, citing
the impact of higher Argentine supply on U.S. sales.  Canada ’s wheat production may total 25.3 million tons in
the year that began Aug. 1, higher than the 24.2 million tons
estimated last month and above last year’s output of 23.2
million tons, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  That matches the USDA  estimate  on Dec. 9 which ranks Canada
as the fourth-largest shipper this season. The agency predicted
that the global  output  will rise to a record, taking stockpiles
to a 12-year high of 208.5 million tons.  Corn for delivery in March gained 0.2 percent to $5.8025 a
bushel, set for a 2.4 percent loss this week. The commodity has
declined 8 percent this year, heading for the first annual loss
in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
