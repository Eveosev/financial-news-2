SNS Reaal NV (SR) , a Dutch lender and
insurer, plans to cut jobs at its securities unit, which is
ceasing proprietary trading as market conditions deteriorate.  “In light of the worsening conditions in the financial
world, we have decided to take action,” said Robert Hogenhuis,
managing director responsible for fixed income at Amsterdam-
based SNS Securities NV. The brokerage will shut part of its
equity trading business and cut 10 of 150 jobs, he said.  SNS Reaal, which is based in Utrecht, must bolster its
capital to satisfy European regulators as the sovereign-debt
crisis spreads to the region’s larger economies and roils
markets. The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  has dropped 15
percent this year, while the Dutch benchmark  AEX-Index (AEX)  has
retreated 17 percent.  The job cuts include one equity analyst and seven traders,
while two private bankers will leave via attrition, Hogenhuis
said. Other parts of the  business , including fixed income,
aren’t affected, he said.  SNS Reaal’s banking unit is the smallest of four Dutch
lenders that face additional  capital requirements  after being
designated as “systemically important” by the nation’s central
bank. The lender said last week that it must raise 159 million
euros ($207 million) to meet the mid-2012 European Banking
Authority requirement for its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength.  The lender has already raised about half that amount and
said last week that it had a core Tier 1 ratio of 9 percent at
the end of November, up from 8.6 percent at the end of
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
