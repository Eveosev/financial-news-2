Billionaire Ziyavudin Magomedov’s
 Summa Group  won the right to build a 44.3 billion ruble ($1.4
billion) section of a railroad to coal fields in East Siberia,
near deposits to be developed by  Evraz Plc  and  OAO Severstal .  OOO Stroynovatsiya, part of the Summa Group, was awarded a
contract by the Russian Railway Transportation Agency to build
147 kilometers (91 miles) of the Kuragino-Kyzyl line to Tyva
region, according to the State Purchases  disclosure website .  Another 255 kilometers will be funded by  Yenisey Industrial
Co. , co-owned by copper billionaire Igor Altushkin and Ruslan
Baisarov. Yenisey, which has the right to develop the Elegest
coal deposit in Tyva that holds about 855 million metric tons of
reserves, may spend as much 86 billion rubles on the line and
hasn’t yet picked a contractor, its press service said today.  Evraz and Severstal,  Russia ’s largest steelmakers, plan to
