U.S. Gulf oil premiums weakened as
the difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
narrowed.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
February delivery settled at $9.60 a barrel today. The January
Brent contract expired yesterday. The difference between the
January WTI and Brent contracts was $11.22 yesterday. The
differential has narrowed 66 percent since reaching a record of
$27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI narrowed 90 cents to
$10.50 a barrel at 3:45 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed
85 cents to $10.25 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI decreased $1.20 to $8.40.
The premium for Mars Blend lost 20 cents to $7 a barrel.
 Poseidon ’s premium narrowed 35 cents to $6.40 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium decreased 90 cents to $5.85
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount was unchanged at 85
cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$15.75 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $2.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
