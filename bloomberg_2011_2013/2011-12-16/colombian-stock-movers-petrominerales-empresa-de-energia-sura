The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  rose 2.2 percent to 12,590.31, while the
Colcap Index gained 1.9 percent to 1,571.89.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, climbed 2.2 percent to
1,145 pesos. Investors are betting the plan of Bogota Mayor-
elect Gustavo Petro to merge the company with other city-run
public utilities may not be viable, said Omar Escorcia, an
analyst at Asesores en Valores SA.  Petro’s plan to reduce utility costs for Bogota residents
by merging EEB, as the company is known, with other companies
will be complicated by the fact that Emgesa and Codensa, EEB-
controlled electricity generation and distribution companies,
also have other shareholders, he said.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , parent
company of  Colombia ’s biggest bank, rose 4.8 percent to 32,500
pesos, a six-week high. The company said  Chile ’s securities
regulator approved its acquisition of ING Groep NV’s assets.  The company said in a regulatory filing today that it
expects approvals from Uruguay’s authorities in “coming days.”  Petrominerales Ltd.  (PMGC CB), a Calgary-based company that
explores for and produces oil in Colombia, rose 3 percent to
30,420 pesos. The company will pay fourth-quarter dividends on
Jan. 13 to shareholders registered as of Dec. 31. The dividend
will be C$0.125 per share, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
