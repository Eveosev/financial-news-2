French business confidence fell for
a sixth month in December as  Europe ’s debt crisis discouraged
investment and threatened to tip the economy into recession.  A gauge of  sentiment among factory managers  fell to 94 from
a revised 96 in November, national statistics office Insee said
today in Paris. Economists forecast a reading of 93, according
to the median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  With Europe’s debt crisis showing little sign of abating
and  Standard & Poor’s  considering whether to strip  France  of its
AAA credit rating, companies are cutting back on investment. The
French economy, the euro area’s second largest, is probably
already in a recession that will last through March, Insee said
yesterday in a quarterly forecast.  “The economic turmoil is hitting industrial investment,”
said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas.
The slide in confidence “is much steeper than that still
officially anticipated by the government.”  The French economy will shrink 0.2 percent in the fourth
quarter and 0.1 percent in the first quarter, before expanding
0.1 percent in the second quarter of 2012, Insee said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
