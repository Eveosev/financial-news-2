Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
approval rating rose to 72 percent in December on stronger
support for economic policies, an opinion poll showed.  Rousseff, who took office Jan. 1, saw her approval climb
from 71 percent in September, according to the Ibope poll
published today and commissioned by the National Industry
Confederation in Brasilia.  “People approve her handling of the crisis,” Andre Cesar,
a political analyst with consultancy CAC, said by phone from
Brasilia. “The economic downturn hasn’t impacted the day-to-day
life of the people yet.”  Approval of government action to fight inflation rose to 39
percent from 38 percent in September, while 33 percent of those
polled backed monetary policy, up from 32 percent in September,
the poll showed.  Annual  inflation  in November fell to 6.64 percent from 7.31
percent in September. Authorities have cut  interest rates  by 150
basis points since August in an effort to stem economic growth
that is slowing from 7.5 percent last year to an estimated 3
percent this year, according to a weekly central bank survey.  The Ibope poll surveyed 2,002 people nationwide from Dec. 2
to Dec. 5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus two
percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
