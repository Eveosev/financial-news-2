Turkish stocks rose for a second day
after  consumer confidence  rebounded in November from last
month’s year-low and better-than-expected U.S. data signaled the
world’s biggest economy is strengthening.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  rose 0.5 percent to
51,886.47 at 10:09 a.m. in Istanbul, paring this week’s decline
to 3.2 percent.  A gauge of Turkish consumer confidence rose in November to
91, advancing from last month’s year-low of 89.7, according to
data released by the Ankara-based statistics agency today. U.S.
initial jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to a three-year low
and Federal Reserve gauges of manufacturing in the New York and
Philadelphia regions topped estimates.  “The consumer confidence data definitely contributed to
the positive momentum at the stock exchange,” Tunc Obuter,
chief trader at Garanti Yatirim Menkul Kiymetler in Istanbul,
said by telephone. The stock market opened higher tracking Asian
markets, which rose for the first day in four on the U.S. data,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
