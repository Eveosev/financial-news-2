International arms dealer  Viktor Bout  asked a judge to reverse his conviction for plotting to
sell a terrorist group millions of dollars worth of weapons,
including surface-to-air missiles.  Bout, a former Soviet air force officer once called the
“merchant of death,” was found guilty of conspiracy last month
by a  Manhattan  jury for attempting to conduct an arms sale with
two men posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known as  FARC . He has yet to be sentenced.  Defense attorney Albert Dayan today filed a request seeking
to set aside all or part of the conviction. Dayan argued that
the indictment against Bout failed to provide him with
sufficient notice of the allegations, as required by the U.S.
Constitution.  Bout was arrested in Bangkok in March 2008 in a sting
operation set up by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and
flown to  New York  for prosecution.  The case is U.S. v. Bout, 08-cr-0365, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
