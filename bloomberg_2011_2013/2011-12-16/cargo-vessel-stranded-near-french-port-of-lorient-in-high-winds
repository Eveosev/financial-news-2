The TK Bremen, a 109-meter (358-
foot) cargo vessel, is stranded on the Atlantic coast near the
French port of Lorient in high winds,  France ’s maritime
administration for the Atlantic Ocean said.  The Bremen sent an alert at 2 a.m. it had run aground, and
the 19 crew were rescued by helicopter in two airlifts starting
around 3 a.m., the Prefecture Maritime de l’Atlantique said in a
 report  on its website today. A leak in one of the fuel holds
caused local coastal pollution, the administration said.  The Malta-flagged  Bremen , which was carrying ballast, had
quit Lorient port in southern Brittany yesterday afternoon to
anchor north of the island of Groix to await better weather
conditions before heading to the U.K., according to the report.
Winds in the area were 80 kilometers (50 miles) an hour with
gusts of 115 kilometers an hour, the administration said.  “Having great difficulty keeping its anchorage, it tried
to reach another, more sheltered one, and started drifting,”
the Prefecture Maritime said.  The cargo vessel called for assistance at 12:40 a.m., and
poor weather conditions meant a port tug from Lorient was unable
to go to sea, the report said. The high-seas salvage tug Abeille
Bourbon set sail at 1:36 a.m. from the island of Ouessant, about
100 miles to the northwest, to assist the Bremen, the
administration said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
