Corn and soybeans rose on
speculation that adverse weather will reduce yield potential in
 Argentina  and Brazil, boosting demand for U.S. supplies.  Hot, dry conditions in the next six days will increase
stress on plants in parts of  South America  after below-normal
rain in the past month reduced soil moisture, according to the
Commodity Weather Group LLC. About half of Argentina’s corn and
soybeans and a quarter of the crops in Brazil may be affected,
the private forecaster said in a report.  “Concerns are growing about the South American crops,”
said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “If the forecast rains fail to
develop late next week, we could see a more dynamic rally
because the crops are entering key development.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to close
at $5.83 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The most-active contract was down 1.9 percent for the week.
Yesterday, the price touched $5.7625, the lowest since Oct. 3,
as rising global production reduced demand for U.S. supplies.  Soybean futures for March delivery climbed 1.6 percent to
$11.395 a bushel on the CBOT, bringing the gain this week to 2.9
percent, the most in two months.  Prices also rose as concerns eased that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will derail a global recovery and demand for food, animal
feed and fuel made from the crops, Schultz said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
