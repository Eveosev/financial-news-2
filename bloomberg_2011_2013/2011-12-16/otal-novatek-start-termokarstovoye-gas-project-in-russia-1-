Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest oil
company, will start development of the Termokarstovoye natural
gas field in Russia with its partner OAO Novatek as it expands
output in the country.  The project is expected to start production in 2015 with
capacity of 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, the Paris-
based company said in a statement.  Termokarstovoye, located in the Yamal Nenets autonomous
district, may hold 47 billion cubic meters of natural gas and
about 10 million tons of condensate. The exploration and
production license is held by Terneftegas, 51 percent-owned by
Novatek, and the rest by Total.  Total plans to boost output in Russia more than 30-fold
within a decade, in part through Arctic projects. The explorer
last week announced the purchase of 2 percent of Novatek for
about $800 million, boosting its stake in  Russia ’s fastest-
growing gas producer to 14.1 percent. The companies are also
partners in the Arctic Yamal LNG project.  Total has stakes in Russia’s Kharyaga, Shtokman and
Khvalynskoye fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
