The  California  Public Employees
Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension, agreed to
take a stake in an underwater power cable between New York and
 New Jersey , its second infrastructure investment.  The $220.2 billion pension fund plans to acquire an
interest in the 65-mile Neptune Regional Transmission System
that runs from Sayreville, New Jersey, to Hicksville, on New
York’s Long Island, according to a  statement  yesterday.  The purchase from Arclight Capital Partners LLC would mark
the fund’s second investment in infrastructure, following its
$157 million acquisition of a stake in London’s Gatwick Airport
last year. The pension plans to spend as much as $5 billion on
infrastructure in the next three years, including $4 billion in
the U.S. and $800 million in California, it said.  “This agreement is a good fit for our growing
infrastructure program,” Joseph Dear, the system’s chief
investment officer, said in the statement. “It’s an income-
generating investment with stable revenues located in the  United
States , very much in line with the type of investment we said we
would be looking to make when we described our vision for
infrastructure in September.”  The pension won’t disclose the size of its power-line
investment until the deal is completed, expected in the first
quarter of 2012,  Brad Pacheco , a spokesman for the Sacramento-
based fund, said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
