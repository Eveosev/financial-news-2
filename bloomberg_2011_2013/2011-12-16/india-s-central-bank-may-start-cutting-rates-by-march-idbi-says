Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees 23
billion rupees ($435 million) as Mumbai-based chief investment
officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co., comments on  Reserve
Bank  of India’s monetary policy.  The central bank left borrowing costs unchanged for the
first time in eight meetings as inflation cools and the fallout
from Europe’s debt crisis threatens growth.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  gained 1.2 percent to
16,018.07 at 1:36 p.m. in Mumbai, its first gain in three days.  Srivastava spoke in a phone interview.  On central bank action:  “The pause was expected as there is incremental pressure
on economic growth. While domestic macros -- investment and
consumption -- have been decelerating, the slowdown in global
markets is impacting exports.”  “The central bank may start cutting  interest rates  by
March. We don’t think it will want to wait for inflation to fall
below 7 percent to initiate rate cuts.”  India ’s  benchmark wholesale-price inflation  slowed to a
one-year low of 9.11 percent in November.  On stock markets:  “We don’t expect to see a runaway rally. Markets will
watch India’s macro-economic environment and focus on news
flowing out of global markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
