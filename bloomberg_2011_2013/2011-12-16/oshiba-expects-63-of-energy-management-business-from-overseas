Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,  Japan ’s largest maker
of nuclear power plants, expects 63 percent of sales from its
energy management business to come from overseas by March 2016.  The company’s “smart community” energy management sales
are projected to grow to 900 billion yen ($11.6 billion) in this
period, Toshiba President Norio Sasaki told reporters in Tokyo
today, maintaining an earlier projection. The smart community
pilot projects in Japan and overseas include setting up charging
infrastructure for electric vehicles and systems to help manage
energy use in buildings.  Toshiba in July acquired a 60 percent stake in Swiss
electronic-metering company  Landis+Gyr AG  and said it will spend
a total of $1.6 billion for the shares and to assume debt.
Landis+Gyr makes meters that allow utilities to check energy use
remotely and can be connected to equipment that shows customers
when rates are highest.  Sasaki said the investment in Landis+Gyr may be recovered
in seven years, from the originally planned nine years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
