New Zealand ’s central bank will
allow Kauri bonds rated at least AA- for use as collateral as
ratings companies strip some nations of their top credit grades.  When two ratings companies score the security AA- or
higher, it will be eligible,  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand said in
a statement today on its website. Kauri bonds are New Zealand
dollar-denominated notes sold in the country by foreign issuers.  “Action by rating agencies in the recent past to adjust
their frameworks and downgrade certain sovereigns from AAA to
lower ratings has systemic consequences for the Kauri securities
market,” the RBNZ said in the statement. Those consequences
relate to the central bank’s domestic market operations and to
commercial banks’ liquidity calculations, it said.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings cut the New Zealand
government’s top credit rating on local currency debt for the
first time in September. S&P also put the euro area’s six AAA
sovereigns including France and  Germany  on watch for a downgrade
on Dec. 5, four months after the company stripped the U.S. of
its top grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
