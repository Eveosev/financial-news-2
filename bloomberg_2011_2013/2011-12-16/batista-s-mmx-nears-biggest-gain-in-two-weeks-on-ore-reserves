MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA , the
iron-ore miner controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ,
posted the biggest gain in almost two weeks after saying its
Serra Azul unit has 997.4 million tons of ore reserves.  MMX advanced 2.5 percent to 6.48 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the largest increase since Dec. 5.  The company, in a regulatory filing yesterday after the
market closed, said SRK Consulting certified the reserves at the
unit. The disclosure boosts investor confidence in MMX’s
expansion plans, according to  Itau Unibanco Holding SA , which
reiterated its “outperform” recommendation on the stock.  “MMX is uniquely positioned to deliver its expansion
plans,” Marcos Assumpcao, an analyst at Itau, wrote in a note
to clients today. “The company will increasingly grab investor
attention, given its attractive risk-reward proposition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
