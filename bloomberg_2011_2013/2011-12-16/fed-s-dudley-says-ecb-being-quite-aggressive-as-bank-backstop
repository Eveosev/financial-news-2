Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said the  European Central Bank  is
providing a backstop to the continent’s banks.  The ECB “is being actually quite aggressive in being a
lender of last resort to the European banking system,” Dudley,
58, said at a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform
subcommittee in  Washington . He pointed to the ECB’s three-year
lending facility and its broadening of eligible collateral.  “Some people are arguing” the ECB should buy bonds
directly from governments, which is “prohibited by treaty,”
Dudley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
