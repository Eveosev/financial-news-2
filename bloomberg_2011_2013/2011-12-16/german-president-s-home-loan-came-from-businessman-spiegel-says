German President  Christian Wulff ’s
home loan was made with money from a businessman friend and not
from the man’s wife as Wulff previously said, Der Spiegel
magazine reported.  Wulff said in a statement yesterday that a loan he accepted
from Egon Geerkens’s wife, Edith, when he was premier of Lower
Saxony state may have created the “wrong impression” and that he
has “nothing to hide.”  The loan, which Bild newspaper reported Dec. 13 as being
for 500,000 euros ($652,000), came from Geerkens himself via a
bank account in his wife’s name for which he had power of
attorney, Spiegel said in a preview of an article to be
published in next week’s edition, citing the businessman. The
president’s office in Berlin had no immediate comment on the
report when contacted by telephone today.  Geerkens said that he negotiated the loan with Wulff,
before Wulff was elected last year to the mainly ceremonial
presidency, and that he sought a way to keep the loan private,
according to Spiegel. “I didn’t want some bank trainee seeing
that so much money was going to Wulff from me,” Spiegel cited
Geerkens as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
