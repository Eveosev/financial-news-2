Siga Technologies Inc. failed to
persuade a  Delaware  Chancery Court judge to reconsider his award
of 50 percent of the profit from a smallpox drug to  PharmAthene
Inc. (PIP) , according to court papers.  In an opinion today, Judge Donald Parsons affirmed his
earlier decision that Siga should share possible proceeds of
more than $400 million.  “The standard applicable to a motion for reargument is
well-settled,” and “ the moving party bears a heavy burden,”
Parsons wrote in a 19-page opinion. “Motions for reargument
must be denied when a party merely restates its prior
arguments.”  New York-based Siga alleged in a court filing that Parsons
“misapprehended both the law and the facts” in awarding a
share of ST-246’s profit to Annapolis-based PharmAthene. Parsons
earlier said Siga breached its obligation to negotiate in good
faith on the antiviral drug designed for use in case of a
biological attack.  The case is PharmAthene Inc. v.  Siga Technologies Inc. (SIGA) ,
CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
