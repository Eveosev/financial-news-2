President William C. Dudley said it will be easier for Spain and
 Italy  to achieve fiscal consolidation imperatives than for
Greece.  “As you go from the peripheral countries to the core, the
debt challenges become much more manageable,” Dudley, 58, said
at a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform
subcommittee in  Washington . “They have to do substantially less
than what Greece has had to do,” and “what Spain and Italy
need to do is completely achievable.”  Dudley said “it’s going to take time” to implement new
programs and the countries will need to “convince market
participants” that they will do so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
