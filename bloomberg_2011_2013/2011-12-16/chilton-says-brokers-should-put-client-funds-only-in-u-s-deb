The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission should ban derivatives brokers from investing client
funds in anything other than  U.S. debt , commissioner  Bart Chilton  said.  Chilton said recent changes in regulations governing client
funds, approved after MF Global Holdings Ltd. filed for
bankruptcy, don’t provide enough protection for clients.  Steps need to be taken to put “confidence and trust back
into our U.S. derivatives markets,” Chilton, a Democrat, said
in a statement.  MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31. James W. Giddens,
the trustee overseeing the liquidation, has estimated that as
much as $1.2 billion in client funds may be missing.  Editors: Lawrence Roberts, Maura Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
