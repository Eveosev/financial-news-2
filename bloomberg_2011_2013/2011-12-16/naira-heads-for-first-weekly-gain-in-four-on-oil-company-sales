Nigeria ’s naira advanced for a
second day, headed for its first weekly gain in four, as  oil
companies  sold the U.S. currency to banks.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.4 percent to 161.60 per dollar as of 1:21 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, heading for a weekly gain of 0.1 percent.  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
 exchange-rate  band at the auctions to 155 naira per dollar from
150 naira as rising imports and weakening oil prices increased
pressure on the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest
economy depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of
foreign income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  “The appreciation or relative stability at the inter-bank
market was due to oil company dollar sales,” analysts at Lagos-
based Diamond Bank said in a report today. “Dealers expect the
exchange rate to be fairly stable as dollar demand diminishes”
from the oil company sales, it said.  Nigeria  sold  $200 million at its last foreign-currency
auction on Dec. 14, less than the $256.7 million  demanded  by
lenders, with the marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate at 156.70 per dollar, unchanged from a
previous sale on Dec. 12, the Central Bank of Nigeria said.  The
last time lenders’ demand was met was Nov. 30.  “The value of the naira greatly depends on the demand and
supply of dollars by the central bank and the autonomous sources
of which the central bank is the major supplier,” Wale Abe,
chief executive of Lagos-based Financial Market Dealers
Association, said by phone.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated by 0.1 percent to 1.6385 per
dollar as of 1.p.m. in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
