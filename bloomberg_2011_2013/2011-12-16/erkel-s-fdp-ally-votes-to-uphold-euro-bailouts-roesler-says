Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Free
Democratic Party coalition partner will continue to support the
government’s line on euro-area rescues during the debt crisis,
after a party vote organized by bailout skeptics was defeated.  The internal ballot that tried to rally opposition to the
future permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism,
failed to muster the majority needed to change party policy, FDP
leader Philipp Roesler said in Berlin today.  The result “once more confirms the party line,” Roesler
told reporters. The FDP “remains a pro-European party.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
