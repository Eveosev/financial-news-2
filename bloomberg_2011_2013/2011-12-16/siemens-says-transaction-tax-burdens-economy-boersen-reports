The European Union’s proposed
financial-transaction tax will burden the rest of the economy
and doesn’t address the problem of market speculation,  Siemens
AG (SIE)  Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser said in a guest commentary
in  Boersen-Zeitung .  Risk-management instruments such as hedging for shifts in
currencies, raw-material prices and  interest rates  will become
more expensive and hurt the competitiveness of German industry,
Kaeser wrote in the Frankfurt-based newspaper.  Manufacturing companies whose treasuries do their own risk
management will have to pay the tax and would therefore be
treated the same as banks, the CFO said, according to Boersen-
Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
