California ’s three largest utilities
received approval from state regulators to buy electricity from
17 solar-energy plants.  The California Public Utilities Commission approved the
power-purchase agreements totaling 444 megawatts in a meeting
today, according to commission filings. California law states
that utilities should get 20 percent of their generation from
renewable resources by the end of 2013, 25 percent by the end of
2016 and 33 percent by the end of 2020.  In 2010, California’s three largest utilities collectively
got 17 percent of their generation from renewable energy,
according to the commission’s third-quarter  report .  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ’s
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. got 15.9 percent, Edison
International’s  Southern California Edison Co. (EIX)  got 19.3 percent
and  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co. received 11.9
percent.  PG&E was approved to buy the output from the 150-megawatt
Copper Mountain Solar 2 project for 25 years.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest maker of thin-film
solar panels, will supply the equipment and begin construction
this year in Boulder City, Nevada. The plant is expected to
enter operation in 2015, Sempra, which owns the project, said
today in a statement.  Southern California Edison  Southern California Edison will buy power for 20 years from
15 projects totaling 144 megawatts of capacity. The plants,
located in California, are being developed by six companies and
will start operating in 2013 and 2014.  The developers are Silverado Power, Juwi Solar Inc.,
Foresight Renewables LLC, Amonix Inc.,  Clear Peak Energy Inc. (CLPE) ,
and Recurrent Energy Inc., a unit of Sharp Corp., according to a
 filing .  SDG&E was approved to buy the output from a 150-megawatt
project near El Centro, California. The Imperial Solar Energy
Center West plant is being developed by Tenaska Inc. and will
consist of concentrating solar panels that French manufacturer
Soitec SA will supply from a factory in San Diego that’s
scheduled to start production in 2013. The 25-year contract will
begin in 2015, according to a commission  filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
