Capital Safety Group’s $425 million
 term loan  backing the U.K.-based safety-harness maker’s buyout
by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  rose in initial trading, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  The debt began trading at 99.25 cents on the dollar, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the trades are
private. The financing was sold at 98 cents, the person said  The seven-year loan pays a rate of 5 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate with a 1.25 percent floor
on the benchmark, the person said. Libor is the rate banks
charge to lend to each other.  UBS AG, Morgan Stanley, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and KKR
Capital Markets arranged the financing, the person said.  New York-based KKR agreed to buy Capital Safety from Arle
Capital Partners last month, according to Nov. 28 news release.  Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, couldn’t immediately
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
