Zimbabwe ’s Deputy Prime Minister
Arthur Mutambara is no longer leader of a splinter faction of
the Movement for Democratic Change, formerly known as MDC -
Mutambara, the state-controlled  Herald  said, citing High Court
Judge Nicholas Mathonsi  Mutambara refused to relinquish his position as party
leader when he lost a vote to Welshman Ncube in February, the
Herald said. Zimbabwe’s High Court ruled yesterday that as well
as losing the leadership of the MDC-M, Mutambara could no longer
act as a “principal” in the Zimbabwean government.  Zimbabwe’s principals are party leaders  Robert Mugabe  and
 Morgan Tsvangirai  whose Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front and Movement for Democratic Change respectively
are negotiating an end to 12 years of political instability.  Mutambara said he would appeal the court ruling, which was
made in Zimbabwe’s second-city, Bulawayo, yesterday, the Herald
added. Mutambara said he would not stand down as a principal or
deputy prime minister, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
