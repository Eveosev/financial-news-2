Wolfgang Kubicki, the Free
Democratic Party’s floor leader in  Germany ’s Schleswig-Holstein
state parliament, said his party should recount votes in its
nationwide poll of members’ support for  Europe ’s permanent
bailout fund,  Die Welt  reported, citing an interview.  FDP members have cited the complexity of the vote procedure
on the European Stability Mechanism as causing numerous invalid
votes, the newspaper said. Kubicki said those votes should be
regarded as valid in a recount, Die Welt said.  The results of the vote will be published today and FDP
opponents of the ESM who participated may be numerous enough to
force the party’s national executive to adopt their stance if
invalid votes had counted, the newspaper cited Kubicki as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
