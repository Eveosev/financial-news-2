Canadian wheat and barley farmers
are now able to forward contract their crops to the buyer of
their choice, including a viable and voluntary Canadian Wheat
Board, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said in a statement.  Ritz spoke at an event in Saskatchewan to mark the passage
of legislation that abolishes the Wheat Board’s monopoly on
marketing of wheat and barley grown in western  Canada  for human
consumption. The bill passed the Senate and received royal
assent, the final step in the legislative process, last night.  Farmers are now allowed to enter into forward contracts for
these grains for delivery after Aug. 1, 2012, Ritz said in a
statement posted on his department’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
