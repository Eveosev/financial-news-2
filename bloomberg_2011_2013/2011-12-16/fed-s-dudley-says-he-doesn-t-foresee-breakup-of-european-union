President William C. Dudley said he doesn’t foresee the European
Union dissolving.  “This is not something that I anticipate,” Dudley, 58,
said at a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform
subcommittee in  Washington . “The European leadership is fully
committed to the European Union,” though it’s a “political
problem” so “maybe they’re not moving as fast as some of us
might like,” he said.  Dudley said the Fed’s currency swap lines are intended to
limit the impact of the crisis in Europe on the U.S.  “This is about helping ourselves,” he said. “This is
about ensuring the flow of credit to U.S. households and
businesses.”  The Fed is putting U.S. financial institutions through a
“very severe  stress test ,” Dudley said. “Our job is to make
sure that U.S. banks can withstand a very bad economic
environment regardless of the source of that stress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
