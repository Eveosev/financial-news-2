Nine states will get federal grants
from a $500 million program to boost education standards for
preschool programs, the Obama administration said.  California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
 North Carolina , Ohio,  Rhode Island  and Washington will receive
the funds from the Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge, a
competition to reward states that create plans to set higher
standards for preschools and to expand and improve their staffs.  The states were chosen based on their applications and
available funds, which will help all early learning programs
such as Head Start and public pre-kindergarten.  “Our kids only get one shot at a top-notch education and
they absolutely cannot afford to wait,”  Melody Barnes , director
of the White House’s Domestic Policy Council, said on a
conference call today.  Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the “best early
learning programs boost student achievement and increase both
high school and college graduation rates.”  Duncan said the program is “especially important for low-
income students” and that the administration is “serious about
closing achievement gaps and leveling the playing field.”  The administration’s broader Race to the Top program has
awarded as much as $4 billion to 11 states and the District of
Columbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
