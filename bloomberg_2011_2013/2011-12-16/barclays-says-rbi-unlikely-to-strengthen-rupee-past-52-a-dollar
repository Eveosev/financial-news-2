Olivier Desbarres, head of foreign-
exchange strategy for Asia-Pacific ex-Japan at  Barclays Capital 
in  Singapore , comments on the rupee’s outlook. He spoke in a
telephone interview today.  The currency strengthened 1.8 percent to 52.7150 a dollar
as of 10:46 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, after the central bank took steps to curb speculation
in the foreign-exchange market. The rupee,  Asia ’s worst-
performing currency this year, dropped to a record low of
54.3050 yesterday.  “The rupee has strengthened today, suggesting the market
has taken note of the measures the  Reserve Bank  of India took
last night. What also needs to be said though is that these
measures don’t necessarily address the underlying cause for the
rupee’s weakness, which is the current-account deficit and the
lack of portfolio inflows.  “Unless we get a big risk-on session and capital flows
come in, the currency will stabilize just weaker than 52 a
dollar and the market will take it from there. Fifty-two is
where we traded for a good chunk of the second half of November,
so that’s the level the market may be more comfortable with and
the RBI can claim that it has succeeded in stemming the downside
for the rupee.  “I don’t think the RBI will try to push the currency more
than that because I think it understands that fundamentals work
against currency appreciation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
