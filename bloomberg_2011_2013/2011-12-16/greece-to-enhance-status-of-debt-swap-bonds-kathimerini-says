Euro region officals have approved a
proposal for new bonds issued to  Greece â€™s private creditors to
have the same legal status as a 30 billion-euro ($39 billion)
loan from the European Financial Stability Facility,  Kathimerini 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  A Dec. 14 meeting of finance ministry officials from euro
region countries approved the proposal, which would be part of a
debt swap plan currently under discussion between Greece and its
creditors, the Athens-based newspaper said. The proposal will
mean a 54 percent net present value loss for holders of about
200 billion euros of privately held Greek debt, Kathimerini
said.  A summit of European Union leaders on Oct. 26 agreed to a
debt swap for Greece involving private sector lenders taking a
50 percent nominal loss on holdings of Greek debt. They agreed
at the summit for Greece to receive a 30 billion-euro loan from
EFSF to help structure the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
