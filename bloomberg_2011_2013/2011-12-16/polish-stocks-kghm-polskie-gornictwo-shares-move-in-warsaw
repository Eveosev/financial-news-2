Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell for a
third day, losing 45.29, or 2.1 percent, to 2,116.03 at the 5:30
p.m. closing in Warsaw. The measure has slumped 5 percent this
week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, slumped 3 percent to 105.2 zloty, the lowest
level since August 2010. The stock plunged 10 percent yesterday
after Poland’s Finance Ministry published a draft of the new
copper tax bill it plans to implement in 2012.  Erste Group Bank AG downgraded the stock to “reduce” from
“hold,” UniCredit SpA reduced its 12-month price estimate for
KGHM to 111 zloty from 163 zloty, while Societe Generale SA cut
its projection 12 percent to 121.1 zloty after the tax proposal.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, rose 1
percent to 24.1 zloty, as oil and natural gas climbed.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN)   fell
4.4 percent to 4.18 zloty, the first retreat in four days. The
energy regulator “probably” won’t approve by the end of the
day tomorrow a request by the country’s dominant gas company to
allow it to increase the price of the fuel, Agnieszka Glosniewska, a spokeswoman for the watchdog, said by phone. The
lack of approval before Dec. 18 means the company won’t be able
to introduce the increased prices as of Jan. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
