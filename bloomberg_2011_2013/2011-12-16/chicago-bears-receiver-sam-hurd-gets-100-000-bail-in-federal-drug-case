Sam Hurd, the former  Chicago  Bears
wide receiver accused by the U.S. of a drug-trafficking
conspiracy, was freed on $100,000 bail by a federal magistrate.  U.S. Magistrate Judge  Young Kim  in Chicago today agreed to
a bail terms proposed by Hurd’s lawyer, Brett Greenfield of  Los
Angeles , and federal prosecutors. The National Football League
player, who has been in custody since Dec. 14, appeared in court
wearing an orange jumpsuit with his ankles shackled.  Hurd, 26, was arrested with one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
cocaine in his possession as he exited a Chicago-area restaurant
where he had been negotiating with an undercover federal agent
for a weekly supply of $700,000 in cocaine and marijuana,
prosecutors said.  The charge of conspiracy to possess 500 or more grams of a
cocaine mixture with intent to distribute it carries a maximum
term of 40 years in prison. Hurd hasn’t been arraigned or
entered a plea.  The Bears cut Hurd from the team today. He spent his first
five seasons with the  Dallas  Cowboys before joining the Bears as
a free agent in July. The San Antonio native, who played at
Northern  Illinois  University, has eight catches for 109 yards
this season, and 77 receptions for 739 yards for his career.  The criminal complaint against him was filed by prosecutors
in Dallas, where he’s required to appear to answer the charges.
As a condition of his bail, Hurd must also find a job.  The case is U.S. v. Hurd, 11-cr-875, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
