CaixaBank  SA will issue as much as
4.9 billion euros ($6.4 billion) of bonds in an exchange for
preference shares to help  Spain ’s fourth-biggest lender raise
capital.  The  issues  of as much as 1.47 billion euros of mandatory
convertible bonds and 3.43 billion euros of subordinated bonds
will be aimed exclusively at holders of preference shares who
accept Caixabank’s offer to buy those securities back at 100
percent of their nominal value of 1,000 euros, the Barcelona-
based lender said in a regulatory filing late yesterday.  CaixaBank is following  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in raising capital with offers to exchange
preference shares. CaixaBank’s capital shortfall in September
under European Banking Authority criteria was 630 million euros,
the bank said earlier this month.  CaixaBank will offer holders of its A and B series
preference shares 300 euros in cash and seven subordinated bonds
with a 4.06 percent coupon. Holders of its series 1/2009
preference shares will receive 300 euros in cash and seven
subordinated bonds carrying a 5.095 percent coupon, the bank
said.  As a condition of the offer, investors must subscribe to
three mandatorily convertible bonds for every preference share
that CaixaBank repurchases. Half of the bonds will convert to
shares of CaixaBank on June 30, 2012, with the remainder
converting a year later, the lender said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
