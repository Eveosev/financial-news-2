Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  asked French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to block
legislation criminalizing denial of the Armenian genocide in
1915, according to state-run Anatolia news agency.  Passage of the measure would have “perilous” results for
the two countries’ political, economic and cultural ties,
Erdogan wrote in a letter to Sarkozy, according to the news
agency. Erdogan said he hopes Sarkozy will stand by promises to
prevent the bill from becoming law, the agency said.  The French parliament will vote Dec. 22 on a measure that
would punish people saying that the events of 1915 aren’t
genocide by a year in prison and a 45,000 euro fine ($59,000),
the agency reported yesterday.  The Turkish government denies that any genocide occurred,
saying tens of thousands of ethnic Turks and Armenians died in
clashes during World War I under the  Ottoman Empire  after
Armenian groups sided with Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
