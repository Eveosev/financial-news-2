Sellers are demanding a premium for
coffee from Honduras, Central America’s largest producer,
reversing a discount last week, as rains delay bean arrivals,
according to Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Honduran beans are at a premium of 5 cents a pound to the
price on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange in  New York , up from a
discount of 2 cents a pound last week, data from the Winterthur,
Switzerland-based trader showed.  “A cold front and some rains are further delaying the
arrival of the coffee,” Volcafe said in a report e-mailed
today. “Internal prices are firming up as exporters are still
in need of coffee to cover their nearby commitments.”  The premium to obtain coffee from  Colombia , the world’s
second-largest producer of arabica coffee, climbed to 25 cents a
pound from 22 cents a pound last week, according to Volcafe.  The weather “remains a problem,” the trader said.
“Coffee flow continues to disappoint.”  Brazil  is the biggest
producer.  Colombia’s 2011-12 production will “struggle” to reach 7
million bags, Volcafe estimated on Dec. 13. The country’s crop
has been damaged due to rains caused by the La Nina weather
pattern, which is associated with cooler than normal water
temperatures in the Equatorial  Pacific Ocean .  To contact the reporter on this story:
