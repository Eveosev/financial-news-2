Germany  produced more energy from
renewable sources than from nuclear, hard-coal or gas-fired
plants this year after boosting investments in projects from
wind to biomass.  Renewables accounted for a fifth of the generation mix in
2011, up from 16.4 percent last year, the BDEW utility
association said today in a website  statement . Only lignite-
fired output, with 24.6 percent, had a greater share this year.  Atomic power sank to 17.4 percent from 22.4 percent after
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  shuttered the country’s eight oldest
reactors in March in the wake of the Fukushima crisis in  Japan .
She plans a complete exit from the nuclear industry by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
