Romania ’s parliament approved two
laws yesterday that ban natural-gas exports and create a
consumption basket, which may prompt  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  to book
additional costs of $100 million, Ziarul Financiar reported.  Petrom, Romania’s biggest oil company, will have to drop
the use of domestic gas at its Brazi gas-fired plant and include
more expensive import gas in its consumption basket, which may
boost costs at the plant, the Bucharest-based based newspaper
said, citing its  own calculations  based on data from the
country’s energy regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
