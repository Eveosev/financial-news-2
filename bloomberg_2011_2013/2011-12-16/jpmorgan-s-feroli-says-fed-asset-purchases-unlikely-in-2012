Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist
at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in  New York , said he doesn’t expect the
 Federal Reserve  to undertake new asset purchases next year
unless  Europe ’s situation deteriorates or inflation falls too
quickly.  “So far, the European crisis has had a limited impact on
the U.S.,” he said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television. “But you never know with Europe. We are as
concerned as anyone.”  “For Europe, I think we are just getting started in terms
of the slowdown,” Feroli said. “Whether we see more QE,” or
quantitative easing, “I’m not convinced. Right now, the growth
picture is not bad enough for the Fed to do more asset
purchases.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
