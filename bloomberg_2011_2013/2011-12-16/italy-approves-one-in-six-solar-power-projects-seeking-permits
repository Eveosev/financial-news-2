Italy’s renewable-energy regulator
approved 507 commercial and utility-scale solar parks, or about
one in every six projects seeking permits for the first half of
next year, as spending limits curb market growth.  Projects with 682 megawatts in total capacity qualified for
feed-in tariffs, or premium rates for solar power, after
applying to the country’s second registry for solar parks, the
 Gestore Servizi Energetici  said today on its website. More than
half of this capacity has already been built and connected, the
data show.  A further 2,548 projects weren’t approved because of a 150
million-euro ($196 million) spending cap on subsidies for the
period, according to the regulator.  Italy, the largest solar market after  Germany , reduced
subsidies and set up a registry system in May to limit spending
after high rates and falling panel prices led to runaway growth.
Almost 12,000 megawatts have been connected to the country’s
grid, compared with only 3,500 megawatts at the end of 2010, GSE
data show.  A total of 831 solar projects with a combined capacity of
1,050 megawatts were approved in July as the initial registry
allotted 300 million euros in tariffs for the remainder of 2011.
A third registry is planned to allocate 130 million euros for
projects in the second half of 2012.  Spending Cap  “It is likely that there won’t be any budget left to open
a third registry,” Federico Brucciani, a spokesman for the
 Gruppo Imprese Fotovoltaiche Italiane  lobbying body, said by
phone. “The law sets a limit of 6 to 7 billion euros in total
spending for solar feed-in tariffs and we expect this will be
reached by June next year.”  The spending cap affects rooftop projects larger than 1
megawatt and ground-mounted projects of more than 0.2 megawatt,
as well as smaller installations on the ground without net
metering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
