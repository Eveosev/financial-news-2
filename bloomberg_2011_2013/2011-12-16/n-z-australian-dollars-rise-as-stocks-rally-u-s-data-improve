The Australian and New Zealand
dollars advanced for a second day as global equities rallied on
stronger demand for higher-yielding assets.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies rebounded from two-
week lows after reports added to signs the  U.S. economy  is
gaining momentum even as  Europe  struggles to contain its debt
crisis. Advances in the Aussie were limited before the  Reserve
Bank  of  Australia  releases minutes next week of its Dec. 6
meeting when the central bank implemented a second-straight
interest-rate cut.  “The market has already factored in a fairly negative
outcome from Europe and there’s some scope for sentiment to
improve,” said Greg Gibbs, a foreign-exchange strategist in
Sydney at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The Australian
dollar is likely to “firm up,” he said.  The Australian dollar advanced 0.7 percent to 99.88 U.S.
cents at 11:21 a.m. New York time, trimming its five-day decline
to 2.2 percent. It sank to as low as 98.62 cents yesterday, the
least since Nov. 28. It gained 0.4 percent to 77.59 yen today.  New Zealand ’s currency rose 1.4 percent to 76.40 U.S.
cents, paring its weekly drop to 1.5 percent. Before rallying
yesterday, the kiwi fell to as low as 74.62, its weakest level
since Nov. 28. It climbed 1.2 percent to 59.35 yen.  The MSCI World Index of shares added 0.7 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks gained 1 percent.  RBA Minutes  The RBA is scheduled to release on Dec. 20 the minutes of
its most recent policy meeting, when it reduced the overnight
cash rate target to 4.25 percent from 4.5 percent, the second
reduction in two months.  “Until the RBA surprises and doesn’t deliver on what the
market currently has priced in, you would expect the Australian
dollar to have a grinding selloff,” said Gavin Stacey, chief
interest-rate strategist at  Barclays Capital  in Sydney.  A Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on swaps shows traders
are betting that Australia’s central bank will cut rates by 135
basis points during the next 12 months. That compares with
wagers for 112 basis points of easing indicated on Dec. 7, the
day after the RBA’s last policy meeting.  The Australian dollar has fallen 2.5 percent against its
U.S. counterpart since this year, while the kiwi has dropped 2.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
