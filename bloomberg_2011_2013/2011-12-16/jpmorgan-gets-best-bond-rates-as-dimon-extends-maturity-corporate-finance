JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , deemed by
derivatives traders to be the most creditworthy of the six
biggest U.S. banks, locked in the lowest interest rate its
industry has seen since 2005 on 30-year debt.  The biggest U.S. bank by assets sold $1.25 billion of 5.4
percent debentures yesterday to yield 250 basis points, or 2.5
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the only other U.S.-based bank to have issued 30-year debt
in 2011, sold $2.5 billion of 6.25 percent bonds at a 170 basis-
point spread on Jan. 21.  JPMorgan is pushing out the maturities of its debt as
yields on investment-grade corporate bonds due in 15 years or
more approach the lowest on record while the  Federal Reserve 
holds down  interest rates  to stimulate the economy. The New
York-based bank has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year debt
since issuance of the securities by banks resumed in October
2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data show.  “JPMorgan is one of the few in the market now that can
issue these bonds, and a big reason is investors think they’re
one of the best banks out there,” Rob Crimmins, a New York-
based  money manager  at RS Investment Management Co., which
oversees $30 billion. “In this environment, there aren’t many
banks that would be able to sell 30-year bonds.”  Justin Perras , a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the sale.  Lowest Coupon  JPMorgan wasn’t among nine large banks including  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG downgraded
yesterday by  Fitch Ratings , which found they are “particularly
sensitive to the increased challenges the financial markets
face,” according to a statement.  The debt sold yesterday has the lowest coupon among 30-year
U.S. bank bonds since San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
issued $750 million of 5.375 percent debt at an 80 basis-point
spread in January 2005, Bloomberg data show. The securities
climbed 1.36 cents to 101.2 cents on the dollar to pay a 245
basis-point spread as of 10:53 a.m. in  New York , according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  In its previous offering of 30-year bonds, JPMorgan sold
$1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140 basis points, or
1.4 percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries on
July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of 5.5 percent, 30-year
bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct. 14, 2010, the first
sale since  Citigroup Inc. (C)  issued $2.5 billion of the debt in
July 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Average Maturity  JPMorgan’s offerings extended the average maturity of its
outstanding bonds to 6.5 years at the end of the third quarter
from 5.66 years in the first quarter of 2010, Bloomberg data
show. The bank’s average coupon fell to 5.01 percent from 5.19
percent. It has sold the most 30-year debt among its peers since
October 2010.  HSBC Holdings Plc based in  London  and Utrecht, Netherlands-
based Rabobank Nederland NV also issued debentures of that
maturity this year.  Banks have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this
year, with more than 97 percent coming due within 10 years,
Bloomberg data show.  The extra yield investors demand to own  U.S. bank  bonds
instead of Treasuries has risen to 395 basis points from 210
basis points since the end of 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads touched 403 on Nov. 29, the
widest since July 2009.  Yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years or more
averaged 5.21 percent yesterday, after falling from 6.16 percent
in February, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. They touched 5.02 percent, the lowest in daily data
extending to October 1986, on Nov. 1.  ‘Good Value’  Spreads have widened on financial company bonds as concern
among investors mounted that  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
would spread, imperiling the global economy. That has made
JPMorgan and other U.S. banks more attractive to fixed-income
investors, said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist at  LPL
Financial , which manages $330 billion.  “Financials in general and certainly the stronger ones are
good value in this market,” Valeri said in a telephone
interview from  San Diego . “We don’t think the bank sector’s
going to implode. We think exposure to Europe is manageable for
U.S. banks, and therefore this  risk premium  is significantly
large right now to where it offers an opportunity.”  Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company’s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 145.9 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $145,900 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank’s debt for five years.  Other Bank Swaps  Contracts on Wells Fargo were at 146.2 while those for Bank
of America reached 402.5. Swaps on Citigroup were 274.7,
contracts protecting the debt of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  traded
at 313.4 and those on  Morgan Stanley (MS)  were at 416.6, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates.  Moody’s Investors Service assigns JPMorgan a rating of Aa3,
its highest grade on any of the six biggest U.S. banks. Fitch
holds a rank of AA- on it and Wells Fargo. Standard & Poor’s
ranks Wells Fargo A+ and JPMorgan A.  ‘Trust Management’  JPMorgan’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
assets, a measure of its ability to absorb losses, is the lowest
among the six biggest U.S. banks at 5.49, Bloomberg data show.
Jim Leonard, a Chicago-based credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.,
cited the ratio when downgrading the lender to A from A+,
calling the level “a cause for some concern” in a note
yesterday.  Investors buying JPMorgan’s bonds are looking past any
financial weaknesses and giving it credit for Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s performance in the wake of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy, when the firm avoided losses,
Leonard said.  “Their credit metrics are OK, but not stellar,” Leonard
said in a telephone interview. “What is stellar is their
reputation and their performance during the credit crisis. When
you think about the credit quality of banks, at some point you
have to trust management knows what it’s doing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
