Wayne County ,  Michigan ’s debt was
cut two levels by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited
“ongoing financial stress.”  The Baa2 rating, two levels above non-investment grade,
affects $445 million of debt that carries the county’s general-
obligation limited tax pledge.  Wayne County is unlikely to eliminate its operating deficit
“in a timely manner,” Moody’s said in a report, which pointed
to “persistent economic challenges” facing the most populous
county in Michigan.  Moody’s said unemployment and “considerable
deterioration” of real-estate values challenge the county,
which encompasses  Detroit . The deficit has forced it to rely on
issuing tax-anticipation notes to support  cash flow , Moody’s
said.  Moody’s also revised the outlook on the county’s rating to
stable from negative, basing the decision on the expectation
that officials will make progress toward eliminating the
deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
