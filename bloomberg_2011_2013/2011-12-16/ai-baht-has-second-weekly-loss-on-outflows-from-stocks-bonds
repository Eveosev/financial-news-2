Thailand ’s baht completed a second
weekly loss as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen sapped
demand for emerging-market assets.  The baht touched its weakest level since August 2010 today
after overseas investors sold $139 million more Thai shares than
they bought this week through yesterday and pulled $262 million
from government debt, according to the stock exchange and the
Thai Bond Market  Association . The European debt crisis is
growing to the point that it won’t be solved by one group of
countries,  Christine Lagarde , the managing director of the
 International Monetary Fund  said yesterday.  “Investors are becoming risk averse because of Europe’s
debt concern and therefore, we are seeing some fund outflows
from  Asia ,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “The baht will be influenced mainly
by external factors rather than domestic factors, at least until
the end of the year.”  The baht dropped 1.3 percent this week to 31.35 per dollar
as of 3:14 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 31.48 today, the weakest level
since Aug. 26, 2010, before trading little changed from
yesterday’s close. It may trade between 31.20 and 31.50 next
week, Hasegawa said.  The central bank has no concerns about the recent weakness
in the baht because it moves in line with other regional
currencies, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said today. Eight of
10 most-traded currencies in Asia excluding the yen weakened
against the greenback in the past month, led by the Indian
rupee’s 4.3 percent slide.  The yield on the 3.25 percent debt due June 2017 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.10 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was unchanged
from a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
