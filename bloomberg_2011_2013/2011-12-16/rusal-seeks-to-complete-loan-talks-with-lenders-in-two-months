United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, said it wants to complete
negotiations within two months with lenders for a “more
flexible approach” to covenants given the prospect of
“continuing weakness” in commodity markets next year.  The company is confident that lenders will meet its
requirements, Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  said in a
Bloomberg TV interview.  Rusal also requested from its lenders a period in which its
covenants aren’t tested, it said in a statement yesterday.  Rusal  completed an $11.4 billion debt refinancing in
October that involved borrowing $4.75 billion from 13 lenders,
including  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  ING Groep NV. (INGA)   Rusal undertook a $17 billion debt restructuring in 2009 as
the global crash in commodity prices coincided with increased
borrowing to finance Rusal’s expansion. Aluminum prices have
slumped 29 percent from this year’s peak of $2,797 a ton on May
3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
