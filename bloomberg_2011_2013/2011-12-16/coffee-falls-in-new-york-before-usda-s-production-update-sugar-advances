Coffee fell to a one-year low as
inventories monitored by ICE Futures U.S. climbed for the
seventh straight week. Sugar advanced, and cocoa dropped.
      Stockpiles  of coffee monitored by ICE have jumped 20
percent since Nov. 1 to 1.53 million bags. Arabica futures in
New York have dropped 11 percent this year after surging 77
percent in 2010.  “Warehouse stockpiles are higher, and that may be keeping
buyers at bay,” Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging
in  St. Paul ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone interview.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 1.2 percent
to settle at $2.151 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $2.142, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 16, 2010. This week, the commodity declined
5.6 percent, the fourth straight drop.  After the close, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its
forecast for global production to 133.8 million bags in the year
that started Oct. 1 from a June estimate of 135 million. Demand
will be 133.86 million, indicating a shortfall instead of a
surplus, agency data showed. A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132
pounds.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 1.5 percent to
23.08 cents a pound on ICE. The price, down 1.4 percent this
week, has dropped 28 percent in 2011.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell 2.3 percent to $2,101
a metric ton. The commodity, up 1.6 percent this week, has
slumped 31 percent in 2011.  In London futures trading, robusta coffee and cocoa
dropped, while refined sugar climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
