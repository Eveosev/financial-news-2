Gold and the  Swiss franc  are no
longer safe havens for investors seeking protection from
financial market turmoil, according to a UBS AG wealth
management unit.  “As we enter 2012, neither gold nor the Swiss franc
retains a safe haven status,” Alexander Friedman, Zurich-based
chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said in a
monthly report yesterday.  Intervention by the  Swiss National Bank  to cap the franc’s
gains this year and rising volatility in gold have removed the
two from the safe-haven assets list, according to the report. At
the start of 2011 investors considered gold, the Swiss franc,
the  U.S. dollar , U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds
as safe havens, UBS said.  Bullion’s 100-day volatility is at the highest since April
16, 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gold for
immediate delivery, up 12 percent in  London  this year, fell as
much as 7.5 percent on an intraday basis on Sept. 26 and as much
as 4.2 percent on Dec. 14.  Still, investment in bullion makes sense as a protection
against currency debasement and as negative real interest rates
reduce the opportunity cost of owning gold, UBS said.  “Investors should not, however, buy gold expecting it to
act as a safe haven during severe, liquidity-driven market sell-
offs,” Friedman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
