A former  Texas  judge was accused by
the U.S. of taking bribes in 2007 in exchange for his vote to
refinance about $40 million in El Paso County debt and replace a
county financial adviser.  The ex-judge, Antonio Guillermo Cobos, 44, was charged with
three counts of conspiracy and fraud, Robert Pitman, the U.S.
attorney in  San Antonio , said today in a statement. If
convicted, Cobos faces as long as 20 years in prison on each of
the counts, according to Pitman.  “The citizens of El Paso County expect, and are entitled,
to have their elected representatives make decisions on the
basis of the merits of what they are voting on, not whether or
how they can personally benefit,” Pitman said in the statement.  Daryl Fields, a spokesman for Pitman, couldn’t immediately
provide the name of Cobos’s lawyer.  The indictment of Cobos and a co-defendant was the eighth
one in a  Federal Bureau of Investigation  probe that began in
2004, according to the statement.  The case is U.S. v. Cobos, 11-3019, U.S. District Court,
Western District of  Texas  (El Paso).  To contact the reporter on this story:
