Gunmen shot dead the editor of a
newspaper critical of the authorities in the conflict-wracked
southern Russian region of Dagestan, officials said.  Khadzhimurad Kamalov, 46, who founded the weekly
publication  Chernovik , was killed outside the newspaper’s office
in the regional capital of Makhachkala yesterday, the Moscow-
based Investigative Committee  said  on its website today.  Kamalov’s death may be related to his professional
activities, the investigative committee said. Police battling an
Islamist insurgency in Dagestan are using security tactics that
are exacerbating grievances linked to unemployment and
corruption, according to Alexei Malashenko, an analyst with the
Carnegie Moscow Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
