China National Petroleum Corp ., the
country’s biggest oil and gas producer, will stick to plans to
keep expanding internationally, chairman Jiang Jiemin said.  The group is “firmly” committed to its strategy of
increasing overseas production, Jiemin said, according to a
 statement  posted on CNPC’s website today. He is also the
chairman of its listed arm,  PetroChina Co. (857)   Chinese  oil companies  are spreading out globally to buy
resources and meet the country’s growing demands for energy.
CNPC’s operations in Sudan have drawn criticism from the U.S.
and Europe for allegedly ignoring the African country’s
humanitarian crisis.  CNPC units should respect the laws and cultures of the
countries where they have operations, Jiemin said, in comments
to staff in its international exploration and service units.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
