Duvvuri Subbarao, governor of the
 Reserve Bank  of  India , speaks on  interest rates  after the
central bank today left the  repurchase rate  unchanged at 8.5
percent. The decision matched all 14 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Subbbarao spoke to reporters in Mumbai.  “We’ve taken into account the inflation situation and the
moderation in growth. For the moment we’ve decided to stay with
the repurchase rate as it is and have also retained the cash
reserve ratio where it is.  ‘‘We will manage liquidity through open market operations,
should there be a constraint.  ‘‘The rupee is putting pressure on inflation, which we have
acknowledged in the statement.  ‘‘I cannot really speculate on when we might start cutting
rates but certainly that is an action on the way forward.  ‘‘We are concerned about growth moderating.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
