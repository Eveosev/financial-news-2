Representative Pete Sessions, a
 Texas  Republican, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that
Congress is likely to approve only a months-long extension of an
expiring payroll-tax cut.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Congressman Pete Sessions
of Texas, chairman of the National Republican House Campaign
Committee.  Thank you for joining us in the studio. Mr. Chairman, let’s
start with the payroll tax. It looks like Congress is going to
get through an omnibus spending bill before you go home for
Christmas, but the payroll tax is still hanging out there with a
lot of things on it. Will you get a payroll tax extension? Or
will it be a short, two-month extension or nothing?  REPRESENTATIVE PETE SESSIONS: I think what it’s going to
have to be is a realistic approach for us to understand that we
need to do something for the American people. Their take-home
pay is very important. The economics of employment are not
working by the president. And  House Republicans  want to make
sure -  HUNT: So what’s going to happen?  SESSIONS: We’re going to have to find a way to cut a deal,
as you know, because the Republican ideas and the president’s
ideas.  HUNT: So you think there will be a compromise? Will it be
long-term or short-term?  SESSIONS: I think it will be short-term.  HUNT: Short-term. Let me ask you this, though. You just -
back in September, you called the payroll tax a “horrible idea”
and said your candidates would have no difficulty explaining why
they want the tax to expire, the tax holiday. Why - why the
change of mind?  SESSIONS: Well, I didn’t change my mind. It is a bad idea.
But when you combine that with something else - for instance,
when we voted the extension of the tax cuts - when you mirror
that with something that’s a job stimulus, an economic growth
package, then it’s a good deal.  (CROSSTALK)  SESSIONS: Now is the wrong time - now is the wrong time to
have the American worker take home less pay.  HUNT: So what has to go in it as part of a deal for the
Republicans?  SESSIONS: Well, I think -  HUNT: I mean, what’s the bottom line? Not what you - you
know, you desire, but what’s the bottom line?  SESSIONS: Job growth. How about Keystone pipeline?  HUNT: So you won’t support anything that doesn’t have
Keystone pipeline in it?  SESSIONS: I won’t support something that does not show job
growth and the development -  HUNT: Could you support something that doesn’t have
Keystone pipeline in it?  SESSIONS: I’ll support something that’s about job growth.
That’s what we need. We need jobs in this country.  HUNT: So Keystone pipeline is not the all-litmus test?  SESSIONS: It may not be, but we are paying more in
unemployment compensation than we’re receiving revenue from
employers, and that is a bad sign for America.  HUNT: Let’s put on your campaign hat for a minute. The
Democrats, through October, are out - House Democrats are out
raising the Republicans - not by much, $3.4 million or
something. The party that doesn’t control the House almost never
out raises the incumbent party. Why are they doing so much
better?  SESSIONS: Let’s give credit to  Nancy Pelosi . She is out all
over this country talking to the left wing of this country. They
love her. She used to be the - before she was a member of
Congress, the national finance chairman for the Democrat
campaign committee. She knows where -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: So why isn’t John Boehner or Kevin McCarthy talking
to the right wing of the  Republican Party ?  SESSIONS: Well, why is John Boehner out talking every
weekend and raising money? John is doing that.  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But he’s not doing as well as - he’s not doing as
well as Nancy Pelosi.  SESSIONS: It’s hard to do it full time. That’s what Nancy’s
doing.  HUNT: OK.  SESSIONS: We’re trying to, with John Boehner and  Eric
Cantor , we’re trying to run the  House of Representatives  from a
perspective of trying to make sure we’re about regular order,
getting good legislation, talking to people, and making sure
that we’re working with this White House on things that are
good.  HUNT: But I checked. There are challengers - Democratic
challengers,  Arizona ,  New York , New Hampshire, they’re out
raising Republican incumbents. That’s pretty unusual, isn’t it?  SESSIONS: It is not unusual, because we’ve spent a lot of
time in Washington focusing on trying to grow the economy. We’ll
be just fine. We’re a couple million behind. You watch us.  HUNT: OK. Your finance chairman, Vern Buchanan of  Florida ,
is under federal investigation for alleged campaign violations,
nothing proved and nothing charged, even. The House Ethics
Committee is looking at him, too. Should he step aside until
this is resolved?  SESSIONS: Vern Buchanan has been forthright and brought the
information to the committee and to the Department of Justice
himself. He gave the information to them. I have looked at this
in detail. Who knows what will eventually turn up?  HUNT: But it’s -  SESSIONS: I have confidence in Vern Buchanan. He is not the
issue. The issue is the ability to resolve quickly what he
brought to the committee and to the Department of Justice. He’s
the one that provided the information, by the way, publicly
about this.  HUNT: OK.  SESSIONS: He’s being forthright, and I’m very proud of
Vern.  HUNT: Let me ask you about the Republican brand name. It
was pretty darn good in October and November of 2010. It has
really dropped in every single poll, NBC, Pew, CBS. I mean, I’ve
looked at all of them, and the Republican brand name has dropped
considerably. It’s in worse shape than the Democratic brand
name. Why? And does it matter?  SESSIONS: The brand name of Republican is drawing a lot of
attention and focus because of our presidential candidates who
are talking. Many times they’re talking about big, new, great
ideas. Many times they’re attacking each other. I think the
American people -  HUNT: And that’s why the brand name has gone down?  SESSIONS: I think - I think across the country, you know,
this opportunity to support our ideas is really helping, but the
opportunity to attack each other - we’ve had a candidate up for
two or three weeks and then a candidate down for two or three
weeks. We’ll get our footing real quickly.  HUNT: When you look at your House candidates - I know
you’re neutral in the presidential race - does it matter who the
nominee is? Does one candidate conceivably help down-ticket more
than the other or hurt down-ticket more?  SESSIONS: I think what matters is that we get a candidate
that is for growing our economy, making sure that we tame this
 Washington  spending, and perhaps, most of all, listening to the
American people on goals for our generation that we can achieve.
And I think the president is in trouble when we get a good
Republican who can tout -  HUNT: And you don’t see -  SESSIONS:  - how we will move our economy.  HUNT: And you don’t see any difference, really, as far as
being able to do that among the major candidates?  SESSIONS: I think our major contenders right now -  Newt
Gingrich  understands exactly how to get this done, and so does
 Mitt Romney . They’ve both proven it, and Mitt Romney grew a lot
of jobs.  HUNT: Let me ask you this. The frontrunner in polls is Newt
Gingrich. The Republicans also say that they are the party of
family values. Indeed, you’re a member of the Values Action Team
in the House. Newt Gingrich’s personal past, two divorces,
acknowledged adultery, not paying child support. Does that make
it hard to have a standard-bearer of a party claiming to be the
party of family values?  SESSIONS: If you look at Newt and his service to this great
nation and his responsibilities that he has had over the period
of time, I think Newt - if you look at him in aggregate or in
the substance behind him, he deeply believes in the value of the
American people, our family values system, which is directly
related to growing jobs and having families be responsible for
their own problems.  HUNT: Do you think that Newt Gingrich personifies family
values?  SESSIONS: You know, what - what I would say is that Newt
Gingrich is going to go sell himself across the country. And if
he effectively does that, he can become our nominee.  HUNT: And the past doesn’t matter?  SESSIONS: I think all pasts matter. But what I do think,
it’s where we’re going to head and where we’re going to grow.
And whether it’s Jack Kennedy or  Bill Clinton  or others, the
personal lives do come into play, and people do judge you for
that. Our country needs someone who can lead and lead
effectively to the betterment of the American dream. And Newt
Gingrich is pretty good at that.  HUNT: Steve  Israel , your counterpart, was on this show last
week, and he said the Democrats will pick up at least 20 House
seats and it’ll be nip and tuck as to whether it’s 25.  SESSIONS: The day before last year’s election, the
Democrats were touting they were going to keep the majority. I
look at the polling. I see it just as much as Steve does.
They’re in trouble. Republicans will hold the House, zero chance
we’re going to lose it.  HUNT: OK, he gave me his prediction. Will you pick? Will
you actually gain seats? Or will you lose just a few?  SESSIONS: I’ve been saying for quite some time, publicly,
plus 16. We’re going to pick up seats across this country. You
know, if you look at where we are in  Illinois , if you look at
where we are in  North Carolina , if you look at where we are in
 Arkansas , and  Oklahoma , we’re picking up those incumbent seats.
And watch us in  Utah .  HUNT: All right, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much.  SESSIONS: You bet.  HUNT: And when we come back, the Iraq war officially ends
and the Republican race gets heated, as the Iowa caucuses near.
