Spain’s Instituto de Credito Oficial
is adding at least 500 million euros to its bonds due January
2014, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  The bonds will be priced to yield 75 basis points more than
Spanish government debt, the person said.  Bankinter SA (BKT)  and
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  are managing the re-opening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
