Citadele Banka AS, the state-owned
Latvian retail lender formed from Parex Banka, was downgraded by
Moody’s Investors Service on deteriorating asset quality and low
capital levels.  Moody’s cut Citadele’s long-term deposit rating to B2 from
Ba3 and assigned a negative outlook, the London-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Citadele was split from Parex, once the Baltic nation’s
second-biggest lender, after a run on deposits triggered a
government rescue in 2008.  “The downgrade reflects the continued deterioration in
asset quality since the bank’s inception,” Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
