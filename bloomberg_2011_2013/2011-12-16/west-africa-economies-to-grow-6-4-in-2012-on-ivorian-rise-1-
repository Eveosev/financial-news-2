Growth in the eight-member West
African Economic and Monetary Union is forecast at 6.4 percent
next year as  Ivory Coast  recovers from a post-election crisis
that stalled output in the goup’s biggest economy.  The projection for 2011 projection is 1.2 percent, Tiemoko Meyliet Kone, governor of the regional central bank, told
reporters in Niamey, Niger’s capital, today.  Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, was mired in a
five-month crisis that followed a disputed November 2010
presidential election.  As conflict flared, landlocked countries including Burkina
Faso, Niger and Mali struggled to maintain trade at Ivory
Coast’s main port of Abidjan, leading to domestic shortages and
a halt in exports of their own goods.  Ivory Coast’s recovery is “faster than expected,” Kone
said. The union had forecast 2011 regional growth at 1 percent,
he added.  Concern about the European debt crisis and the  U.S. economy 
add to “increased uncertainties in the economies of the
WAEMU,” Kone said.  Togo, Mali, Niger, Ivory Coast,  Burkina Faso ,  Senegal ,
Benin and Guinea-Bissau use the common CFA franc currency, which
is pegged to the euro and has weakened 11 percent since July and
traded at 503.27 per dollar by 11:09 a.m. in Abidjan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
