Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the health insurer that
gets about three-quarters of its sales in  Japan , will continue
to beat goals in that country, said Chief Executive Officer Dan
Amos.  “We have achieved all of our targets and our sales are
actually running way ahead of target, as we said in the third
quarter, and we expect them to continue,” Amos told  Tom Keene 
and Ken Prewitt during an interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” today.  Customers who bought policies through banks drove a 14
percent gain in Japanese sales for the nine months ended Sept.
30, Aflac said last week. The world’s biggest provider of
policies supplementing work and government health coverage has
prospered as the Japanese market has “pretty much gone back to
normal” since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, Amos said.  “It’s amazing, the adaptability of the Japanese and how
they were able to transform,” Amos said. “We as Americans
would find this more difficult.”  Aflac rose 1 percent to 41.61 at 11:10 a.m. in  New York .
The Columbus, Georgia-based firm has gained 19 percent since
Sept. 30, the third-best performance in the seven-company
Standard and Poor’s 500 Life & Health Insurance Index behind
Torchmark Corp. and Lincoln National Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
