European  stocks retreated after
 Standard & Poor’s  said the region’s economies may see a larger
contraction in 2012, outweighing a report that showed U.S.
inflation remains in check.  PSA Peugeot Citroen and Fiat SpA led a gauge of carmakers
lower.  Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s largest hedge fund, fell 4.4
percent after Deutsche Bank AG recommended selling the stock.
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  led mining shares higher, both
jumping more than 3 percent.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  declined 0.4 percent
to 233.71 at the close in  London . The gauge declined 2.8 percent
this week on concern euro-area policy makers are struggling to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  Stocks erased earlier gains after the S&P said the
Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Finland may see their
gross domestic products suffering larger contraction next year.
The austerity measures adopted across the euro region will imply
that there won’t be any fiscal support for growth, it said.  National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets. France’s CAC 40 lost 0.9 percent,  Germany ’s
DAX dropped 0.5 percent and the U.K. FTSE 100 declined 0.3
percent.  U.S. Inflation  The cost of living in the U.S. stagnated in November as
gasoline prices dropped, supporting the  Federal Reserve ’s view
that inflation remains in check.  The unchanged reading in the consumer-price index last
month followed a 0.1 percent decline the prior month, a report
from the Labor Department showed today in  Washington . That
compares with a 0.1 percent increase forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 82 economists. So-called core prices, which
exclude food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent, more than
forecast, reflecting higher medical care and clothing costs.  “The core rates have climbed, but they’re still in a range
in which the American central bank doesn’t see a need for
immediate action,” Viola Stork, an analyst at Helaba Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail.  In  Italy , Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government won a
confidence vote in Parliament on a 30 billion-euro ($39 billion)
emergency budget plan aimed at spurring growth and cutting the
euro-area’s second-biggest debt. A final vote will be held in
the lower house at 7:30 p.m., and then the package will pass to
the Senate, which will decide on it on Dec. 23.  Carmakers Decline  Peugeot dropped 1.7 percent to 11.81 euros and  Fiat SpA (F) 
declined 2.6 percent to 3.43 euros, after the two companies led
the biggest decline in European car sales in five months.
Michelin & Cie., the world’s second-largest tire maker, lost 2.9
percent to 42.94 euros.  Faurecia (EO)  SA,  Europe ’s biggest maker of
car interiors, retreated 4.4 percent to 12.88 euros.  Registrations in November fell 3 percent to 1.07 million
vehicles from 1.10 million a year earlier, the biggest decline
since June, the Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers
Association, or ACEA, said today.  Man Group slid 4.4 percent to 127.6 pence after Deutsche
Bank cut the stock to “sell” from “buy.”  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  slumped 4.5 percent to 184.9 pence, its
lowest price since its listing in May 2010. Etablissements
Maurel & Prom SA retreated 5.7 percent to 11.03 euros. Credit
Suisse Group AG analysts led by Edward Westlake cut their price
estimates for European integrated  oil companies , citing
“challenging” downstream business environment.  SAP, Commodity Shares  SAP AG (SAP)  lost 2.6 percent to 42.25 euros. The Financial Times
Deutschland reported that the software maker doesn’t plan any
major acquisitions after the takeover of SuccessFactors Inc.,
which was the company’s “big purchase.” The newspaper cited
 Bill McDermott , SAP’s co-chief executive officer.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  gained 2.3 percent to 970 pence and Kazakhmys
added 3.2 percent to 874 pence as copper and other base metals
rose on the London Metal Exchange. Antofagasta jumped 3.7
percent to 1,172 pence. Rio Tinto Group Plc, the world’s second-
biggest mining company, climbed 1 percent to 3,060 pence.  Klepierre (LI)  SA, Europe’s second-largest shopping-center
owner, increased 6 percent to 20.65 euros after Chief Executive
Officer Laurent Morel said he expects a “good Christmas” for
his company, and this may make up for a second half of 2011 that
hasn’t been as strong as the first half.  Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German chemical maker spun off from Bayer
AG in 2005, rose 2.2 percent to 37.11 euros after Morgan Stanley
raised the shares to “overweight” from “equal weight.”  Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (PGS) , the world’s third-biggest
surveyor of oil and gas fields, rallied 6.5 percent to 58.20
kroner after it predicted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization will rise to the range of $650
million to $700 million in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
