Palm oil  climbed, paring a weekly
decline, on concern that dry weather in  South America  may lower
soybean output and tighten edible oil supplies.  The March-delivery contract, the most active by volume,
gained as much as 1.2 percent to 3,007 ringgit ($946) a metric
on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange and was at 3,005 ringgit at
11:59 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . The commodity, set for a 2.6 percent
decline this week, has lost 21 percent this year.  Areas of eastern and central Argentina got as little as 40
percent of normal rainfall in the 30 days through Dec. 14,
according to QT Weather. The country will remain dry until Dec.
20, when storms may bring about 0.75 inch (1.9 centimeters) of
precipitation, QT meteorologist  Allen Motew  said. The soybean
crop may fall short of government estimates unless more rain
falls, according to Grupo Los Grobo LLC, a producer.  “Weather in Argentina has been a concern for the soybean
crop,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said
by phone from Singapore. “Forecast of some flooding in the main
plantation areas in Malaysia during the weekend are also
supporting the prices.”  Production declined 14.8 percent to 1.6 million tons in
November from a month earlier after the peak-harvest season
ended, the  Malaysian Palm Oil Board  said on Dec. 13. Stockpiles
declined 1.5 percent to 2.1 million tons, while exports shrank
9.9 percent to 1.7 million tons, the board said.  Soybeans gained the most in more than two weeks yesterday
to $11.2125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The March-
delivery contract was 0.5 percent higher at $11.2675 at 11:46
a.m. in  Singapore  today.  Soybean oil , a direct substitute for
palm oil, gained 0.5 percent to 49.60 cents a pound, extending a
1.2 percent rally yesterday.  Palm oil for delivery in May rose as much as 0.8 percent to
7,848 yuan ($1,236) per ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and
soybean oil for September delivery climbed as much as 0.8
percent to 8,786 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
