The guarantee limit of 211 billion
euros ($275 billion) accepted by Germany to underpin  Europe â€™s
temporary bailout fund may rise if the  International Monetary
Fund  supplements the rescue facility, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing the Bundesbank.  Repayment of IMF loans has priority over obligations to
other creditors in a solvency crisis, the newspaper said. This
may mean German taxpayers will face a higher guarantee ceiling
if the Bundesbank transfers a planned 45 billion euros to the
IMF, FTD said, without naming any Bundesbank officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
