Gold rebounded, trimming the worst
weekly loss since September, as positive economic data from the
U.S. eased demand for the dollar as a haven. Silver, platinum
and palladium advanced.  Immediate-delivery gold rose for the first day in five,
gaining as much as 0.7 percent to $1,580.77 an ounce and trading
at $1,579.98 at 8:54 a.m. in  Singapore . This week, the metal has
lost 7.7 percent, the biggest slump since Sept. 23. February-
delivery gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,581.70 on the Comex.  The fewest U.S. workers in three years filed claims for
jobless benefits last week, according to  data issued yesterday ,
indicating that the world’s largest economy may be strengthening
heading into 2012. The dollar fell as much as 0.6 percent
yesterday, also weakening as European funding stress eased.  “Gold looks to have had a little bounce after the dollar
pulled back,”  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets
in Sydney, said by phone today. “Bullion’s dramatic decline
earlier this week means it should now be at a pretty solid base
and will have more upside potential.”  Gold reached a record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6 as investors
sought to diversify away from equities and some currencies amid
concerns that economic growth may slow and the  euro zone  may
fragment. Since then, it’s lost 18 percent, nearing the 20
percent drop seen by some investors as defining a  bear market .  Holdings in  exchange-traded products  backed by bullion
dropped from a record yesterday, losing 0.6 percent to 2,347.51
metric tons, according to Bloomberg data. That was the biggest
one-day decline since Aug. 24.  Spot silver rose 1 percent to $29.445 an ounce, extending
yesterday’s 0.9 percent advance. Spot platinum climbed 0.2
percent to $1,410 an ounce, rising for the first day in five.
Palladium gained as much as 0.7 percent to $623.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
