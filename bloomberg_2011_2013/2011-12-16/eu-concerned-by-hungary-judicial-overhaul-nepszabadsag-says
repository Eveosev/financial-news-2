The European Commission has
“serious concerns” about  Hungary ’s judicial overhaul,
including the ouster of the country’s Supreme Court Chief
Justice,  Nepszabadsag reported , citing a letter from Justice
Commissioner Viviane Reding to the Hungarian government.  The European Union executive is concerned about judicial
independence in Hungary as a result of the concentration of
power in the hands of the director of the newly created National
Judicial Agency and the reduction of the  retirement age  for
judges by eight years at a time when the government plans to
raise the general retirement age, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
