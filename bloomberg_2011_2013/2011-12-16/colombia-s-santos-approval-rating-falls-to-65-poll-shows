Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos ’s approval rating fell to 65 percent in December from 67
percent last month as heavier-than-average rain caused mudslides
and flooding, according to a  poll  by Gallup  Colombia  published
in La Republica newspaper.  Colombia’s weather agency said earlier this week that rains
will persist through the first quarter because of the La Nina
weather pattern, which triggers above-average rainfall in the
South American country. The rains have caused the death of more
than 100 people since September.  Gallup interviewed 1,200 citizens in Colombia’s five
biggest cities from Dec. 3 to Dec. 10. The poll has a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points, La Republica
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
