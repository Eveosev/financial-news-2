Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  plans to seek
binding commitments to transport oil on its proposed Westward Ho
pipeline after receiving enough interest from shippers, the
company said in a  statement .  Shell plans to conduct an open season for commitments in
early 2012 to ship on the 30-inch line that would run from St.
James, Louisiana, to the Port Neches/Nederland, Texas, area, the
company said.  The Westward Ho line, which would ship around 600,000
barrels a day, may be completed and commissioned by early 2015,
according to Shell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
