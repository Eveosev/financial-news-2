Canadian natural gas fell for a
second day on mild weather and above-normal stocks of the fuel.  Alberta  gas dropped 0.6 percent. Weather Derivatives of
Belton,  Missouri , said heating demand across the U.S., where
most of Canada’s output is consumed, will trail normal by 17
percent through Dec. 23. Warm weather has pared declines in U.S.
inventories since November.  “For the week ended Dec. 9 there was a 102 billion-cubic-
foot withdrawal compared to a normal withdrawal of 162
billion,” James Williams, an economist with WTRG Economics in
 London ,  Arkansas , said in a note to clients today. “For the
latest four-week period withdrawals typically total 265 billion.
This year net withdrawals are 114 billion.”  Alberta gas for January delivery slipped 1.75 cents to
C$2.89 a gigajoule ($2.64 per million British thermal units) as
of 1:30 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.
NGX Alberta gas has fallen 21 percent this year.  Gas for January delivery dropped 1.4 cents to $3.113 per
million Btu at 1:35 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 50 million below its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.46 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.1 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 883 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.77 billion cubic feet today, about 69 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.07
billion cubic feet at 12:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
