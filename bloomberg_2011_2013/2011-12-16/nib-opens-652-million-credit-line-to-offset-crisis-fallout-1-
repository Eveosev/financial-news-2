The Nordic Investment Bank , a
supranational lender, will “temporarily” increase lending as
the financial turmoil chokes off credit from banks.  The bank set up a new loan program, the NIB Refinancing
Facility, of 500 million euros ($652 million), according to a
statement today. NIB is owned by  Denmark , Estonia,  Finland ,
Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania,  Norway  and Sweden.  The program is aimed at counterparts with refinancing needs
for recently completed projects, NIB said. Loans under the plan
are to be made on “normal terms,” although maturities can be
shorter, starting “from three years and up,” NIB said.  “The economic and financial crisis has adversely affected
the supply of credit in the Nordic-Baltic region,” Johnny Akerholm, the bank’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “The consequences are felt especially in NIB’s focus
sectors, which are vital for long-term sustainable growth.”  NIB, owned 77 percent by top-rated  Sweden , Norway and
Denmark, said this week it may raise bond sales as much as 17
percent next year to 3.5 billion euros ($4.6 billion), tapping
demand from central banks and financial institutions in need of
AAA liquid assets. The bank makes long-term loans to projects in
energy, transport and infrastructure industries, as well as
ventures with environmental goals.  “In this situation, institutions such as NIB, which
continue to have good access to funding, can provide an
important, complementary role in maintaining critical financing
flows,” Aakerholm said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
