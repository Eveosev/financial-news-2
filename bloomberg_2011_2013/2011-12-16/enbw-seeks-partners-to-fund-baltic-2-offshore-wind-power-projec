EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,
Germany’s third-largest utility, is seeking partners to help
finance a wind farm it’s planning in the  Baltic Sea .  EnBW has offered almost half of the 288-megawatt Baltic 2
wind park, north of the German island of Ruegen, to municipal
utilities and other investors, it said today in an e-mailed
statement, without valuing the project. The company aims to sign
contracts with partners and start construction by mid-2012.  The utility is looking to bolster project funds after
reporting a 552 million-euro ($722 million) loss in the first
nine months of the year. EnBW and its German peers have seen
earnings drop since Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered the closure
of eight reactors in March in response to the Fukushima crisis.  A total of 19 municipal utilities invested in EnBW’s Baltic
1 wind farm, the Stuttgart-based company said. EnBW is seeking
to install about 3,000 megawatts of renewable generation
capacity by the end of the decade, it said.  Germany ’s largest utilities are EON AG and RWE AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
