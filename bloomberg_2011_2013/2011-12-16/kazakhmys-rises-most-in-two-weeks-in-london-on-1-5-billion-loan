Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) ,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
copper producer, gained the most in two weeks in London trading
after signing a $1.5 billion loan accord with China Development
Bank Corp. to finance the producer’s Aktogay mine.  Kazakhmys rose as much as 4.6 percent, the most since Dec.
2. The accord signed today gives Kazakhmys access to the funds
for three years after completing the Aktogay feasibility study
by the end of 2012, the company said in a statement.  The producer plans to raise output by about 60 percent
to 500,000 metric tons in 2015 by developing the Bozshakol and
Aktogay mines. The company secured a $2.7 billion loan from the
Chinese bank in December 2009 to develop the Bozshakol mine and
fund some mid-sized projects, it said in the statement.  “This stock looks markedly undervalued in relation to its
peers,” Louise Collinge, a London-based analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd., wrote in a note today. ``We reiterate our 
`add' recommendation and our 1,260-pence target price.''  Kazakhmys rose 4.3 percent to 883 pence by 10:10 a.m. in
 London , paring its loss for the year to 45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
