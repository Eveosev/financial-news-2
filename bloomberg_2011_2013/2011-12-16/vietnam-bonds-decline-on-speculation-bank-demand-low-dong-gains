Vietnam ’s government  bonds  declined
on speculation demand from banks is dropping as the end of the
year approaches. The dong strengthened.  Vietnam Development Bank, a state-owned lender that raises
funds for government projects, is offering 1 trillion dong ($48
million) of three-year bonds and 900 billion dong of five-year
notes today, according to a statement on the Hanoi Stock
Exchange. The auction results will be available later today.  “Demand for bonds is pretty low these days since many
banks have halted bond investment ahead of the year-end,” said
Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year bond climbed two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.46 percent, according to
a daily fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Three-
year yields  rose for a second day, adding four basis points to
12.50 percent.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,982 per dollar, according
to data from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set
the  reference rate  at 20,813 per dollar, unchanged since Dec. 14,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to fluctuate
by as much as 1 percent on either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact reporter on this story:
