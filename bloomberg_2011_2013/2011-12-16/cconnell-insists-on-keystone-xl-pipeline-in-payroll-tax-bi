U.S. Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  said he will insist that any bill to extend the
payroll tax cut must also include language expediting
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL pipeline from  Canada .  “I will not be able to support a package that does not
include the pipeline,” McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on
the Senate floor today in  Washington .  His party has the ability to block Democratic proposals in
the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
