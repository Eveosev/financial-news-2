The Polish zloty’s appreciation to 4
per euro at the end of next year is “very realistic,” Deputy
Finance Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said in parliament in Warsaw
today.  The  Finance Ministry  has entered into foreign currency swap
transactions this year for a “much smaller” sum than the 4.3
billion euro amount from 2010, he said. The swaps will not
impact public debt calculations, according to Radziwill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
