Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. (BK)  and  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  were sued by U.S. Bank NA over
control of $2.27 million in escrowed collateral.  U.S. Bank, based in Cincinnati, wants a judge to order the
defendants to resolve their disputes over the money between
themselves and to prohibit them from suing U.S. Bank over it,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan.  Unless the dispute is resolved, “U.S. Bank will have to
continue to hold the escrowed funds,” though it has “no
interest” in the money except for legal fees, the bank said in
the complaint.  Barclays, based in London, and BNY Mellon are holders of
notes secured by collateral consisting of bundled commercial
mortgage loans and other assets, according to court papers.  Also named in the lawsuit is Angelo, Gordon & Co. of  New
York , a collateral manager under a 2007 agreement, according to
court papers.  Brandon Ashcraft, a Barclays spokesman; Kevin Heine, a BNY
Mellon spokesman; and Kevin Brown, a spokesman for Armonk, New
York-based MBIA, declined to comment on the complaint.  The case is U.S. Bank v. Barclays, 11CV9199, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
