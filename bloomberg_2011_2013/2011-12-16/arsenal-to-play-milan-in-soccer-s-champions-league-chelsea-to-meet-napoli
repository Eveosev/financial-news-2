Defending champion Barcelona will
play  Bayer Leverkusen  and AC Milan faces Arsenal in the
 Champions League  after today’s draw for the round of 16.  Chelsea, the only other English team left after Manchester
City and  Manchester United  were eliminated, meets Napoli. Record
nine-time champion Real Madrid travels to Moscow for the first
of its two-match showdown with CSKA.  “We have to break our bad tradition with Arsenal and
especially with England clubs,” Milan director Umberto Gandini
said after the teams were paired. Milan, a seven-time champion,
was eliminated by the Gunners the last time the teams met in
2008. “It’s an exciting fixture and we are very determined.”  Arsenal’s run against Italian teams means it will enter
the matches with conviction, said club secretary  David Miles .
“We have a good record against Italian clubs, having knocked
out Roma and Inter, including a 5-1 win in San Siro. It’s going
to be tough but we’re confident,” he said.  Chelsea, a finalist in 2008, faces in Napoli a team that
finished ahead of Premier League leader  Manchester City  in the
group phase.  Inter Milan , champion two seasons ago, plays Marseille and
Cyprus’ APOEL will play Lyon. Zenit  St. Petersburg  takes on
Benfica and Basel, which eliminated Manchester United, hosts
 Bayern Munich .  The two-game round, which matches the winners and runners-
up of the group stage, will be played in February and March. The
runners-up host the opening match, with the group winners hosting
the deciding game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
