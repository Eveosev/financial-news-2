Azerbaijan ’s oil and natural-gas
exports declined in the first 10 months from a year earlier
following a slump in  output , according to the State Statistics
Committee.  Crude exports slumped 11 percent to 33.6 million metric
tons, while gas exports fell 2 percent to 5.4 billion cubic
meters, a State Statistics Committee official said today by
phone from Baku, the Caspian nation’s capital, declining to be
identified because of the agency’s policy.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , pumped 39 million tons of oil during the period, a
9 percent decline from a year earlier, and 21.6 billion cubic
meters of  gas , down 2.5 percent, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
