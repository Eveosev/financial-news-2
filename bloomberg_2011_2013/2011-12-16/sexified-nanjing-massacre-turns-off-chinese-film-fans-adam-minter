How do you eroticize a massacre? The marketing campaign for the new Chinese film “ The Flowers of War ,” a historical epic set against the bleak backdrop of the  1937 Nanjing Massacre , provides some instruction. In the build-up to its Dec. 16 release in  China , the film’s producers have promoted it via sexually-charged articles and images that have roiled Chinese audiences and critics more accustomed to somber  memorials  of the dark event. Earlier this week, Ma Xiaolin, the influential founder of  blshe.com , a blogging platform favored by Chinese intellectuals,  asked a question  on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, that summarizes the Chinese public’s sentiment about the film: Alas, most Western critics are oblivious to the backlash that the film’s eroticized marketing of rape and murder has produced in China. Instead, they have seen the film as an Oscar contender. It has an almost irresistible combo package for Hollywood’s awards season: a gripping subject matter; a $100 million budget; British Oscar-winning actor  Christian Bale ; and China’s most revered director,  Zhang Yimou . On Dec. 15, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated it for a Golden Globe in the  Best Foreign Language Film  category. This ostensibly “serious” film revolves around Bale's character,  John Miller , an American mortician, who arrives in Nanjing to bury a local priest just as Nanjing falls to Japanese soldiers. Miller takes refuge in a cathedral with a gaggle of teenage schoolgirls. Soon after, they are joined by thirteen of Nanjing’s finest, kind-hearted prostitutes -- the “flowers” referenced in the film’s title. Miller, who early on learns that the Japanese won’t mess with a Westerner, dons the late priest’s collar, becomes Father John and, in a cataclysmic climax, proves that he –- and the prostitutes -– are capable of selfless acts of courage. And along the way, in a scene that has been central to the film’s marketing efforts, Bale's character sleeps with one of the prostitutes, played by the young Chinese actress, Ni Ni. Zhang Yimou is not the first director to attempt to thread complex human emotions and impulses through a film set against a massacre. Stephen Spielberg faced the same delicate balance in making his holocaust epic “ Schindler’s List ” -- a film to which “The Flowers of War” is occasionally  compared . Few, if any, doubted the sincerity of Spielberg’s intentions in making and promoting his film. To the Chinese public, however, Zhang’s intentions are in question: Instead of marking the Nanjing Massacre with reverence, Zhang and his team seem intent on finding new ways to sexualize it. One of the movie's  promotional posters  features Bale wearing a priest's collar, leering at Ni Ni's chest. Advanced screenings of the film have offered members of the audience  photo opportunities  with thirteen "flowers" wearing form-fitting dresses. And there is the mind-boggling personal essay from Ni Ni that describes her love scene with Bale, helpfully titled, " Bale and I Act a Bed Scene ." Originally written for a  book of essays  about the film, the producers decided to release it before the film premiered to drum up interest. Had “Bale and I Act a Bed Scene” been written for, say, a romantic comedy, it would’ve just been snicker-worthy. But attaching such an essay to a film about one of the great crimes of the 20th century places it in a pantheon of tone-deaf acts of tastelessness. The essay opens with Ni Ni, who was acting in her first feature film, admitting that she was nervous to disrobe for strangers. But she soon embraced her character of Yu Mo, the prostitute who gives in to a night of passion with Bale's character -- never mind the rape and murder occurring outside the church walls. It read: The essay goes on, and becomes much ickier. On Dec. 13, the 74th anniversary of the slaughter,  Zhu Dake , a professor at the Institute for Cultural Criticism at Tongji University -- and one of China’s most respected culture critics -- published a  scathing critique  of “The Flowers of War” in the influential, Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolitan Daily. Zhu did not hold back with his contempt for the marketing of the film -- and producer Zhang Weiping’s demand that  ticket prices  for "The Flowers of War" be the highest in Chinese film history: This sentiment has resonated across Chinese blogs and microblogs. Luo Qi, a citizen of Nanjing,  said  on Weibo: “Nanjing never welcomes people who take that period of history and use it to make money. It is a miserable fact but it is not art!” And in perhaps what is one of the harshest stabs, Xu Gang, a Chinese national and professor at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, asked his friends to avoid the film,  adding : “Even in Hollywood, there are serious movies not controlled by commercial profits. For example, movies about Auschwitz have dealt well with the trauma left by brutal wounds.” The film will be released in the U.S. late next week. Western critics have  questioned  if “The Flowers of War” is actually finely wrought anti-Japanese propaganda. With its Golden Globe nomination, focus will likely turn in the U.S. to whether or not the film will also get an Oscar nod. But the more pertinent question about the film is the one that Hollywood almost never asks: How could anyone think this was in good taste?
