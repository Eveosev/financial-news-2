Youku.com Inc. (YOKU)  and  Tudou Holdings
Ltd. ,  China ’s two largest operators of online video sites, are
accusing each other of intellectual property infringements by
running pirated videos.  Youku is illegally showing the entertainment program series
“Kangxi is Coming,” whose online broadcast rights in China are
owned by Tudou, Yu Bin, vice president of finance at Tudou, said
in a phone interview today. Tudou has violated Youku’s rights on
“more than 60 serials” including “The Emperor’s Harem,”
Youku spokeswoman Jean Shao said in a separate phone interview.  The companies, both listed in New York, compete with each
other by licensing content such as TV programs and films to win
viewers in China, the world’s biggest Internet market by users.
Neither has had an annual profit in at least three years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tudou “completely denies” the infringement allegations by
Youku, Yu said. Youku’s Shao said Tudou’s claims were “unfair
and misleading.”  Tudou’s American depositary receipts  fell  2.5 percent to
$11.25 in  New York  trading yesterday, the lowest since their
debut in August. Youku fell 3.8 percent to $17.18.  An initial public offering by Shanghai-based Tudou in
August raised $174 million after attracting investors including
Sina Corp., operator of China’s most popular microblogging
service. The IPO by Beijing-based Youku raised $233.3 million in
December 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
