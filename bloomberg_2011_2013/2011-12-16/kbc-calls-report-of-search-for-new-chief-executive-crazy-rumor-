KBC Groep NV (KBC) ,  Belgium ’s largest bank
and insurer by market value, dismissed a newspaper report
suggesting that the company might be looking for a new chief
executive officer as a “crazy rumor.”  Geert Noels, co-founder of Belgian financial-services
company Econopolis, has been approached to be Brussels-based
KBC’s CEO,  De Tijd  reported today, without saying how it
obtained the information. The approach was at the initiative of
one or more of KBC’s family shareholders, the newspaper said.  “Looking for a CEO is not on the agenda,” Viviane Huybrecht, a spokeswoman for the bank, said today by telephone,
citing comments by KBC Chairman Thomas Leysen in an interview
published in  L’Echo on Nov. 12 . “His position hasn’t changed”
since the interview, she said.  Noels declined to comment on the report in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News.  KBC CEO Jan Vanhevel was appointed to that post in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
