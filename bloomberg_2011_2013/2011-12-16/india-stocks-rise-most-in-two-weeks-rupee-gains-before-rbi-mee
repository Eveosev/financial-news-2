India ’s benchmark stock index sank
to a 25-month low after the central bank cautioned against risks
to economic growth even as it refrained from raising borrowing
costs for the first time in eight meetings.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the country’s biggest company,
dropped to more than a three-month low.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) ,
the largest engineering company, slumped to a 2 1/2-year low.
The economy is “clearly decelerating,” the  Reserve Bank of
India  said, adding that inflation risks “remain high” and the
“rupee remains under stress.”  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, sank 2.2 percent
to 15,491.35 at the 3.30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the lowest since
Nov. 3, 2009. The gauge has sunk 24 percent this year, the most
among the world’s largest equity markets, as 13 rate increases
since last March and a drop in the rupee to a record low erode
company earnings already threatened by  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “No measures were announced to enhance liquidity or to
boost growth,” said Anita Gandhi, director at  Arihant Capital
Markets Ltd. (ACM)  in Mumbai. “Also, no time line was given on when
the RBI would start to cut  interest rates . The policy guidance
disappointed the street.”  Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  paused after inflation slowed to
a one-year low, industrial output fell for the first time in 28
months and the economy grew last quarter at the weakest pace in
more than two years. Still, a “rate cut is an event some way
ahead,” he told reporters in Mumbai, adding he won’t speculate
when the central bank would begin easing its monetary policy.  Trading Curbs  The rupee, which has lost 15 percent this year, surged as
much as 2.7 percent to 52.21 a dollar earlier today and traded
at 52.78 at 4:34 p.m. The jump followed the central bank’s move
to restrict rupee-forward trading yesterday after the currency
dropped to an all-time low of 54.3050 per dollar. The yield on
the 8.79 percent government note due November 2021 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.43 percent.  While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in an interview with
Bloomberg News this week, said the economy will return to a 9
percent growth pace, analysts are slashing their forecasts for
companies. Bank of America Corp., CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets and
UTI Asset Management Co. say the downgrades will extend into the
2013 fiscal year. The Sensex may sink to 14,500 in the next six
months, according to a Dec. 5 Bank of America report.  Earnings forecasts for Sensex companies for the year to
March 2012 have fallen 7.9 percent to 1,160 rupees per share,
the most since the year ended March 2009, according to about
1,500 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts cut outlooks for
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the country’s biggest car-maker, and
 Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the largest producer of the alloy, by at least
29 percent, the data show.  ‘Decelerating’  “While domestic macros -- investment and consumption --
have been decelerating, the slowdown in global markets is
impacting exports,” said Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees 23
billion rupees ($435 million) as chief investment officer at
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. in Mumbai. “We don’t expect to
see a runaway rally. Markets will watch the macro-economic
environment and focus on news flowing out of global markets.”  While the benchmark wholesale-price inflation slowed to a
one-year low of 9.11 percent in November, it is higher than in
other BRIC nations. Consumer prices rose 6.6 percent in Brazil,
6.8 percent in  Russia  and 4.2 percent in  China  last month.  Overseas funds withdrew $787.1 million from local shares in
November, the most since August, data from the regulator show.
They have pulled out $353 million from stocks this year,
compared with a record inflow of $29.4 billion last year, as
Europe’s worsening debt crisis prompted investors to flee from
assets perceived as risky.  Industrials Sink  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. tumbled 2 percent to 4,651.60. The BSE-200 Index lost
2 percent to 1,874.10, the lowest since August 2009.  As many as 28 of the 30 stocks on the Sensex slid, with
industrials contributing the most to losses, followed by banks,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Reliance tumbled 3.8 percent to 721.85 rupees, the lowest
price since Aug. 26. Larsen & Toubro slumped 5.3 percent to
1,072.65 rupees, the lowest since May 2009.  ITC Ltd. (ITC)  lost 1.9 percent to 195.8 rupees while  Axis Bank
Ltd. (AXSB)  tumbled 4.8 percent to 904.05 rupees, the lowest since Nov.
3, 2009.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the biggest private lender, fell 3.2
percent to 676 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the second-largest, lost
3.7 percent to 415.3 rupees.  Sterlite Industries (STLT)  (India) Ltd., the biggest copper
producer, slumped 4.5 percent to 89.2 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
