McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood
Restaurants Inc. (MSSR)  moved a step closer to being acquired by
 Landry’s Inc.  by settling shareholder lawsuits over the
$131.6 million takeover.  Under the settlement, which requires approval from Delaware
Chancery Court Judge J. Travis Laster, investors will get more
information about the process leading to the $8.75-a-share deal
and the investors’ lawyers will negotiate a fee award with the
companies, according to court documents filed today.  The settlement “shall not be deemed a presumption,
concession or admission by any defendant of any fault, liability
or wrongdoing,” McCormick said in the filing.  McCormick, based in  Portland ,  Oregon , and Houston-based
Landry’s disclosed the offer on Nov. 22, saying McCormick’s
board determined the acquisition was fair and in the best
interests of stockholders.  Matthew Sherman, a spokesman for McCormick, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment on the settlement.  The settlement was reached before a hearing scheduled in
Wilmington today where shareholders who sued seeking a better
price from Landry’s planned to ask Laster to issue an injunction
to block the sale.  McCormick rose 1 cent to $8.73 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 2:57 p.m. in  New York .  The case is In Re McCormick & Schmick’s Shareholder
Litigation, CA7058, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
