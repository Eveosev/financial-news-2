The lira weakened as much as 0.3
percent after a local company bought at least $300 million
today, two traders at Akbank TAS and ING Bank AS said.  The lira depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8816 as of 5:25 p.m.
in Istanbul, raising this week’s decline to 2.1 percent.  “A big local corporation bought around $300 million,”
Burcin Metin, chief currency trader at ING Bank AS, said in e-
mailed comments. Emir Baruh from Akbank TAS concurred and said
the total purchase was between $300 million and $350 million.  Both traders declined to name the corporation buying
dollars.  Turkey ’s central bank sold $150 million today after
offering to sell as much as $250 million for a second day. The
bank in Ankara got $531 million of bids from banks, compared
with $631 million yesterday when it sold $150 million for liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
