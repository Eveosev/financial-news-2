U.K. stocks  fell, extending this
week’s loss for the benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index, as gains in basic-
resources shares failed to offset ongoing concern the euro
area’s debt crisis will worsen.  Man Group Plc dropped 2.3 percent after Deutsche Bank AG
advised selling shares in the hedge-fund manager. Kazakhmys Plc
rose 3.2 percent after saying it has a $1.5 billion loan
facility for a project in Afghanistan.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and
 Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  rallied more than 2 percent as metals rose.  The FTSE 100 retreated 13.51, or 0.3 percent, to 5,387.34
at the close in London, taking this week’s drop to 2.6 percent.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index declined 0.3 percent today and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.7 percent.  Stocks in Europe fell today as  Standard & Poor’s  said the
region’s economies may see a larger contraction in 2012,
outweighing a report that showed U.S. inflation remains in
check. The FTSE 100 has dropped 8.7 percent in 2011 as Greece,
Ireland and Portugal were bailed out and nations from France to
Spain faced higher borrowing costs.  Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government won a
confidence vote in the lower house of parliament today on a 30
billion-euro ($39 billion) austerity and growth package. A final
ballot will be held this evening before the plan passes to the
Senate, which will decide on it on Dec. 23.  Man Group, Essar  Man Group dropped 4.4 percent to 127.6 pence after Deutsche
Bank reduced its recommendation on the company to “sell” from
“buy.” The shares are down 57 percent this year.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  slumped 4.5 percent to 184.9 pence, its
lowest price since its listing in May 2010. Credit Suisse Group
AG analysts led by Edward Westlake cut their price estimates for
European integrated oil companies, citing “challenging”
downstream business environment.  Shanks Group Plc (SKS)  lost 6.3 percent to 95.1 pence after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the waste-management company
to “neutral” from “buy.”  Kazakhmys rose 3.2 percent to 874 pence and Antofagasta
advanced 3.7 percent to 1,172 pence. Xstrata climbed 2.3 percent
to 970 pence. Copper and nickel prices climbed in London.  Sports Direct International Plc (SPD)  surged 11 percent to 210
pence after the retailer dropped an offer to acquire  Blacks
Leisure Group Plc. (BSLA)  Numis Securities Ltd. upgraded the stock to
“buy” from “hold.”  “We are firmly of the view that Sports Direct will
continue to benefit from share gains in a tough consumer
environment and, as a result we see upside risk to our
forecasts,” James Dilks-Hopper, a London-based analyst at Numis
wrote in a report today.  Blacks Leisure sank 11 percent to 2 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
