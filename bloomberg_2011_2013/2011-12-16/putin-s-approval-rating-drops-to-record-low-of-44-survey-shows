Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s approval rating fell the lowest level in at least eight
years after his party’s setback in Dec. 4 elections, which was
marred by complaints of vote-rigging, an  opinion poll  showed.  The premier’s support dipped to 44 percent, from 46 percent
two weeks earlier, the  Public Opinion  Foundation said in a
report published on its website today, citing its Dec. 10-11
survey of 3,000 people. No margin of error was given.  The poll was conducted on the weekend that saw tens of
thousands of people protest against vote fraud, the largest
demonstrations against Putin since he came to power. The 59-
year-old prime minister, who plans to return to the Kremlin next
year by swapping jobs with President  Dmitry Medvedev , yesterday
denied that the elections were rigged and accused his opponents
of paying people to protest and getting financing from foreign
governments.  Putin would get 42 percent if a presidential election were
held this weekend, the state-run All-Russian Center for the
Study of Public Opinion, or VTsIOM, said today, citing a survey
conducted among 1,600 people on Dec. 10-11 with a 3.4
percentage-point margin of error.  Medvedev replaced Putin in 2008 after the premier served
the constitutional limit of two consecutive presidential terms
from 2000. Putin, who will run in March 4 elections, could be
president for another 12 years, making him the longest-serving
Russian leader since  Josef Stalin .  To contact the reporter on this story:
