The  World Bank  will make available
$340 million for Serbia in the next two years and add $200
million in budget support in case the country is hit by euro-
area turbulence.  The funds are part of the lender’s four-year Country
Partnership Strategy, representing its commitment to support
Serbian efforts to strengthen competitiveness and improve the
efficiency of social spending, it said in an e-mail today.  The bank’s private sector lending arm, the  International
Finance Corporation , or IFC, will make available a further $600
million to $800 million for the Balkan country’s private sector
through 2015, the World Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
