A legal snag prevented  India ’s
Karnataka state from opening bids from companies including  Tata
Power Co. (TPWR)  that are seeking contracts to build 80 megawatts of
solar power plants, an official said.  Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd., a state-run
agency, had planned to open the bids on Dec. 2 and announce the
winners. That was delayed after it broke a rule requiring
government bodies to award contracts through an online
procurement system, said KREDL Managing Director N.S. Prasanna
Kumar by telephone from Bangalore.  “The program hasn’t been canceled,” he said. “It’s a
legal problem that should be solved in a week or 10 days.”  The agency needs to file an application to exempt it from
the electronic procurement rule, Kumar said. After that, the
bids will be opened, he said.  Companies that have bid for the 50 megawatts of
photovoltaic capacity on offer include Tata Power, Welspun
Group, Kiran Energy Solar Power Pvt. and Jindal Aluminium Ltd.
Bidders for 30 megawatts of solar-thermal projects were Sunborne
Energy LLC, backed by billionaire  Vinod Khosla  and Atria Power
Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
