Warren Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy
Holdings agreed to buy a 49 percent stake in  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) ’s
$1.8 billion Agua Caliente solar project, the billionaire’s
second investment in solar this month.  The 290-megawatt power plant is being built in Arizona by
 First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , which expects to complete the installation of
its panels by 2014, Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG said today
in a statement. Terms of MidAmerican’s purchase weren’t
disclosed.  Buffett’s foray into solar shows that utility-scale  power
plants  offer good returns with little downside risk, said  Paul Clegg , an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. Power
from the plant, which won a $967 million loan guarantee from the
U.S. Energy Department this year, will be sold to a PG&E Corp.
utility under a 25-year contract at undisclosed prices.  “The utility contracts are favorable and solid,” Clegg
said today in an interview. “Plus, they offer tax credits that
may be useful to large, profitable companies.”  Increasing competition from China’s solar industry has cut
panel prices by as much as 50 percent this year, leading First
Solar to shift its focus to building larger scale power plants
from selling panels to rooftop developers.  MidAmerican on Dec. 7 agreed to buy the entire $2 billion
Topaz power plant in California from Tempe, Arizona-based First
Solar. MidAmerican is a subsidiary of Omaha, Nebraska-based
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   NRG rose 0.6 percent to $18.31 and First Solar rose 1.5
percent to $31.91 at the close of trading in New York. Berkshire
fell $75 to $112,325.  To contact the reporter on this story:
