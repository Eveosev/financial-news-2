Utah  violated the U.S. Constitution
by passing a set of immigration laws the state’s governor has
called the “Utah solution,” the U.S. said, asking a
federal court to block the laws.  “Utah consciously joined a number of states that have
already attempted to set forth their own, often conflicting,
immigration policies and enforcement mechanisms,” Justice
Department lawyers said in today’s request for a preliminary
injunction filed in federal court in Salt Lake City.  The various states’ efforts to create their own immigration
policies conflict with the federal government’s exclusive power
to regulate immigration, according to the filing. The U.S. also
has sued to block state immigration measures in Arizona, Alabama
and  South Carolina . Utah Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican,
signed four immigration bills in March.  Brian Somers, a spokesman for Herbert, didn’t immediately
return a call to his office after regular business hours seeking
comment on government’s filing.  The case is Utah Coalition of La Raza v. Herbert, 11-401,
U.S. District Court, District of Utah ( Salt Lake City ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
