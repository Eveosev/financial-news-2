Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind turbine-
maker, said its French unit sold four wind farms it developed to
 Allianz SE (ALV)  and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA.  Nordex France sold the Forge project in the Cher region to
Allianz Renewable Energy Partners IV Limite, and three other
French projects to BNP Clean Energy Investment Partners, the
Hamburg-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The farms have a total capacity of 47.5 megawatts. Nordex
also sold four 2.5-megawatt turbines to wind farm developer
BOREAS for its Coume project in eastern France, it said. No
terms were given for the sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
