U.S. automakers led by  General
Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group LLC may need to boost incentives
or cut production to reduce inventories that have risen to a 31-
month high, according to Bloomberg Industries.  GM, Chrysler and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  had 80 days supply of cars
and light trucks as of Nov. 30, according to a report led by
Kevin Tynan, a Princeton, New Jersey-based Bloomberg Industries
analyst. Inventories are considered “manageable” when in the
range of 55 days to 65 days, he said.  The automakers’ supply of cars and trucks may be too high
as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co. production recovers
from  Japan ’s tsunami and  Thailand ’s floods this year. Toyota,
 Asia ’s largest automaker, may use incentives to reclaim U.S.
market share that has stayed below 14 percent in every month
since the March tsunami from 18 percent in December 2009.  “You just don’t want to be out there with so much
inventory when a price war starts or it’s going to get ugly,”
Tynan said today in a phone interview. “If I’m GM, Ford or
Chrysler, I’m trying to get that days supply down” before
Japanese automakers’ inventories return to 60 days supply.  U.S. auto sales may total 12.7 million this year, the best
annual performance since 2008, Bloomberg Industries estimates.
Deliveries may increase to 13.5 million in 2012, rising for a
third consecutive year from a 27-year low of 10.4 million cars
and light trucks in 2009.  GM is poised to retake leadership in global auto sales,
which it ceded to Toyota in 2008. The automaker has reported
6.79 million sales through September of this year, leading
disaster-stricken Toyota by 1 million vehicles.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
has jumped to second with 6.17 million vehicles sold through the
first nine months, expanding faster than it had forecast.  Depressed Inventory  U.S. inventory for Japanese automakers fell to 47 days at
the end of March after the nation’s earthquake and tsunami
earlier that month disrupted car and truck assembly plants and
the supply of parts. The automakers’ supply has yet to surpass
50 days since, and inventories for Korean carmakers  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  have trailed 40 days throughout
that span, according to Bloomberg Industries.  If the pace of auto sales slow early next year as Toyota
and Honda’s supply recovers, cuts to production or increased
incentives probably would affect U.S. automakers’ earnings
beginning in the second quarter of 2012, Tynan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
