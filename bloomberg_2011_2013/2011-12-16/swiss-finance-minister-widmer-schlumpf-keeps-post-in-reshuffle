Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf kept her
post as  Switzerland ’s finance minister in a cabinet reshuffle
following the Dec. 14 election of a new government.  Didier Burkhalter was named foreign minister, replacing
Micheline Calmy-Rey, who didn’t stand for re-election,
government spokesman Andre Simonazzi said today at a news
conference in Bern. Burkhalter was succeeded at the Interior
Ministry by Alain Berset. All five remaining ministerial posts
stayed the same, Simonazzi said.  Lawmakers this week voted Berset into the cabinet from the
Upper House alongside his fellow Social Democrat Simonetta
Sommaruga, who heads the Justice Ministry. Also staying on are
Transport Minister Doris Leuthard, Defense Minister Ueli Maurer,
and Johann Schneider-Ammann at the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
