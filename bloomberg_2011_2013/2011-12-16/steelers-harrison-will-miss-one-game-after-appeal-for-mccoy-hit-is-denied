James Harrison ’s appeal of a one-
game suspension for a hit to the head of quarterback Colt McCoy
was denied and the Pro Bowl linebacker will sit out the
Pittsburgh Steelers’ Dec. 19 game against the San Francisco
49ers.  Ted Cottrell, an on-field appeals officer working jointly
for the league and the National Football League Players
Association, upheld the league’s decision to ban Harrison, the
NFL said in a statement.  It was fifth illegal hit in the last three seasons by
Harrison, 33, who received a roughing-the-passer penalty for the
helmet-to-helmet hit on McCoy during the Steelers’ 14-3 win over
the  Cleveland Browns  on Dec. 8.  Harrison was docked four times for illegal hits on
quarterbacks during the 2009 and 2010 seasons. He also was fined
twice by the league for unnecessary roughness over that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
