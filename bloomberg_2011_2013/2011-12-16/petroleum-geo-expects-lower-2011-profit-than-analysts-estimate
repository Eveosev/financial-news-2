Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (PGS) , the
world’s third-biggest surveyor of oil and gas fields, predicted
a profit for this year which was lower than analysts estimated
and said it will cut costs.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will be “slightly” below $525 million as
utilization and productivity is weak in the current quarter, the
Lysaker, Norway-based company said today in a statement. The
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 25 analysts was a 2011
Ebitda of $529 million.  PGS raised in October its 2011 Ebitda forecast to $525
million from $500 million citing better results at its non-
exclusive, or multiclient, user licenses in the  North Sea . The
company said today that profit by the same measure will rise to
a range of $650 million to $700 million next year. That compares
with an average estimate of $671 million in the Bloomberg
survey.  The company’s cost cut plan will save $50 million by the
end of next year of which half is included in its forecast for
2012, PGS said, without providing more details.  “This program with its renewed focus on cost and fleet
performance will deliver margin uplift,” Jon Erik Reinhardsen,
the company’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  PGS said it expects multiclient cash investments of $300
million to $325 million next year and capital expenditures of
$350 million to $400 million.  PGS holds a capital markets day today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
