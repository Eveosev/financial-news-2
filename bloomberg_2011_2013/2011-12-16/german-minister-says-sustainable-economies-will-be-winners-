Countries that make their economies
more sustainable to help curb climate change will “be the
economic winners” of the 21st century, German Environment
Minister Norbert Roettgen said today.  Curbing climate change by making economies more resource-
efficient harbors “enormous economic opportunities” that
Germany and  Europe  want to benefit from, Roettgen told lawmakers
in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
