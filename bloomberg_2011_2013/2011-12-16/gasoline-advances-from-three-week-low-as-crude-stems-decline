Gasoline declined to a three-week
low after  crude oil  reversed earlier gains on concern that
economic growth in  Europe  will slow.  Futures fell to the lowest level since Nov. 25 as oil sank
after Fitch Ratings lowered France’s outlook and put nations
including Spain and Italy on review for downgrade. Exports from
the euro region slipped 1.9 percent in October from a month
earlier, the European Union’s  statistics office  said today.  “Gasoline is following crude prices,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. “People’s
attention has returned to the European situation and any
tensions in the  Middle East  that might impact supplies.”  Gasoline for January delivery fell 0.07 cent to settle at
$2.487 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 1.4 percent this year, after gaining as much as 41 percent
through April.  Prices also declined as France’s statistics office said the
country’s economy will shrink during this quarter and in the
first quarter of 2012.  January crude declined 34 cents to settle at $93.53 a
barrel on the Nymex.  January-delivery heating oil fell 2.2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.8005 a gallon. Prices are up 10 percent this
year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.9
cent to $3.25 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Retail
prices have increased 8.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
