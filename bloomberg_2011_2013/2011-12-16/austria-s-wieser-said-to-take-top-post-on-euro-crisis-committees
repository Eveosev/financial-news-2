Thomas Wieser , an Austrian finance
official, is due to become the permanent head of two European
Union committees on the front lines in combating the debt
crisis, two people familiar with the decision said.  U.S.-born Wieser, head of the Austrian  Finance Ministry ’s
economic policy and financial markets department, will run
committees of national finance and central bank officials that
prepare meetings of finance ministers from the euro area and the
broader 27-nation EU, said the people, who declined to be
identified because contractual details haven’t been finalized.  Wieser, 57, will be the first full-time chairman of the
panels, part of European efforts to streamline decision-making
amid the debt crisis. Previously, a national official was
elected as chairman on a rotating basis. Harald Waiglein, a
spokesman for  Austria ’s Finance Ministry, declined to comment.  Born in Bethesda,  Maryland , Wieser studied economics in
Innsbruck and as a Fulbright scholar at the  University of
Colorado . He already served a two-year term as rotating chairman
of one of the committees, the Economic and Financial Committee,
which works for all EU ministers.  The second committee, known as the Eurogroup Working Group,
prepares meetings of ministers from the 17-nation euro area.
Wieser is likely to start in January once European governments
give the final approval and decide on the length of his term,
the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
