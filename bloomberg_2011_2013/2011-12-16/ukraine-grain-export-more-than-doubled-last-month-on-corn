Ukraineâ€™s grain exports more than
doubled in November from the previous month on a record corn
harvest, researcher  UkrAgroConsult  said, citing preliminary
data.  The former Soviet state shipped 2.29 million tons of grain,
including 1.79 million tons of corn, the Kiev-based researcher
said today in an e-mailed statement. That compares with 1.05
million tons of exports, including 635,400 tons of corn, in
October.  The November corn exports mainly went to North Africa, the
European Union and the  Middle East , UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukraine also exported 192,000 tons of rapeseed in November,
which is a 49 percent increase month-on-month, the researcher
said. The country exported 780,000 tons of rapeseed in the July
through November period, compared with 1.22 million tons a year
ago, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
