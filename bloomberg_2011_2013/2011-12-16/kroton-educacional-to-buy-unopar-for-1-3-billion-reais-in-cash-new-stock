Kroton Educacional SA ,  Brazil ’s No.
2 operator of schools and colleges by market value, fell the
most in four months after announcing the acquisition of Uniao
Norte do Parana de Ensino Ltda. for 1.3 billion reais ($699
million) in cash and stock.  The stock fell 7.2 percent to 18 reais at 11:42 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the biggest decline since Aug. 8. The Bovespa benchmark
stock index gained 0.4 percent.  Kroton plans to raise as much as 600 million reais by
selling up to 240 million new shares for 2.50 reais each to help
pay for the acquisition, according to a Brazilian regulatory
filing today. The company, based in  Belo Horizonte , plans to
borrow 550 million reais from  Banco Bradesco SA. (BBDC4)  Kroton will pay
for 80 percent of Unopar, as the acquired company is known, in
cash and the rest in stock.  Unopar is Brazil’s largest distance-learning education
institution and adds 162,000 students, according to Kroton. The
 acquisition  is Kroton’s biggest of four since July 2011. Last
month, Kroton bought Uniao Sorrisense de Educacao Ltda. for 5.4
million reais plus debt. Unopar has no debt, Kroton said.  Kroton will seek approval from shareholders next year to
list its shares on BM&FBovespa’s Novo Mercado stock exchange,
according to the filing today.  Kroton declined 11 percent this year before today.
 Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes SA (KROT11) , the largest in the
industry, lost 49 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
