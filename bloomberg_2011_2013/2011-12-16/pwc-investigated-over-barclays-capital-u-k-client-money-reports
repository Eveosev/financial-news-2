A U.K. accounting regulator is
investigating whether PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s reports on
client assets at Barclays Capital Securities Ltd. broke
financial rules.  The  Accountancy & Actuarial Discipline Board  is reviewing
PwC’s reports to the Financial Services Authority outlining
Barclays Capital’s compliance with client-asset separation rules
between December 2001 and 2009, the London-based accounting
regulator said in a statement today.  The FSA fined the bank 1.12 million pounds ($1.7 million)
in January for failing to put as much as 752 million pounds a
day of client money into protected accounts that were separate
from its own money-market deposits. The AADB is already seeking
a record fine of at least 1.5 million pounds against PwC in a
similar case concerning regulatory reports on client-money
accounts at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s London securities unit.  “We will cooperate fully with the AADB investigation and
we will be defending our work vigorously,” PwC said in an e-
mailed statement.  Tim Dutton, a lawyer for PwC, told a London tribunal in the
JPMorgan case last month that the fine should be capped at 1
million pounds because the firm had admitted and apologized for
the error, which was a “result of  information technology 
changes made by JPM treasury staff,” and that no clients of the
bank had lost money.  “The focus of the AADB is on cases which raise important
issues affecting the public interest,” the regulator said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
