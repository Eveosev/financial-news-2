Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a one-week low, after the
central bank left  interest rates  unchanged amid lower inflation
forecasts.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.56 percent,
according to the stock exchange. That’s the lowest level since
Dec. 7. The bond’s price rose 0.085 centavo to 119.305 centavos
per peso.  The central bank’s seven-member board, led by Jose Dario Uribe, held the overnight rate at 4.75 percent today, as
forecast by 26 of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Six
analysts expected the bank to raise the rate to 5 percent. In
November policy makers raised the rate a quarter percentage
point citing the need to bolster the central bank’s credibility
after “strong” growth drove up inflation expectations,
according to minutes of the meeting.  “Last month’s hike helped anchor inflation expectations,”
said Omar Escorcia, an analyst at Asesores en Valores SA
brokerage in Bogota. The central bank has “room to gauge the
impact of  Europe  on the economy” before likely raising rates in
April, he said.  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of
annual consumer price increase expectations, fell to 3.58
percentage points from 3.91 on Nov. 17.  Colombia’s economy likely grew more than 6 percent in the
third quarter, Banco de la Republica said in a statement
following the rate decision.  Latin America ’s fifth-largest
economy may grow as much as 6 percent in 2011, the central bank
has said, which would make it the fastest pace since 2007.  Bank lending is expanding “at a fast pace and seems to be
accelerating,” and housing costs are at a record, policy makers
said in the statement.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 1,940.98 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,935.61 yesterday. The currency slipped 0.8 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
