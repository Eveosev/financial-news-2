Tallink Grupp AS (TAL1T) , the biggest Baltic
ferry company, was Estonia’s biggest exporter last year,
followed by fuel trading company Baltic International Trading OU
and electronics producer Ericsson Eesti AS, according to a
ranking by business newspaper  Aeripaeev .  Tallink, which gets more than half of its revenue from on-
board restaurant and shop sales, had revenue of 814 million
euros ($1.06 billion) in 2010, Aeripaeev said. “Almost all” of
its revenue could be defined as exports, the newspaper said.  Baltic International Trading OU, which sells oil products
and chemicals, had export revenue of 625 million euros in 2010.
Ericsson Eesti AS, a unit of Stockholm-based wireless equipment
maker  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , sold goods worth 554 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
