Stocks are poised to begin a
“raging bull” market within 18 months as the children of  baby
boomers  reach their peak savings years, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  “The demographics of the baby boom ‘echo’ should support a
new cadre of investors,” spurring a multiyear surge in share
prices, Levkovich wrote two days ago in a report. “They have
not suffered a lost decade in stocks and thus do not harbor any
ill will to the asset class.”  Americans between 35 and 39 years old are the group to
watch, he wrote. The CHART OF THE DAY compares the number of
people in that age category each year since 1900 with the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average . Projected figures through 2030, as
compiled by the Census Bureau, are also displayed.  Demographics are among half a dozen reasons to look forward
to a so-called secular  bull market  in U.S. stocks, according to
Levkovich, who is based in  New York  and sees the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index ending next year 13 percent higher than
yesterday’s close. He also cited:  -- The potential for a housing recovery to begin in the
middle of next year,  -- “An American manufacturing renaissance” as companies
bring back production from overseas,  -- Federal budget cutbacks that pave the way for greater
interest in stocks and higher price-earnings ratios,  -- Rising shale oil and gas production that is moving the
U.S. toward energy self-sufficiency, and  -- Increased technology investment to accommodate the
growing use of smartphones and other mobile devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
