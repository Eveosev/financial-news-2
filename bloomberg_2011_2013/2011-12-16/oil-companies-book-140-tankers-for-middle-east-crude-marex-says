Oil companies  and traders booked 140
tankers that can each haul 2 million-barrel cargoes of crude for
loading in the  Persian Gulf  this month, said commodities broker
Marex Spectron Group Ltd.  The tally is one less than last month’s total of 141, which
was the highest since at least 2007, according to data from the
broker’s Singapore-based freight derivatives unit. It didn’t say
whether charters for December loadings are finished.  To contact the reporter on this story:
