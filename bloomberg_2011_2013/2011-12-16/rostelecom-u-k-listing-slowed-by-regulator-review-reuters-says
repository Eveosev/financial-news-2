OAO Rostelecom ,  Russia ’s dominant
fixed-line phone provider, won’t meet a goal for listing shares
on the London Stock Exchange this month because U.K. regulators
need more time to review the application, Reutres news agency
 reported , citing an unidentified person at the company.  The listing may take place in early 2012, Reuters reported.  A person who answered the company’s phone number after
normal business hours in Moscow declined to comment on the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
