Canada ’s currency fell, extending
its biggest five-day drop in six weeks, as speculation  Europe  is
struggling to contain its sovereign-debt crisis damped appetite
for higher-yielding assets.  The loonie, as the currency is also known, fell against all
of its 16 most-traded counterparts as crude oil posted its
biggest weekly drop since September. Reports showing U.S.
consumer prices stagnated and foreigners bought less in Canadian
securities than forecast weighed on the currency. Government 10-
year bond  yields  fell below 1.9 percent for the first time.  “It hasn’t been a good week for the risk backdrop, with
crude-oil prices being hit pretty hard, which isn’t helping
Canada,” said  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed-
income and foreign-exchange strategy in Toronto at Royal Bank of
Canada. “The risk backdrop has not been supportive now that
people are more cautious with regards to the global growth
outlook.”  The loonie declined 0.3 percent to C$1.0380 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5 p.m. after reaching C$1.0424 on Dec. 14, the weakest since
Nov. 28. One Canadian dollar buys 96.31 U.S. cents. Canada’s

days ended Nov. 4.  Foreigners bought a net C$2.03 billion ($1.97 billion) of
Canadian securities in October, led by bonds, Statistics Canada
figures showed today. Economists predicted a C$7.25 billion net
investment, according to the median of four estimates compiled
by Bloomberg News.  U.S. Inflation  Consumer prices in the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading
partner, were unchanged in November as gasoline prices dropped.
The report follows a 0.1 percent decrease in the prior month, a
report from the Labor Department showed today in  Washington .  Yields  on Canada’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.86 percent. They earlier
touched a record low of 1.837 percent. The price of the 3.25
percent securities maturing in June 2021 increased 55 cents to
C$111.95.  Crude oil futures rose 0.4 percent to $93.78 a barrel in
New York after reaching $92.52, the weakest since Nov. 3. The
nation’s biggest export has dropped 6.1 percent this week.  The loonie has weakened 3.1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a gauge of 10
developed-nation currencies. The greenback has appreciated 1.7
percent, and the yen has added 4.8 percent.  The Canadian currency has fallen 3.9 percent against the
greenback this year. It appreciated to a three-year high of
