A Dutch investigation of sexual
abuse by staff at Roman Catholic schools, seminaries and
children’s homes estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 minors fell
victim between 1945 and 1981.  “The idea that it wasn’t known can’t be maintained,” Wim
Deetman, a former mayor of The Hague who led the investigation,
told reporters in the city. The Catholic Church knew about the
abuse and failed to take adequate action, according to the
 report  published today.  The independent investigators, commissioned by the Dutch
bishops, received 1,795 complaints of sexual abuse and
identified about 800 suspects who worked in dioceses, orders and
congregations, of whom 105 are still alive.  Four people filed charges and 30 reported abuse in the
institutions. While most cases couldn’t be prosecuted because
time had lapsed, one sexton was sentenced to 15 months, of which
12 months was conditional, the prosecutor said in a  statement .  “Help alone is not enough to provide redress for
victims,” the commission wrote. “Financial compensation is an
essential element of the reparation that must be made to the
victims.” The Dutch bishops last month agreed to pay as much as
100,000 euros ($130,000) per person in compensation to the
victims.  The Netherlands in 1947 was home to 3.7 million Catholics,
or 38 percent of the population, according to a  census . The risk
of abuse for children in Catholic and non-Catholic institutions
was twice the national average, the commission found.  “We deeply regret this abuse,” the Dutch bishops said in
a  statement  today. “We empathize with the victims and offer
them our heartfelt apology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
