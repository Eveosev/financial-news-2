China  adjusted the sliding scale tax
levied on cotton imports to increase the duty for cheaper
shipments,  the China Cotton Association  said today, citing the
Ministry of Finance.  The price ceiling for imports to be taxed at a maximum of
40 percent will be increased to 14,000 yuan a metric ton, up
from 11,397 yuan a ton, according to the association. Shipments
priced higher than 14,000 yuan will be taxed at a flat rate of
570 yuan a ton, it said.  “The change is partly aimed at ensuring cheap imports
don’t compete with local cotton because imports are now much
cheaper than local produce,” Fu Xiaoyan, an analyst at Nanhua
Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou today.  Cotton for May delivery on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange
gained 1.4 percent to 20,650 yuan a metric ton by 10:19 a.m.
local time. March-delivery cotton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  rose 1.4 percent to 86.29 cents a pound yesterday.  Still, “the change in the formula seems to have little
impact for now because the lowest import price is much higher
than the benchmark 14,000 yuan a ton,” Dong Shuzhi, vice
general manager of PKU Founder Commodities Group, said from
Urumqi today.  Imports in November reached 378,200 metric tons, almost
triple from a year earlier, cncotton.com said, citing customs
data. The website is owned by the China National Cotton Reserves
Corp., which manages state stockpiles.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
