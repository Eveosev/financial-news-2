  Rosenbauer International AG (ROS) , the
world’s No. 2 fire engine maker, rose the most since January
2009 after winning a record contract to supply  Saudi Arabia  with
245 million euros ($319 million) worth of emergency vehicles.  Rosenbauer rose 12 percent, or 4.09 euros a share, to 37.3
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Vienna. The stock is
down 0.5 percent this year.  “Capacity utilization at our production facilities is
assured for the next two years,” said Dieter Siegel, Chief
Executive Officer of the Leonding, Austria-based company.
Delivery of the 1,125 vehicles will be spread over 30 months and
be completed by mid-2014, the company said.  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK) , the Wisconsin-based military, fire and
emergency truck maker is Rosenbauer’s biggest competitor,
according to Bloomberg data. The Saudi deal is the biggest in
Rosenbauer’s history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
