President William C. Dudley said  Europe  has the “fiscal
capacity” to solve its issues and that its problem is “really
a political one.”  “I do not see Europe as having a fiscal insolvency
problem,” Dudley, 58, said at a hearing of a House Oversight
and Government Reform subcommittee in  Washington . “Their
situation fiscally is very comparable to ours” and that of
other nations.  Dudley said some European banks face “greater difficulty”
than others, and that the stress tests being undertaken by
regulators are “a very important step” in bolstering
confidence in the financial system.  “You really have to solve two problems,” Dudley said.
Regulators need to “make sure the banks have enough capital,”
and “you also have to get each country on a sustainable fiscal
path so that people are comfortable that the sovereign debt they
hold is going to be money good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
