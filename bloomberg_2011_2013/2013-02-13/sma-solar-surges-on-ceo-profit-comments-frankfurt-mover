SMA Solar Technology AG , Germany’s
biggest solar company by market value, rose the most in almost
six weeks after Chief Executive Officer  Pierre-Pascal Urbon  said
the company aims to generate a profit this year.  SMA, based in Niestetal, rose as much as 13 percent in
Frankfurt trading after Handelsblatt reported that the German
supplier aims for a profit, citing an interview with Urbon. The
CEO last year said the company expects “at best” a balanced
result for 2013 because of falling prices and subsidies.  Rising competition in the solar industry reduced panel
prices by half in 2011 and an additional 24 percent last year,
squeezing profit margins and tipping more than a dozen companies
into bankruptcy, including Solar Millennium AG and Q-Cells, once
the world’s largest producer of power-generating cells.  SMA, the biggest supplier of inverters to convert power
from photovoltaic panels, was up 9.2 percent as of 10:58 a.m.
Volume exceeded the three-month daily average after less than
two hours of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
