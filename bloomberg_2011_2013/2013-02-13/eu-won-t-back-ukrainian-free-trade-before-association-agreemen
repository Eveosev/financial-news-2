The European Union rejected a
proposal by Lithuania, which assumes the 27-member bloc’s
rotating presidency in July, to grant Ukraine a free-trade
accord before it signs a planned Association Agreement.  “The mandate of the member states is clear -- we are
signing the Association Agreement, including” the free-trade
accord, Enlargement Commissioner  Stefan Fule  said today in an
interview in Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi. “I do not see
pragmatically and politically any need to divide those ideas.”  Lithuania urged EU leaders Feb. 25 to approve free trade
with Ukraine to show that the bloc is serious about pursuing
closer ties with the former Soviet republic. The signing of the
Association Agreement, scheduled for 2011, has been delayed
because the bloc objects to the jailing of opposition leader
 Yulia Tymoshenko , a former prime minister.  The EU has also criticized Ukrainian authorities for
failing to conduct October parliamentary elections in line with
international democratic standards. The Association Agreement
may be signed at a Vilnius summit in November if Ukraine meets
all the EU’s requirements, the bloc has said.  “We expressed ourselves clearly on those expectations
related to the elections” and “selective justice,” Fule said.
“None of those issues are new.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
