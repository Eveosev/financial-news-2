Portugal’s  jobless rate  rose to a
euro-era record in the fourth quarter as the country struggles
to emerge from a recession headed for a third year in 2013.  The unemployment rate increased to 16.9 percent from 15.8
percent in the third quarter, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s
the fastest pace in a year. Unemployment averaged 15.7 percent
in 2012, up from 12.7 percent in 2011. The government predicts
joblessness of 16.4 percent in 2013.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness as he cuts spending and raises taxes to meet the
terms of a 78 billion-euro ($105 billion) aid plan from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Portugal has
already been given more time to narrow its budget shortfall
after tax revenue missed forecasts.  The number of unemployed workers from industries including
manufacturing, construction and energy rose 13 percent in the
fourth quarter, while the increase from services was 2 percent.  Construction companies’ order books shrank 44 percent in
the final quarter of 2012 from the same period a year earlier,
Portugal’s Association of Public Works and Construction, or
AECOPS, said in a Feb. 4 statement. Cement consumption dropped
27 percent last year to the lowest level since 1973.
Unemployment in the industry rose 34 percent in the 11 months
through November, it said.  Job Cuts  Banco Comercial Portugues SA , Portugal’s second-biggest
bank by market value, said on Nov. 5 it plans to cut 600 jobs.  The Portuguese government projects the economy to return to
growth in 2014. It forecasts gross domestic product to drop 1
percent this year after a 3 percent decline in 2012.  Economic
growth  has averaged less than 1 percent a year for the past
decade, placing Portugal among Europe’s weakest performers.  The economy shrank for an eighth quarter in the three
months through September as the government and consumers reduced
spending. The statistics institute releases preliminary fourth-
quarter  GDP  figures tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
