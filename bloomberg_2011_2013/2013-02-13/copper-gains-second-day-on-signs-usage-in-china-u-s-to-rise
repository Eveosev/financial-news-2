Copper rose for a second day on
speculation a recovery in demand in top users China and the U.S.
will help absorb an oversupply.  The metal for delivery in three months gained as much as
0.2 percent to $8,250.75 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange, after closing 0.5 percent higher yesterday. The
contract traded at $8,250 a ton as of 10:11 a.m. in Singapore.
Futures for March delivery were little changed at $3.748 a pound
on the Comex in New York.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  climbed 6.5 percent this
year through yesterday as about 74 percent of the 354 companies
in the equity gauge that have released results during the
earnings season exceeded profit projections, data compiled by
Bloomberg  show . A government-backed survey of purchasing
managers showed manufacturing in China expanded in January, and
a separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
rose to the highest in two years, signaling the recovery may be
gaining momentum.  “Copper will benefit from the macro-economic recovery in
the major consuming countries,”  Daniel Hynes , head of commodity
strategy at CIMB Securities Australia Lid., said today by phone
from Sydney.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME, the Shanghai
Futures Exchange and Comex gained to 664,396 tons as of
yesterday, the highest since May 2011 and almost a 13 percent
climb in the year to date, according to data tracked by
Bloomberg news. While the market may see the first annual
oversupply since 2009, an expected demand increase in China and
the U.S. will help absorb the glut, Hynes said.  Financial markets are closed this week in China for the
Lunar New Year holiday. Copper imports by China advanced 2.9
percent last month from December.  LME lead for three-month delivery added 0.6 percent at
$2,428 a ton, zinc advanced 0.4 percent to $2,218 a ton and
while aluminum rose 0.2 percent to $2,124. Nickel fell 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
