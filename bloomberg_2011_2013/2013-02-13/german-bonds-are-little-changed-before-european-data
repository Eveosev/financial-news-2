Spanish bonds advanced for a second
day, leading gains in the region’s higher-yielding government
securities, as a report showed industrial production in the
euro-area rose more than economists forecast.  Spain’s securities extended gains from yesterday when
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the country
had achieved “enormous progress” in its reforms.  Italy ’s 10-
year yields dropped to the lowest level in a week even as
borrowing costs increased when the country sold 6.63 billion
euros ($8.91 billion) of debt, the last auction before an
election this month. German bonds fell as the country sold two-
year notes and as demand for the region’s safest assets waned.  “There’s still a big grab for yield going on, which does
encourage people” to purchase Italian and Spanish bonds, said
 Marc Ostwald , a rates strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in
London. “The spread relative to bunds is still tightening
despite the supply.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 5.20 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time, the
lowest level since Feb. 1. The 5.4 percent securities due in
January 2023 gained 0.97, or 9.70 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 101.545.  The spread over comparable German debt slipped 17 basis
points to 353 basis points, after narrowing to 351 basis points,
the least since Feb. 4. The  Italian 10-year yield  declined 12
basis points to 4.39 percent, leaving the gap with bunds at 272
basis points, from 301 basis points on Feb. 11.  Output Increases  Factory production in the 17-nation currency bloc rose 0.7
percent in December, after declining a revised 0.7 percent a
month earlier, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.2 percent,
according to the median of 41 estimates in a  Bloomberg  survey.  The data follows separate reports this month showing
economic confidence in the euro area climbed to the highest
since July and manufacturing output contracted less in January
than estimated.  Italy sold 3.45 billion euros of 2.75 percent notes
maturing in December 2015 at an average yield of 2.3 percent, up
from 1.85 percent at a previous auction on Jan. 11. It also
auctioned 888 million euros of bonds due in 2040 at a yield of
5.07 percent, as well as securities maturing in 2026 and 2017.  That’s the last offering until the elections due Feb.
24-25. The country’s next bond sale is scheduled for Feb. 25,
followed by an auction of bills the following day.  ‘Looming Election’  “The fact that yields have risen from last month can be
linked, more than to the looming election, to the strength of
the euro, which means reduced growth perspectives and increases
the risks for countries such as Italy and Spain that are mired
in a recession,” said  Chiara Manenti , a fixed-income strategist
at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA in Milan.  Benchmark German 10-year bund yields added four basis
points to 1.67 percent, extending their advance from 1.58
percent on Feb. 8, which was the least since Jan. 25.  Germany allotted 4.3 billion euros of 0.25 percent notes
due March 2015 at an average yield of 0.21 percent. It last sold
two-year securities on Jan. 2 at 0.01 percent.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.5
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Italian debt returned 0.6 percent and
Spanish securities gained 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
