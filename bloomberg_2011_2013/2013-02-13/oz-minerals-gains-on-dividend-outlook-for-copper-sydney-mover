OZ Minerals Ltd ., Australia’s third-
biggest copper producer, rose to a three week high in Sydney on
the outlook for metal demand and after announcing a higher-than-
expected dividend.  The  stock  added 3.6 percent to A$7.47, the highest since
Jan. 21, at the close of trading. The Melbourne-based company
will pay a second-half dividend of 20 Australian cents per
share, taking the full-year payout to 30 cents a share, it said
today. That is double the average  estimate  of four analysts for
the second-half dividend, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  OZ Minerals also extended the life of its Ankata mine at
Prominent Hill in South Australia by two years to 2019 and
forecast “robust” demand for copper from China and the U.S.
that Chief Executive Officer  Terry Burgess  said would boost
copper to the higher end of the $3 to $4 a pound range in 2013.  “The dividend is above the expectations so that was quite
good and the extension of the mine life at Prominent Hill is a
catalyst,”  Chris Weston , chief market strategist at IG Markets
Ltd. said by phone from Melbourne.  OZ Minerals also reported today 2012 net income of A$152
million ($157 million), in line with the average estimate of
A$156 million from 22 analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Copper for March delivery was at $3.7510 a pound in New
York as of 4:27 p.m. Melbourne time. The metal has gained 2.7
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
