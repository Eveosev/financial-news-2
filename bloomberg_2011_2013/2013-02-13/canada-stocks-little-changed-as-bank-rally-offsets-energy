Canadian stocks fell as a slump in
technology and raw-material shares offset a rally in financial
companies amid corporate earnings.  Gold producers declined as Barrick Gold Corp. and Eldorado
Gold Corp. dropped at least 2.6 percent. BlackBerry, formerly
known as Research In Motion Ltd., fell 8.1 percent, retreating
for a fourth straight day.  Thomson Reuters Corp.  slid 2.3
percent after predicting tightening profit margins.  Talisman

million shares traded hands on Canadian exchanges today, or 1.6
percent below the three-month average.  “People are focused on earnings, you’ve seen stock
selection become more important,”  Jeff Young , chief investment
officer at NexGen Financial Corp, said in a phone interview. The
Toronto-based firm manages just over C$1 billion. “It’s turning
into a more normalized market, but whether we’re completely out
of the woods in the macro side, the reality is nothing’s really
been fixed.”  Gold producers fell as the price of the metal slipped 0.3
percent to $1,645.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Barrick
Gold lost 83 Canadian cents to C$31.72. Eldorado Gold dropped 35
Canadian cents to C$10.68, its lowest level since August.  BlackBerry slumped C$1.25 to C$14, for the worst
performance in the benchmark index. The Waterloo, Ontario-based
company, which is rolling out its new BlackBerry 10 lineup, has
tumbled 18 percent over the past four days. The stock has
rallied 19 percent this year on optimism that the phones can
make the company competitive again with Apple Inc.’s iPhone and
Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy lineup.  Chorus Aviation  Chorus Aviation Inc.  tumbled 3.6 percent to C$4.34 after
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sold its stake in the regional
airline. Chorus operates regional flights for Air Canada, the
country’s largest carrier, under the Jazz and Air Canada Express
banners. Fairfax, an insurer and investment management company
based in Toronto, was the third-biggest holder of Chorus stock.  Thomson Reuters  stumbled 70 Canadian cents to C$30.02. The
provider of financial news and information services predicted
slow growth and tightening profit margins in 2013, and announced
plans to cut 2,500 jobs. Thomson Reuters is midway through an
effort to turn around its financial and risk-management
operations, Chief Executive Officer  James C. Smith  said in
today’s statement.  CAE Inc. slid 2 percent to C$10.58. The simulation
manufacturer posted third-quarter revenue of C$522.1 million,

level since October. The Calgary-based oil and natural gas
producer with operations on six continents posted per-share net
income of 37 Canadian cents.  Hal Kvisle , who took over as chief
executive officer in September, has announced plans to reduce
spending, cut debt and exit certain regions, including Peru, to
refocus the company on near-term cash flow.  Orko Silver Corp. , based in Vancouver, surged 22 percent to
C$2.60, its highest level since March. Coeur d’Alene Mines
Corp., an Idaho-based silver producer, offered to buy Orko

trump a rival bid from First Majestic Silver Corp.  Coeur d’Alene tumbled 10 percent to C$21.09, while First
