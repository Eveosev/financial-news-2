Ethanol weakened against gasoline as
distillers sought to capitalize on the best returns in eight
months for turning a bushel of corn into the biofuel.  The spread widened 51 cents to 66.84 cents a gallon based
on settlement prices one day after the corn crush spread, which
shows the loss from turning corn into ethanol, narrowed to 14
cents a gallon, the least since June and up from a loss of 30
cents a month ago. Distillers have reduced output and idled
plants as earnings fell below production costs.  “They haven’t seen this in a while, so they’re trying to
lock it in,” said  Jerrod Kitt , an analyst at Linn Group in
Chicago. “You were in such a drought in terms of margins that
anything close to break-even looked like manna from heaven.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.367 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 8.1 percent this year and are up 5.9 percent
from a year ago.  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 1.49 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.0354 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
blended with ethanol.  Ethanol traded at 99.8 cents below the motor fuel on Sept.
28. The crush spread was minus 16 cents today.  Corn for March delivery decreased 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $6.955 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Shuttered Plants  At least 19 plants have been idled since June as the worst
drought since the 1930s boosted corn prices to a record and
trimmed profits for ethanol makers.  Poet LLC, the second-biggest U.S. ethanol producer,  Valero
Energy Corp. , the third-largest, and  Abengoa SA , are among
companies that have idled operations.  Kitt said the improving crush spread may entice companies
to restart production. The spread doesn’t include earnings from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock.  “Ready or not here it comes,” he said.  An Energy Information Administration report today showed
 production  rose 1.9 percent last week to 789,000 barrels a day,
the highest level since Jan. 4. Output was up 2.5 percent
770,000 barrels a day on Jan. 25, the lowest level since the
Energy Department’s statistical agency began tracking weekly
data in June 2010.  Steep Decline  Ethanol  stockpiles  dropped 3 percent to 19.5 million
barrels, the lowest level since Nov. 30 and the steepest decline
in 11 weeks, EIA said. Inventories wilted 9.3 percent from a
year earlier and are  below average  for this time of year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol stands to benefit from higher gasoline demand.
 Consumption  of the motor fuel over the past four-weeks was up
4.4 percent to 8.44 million barrels a day from a year earlier,
the EIA said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, little changed from the previous
week, according to EIA.  Imports of the fuel may be limited as Brazil plans to raise
the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline to 25 percent in May
from 20 percent now and after  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , the
country’s state-controlled oil company, said earlier this month
that it would raise gasoline prices by 6.6 percent, Kitt said.
Brazil is the biggest source of U.S. ethanol imports.  Imports  in the week ended Feb. 8 averaged 11,000 barrels a
day, up from none the previous week and none a year earlier, the
EIA report showed.  Brazilian Prices  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.29 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, 3.1 percent cheaper
than futures in Chicago.  In cash market trading, ethanol prices fell in most major
regions. Ethanol slid 1 cent in New York to $2.49 a gallon; 2
cents in Chicago to $2.38 a gallon; 1.5 cents to $2.43 in the
Gulf; and 1 cent on the West Coast to $2.55, the highest price
in the nation, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
 RINs , for advanced forms of ethanol, which includes the
Brazilian grade, rose to 58 cents yesterday, or more than double
the worth of the  conventional sort , data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
