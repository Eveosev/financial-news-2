Cattle futures declined for the
second straight day on speculation that higher prices for U.S.
beef are slowing consumer purchases of the meat. Hog prices were
little changed.  Wholesale beef rose 0.1 percent to $1.8357 a pound as of
midday, a one-week high, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data 
show. All fresh retail-beef prices may average $4.85 a pound
this year, up 4 percent from 2012, according to CattleFax, a
Centennial, Colorado-based researcher.  “The cattle market has had a problem,”  Mark Schultz , the
chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview. “It just has a
market that has been so high, and price-wise, we just don’t have
demand.”  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1.28875 a pound at 11:54 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through yesterday, the price was down 1.8 percent this
year.  Meatpackers processed 239,000 head of cattle in the first
two days of this week, down 2 percent from a year earlier, USDA
figures show. Packers are probably losing $60 to $75 a head,
according to Schultz.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement declined 1.7
percent to $1.40825 a pound. A close at that price would be the
ninth straight decline.  Hog futures for April settlement slid less than 0.1 percent
to 85.975 cents a pound on the CME. Prices were up 0.3 percent
this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
