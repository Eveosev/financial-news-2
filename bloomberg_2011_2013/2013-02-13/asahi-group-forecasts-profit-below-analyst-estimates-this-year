Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. , Japan’s
biggest beermaker, climbed the most in almost 11 years in Tokyo
trading after announcing a plan to spend as much as 30 billion
yen ($322 million) to buy back shares.  The brewer  surged  as much as 9.2 percent, headed for the
biggest gain since August 1992, to 2,192 yen, before trading at
2,136 yen as of 10:32 a.m. The company will buy back as much as
4.3 percent of its shares from today until Aug. 13, it said
yesterday in a statement.  The maker of “Super Dry” beer aims to more than double
its total return ratio, or buybacks and dividends divided by net
income, to 50 percent from about 23 percent in 2012, it said
yesterday in a statement. Sales rose 8 percent in 2012 from the
previous year to 1.579 trillion yen, beating its  projection  for
1.569 trillion yen.  “The total return ratio target was positively received in
the market,” said  Takayuki Hayano , an analyst at Barclays
Securities Japan Ltd. “Thirty billion yen has a big impact.”
He rates the shares “overweight.”  Net income will probably rise to 65.5 billion yen this
year, compared with the 68.1 billion yen average of 15 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales are expected to jump 9
percent to 1.720 trillion yen this year, according to the
statement yesterday. The brewer reported net income of 57.2
billion yen last year, missing its own projection for 65 billion
yen.  Independent Lawsuit  Separately, Asahi sued two buyout firms that sold it a New
Zealand liquor distributor for NZ$1.53 billion ($1.3 billion),
claiming they gave false information about the company’s
finances.  Pacific Equity Partners Pty. and Unitas Capital Pte.
engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by inflating
Independent Liquor’s earnings ahead of the 2011 takeover, Asahi
said. The lawsuit was filed in Federal Court in Melbourne,
according to the judicial website. A copy of the originating
application wasn’t immediately available from the court.  Amanda Lee, an external spokeswoman for Pacific Equity at
FTI Consulting Inc., declined to comment on the claims. A phone
message left outside of regular office hours at the Hong Kong
office of Unitas wasn’t immediately returned.  Pacific Equity and Unitas each held 43.9 percent stakes in
Independent, which they’d bought for NZ$1.2 billion in 2006,
according to a statement issued at the time of the acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
