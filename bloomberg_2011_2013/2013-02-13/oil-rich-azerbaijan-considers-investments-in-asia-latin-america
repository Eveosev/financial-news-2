President  Ilham Aliyev  said
Azerbaijan, an energy-rich former Soviet nation, is considering
investing in Asian and Latin American markets given its close
political ties with countries in each region.  “Our relations with Asian countries are developing very
successfully, based on mutual respect and non-interference in
each other’s affairs,” Aliyev said in comments published on his
 website  today. “Asia and Latin America look attractive in terms
of diversifying our investment portfolio.”  Western nations and rights watchdogs based in the U.S. and
the European Union have criticized the state of human rights and
freedoms in Azerbaijan, urging the Aliyev government to carry
out democratic reforms. Aliyev, who took over from his father in
disputed presidential elections in 2003, plans to run for a
third term in October.  Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known as Sofaz, is interested
in investing in real estate in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
China and Australia, the fund’s executive director,  Shahmar Movsumov , said in an interview broadcast on state TV channel
AzTV on Jan. 17.  Sofaz, established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s income from oil and gas sales, had $33.9 billion of
assets as of Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
