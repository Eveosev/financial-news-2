Qatar plans to hand over the Syrian
Embassy in its capital, Doha, to the opposition Syrian National
Coalition, the group said in an e-mailed statement today.  The coalition said it has appointed Nizar al-Haraki, 51, as
ambassador to Qatar.  Al-Haraki is an electrical engineer from the province of
Daraa, where the uprising against President  Bashar al-Assad 
began in March 2011, the group said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
