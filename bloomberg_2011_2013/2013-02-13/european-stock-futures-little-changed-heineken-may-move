European  stocks were little changed
as euro-area industrial output data rose and after U.S.
President  Barack Obama  pledged to expand trade with the region.
U.S. futures advanced, while Asian stocks were little changed.  Societe Generale SA posted the biggest decline by a lender
on a gauge of banking stocks after reporting a fourth-quarter
loss that missed analysts’ estimates. Heineken NV rallied to its
highest in more than 23 years after the world’s third-largest
brewer beat full-year profit estimates. PSA Peugeot Citroen rose
after it reported a narrower operating loss than predicted.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  declined 0.1 percent
to 286.8 at 10:08 a.m. in London, after yesterday adding 0.5
percent. The gauge has advanced 2.6 percent this year as U.S.
lawmakers agreed on a budget avoiding tax increases and spending
cuts that had threatened to push the world’s largest economy
into a recession. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures added 0.1
percent, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed as
markets in China and Hong Kong were closed.  “There’s a bit of a consolidation right now, but investors
are still underinvested and European assets are still
undervalued,”  Patrick Legland , Societe Generale’s head of
research, said in a Bloomberg TV interview with  Francine Lacqua .
“We’ve had some disappointment in European earnings, but you
need to see this case by case because sometimes this is more to
do with exceptional items and provisions. Their core underlying
business is not great because it’s tough in Europe, but these
companies are coping.”  Company Earnings  About 54 percent of the 312 western European companies that
have reported earnings since Jan. 8 beat analysts’ projections
for profit, according to Bloomberg data. Of the 358 that have
posted sales, 51 percent exceeded forecasts.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 23 percent lower than the average of the last
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Euro-area industrial production increased more than
economists forecast in December. Factory production in the 17-
nation currency bloc rose 0.7 percent from November, when it
declined a revised 0.7 percent, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast a gain
of 0.2 percent, according to the median of 41 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News  survey. December output fell 2.4 percent from the
year-earlier month.  Trade Agreement  In the U.S., Obama said he would pursue a trade agreement
with the EU to expand the world’s largest economic relationship,
while at the same time finishing discussions for a Pacific-
region accord.  Trade and investment between the U.S. and the 27 nations
that make up the EU had a value of $4.5 trillion in 2011.  Sales  at U.S. retailers probably grew in January as an
improving job market helped consumers overcome higher payroll
taxes, economists said before a report today. The projected 0.1
percent gain would follow a 0.5 percent December increase,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Societe Generale  declined 3.6 percent to 31.50 euros.
France’s second-largest bank posted a fourth-quarter loss after
writing down its stake in derivatives broker Newedge Group and
setting aside 300 million euros ($404 million) for legal
expenses. The net loss was 476 million euros, compared with a
100 million-euro profit a year earlier, the Paris-based lender
said. That was wider than the average estimate for a loss of 203
million euros in a Bloomberg survey.  ING Misses  ING Groep NV  retreated 1.5 percent to 6.83 euros. The
biggest Dutch financial-services company will shed 1,400 jobs in
the Netherlands and 1,000 in Belgium after saying fourth-quarter
profit missed estimates and its core capital ratio fell.  Net income rose to 1.43 billion euros from 1.19 billion
euros a year earlier, the Amsterdam-based company said in a
statement. That missed the 1.63 billion-euro median  estimate  of
12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Societe BIC SA  plunged 8.1 percent to 89.35 euros, its
largest decline in almost 16 months. The French manufacturer of
pens and pencils said profit was 263.1 million euros in 2012,
below the average estimate of 270.6 million euros.  Storebrand ASA  dropped 9 percent to 27.06 kroner, its
biggest slide in more than six months. Norway’s second-largest
insurer posted profit that missed estimates and increased its
guidance for reserve strengthening needed to meet new rules.  Heineken  added 3.9 percent to 53.97 euros, its highest
price since at least 1989. Earnings before interest and taxes,
excluding some items, rose to 2.9 billion euros from 2.7 billion
euros a year earlier, the maker of Amstel lager and Strongbow
cider said in a statement. That beat the median estimate for
profit of 2.85 billion euros.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-biggest carmaker, advanced 2.6
percent to 6.12 euros. The company posted an Ebit loss of 576
million euros for 2012, down from a profit of 1.09 billion euros
a year earlier. The loss was narrower than the 647 million-euro
average analyst estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
