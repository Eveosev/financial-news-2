Statoil ASA  is giving up a Kazakh
offshore block after Norway’s biggest energy producer spent
about seven years negotiating to start exploration, the latest
international defection from a Caspian Sea project.  Statoil, state-owned  KazMunaiGaz National Co .’s strategic
partner in the Abai project, sent notice of its decision last
month, the Astana, Kazakhstan-based energy producer said in an
e-mailed response to questions. KazMunaiGaz said in 2006 that
Statoil planned to join Abai, with an estimated 387 million tons
of resources (2.8 billion barrels), the following year.  Delays and cost overruns have dogged Kazakhstan’s efforts
to expand offshore production of oil and gas, the government’s
main source of revenue. ConocoPhillips is exiting the biggest
new development, the Kashagan project, where costs have swelled
to $46 billion for the first phase with first output due by
June, about eight years after an initial target.  “Kazakhstan has huge potential in the Caspian Sea but the
state should ease conditions for oil producers to attract them”
as competition among resource holding nations increases,  Ildar Davletshin , an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. “The exit of foreign partners from offshore projects may
slow down their development as KazMunaiGaz hasn’t enough
expertise” to go it alone.  Kashagan, Tengiz  Kazakhstan, the second-largest oil producer in the former
Soviet Union, needs Kashagan, Chevron Corp.’s Tengiz and the Eni
SpA and BG Group Plc-led Karachaganak deposit to keep output
from dropping to less than 80 million metric tons of oil a year
after 2016, Oil and Gas Minister  Sauat Mynbayev  said in October,
according to his website. Oil production contributed 16 percent
of gross domestic product and about half of tax revenue in 2011,
JSC Halyk Finance estimated in December.  Kazakhstan’s oil output forecast is “quite cautious” and
excludes 65 exploration contracts, Mynbayev said. “Some of the
structures will turn out to be dry.”  Statoil opened an office in Astana in 2004 to seek business
opportunities in the North Caspian region in cooperation with
KazMunaiGaz, according to the Stavanger, Norway-based oil
producer’s  website . Abai is 65 kilometers (40 miles) from shore.  Global Priorities  “As part of a global prioritisation process and the
overall commercial and technical evaluations related to the Abai
project, we have decided not to pursue negotiations,” Baard
Glad Pedersen, a spokesman for Statoil, said by e-mail. The
company signed a heads of agreement on the Abai block in March
2011, he said.  KazMunaiGaz is buying stakes in Caspian projects, even as
it loses partners, raising questions about a five-year, 557
billion-tenge ($3.7 billion) exploration plan announced in
December 2011. The state company had planned to drill 435 wells
to evaluate offshore fields including the N, Zhambyl and
Satpayev blocks, and start exploration at Abai, as well as the
Isatai and Shagala deposits with Eni.  Since then, ConocoPhillips pulled out of N block, selling
its 24.5 percent to the Kazakh company for $32 million in
January, and is looking to sell its 8.4 percent stake in
Kashagan to India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. for $5 billion.  Kazakhstan is considering whether to use the state’s right
of first refusal to buy ConocoPhillips’s Kashagan stake or let
ONGC enter the project. The government has until March 26 to
decide, the Oil and Gas Ministry said by e-mail.  Eni Withdrawal  Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, partners in
Kashagan, passed on their right to buy the stake, KazMunaiGaz
said, after talks with the government on a second phase stalled.  The expansion of Kashagan has been delayed about 18 months
because the “fiscal environment” didn’t support investment,
Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said on a Nov. 1
conference call.  Eni withdrew from the Shagala development, while agreeing
only to explore at Isatai, the Kazakh company said in its
response. KazMunaiGaz said it’s now discussing with Eni the
terms for Isatai, as well as industrial projects such as a
turbine power plant and shipyard.  KazMunaiGaz is continuing exploration plans with ONGC
Videsh Ltd., the Indian company’s overseas unit, and a group led
by Korea National Oil Corp.  ONGC Videsh and KazMunaiGaz plan to drill two exploration
wells at Satpayev in 2014 and 2015, and two exploration wells
with the Korea National Oil-led partners at Zhambyl oilfield
this year, the Kazakh company said. ONGC Videsh bought 25
percent of Satpayev in 2011.  KazMunaiGaz also plans to develop the Zhenis oilfield with
its unit KazMunaiGas Exploration Production, currently starting
to jointly study the geological data about the project, the
company said. Total SA, another of the Kashagan partners,
planned to join Zhenis exploration in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
