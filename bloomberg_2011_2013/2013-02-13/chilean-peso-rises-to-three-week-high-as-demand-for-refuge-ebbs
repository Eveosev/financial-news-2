Chile’s peso rose to a three-week
high as emerging-market currencies appreciated after Group of
Seven policy makers criticized market interventions.  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 470.65 per dollar at
the close in Santiago, the strongest level since Jan. 24. The
greenback dropped today against 16 of 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Chilean policy makers will probably leave the  benchmark
lending rate  at 5 percent for a 13th straight month at their
meeting tomorrow, according to all 17  economists  surveyed by
Bloomberg. The peso has gained since G7 officials make the
comments yesterday, said Alejandro Cuadrado, the head of Latin
American currency strategy at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA
in New York.  “We’re right at the border of 470,” Cuadrado said. “Our
forecast is moderately below that line but we do see people
stepping out at 470 so a consistent break through is going to be
difficult.”  Group of Seven ministers and central bank governors
reiterated their “longstanding commitment to market determined
exchange rates” in a statement yesterday.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $1.5 billion net bet against the currency on Feb. 11, down
from $1.6 billion on Feb. 8, according to data published today
by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
