The Treasury’s $24 billion sale of
10-year notes may draw a yield of 2.039 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  The notes, which mature in February 2023, yielded 2.035
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time. The  record-low  sale yield, 1.459 percent, was reached at
the July 11 offering.  The January auction’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.83, versus an average of 2.96 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 28.5 percent of the notes at last
month’s offering, compared with an average of 37 percent at the
past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.8 percent of
the offering in January, after buying a record-high 45.4 percent
of the notes at the July sale. The average at the past 10
auctions was 20.4 percent.  Ten-year U.S. debt has lost 1.9 percent this year,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, almost
double the 1 percent loss in the broader Treasury market. The
notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a 2.2 percent
gain by Treasuries overall.  This is the second of three auctions this week as the
government  sells  $72 billion of notes and bonds. It auctioned
$32 billion of three-year securities yesterday, drawing a
record-high direct bid of 26.9 percent, and is due to sell $16
billion of 30-year debt tomorrow.  The auctions will raise $8 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $64 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade government securities with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in U.S. debt sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
