European coal for 2014 declined the
most in two weeks as shipping rates rose, implying increasing
exports of the fuel from the U.S.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp next year dropped as much as 90 cents to $99.50 a metric
ton, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest decline since Jan. 31. The contract traded at $99.60 a
ton at 4 p.m. London time.  Returns for Panamax vessels that haul coal and other
commodities strengthened to a two-month high, figures from the
Baltic Exchange in London showed today. An increase in coal
exports this week amid colder weather is helping boost rates for
Panamaxes, the biggest vessels to navigate the Panama Canal,
according to analyst Dominic Hardy at Galbraith’s Ltd., a
London-based shipbroker.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
Marex Spectron Group Ltd., Credit Suisse Group AG, IHS
McCloskey, Tradition Financial Services and Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
