The Columbus Blue Jackets hired
 Jarmo Kekalainen  to replace Scott Howson as general manager,
making him the first European to hold that position in the
National Hockey League.  Kekalainen, who is from Finland, has been president and
general manager of Jokerit of the Finnish Elite League since
2010. He previously spent eight years with the NHL’s St. Louis
Blues, most recently as assistant general manager, and oversaw
the team’s amateur scouting and draft preparations.  “Hockey is a truly global game and there are very few
people whose knowledge of the game in North America and abroad
surpasses that of Jarmo Kekalainen,” Blue Jackets president of
hockey operations John Davidson said. “He is intelligent, hard-
working and a tremendous evaluator of talent.”  Kekalainen, 46, also worked in the Ottawa Senators’ hockey
operations department from 1995 through 2002. He appeared in 55
career NHL games over six seasons as a left wing for the
Senators and Boston Bruins.  Columbus is in last place in the Western Conference’s
Central Division with a 4-7-2 record this season. Howson, who
was fired yesterday, spent six seasons as the Blue Jackets’
general manager, with the team recording a 173-190-59 record
during his tenure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
