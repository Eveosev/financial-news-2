Kazakhstan said security and law-
enforcement officials broke up a terrorist group in the Atyrau
region, the central Asian nation’s biggest oil-producing area.  The authorities arrested the group’s leader and several of
its suspected members, the Atyrau-based Prosecutor General’s
Office said today on its  website  without specifying the number
of those arrested. Investigators found two sawed-off shotguns
and bomb components for home-made explosive devices, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
