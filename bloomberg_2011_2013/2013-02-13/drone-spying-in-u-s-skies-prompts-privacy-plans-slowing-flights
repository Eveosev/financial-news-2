Lawmakers in Congress and more than
a dozen states are seeking to shield Americans from spying by
domestic drones as the Federal Aviation Administration works to
integrate unmanned aircraft into the U.S. aviation system.  Drone boosters say that, after years of military use in
Iraq and Afghanistan, unmanned aircraft can be deployed in the
U.S. to monitor crops, film Hollywood movies and aid law
enforcement. The prospect for increased police and private drone
flights is leading to federal and state proposals to restrict
information gathering or require privacy disclosures.  “It’s aerial surveillance on steroids because drones are
so inexpensive and they’re potentially so wide-reaching in terms
of where they can look and what they can do,” said Chris
Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties
Union. “They represent a real new front in privacy invasion, so
people are right to be worried about them.”  Lawmakers from both parties are seeking privacy safeguards
for drone activities in U.S. skies. Representative  Ed Markey , a
Massachusetts Democrat, Representative  Ted Poe , a Texas
Republican, and Senator  Rand Paul , a Kentucky Republican, plan
to reintroduce separate drone privacy measures this year. Senate
Judiciary Chairman  Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat, said last
month he will scrutinize police use of drones.  The privacy concerns are raising more hurdles for the
emerging domestic drone industry, after Congress last year
passed a law to make unmanned aircraft as routine as airplanes
in U.S. skies by Sept. 30, 2015. The FAA missed its Dec. 31
target for naming six test sites for drone flights, citing in
part the need to address privacy issues.  Drone Market  The global market for drones will grow to $11.4 billion in
2022 from $6.6 billion this year, according to Teal Group Corp.
of Fairfax, Virginia, which analyzes the industry. Major drone
makers include  Northrop Grumman Corp. , General Atomics
Aeronautical Systems Inc., and  Aerovironment Inc. , which make
most sales to the U.S. military, said  Steve Zaloga , a Teal Group
analyst.  The FAA has granted a limited number of special permits to
non-commercial entities including the armed forces, police
departments and public universities to fly unmanned aircraft.
The number of permits grew to 345 as of November, up from 146 in
2009. Last May, the agency said public safety agencies could fly
drones weighing as much as 25 pounds without permits.  Under deadlines in the law, the FAA this month is to
release a five-year plan for introducing civil drones into the
country’s airspace.  Cheap Technology  “I am concerned by the growing use of drones by federal
and local authorities to spy on Americans here at home,” Leahy
said Jan. 16 in Washington. “This vast, emerging technology is
cheap, but just because it’s available doesn’t mean it helps
us.”  Markey’s bill last year required drone operators to detail
their plans for collecting and using data, and required law
enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant for surveillance, with
exceptions such as imminent danger to life or terrorist attacks.
Paul’s bill also required a warrant for the federal government
to gather evidence, with similar exceptions.  The Obama administration’s use of drone strikes by the
military outside the U.S. became a focus of last week’s Senate
confirmation hearing of  John Brennan , nominated to be the new
chief of the Central Intelligence Agency. Senators challenged
Brennan, the White House counterterrorism adviser, about the
legal foundation for drone strikes aimed at U.S. citizens linked
to al-Qaeda.  Limiting Surveillance  Lawmakers in 14 states including Florida, Texas and Oregon
have put forward bills limiting surveillance by drones,
according to the ACLU. The city council of Charlottesville,
Virginia, passed a resolution last week pledging not to use
drones, and Seattle Mayor  Mike McGinn  announced the city’s
police department would end its drone program.  Drones can be equipped with technology such as high-powered
cameras and thermal-imaging devices, and may raise issues
related to freedom of the press, privacy, trespassing, and other
areas of the law, according to a Jan. 30 report by the
nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.  In making plans for domestic drones, the FAA’s primary
focus should be safety, Representative  Howard McKeon , founder of
the Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus, and 15 other House
members said in Feb. 8 letter to Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood . The lawmakers said members of Congress and other
government agencies are addressing privacy issues, and that FAA
delays related to non-safety issues could have an “adverse
impact” on meeting its September 2015 deadline for integrating
drones into U.S. airspace.  Crops, Pipelines  Drones could let farmers monitor crops for soil moisture
and insects, take aerial photographs of houses for real estate
agents, or allow energy companies to monitor hundreds of miles
of remote pipelines, said Ben Gielow, government relations
manager at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems
International, an Arlington, Virginia-based trade group.  The FAA should stick to its safety mission, and existing
laws and federal policies should govern data collection by
drones, Gielow said.  Unmanned aircraft probably won’t be able to safely operate
in flight paths occupied by planes and helicopters until after
September 2015, according to  Lee Moak , president of the Air Line
Pilots Association union.  Drone operators need to demonstrate that they can sense and
steer clear of other aircraft and react to commands from air
traffic controllers before being allowed free access to the
skies, Moak said last year.  The Motion Picture Association of America, which represents
studios including  Walt Disney Co.  and  Viacom Inc. ’s Paramount
Pictures, is lobbying the FAA on drones as it seeks permission
to use the unmanned vehicles for film production, said  Howard Gantman , a spokesman.  Movie productions often want use a remote-controlled toy-
sized helicopter with a high-definition camera to get aerial
shots or film someone climbing a mountain, and are only able to
do so outside the U.S., Gantman said.  “We’re always looking for ways in which we can keep the
productions here instead of going overseas,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
