Thai marines killed at least 17
insurgents as they repelled an attack on a military base in the
country’s south, the latest clash in an uprising that has
stifled investment and left thousands of people dead.  More than 50 guerrillas dressed in military style uniforms
raided the marine station in  Narathiwat province  early this
morning, army spokesman Ditthaporn Sasasmit said by phone from
Bangkok. No member of the security forces was injured, he said.  “I would like to praise the officials for their good
intelligence that helped fend off this attack,” Defense
Minister  Sukumpol Suwannatat  told a press briefing in Bangkok
today. “We are still on high alert.” The government and army
will meet on Feb. 15 to discuss whether to impose curfews in the
nation’s three southernmost provinces, he said.  More than 5,000 people have been killed and thousands
injured since a separatist insurgency against Bangkok rule
flared up in 2004 in Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala provinces,
which border Malaysia. Separatists have fought for an
independent state since mainly Buddhist Thailand formally
annexed the autonomous Malay-Muslim sultanate in 1902.  The Muslim rebellion has curbed economic investment in the
south, where 14 provinces account for about 80 percent of
Thailand’s  rubber production . About 95 percent of Thailand’s
population of 66 million people is Buddhist.  -- Editors: Mark Williams, John Brinsley  To contact the reporter on this story:
