C. Vivian Stringer ’s bid to become
the fourth women’s college basketball coach with 900 wins was
thwarted last night when her Rutgers Scarlet Knights lost 60-57
at DePaul in a  Big East  conference game.  Stringer, 64, is trying to join Sylvia Hatchell of North
Carolina and retired coaches  Pat Summitt  of Tennessee and  Jody Conradt  of Texas as the only women with 900 victories.  Rutgers (14-9, 5-5 Big East) rallied from a 16-point
halftime deficit to tie the game in the closing minute of the
second half. Brittany Hrynko then made a 3-pointer with 10
seconds left to give DePaul (18-7, 7-4) the victory and end the
Scarlet Knights’ three-game winning streak.  The next chance at 900 wins for Stringer, a member of the
Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, will come Feb. 16 when Rutgers
hosts third-ranked Connecticut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
