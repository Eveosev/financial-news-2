Egis Nyrt ., the Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, jumped the most in 14 months
after fiscal first-quarter results beat estimates.  Shares  rose  as much as 4.8 percent, the most since November
2011, to 18,935 forint and traded at 18,900 forint at 12:55 p.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index  advanced  0.8 percent.  Egis said late yesterday its net income jumped 24 percent
in the October-to-December period from a year earlier as profit
from financial activities rose. First-quarter net income was 6.6
billion forint, up from 5.3 billion forint in the same period a
year earlier and exceeding the median estimate of 5.3 billion
forint from a Bloomberg poll of four analysts.  Egis reported “excellent” profit numbers, which may
prompt investors to be overweight in the stock “at the
expense” of its peer, Richter Nyrt., analysts at Budapest-based
brokerage Equilor Zrt. said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
