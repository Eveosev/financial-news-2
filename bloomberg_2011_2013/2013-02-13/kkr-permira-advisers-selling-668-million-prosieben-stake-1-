Permira Advisers LLP and KKR & Co.
are selling a 485 million-euro ($647 million) stake in
 ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG , a person familiar with the matter said.  The price for 19.7 million preferred shares, equivalent to
an 18 percent stake, was set at 24.60 euros, the person said,
declining to be named before an announcement.  The shares were offered in a range between 24.60 euros and
market price when the sale started yesterday. ProSiebenSat.1
fell as much as 5.4 percent, the most since August, and was
trading down 4.6 percent at 24.08 euros at 11:26 a.m. in
Frankfurt.  Deutsche Bank AG  is managing the sale.  KKR and Permira, which together own 53 percent of the
German broadcaster, may exit the investment this year by selling
their stake to another company or on the market, a person with
knowledge of the matter said this month. In addition to the 18
percent of the preferred shares, which don’t carry voting
rights, KKR and Permira’s holding vehicle also  owns  88 percent
of the voting common stock.  In December, ProSiebenSat.1 agreed to sell its SBS Nordic
unit, which included TV networks in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
Finland, for $1.7 billion. The company said then that investors
would vote on converting preferred shares into exchange-listed
common stock, which would facilitate an exit for KKR and
Permira.  Companies in Europe raised $10.9 billion from share sales
this year, compared with $6.4 billion in the same period in
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UBS AG is ranked
first in managing the share sales this year, followed by
Deutsche Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
