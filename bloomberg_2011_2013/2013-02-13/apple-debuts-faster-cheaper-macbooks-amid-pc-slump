Apple Inc.  introduced more
affordable versions of the MacBook with faster processors as the
company works to woo price-conscious consumers amid slumping
sales in the personal-computer market.  A 13-inch MacBook Pro with a high-resolution retina display
and 128 gigabytes of flash storage goes on sale today in the
Apple Online Store for $1,499, the Cupertino, California-based
company said in a statement. A model with a 2.6 gigahertz
processor and 256 gigabytes of flash will cost $1,699 -- the
same price Apple announced in October for a slower machine with
half the storage.  Worldwide PC shipments declined 3.2 percent last year as
consumers and retailers shifted to tablets and smartphones,
according to researcher IDC, after a 1.7 percent gain in 2011.
Apple’s latest MacBook lineup is part of a push to make products
thinner and smaller without sacrificing performance.  Apple also said it will sell a 13-inch MacBook Air with 256
gigabytes of flash for $1,399, a $100 discount off the price the
company announced in June.  The 15-inch MacBook Pro with a retina display now has a
faster 2.4 gigahertz quad-core processor, while a version with
more features comes with 2.7 gigahertz and 16 gigabytes of
memory, the company said.  Shares of Apple fell less than 1 percent to $467.01 at the
close in New York, leaving the shares down 12 percent this year,
compared with a 6.6 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
