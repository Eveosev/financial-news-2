Defense Secretary  Philip Hammond 
said the U.K. government has started planning to repatriate 4
billion pounds ($6 billion) of military equipment from
Afghanistan via Pakistan and Uzbekistan.  By the end of this year, the U.K. will reduce the number of
military personnel in Afghanistan to 5,200 from 9,000. The armed
forces also need to transport home the equivalent of 6,500 20-
foot containers of equipment, together with about 2,500
vehicles.  Some of the kit will return to the U.K. via Pakistan, yet
with that southern route unable to provide enough capacity,
Hammond has agreed with the Uzbek government that it will allow
non-dangerous equipment to pass through its territory.  “Uzbekistan has already played a constructive role in
helping to secure Afghanistan’s stability but will face
increased security challenges” once allied forces have
withdrawn, Hammond said in a written statement to Parliament in
London today. “We have therefore been examining options for
gifting surplus U.K. equipment to help meet those challenges.”  Uzbekistan can expect gifts of surplus Leyland DAF trucks
and Land Rover spares, Hammond said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
