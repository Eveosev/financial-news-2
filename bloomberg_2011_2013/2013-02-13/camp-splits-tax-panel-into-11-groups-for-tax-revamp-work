The U.S. House Ways and Means
Committee will break into 11 bipartisan groups to work on
details of a tax-code overhaul, said Representatives  Dave Camp ,
the committee’s chairman, and  Sander Levin , the top Democrat.  The groups, each led by a Republican with a Democrat as
vice chairman, will focus on areas such as energy, financial
services, education, manufacturing and retirement. In each area,
the groups will conduct research and return with a report by
April 15.  “These working groups will be one more way for the
committee to gather the necessary information to produce the
best possible legislation,” Camp said in a statement.  Camp, a Michigan Republican, has said the committee will
advance a rewrite of the U.S. tax code this year that won’t
raise additional revenue and will lower tax rates for
individuals and corporations.  He has released discussion drafts of potential changes to
taxation of foreign income of U.S.-based companies and financial
products such as derivatives.  Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said in a statement that the
research will allow for “in-depth fact-finding.”  Democrats, including Levin and President  Barack Obama , want
to rewrite the code to raise more tax revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
