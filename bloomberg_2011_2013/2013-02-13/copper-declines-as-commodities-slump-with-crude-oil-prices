Copper futures fell for the second
time in three days as crude-oil prices slipped, dragging
commodities lower.  Oil prices dropped as much as 0.9 percent after a U.S.
government report showed crude output jumped to the highest in
20 years. Through yesterday, the dollar gained 0.4 percent
against a basket of six currencies this year, reducing the
appeal of commodities as alternative investments. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials , which is weighted by
more than 50 percent to energy products, was little changed in
New York, erasing earlier gains.  “There’s a little nervousness in the markets over energy
prices, and that’s affecting copper,”  Sterling Smith , a futures
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “The dollar being back in positive territory also
isn’t creating an ideal environment. None of this is giving any
impetus for buyers to chase the market.”  Copper for delivery in three months decreased 0.1 percent
to settle at $8,226 a metric ton ($3.73 a pound) on the London
Metal Exchange. Zinc and lead were also lower in London, while
aluminum, nickel and tin gained.  Financial markets are closed this week for the Lunar New
Year holiday in China, the world’s biggest metals consumer.  “The China holiday has put a major participant in the
markets on the sideline,” Smith said.  In New York, copper futures for March delivery declined
less than 0.1 percent to close at $3.7425 a pound at 1:13 p.m on
the Comex. The price has climbed 2.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
