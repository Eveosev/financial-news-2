Crude oil options volatility rose
for the first time in a week, gaining from the lowest level
since 1995 as the underlying futures fell.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 17.48 percent on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 3:35 p.m., up from 17.45 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for April delivery dropped 47
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $97.60 a barrel on the Nymex. March
futures sank 50 cents to $97.01.  WTI slipped after Iran said it was nearing agreement with
nuclear inspectors and as the Energy Information Administration
said U.S. oil output rose to the highest level in 20 years.  The U.S. pumped 7.06 million barrels a day last week, the
most since December 1992. Crude  stockpiles  climbed 560,000
barrels to 372.2 million, according to the Energy Departmentâ€™s
statistical arm.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $96 puts, which fell 9 cents to 12 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,737 contracts. The second-most active were March $95
puts. They declined 6 cents to 6 cents a barrel with 2,364 lots
exchanged.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 61
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs. In the
previous session, puts accounted for 50.1 percent of volume.  March $98 calls were the most active options yesterday,
increasing 2 cents to 38 cents a barrel with 5,220 contracts
trading. March $99 calls rose 3 cents to 15 cents a barrel on
5,209 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $85 puts with 42,491
contracts. Next were March $110 calls at 40,868 and April $110
