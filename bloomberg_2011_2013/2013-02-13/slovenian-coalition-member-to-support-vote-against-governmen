Slovenia’s People’s party, a member
of  Prime Minister Janez Jansa ’s coalition government, will
support a no confidence vote in the Cabinet that could lead to
early elections,  TV Slovenija  reported, citing leader Radovan
Zerjav.  The party decided it won’t be part of a technical
administration that is being pushed by the largest opposition
party Positive Slovenia, Zerjav was quoted as saying by the
public broadcaster late yesterday.  The People’s party has said it will leave Jansa’s coalition
after two groups already abandoned the government, leaving it
short of the 46-vote majority needed in the 90-member assembly
to pass legislation.  Slovenia was plunged into a political crisis over
corruption allegations against Jansa as the euro-region nation
works on a bank recapitalization plan and other overhaul
measures that are meant to help avoid an international bailout
and pull its economy out of the second recession in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
