GPT Group , Australia’s second-
biggest diversified property trust, said full-year profit more
than doubled after the value of its properties rose.  Net income  climbed to A$594.5 million ($615.5 million) in
the 12 months to Dec. 31 from A$246.2 million a year earlier,
the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange. Operating income rose to A$456.4 million from
A$438.8 million a year ago.  GPT in December made an offer for the commercial property
and development businesses of smaller rival  Australand Ltd. 
While the target rejected the bid, saying it didn’t offer
compelling value, GPT today reiterated plans to expand its real
estate funds management and development businesses, optimize
existing assets and acquire new properties.  “GPT’s focus in 2012 was on its ‘optimize and grow’
strategy and it is pleasing to see that this approach continues
to deliver results,”  Michael Cameron , managing director of GPT,
said in today’s statement.  Net tangible assets rose to A$3.73 a share from A$3.59 a
year earlier. GPT will pay a  dividend  of 19.3 Australian cents a
share, up from 17.8 cents a year earlier, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
