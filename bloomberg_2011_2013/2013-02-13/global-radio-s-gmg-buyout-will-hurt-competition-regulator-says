Global Radio Group Ltd.’s completed
acquisition of GMG Radio Holdings Ltd. could lead to higher
prices for advertisers in seven areas of Britain, the U.K.’s
Competition Commission said in a provisional decision.  In areas where the companies overlap and compete,
advertisers that buy airtime through non-contracted agencies
“on a campaign-by-campaign basis” may see an increase in costs
for ads, sponsorships and promotional activity, the regulator
said today in a  statement  on its website.  For those who buy through contracted agencies and for
national campaigns, there “would not be significantly adversely
affected,” the Competition Commission said. London won’t be
affected, it said.  Global Radio, owner of Britain’s Classic FM station,
purchased GMG Radio, which operates several stations across the
U.K. under the Real or Smooth brand, in June. It didn’t disclose
the price it paid to Guardian Media Group.  “As provisional findings, these do not represent the CC’s
final report, and as such, it would not be appropriate to
comment,” Global Radio said in a statement on its website.  Maria Miller , the U.K.’s culture secretary, decided in
October that the deal shouldn’t be reviewed on media plurality
grounds and should be treated as an ordinary merger. Her
predecessor,  Jeremy Hunt , previously ordered the agency and
media regulator Ofcom to examine whether the deal was in the
public interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
