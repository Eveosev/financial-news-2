Italian borrowing costs rose at a
bond auction for the first time since October, less than two
weeks before a general election that is fueling investors
concern about political stability in Italy.  The Treasury in Rome today sold 3.45 billion euros of a
2015 note at 2.30 percent, up from the 1.85 percent paid Jan.
11. The Treasury also managed to sell longer-term debt, placing
1.75 billion euros of securities maturing in 2026 and 2040
respectively. Investors bid 2015 1.37 times the amount of three-
year bonds offered, down from 1.45 times last month.  Five opinion polls, published before a ban kicked in Feb.
9, indicated Democratic Party leader  Pier Luigi Bersani  was
leading his rival  Silvio Berlusconi  by an average of 6
percentage points. Still, Bersani may fall short of a majority
in the Senate, where the race is more unpredictable as seats are
doled out on a regional basis.  Bersani’s bloc “is still on track to win the lower house,
but will likely have to strike a deal” with outgoing Prime
Minister Mario Monti to control the Senate, Eurasia Group
analysts including  Wolfango Piccoli  said in an e-mailed note
yesterday. “In the most probable outcome, Bersani’s coalition
and Monti together will have a slim Senate majority.”  Market Appetite  Italy’s 10-year bond yield declined 4 basis points to 4.47
percent at 11:36 a.m. in Rome, leaving the difference with
German debt at 280 basis points.  The Treasury tested the appetite for long-term debt today.
The Treasury is considering selling a new 30-year bond when
market conditions are right, a spokesman said Jan. 16.  Today Italy sold the 2026 and 2040 bonds at 4.55 percent
and 5.07 percent respectively. The Treasury also sold 1.43
billion euros of a floating bond due in 2017 to yield 2.55
percent.  The auction comes during the ban on opinion polls, which
aims to protect voters ahead of the Feb. 24-25 vote, making it
impossible for Italians to gauge support for their candidates.  “The upcoming elections have triggered some profit taking
on BTPs,”  Elia Lattuga , fixed-income strategists at  UniCredit
SpA , wrote in a note to investors yesterday. “While we remain
positive in a medium-term horizon, we think volatility will
likely prevail in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
