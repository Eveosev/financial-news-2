Waitrose Ltd., the upmarket U.K.
grocery chain, said it will build a factory to produce frozen
meat products after it withdrew frozen beef meatballs that
contained pork.  The plant will be located at the Yorkshire base of its
fresh beef supplier Dovecote Park and will become operational
within three months, Waitrose said in a statement today.  The supermarket chain is the latest to get embroiled in the
U.K.’s mislabeled meat scandal, which has now spread to Europe.
Waitrose withdrew its budget range frozen meatballs late
yesterday. The U.K.’s Minister of State for the Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs  David Heath  said he told food industry
representatives this morning that the current situation is
“totally unacceptable.”  Retailers and food distributors had assured Heath they are
on track to share “meaningful” test results by Feb. 15, when
they have to submit their findings on testing for horse meat in
beef products with the Food Standards Agency, he said.  The scandal widened last night when the FSA raided two meat
processing plants, one in West Yorkshire and one in West Wales,
in an investigation into horse meat in meat products supposed to
be beef for kebabs and burgers, according to a statement on the
agency’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
