Egyptian authorities have begun
flooding some of the tunnels that stretch into the Gaza Strip in
an effort to curb smuggling of goods such as diesel and building
materials, a security official said.  Authorities have also begun intercepting goods en route to
the tunnels that run from the north of the Sinai peninsula in
Egypt to the Palestinian territory, Mohamed Saeed, the head of
criminal investigations in the area, said by phone today.  Gazaâ€™s Hamas rulers had welcomed the election of Islamist
President  Mohamed Mursi  in June as paving the way for stronger
links with the movement, dubbed a terrorist organization by the
U.S. and Israel. An attack on Egyptian border guards last year
has partly stifled those hopes, and Mursi has yet to
significantly deviate from the policies in place under his
ousted predecessor,  Hosni Mubarak .  Mursi has said Egypt remains committed to the Palestinian
quest for independence. Talks paving the way for a possible
reconciliation between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have
been taking place intermittently in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
