British health authorities
identified an additional case of a new respiratory virus in a
relative of a person diagnosed this week, suggesting person-to-
person transmission of the lethal pathogen.  The patient, who is in intensive care in a hospital in
Birmingham, has no recent travel history and has an existing
health condition that may have made him or her more susceptible
to respiratory infections, the  Health Protection Authority  said
in a statement today, without specifying the medical condition
or the patient’s gender or age.  The infection with the new coronavirus is the third in the
U.K. and the 11th globally, with five deaths. While person-to-
person transmission may have occurred in some other cases in the
Middle East, the risk of infection is considered low,  according 
to the Geneva-based World Health Organization.  “If the novel coronavirus were more infectious, we would
have expected to have seen a larger number of cases than we have
seen since the first case was reported three months ago,” John
Watson, head of the HPA’s respiratory diseases department, said
in the statement. “The risk associated with the novel
coronavirus to the general U.K. population remains very low.”  Coronaviruses are a family of pathogens that cause
illnesses ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which sickened more than 8,000
people and killed 774 in 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO.
While the new virus is related to the one that causes SARS, it
appears far less transmissible, according to the WHO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
