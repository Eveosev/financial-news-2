African Barrick Gold Plc , the
Tanzania-focused producer of the precious metal, forecast the
lowest output since its shares began trading in London in 2010
amid a review of operations to cut costs.  The company targets  production  of 540,000 ounces to 600,000
ounces of gold in 2013, a drop of as much as 14 percent from
last year’s figure of 626,212 ounces. Costs will be $925 to $975
an ounce, it said in a statement today. The stock fell 11
percent to 302 pence by the close, the lowest since it listed in
London.  African Barrick has been dogged by operational setbacks
since it was spun off from Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp., and
has struggled to meet production targets. The company is
reviewing its operations to cut costs that have ballooned by 67
percent since 2010.  “Another disappointing result from a serial
disappointer,” Numis Securities Ltd. said in a note to
investors. Numis had predicted that the 2013 production target
would be 643,000 ounces at a cost of $918 an ounce.  African Barrick is aiming for the “top end” of its output
target, and under “normal” conditions its mines should produce
about 600,000 ounces a year, Chief Executive Officer  Greg Hawkins  said in a telephone interview. The company will produce
about 650,000 ounces in 2014 after an expansion at its
Bulyanhulu mine. Output may increase to about 700,000 ounces in
2015, Hawkins said.  African Barrick reported full-year net income of $59.5
million compared with $274.9 million a year earlier. Sales fell
11 percent to $1.09 billion, the London-based company said.  Barrick Gold  ended talks last month to sell its 74 percent
stake in African Barrick to China National Gold Group Corp.
Barrick’s plan to dispose of its holding has “not gone away
completely,” Hawkins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
