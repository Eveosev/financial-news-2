Groupon Inc.  surged the most in two
months amid optimism that its new e-commerce service may expand
to more cities, bolstering sales.  The shares advanced 5.4 percent to $5.58 at the close in
New York, for the biggest gain since Dec. 7. Groupon has
 declined  72 percent since an initial public offering in November
2011, compared with a 21 percent increase for the Russell 1000
Index in the same period.  Groupon, operator of the largest daily-deals website, is
expanding beyond its coupon roots as some consumers and
retailers cool on e-mailed discounts. A local e-commerce
marketplace Groupon began a few months ago in Chicago and New
York will boost revenue as it expands nationwide over the coming
quarters, according to  Arvind Bhatia , an analyst at Sterne Agee
& Leach Inc.  “Groupon is in the midst of evolving beyond its
traditional push e-mail business,” he wrote in a research
report today. Bhatia upgraded the shares with a $9 target price.  Customers are pulled into Groupon’s e-commerce marketplace
through advertising on search engines, a method that’s more
effective than e-mailed discounts because the promotions appear
on the screen without requiring users to open messages, Bhatia
said. Currently, less than 5 percent of Groupon’s  revenue  comes
from promotions on Web-search sites, he said.  “This marketplace has the potential to become an important
growth driver for Groupon,” Bhatia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
