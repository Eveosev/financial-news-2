More positive news on Turkish
external accounts strengthens “our favourable view” toward
lira; recent backup is “buying opportunity,”  Ilan Solot,
London-based strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, says by e-
mail today.
* “Other weak spot, high inflation, has also improved,” Solot
says
* “Only thing missing now is growth,” Solot says and adds
c.bank will “retain its easing bias well into 2013”
* Break below 1.7600/$ and then recent low near 1.7450/$ is
needed to target 2012-low of close 1.7360/$
* Lira gains 0.3% to 1.7673 per dollar at 1:22pm in Istanbul,
set for highest since Feb. 5.
* NOTE: Dec. current-account deficit at $4.66b, according to
c.bank data published on website today, beats  $5.4b median est.
