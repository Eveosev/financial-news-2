Italian stocks may rally 8 percent
in the next two weeks after they held above a support line
validating a so-called inverted head-and-shoulders pattern,
according to a technical analyst at ING Groep NV.  The benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  bounced off a level on Feb. 7
that would have annulled the bullish reversal pattern, said
 Roelof-Jan van den Akker , senior technical analyst at ING in
Amsterdam. That indicates the gauge will climb back to the Jan.
30 intraday high of 17,983.63, an 8 percent gain from
yesterday’s close, before rallying further, he said.  “We will see a quick return to the 18,000 level,” Van den
Akker said in a phone interview, adding that the gauge formed
the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern with three consecutive
troughs at the end of last year. “It may reach 19,000 in the
first half of this year. What we would like to see now is the
index closing above its 50-day moving average, further
confirming this bullish trend.”  A rally to 19,000 represents a 14 percent advance from
yesterday’s close of 16,644.45. The FTSE MIB rose 0.7 percent to
16,754.81 at 3:48 p.m. in Milan today, on course to end higher
than the 50-day moving average of 16,735.65, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Italian stocks surged 7.2 in January, before declining 4.6
percent this month though yesterday.  Stocks fell  as polls showed
Silvio Berlusconi’s political party gained support before the
country’s parliamentary elections on Feb. 24-25, fueling concern
he may secure a fourth stint as prime minister and replace
current premier Mario Monti.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
