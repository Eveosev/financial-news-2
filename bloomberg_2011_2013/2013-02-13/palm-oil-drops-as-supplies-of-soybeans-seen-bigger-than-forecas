Palm oil dropped the most in more
than six weeks as reserves in Malaysia, the world’s second-
largest producer, dropped less than expected last month from a
record in December.  The contract for delivery in April fell 2.2 percent to
close at 2,505 ringgit ($811) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest level for the most-active
contract since Jan. 29, and the steepest drop since Dec. 31.
Trade restarted today after a two-day break on Feb. 11 and 12
for the Lunar New Year.  Inventories  fell 1.9 percent to 2.58 million tons last
month from 2.63 million in December, the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board said today. The drop in reserves was less than the median
estimate of a decline to 2.53 million tons in a Bloomberg
survey.  Output  fell 10 percent to 1.6 million tons, while
exports slid 1.6 percent to 1.62 million tons, the board said.  “This will have a negative impact on prices because
inventories are still high,”  Prathamesh Mallya , an analyst at
AnandRathi Commodities Ltd., said from Mumbai. Prices may
continue to be pressured in the next two days “because
inventories at such high levels will not be tolerated, unless
and until we see demand pouring in from India.”  Soybean oil for March delivery dropped 0.8 percent to 50.71
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, heading for a
seventh straight day of losses. Soybean oil, which is a
substitute for palm oil in food and fuel uses, costs about 1.38
times the price of palm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
