The price of liquefied natural gas
in Asia broke a four-month streak of gains, holding unchanged at
a record high on signs of softer demand, according to World Gas
Intelligence, an energy research company.  Spot cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks cost
$19.40 per million British thermal units in northeast Asia, WGI
said on its website today. The price in southwest Europe fell
1.4 percent to $14.50, according to WGI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
