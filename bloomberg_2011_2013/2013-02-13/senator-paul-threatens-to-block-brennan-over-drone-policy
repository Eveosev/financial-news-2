Republican Senator  Rand Paul  said he
will hold up  John Brennan ’s nomination as director of the
Central Intelligence Agency unless Brennan provides more
information about the legality of targeting drone strikes
against Americans found to be members of al-Qaeda.  “I have asked Mr. Brennan if he believed that the
president has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a
drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and my
question remains unanswered,” Paul of Kentucky said today in a
statement. “I will not allow a vote on this nomination until
Mr. Brennan openly responds to the questions and concerns my
colleagues and I share.”  Brennan’s confirmation hearing before the Senate
intelligence panel on Feb. 7 brought scrutiny of the
administration’s use of armed drones over countries such as
Pakistan and Yemen, with limited oversight by Congress or the
judiciary. Senators from both parties prodded Brennan, who
helped shape the drone policy as White House counterterrorism
adviser, to explain why the administration has resisted sharing
the legal basis for such strikes.  On the morning of Brennan’s hearing, the Justice
Department, under President  Barack Obama ’s instructions,
provided members of the House and Senate intelligence panels
with one such document, a classified justification for drone
strikes against U.S. citizens deemed to be terrorists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
