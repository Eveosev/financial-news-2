Asia’s benchmark  stocks  gauge traded
at an 18-month high as earnings from  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia  and Leighton Holdings Ltd. boosted investor optimism.
Japanese shares dropped as a stronger yen soured the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Commonwealth Bank, the nation’s largest lender, climbed 2.4
percent as retail banking and wealth management boosted first-
half profit by 1 percent. Leighton, Australia’s largest
construction company, surged 11 percent after returning to full-
year profit and reducing debt levels. Toyota Motor Corp. slid
1.8 percent in Tokyo as the yen gained against all 16 major
peers. Gree Inc., a Japanese social-network game operator,
plunged after cutting its profit forecast.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained less than 0.1 percent to
133.49 as of 3:23 p.m in Tokyo. About the same number of shares
rose and fell. Equity markets in Singapore and Malaysia reopened
today after public holidays, while markets in China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Vietnam remain shut.  “Things look pretty positive,” said  Kirk Hartman , Los
Angeles-based chief investment officer at Wells Capital
Management, where he helps oversee about $331 billion. “I like
Asia. Companies are beating earnings estimates. You have the
U.S. economy kicking into gear and China also appears to be
coming back,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.9 percent, surpassing the
5,000 level and closing at the highest level since September
2008. Volume in Australia was about 22 percent higher than the
30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. South Korea’s
Kospi Index advanced 1.6 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times
rose 0.9 percent.  Asian Earnings  Of the 299 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that
reported  earnings  this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 53 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 53
percent have missed sales projections. That compares with 74
percent of S&P 500 companies that topped profit forecasts during
the period, while 34 percent fell short of sales estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  CBA rose 2.4 percent to A$67.11. Leighton soared 11 percent
to A$23.14.  Gree  slumped 15 percent to 1,150 yen in Tokyo after
cutting its outlook on delays to new social-networking games.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.9 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the S&P 500 and a multiple of 12.3 for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1
percent. The gauge climbed 0.2 percent yesterday to the highest
level since November 2007 as earnings topped estimates. That
left the gauge less than 3 percent below its record of 1,565.15
reached in October 2007, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average
is about 1 percent from its all-time high of 14,164.53.  The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5 percent in 2013 as U.S.
lawmakers reached a budget compromise and companies reported
better-than-estimated profits. That’s more than double the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index’s gain of 3.1 percent this year through
yesterday.  Yen Strengthens  Toyota  slid 1.8 percent to 4,830 yen. The yen rose against
all 16 major peers after an official from the Group of Seven
nations, who requested not to be further identified, said the
group is concerned about excess moves in the yen and investors
misinterpreted an earlier statement on exchange rates. The
clarification came hours after the world’s major industrial
economies appeared to signal acceptance of a weaker Japanese
currency as long as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government
didn’t actively pursue devaluation.  Data tomorrow may show Japan’s economy emerged from its
third recession in five years last quarter as cold weather
boosted consumption, bolstering Abe’s campaign to revive growth.
 Gross domestic product  probably expanded an annualized 0.4
percent the three months through December, according to the
median forecast in a survey of 32 economists. Banks including
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. raised their forecasts
from a contraction this month after a gauge of consumption rose.  The Bank of Japan will conclude a two-day policy meeting
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
