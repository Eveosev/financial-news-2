Tata Steel Ltd. , India’s biggest
producer, posted a third-quarter loss almost four times greater
than analysts estimated as the economic slowdown in its biggest
market spurred a decline in demand and prices.  The  loss , including that of unit Tata Steel Europe Ltd.,
widened to 7.63 billion rupees ($142 million) in the three
months ended Dec. 31 from 6.03 billion rupees a year earlier,
the Mumbai-based company said today in a statement. The median
loss estimate of 25 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 1.99
billion rupees. Sales fell 3.5 percent to 318.2 billion rupees.  Steel-industry earnings have slumped as Europe’s economic
crisis saps demand and slower Chinese growth weighs on commodity
prices. Steelmakers in Europe, where Tata makes two-thirds of
its production, are grappling with excess capacity, falling
prices and rising operating costs. The region has a capacity to
make about 210 million metric tons of steel a year, while demand
in a “normal market” is 150 million to 160 million tons,
according to industry lobby group Eurofer.  “Prices in Europe fell much more than the decrease in raw
material prices,” group Chief Financial Officer  Koushik Chatterjee  told reporters on a conference call.  Tata Steel’s  global depositary receipts  in London fell as
much as 6.7 percent to $6.795 and traded at $6.845 as of 12:16
p.m. local time. The Mumbai-traded shares closed down 2.3
percent to 376 rupees before the earnings were announced. The
benchmark Sensitive Index gained 0.2 percent today.  Average Revenue  The company’s average revenue on steel sales was $1,000 a
ton in the quarter, compared with $1,031 a ton a year ago, he
said. Deliveries fell 4 percent from the three months ended Sept.
30, according to a company statement. Deliveries from the
company’s Jamshedpur mill in India’s eastern Jharkhand state
rose 17 percent.  Steel sales volume was little changed at 5.83 million tons
in the quarter. Total costs were 313.3 billion rupees, compared
with 323.5 billion rupees. Mumbai-based Tata Steel earned 558.6
million rupees from sources other than its main business, while
finance expenses were little changed at 10.3 billion rupees.  Prices of the benchmark hot-rolled steel, used in making
cars and electronic appliances, in the quarter declined more
than 11 percent, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The losses at
Tata Steel were limited by a drop in prices of coking coal and
iron ore, key steelmaking ingredients, and higher earnings at
its Indian operations.  Spot iron ore prices of the 62 percent metal content
delivered at Tianjin port in China dropped 14 percent in the
last quarter compared with a year ago, according to The Steel
Index. Coking coal quarterly contract prices fell 40 percent in
the same period. Tata depends on international suppliers to meet
its raw material needs in Europe.  Rival  ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest steel producer,
reported on Feb. 6 fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization fell to $1.32 billion from $1.71
billion a year earlier. That beat the $1.25 billion median
estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
