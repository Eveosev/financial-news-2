U.K. natural gas for next-day
delivery fell by the most in a week as forecasters predicted
higher-than-average temperatures, cutting demand for the fuel.  Within-day gas was little changed, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. The average temperature in the U.K.
tomorrow will be 5.6 degrees Celsius (42 Fahrenheit), up from
0.6 degrees today and above the seasonal normal of 5 degrees,
according to an EWMWF model provided to Bloomberg by
MetraWeather.  Gas for tomorrow slid as much as 2.7 percent to 67.5 pence
a therm, the biggest intraday decline since Feb. 5, before
trading at 67.7 pence at 10:04 a.m. London time.  Month-ahead  gas
climbed 0.5 percent to 66.2 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to
$10.33 per million British thermal units and compares with $3.25
per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Demand  in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow is predicted to
be 365 million cubic meters, after reaching 370 million
yesterday, the most since Jan. 24, National Grid Plc data show.
The  delivery network  will contain 367 million cubic meters of
gas at the end of the period, down from 352 million at the
beginning, grid data show.  Flows from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of imported
gas, were at a rate of 113 million cubic meters a day compared
with a 10-day average of 106 million, Gassco AS data show.
Imports from the  Netherlands  were at 39 million cubic meters a
day, the most since Jan. 24.  Power Production  Gas accounted for 35 percent of U.K. power production at
10:15 a.m., National Grid data show. Coal generated 41 percent,
nuclear 16 percent and wind 6.6 percent.  RWE AG said three 250-megawatt units at its biomass power
plant in Tilbury were halted because of fuel supply issue. They
will resume production tomorrow, RWE said on its website.  U.K. wind production will peak at 3,284 megawatts tomorrow
after reaching 4,205 megawatts today, Bloomberg calculations
show. It reached a  record  5,082 megawatts Feb. 3, grid data
show.  Electricity  for tomorrow fell 4.4 percent to 49.25 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
