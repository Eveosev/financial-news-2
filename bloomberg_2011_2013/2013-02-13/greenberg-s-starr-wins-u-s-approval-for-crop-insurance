Maurice “Hank” Greenberg ’s Starr
Cos. is expanding in U.S. crop insurance, joining  Validus
Holdings Ltd.  in bets on agriculture after last year’s drought
fueled higher costs for the coverage.  The Starr Indemnity & Liability Co. unit won approval to
participate in a government-backed program from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, the company said today in a
statement. The insurer plans to cover crops including corn,
soybeans and wheat,  Charles Dangelo , chief executive officer of
Starr Indemnity, said in a phone interview.  “It’s still relatively new” for the insurer to be in the
crop business, he said. The company will target “the heartland
of the U.S.,” including states such as Indiana, Illinois,
Minnesota, Nebraska and Texas, he said.  Private insurers sell and administer the coverage in the
U.S. and get a backstop from the federal government. Australia’s
QBE Insurance Group Ltd. and Bermuda-based Validus are among
companies that expanded in the business in the U.S. The top
sellers of the coverage are Wells Fargo & Co. and Ace Ltd., led
by Hank Greenberg’s son  Evan Greenberg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
