Directors at AMR Corp.’s American Airlines and US Airways Group Inc. approved an $11 billion merger that will create the world’s largest carrier, people familiar with the matter said.  The boards voted today after the two sides agreed to final terms, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Those decisions set the stage for an announcement tomorrow, the people said.
