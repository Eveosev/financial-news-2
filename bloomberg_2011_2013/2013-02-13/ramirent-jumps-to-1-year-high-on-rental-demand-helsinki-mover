Ramirent Oyj , which rents equipment
including scissor lifts and tower cranes, rose to the highest
price in almost a year in Helsinki trading after Danske Bank A/S
said an increase in demand will buoy the shares.  Ramirent  rose  as much as 4.1 percent to 8.07 euros, the
highest intraday price since March 5. The shares were up 3.9
percent at 8.05 euros as of 12:35 p.m. in the Finnish capital,
with trading volume more than three times the three-month daily
average.  “Given indications of largely stable pricing in Nordic
machinery rentals and likely improvement in volume outlook for
2014, we lift our target price to 9.5 euros a share and keep our
buy rating,” Danske Bank analysts said in a note to clients
today. Even so, earnings will decline in the first six months,
they said.  In southern Finland and northern Sweden, demand is good for
construction equipment for industrial building, Chief Executive
Officer  Magnus Rosen  said on a  conference call  yesterday.
Overall demand is good in Stockholm, western Sweden and Norway,
he said. Finland, Sweden and Norway account for about 75 percent
of Ramirent’s sales.  “It’s in general a good business atmosphere in Norway,”
Rosen said. “Sometimes the sky is the limit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
