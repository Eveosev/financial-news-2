Whole Foods Market Inc ., the largest
natural-foods store in the U.S., fell as much as 8.2 percent in
late trading yesterday after lowering its sales forecast for
fiscal 2013.  The shares slid 6.6 percent to $90.51 at 4:18 p.m. in New
York and earlier  plunged  as low as $89. Whole Foods had gained
20 percent in the 12 months through the close of regular trading
yesterday, compared with a 12 percent gain for the Standard &
Poorâ€™s 500 Index.  Sales may increase as much as 11 percent in fiscal 2013,
compared with a previous estimate for growth of as much as 12
percent, the Austin, Texas-based company said yesterday in a
statement. That implies sales of about $13 billion. Analysts
estimated $13.1 billion, the average of 24 projections compiled
by Bloomberg.  Supermarkets are fighting for market share as American
grocery-store sales stagnate and some consumers receive smaller
paychecks. Industry revenue was forecast to increase 0.4 percent
to about $491 billion in 2012, according to a June report from
researcher IBISWorld Inc. Whole Foods, which has about 345
stores, has sought to appeal to customers with its antibiotic-
free meat and organic produce.  The grocer reiterated its profit forecast of as much as
$2.87 a share for the fiscal year ending in September. Analysts
estimate $2.90, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
