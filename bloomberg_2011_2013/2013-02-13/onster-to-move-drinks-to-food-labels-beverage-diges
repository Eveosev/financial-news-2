Monster Beverage Corp. , the largest
U.S. energy-drink maker by sales volume, will label its
beverages’ ingredients under the federal guidelines for food
products and include caffeine content, Beverage Digest reported.  Labels on cans will list “nutrition facts” instead of
“supplement facts,” qualifying the beverages as food items
under U.S. Food and Drug Administration policies, Monster Chief
Executive Officer  Rodney Sacks  told Beverage Digest.  The change is intended to blunt criticism that Sacks said
was incorrect and unfounded, Beverage Digest said.  U.S. regulators, including the FDA, have been investigating
the drinks’ safety after they were linked to deaths and
hospitalizations. The agency is looking into whether the
beverages can cause harm when consumed in excess or by young
people or those with heart conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
