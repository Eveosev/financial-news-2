Mohamed El-Erian , chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said currencies
are suffering from the impact of aggressive monetary policies
around the world.  Markets are trying to “navigate the reality that everybody
is trying to devalue their currencies,” El-Erian said today in
a Bloomberg Television interview with Betty Liu. “There is too
much reliance on central banks and currencies are the collateral
damage,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
