BlackRock Inc.’s  Robert Kapito,
president of the world’s largest asset manager, said the firm
sees an opportunity to grow by selling more funds to
individuals.  “Retail is an enormous growth opportunity,” Kapito said
today at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum. New York-
based BlackRock is still “underpenetrated” in the U.S. retail
market, excluding exchange-traded funds, with less than a 2
percent market share for assets under management in open-end
mutual funds, he said.  BlackRock, which manages $3.79 trillion, has been urging
investors to get back into higher-yielding assets such as stocks
as it seeks to expand its retail business. Kapito, along with
Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive officer, have said
that clients need to diversify and can be harmed by staying in
cash-like products.  Kapito said individuals represents about 12 percent of
BlackRock’s assets under management, while accounting for 34
percent of base fees. BlackRock has less patience with
underperforming active products and will seek to replace teams
quicker than in the past, he said, as the firm seeks to boost
performance and attract new money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
