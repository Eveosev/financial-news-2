Russia’s President  Vladimir Putin 
said OAO RusHydro, the nation’s biggest renewable energy
producer, needs to investigate the disappearance of “billions
of rubles” during a construction project in Moscow.  RusHydro’s loss came after the company’s builder for the
Zagorskaya pumped-storage hydropower station in the Moscow
region hired contractors with no real staff or infrastructure,
Putin told RusHydro Chief Executive Officer Yevgeny Dod during
an energy commission meeting with industry leaders today outside
Moscow. Dod said he was investigating the situation with the
Interior Ministry, according to a transcript posted on the
 website  of state television Rossiya 24.  “You should be fighting with your teeth to recover these
funds,” Putin told Dod, according to the transcript. “Billions
just evaporated and you are still investigating and you don’t
think it’s necessary to protect the interests of the company.”  An e-mail and a phone call to RusHydro’s spokeswoman Elena
Vishnyakova after hours in Moscow were not immediately answered.  State-run RusHydro rose 2.9 percent today on Russia’s Micex
Index, the most since Dec. 10. The company’s American depositary
receipts jumped 2.6 percent to $2.37 in New York, the steepest
one-day advance since Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
