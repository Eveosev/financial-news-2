The premium investors pay to hold
Russia’s ruble-denominated government debt compared with local-
currency Eurobonds narrowed to the smallest in 16 months as
expanded foreign access to the market stoked appetite.  The yield on ruble notes due March 2018 fell four basis
points to 6.08 percent by 7 p.m. in Moscow, while the yield on
the government’s ruble Eurobonds rose one basis point to 5.81
percent. That left the spread at 26 basis points, the narrowest
since October 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Euroclear Bank SA, which operates the world’s biggest bond
settlement system, started offering direct access to foreign
investors to the local market of government ruble debt on Feb.
7. At the same time, the tightening caused by the liberalization
has run its course, according to Aton Capital and Ronin Trust.
Crude oil, Russia’s main export, rose 0.2 percent to $97.71 per
barrel in New York.  The local 2018 notes are “extremely expensive now,”  Anna Bogdyukevich , an analyst at Aton Capital, said in an e-mail.  The ruble weakened 0.1 percent against the central bank’s
dollar-euro basket to 34.7369 by 7 p.m.  The “fair spread” between the bonds should be about 30
basis points,  Ivan Guminov , who helps manage 12.5 billion rubles
($417 million) at Ronin Trust, said by e-mail.  Yield on Eurobonds and local bonds are calculated via
different conventions, and directly comparable premium is even
lower at 16 points, Guminov says.  An extra return on the locally traded debt is warranted
because the securities are governed by Russian law rather than
English legislation, VTB Capital analyst  Anton Nikitin  told
Bloomberg on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
