Valero Energy Corp. , the third-
biggest U.S. ethanol producer, resumed output at an Albion,
Nebraska, plant because it’s now profitable to make the biofuel.  The company idled the mill, along with one in Linden,
Nebraska, and another in Bloomingburg, Ohio, after high corn
prices amid the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s raised
production costs.  Corn futures are in the longest slump in 32 years, falling
for a ninth session today on the Chicago Board of Trade. March-
delivery corn slid to $6.955 a bushel today, down 17 percent
from a record settlement of $8.3875 on Aug. 21.  “We’re hopeful that margins will improve soon at Linden
and Bloomingburg,”  Bill Day , a spokesman for Valero in San
Antonio, said in an e-mail. “Those plants will be restarted
when it’s economic to do so.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery declined 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.367 a gallon on the CBOT. Prices have risen
8.1 percent this year and are up 5.9 percent from a year ago.  The corn crush spread, the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 16 cents today.
It was minus 14 cents yesterday, the highest level since June.  Southwest Georgia Ethanol LLC, another company that idled
operations because of corn prices, plans to restart output at a
mill in Camilla, Georgia, in July as the local harvest begins,
Larry Kamp, the company’s chief financial officer, said today.  Production Rises  Production  of the fuel last week rose 1.9 percent to
789,000 barrels a day, the biggest jump in five weeks and the
highest level since Jan. 18, the Energy Information
Administration said in a report today.  Output in the week ended Jan. 25 fell to 770,000 barrels a
day, the lowest since the Energy Department’s statistical agency
began tracking weekly data for the additive in June 2010.  That helped drain a glut of the fuel as  stockpiles  last
week plunged 3 percent to 19.5 million barrels, the lowest level
since Nov. 30 and the steepest drop in 11 weeks, EIA data
showed.  Archer Daniels Midland Co. , in Decatur, Illinois, is the
largest U.S. ethanol producer, followed by Poet LLC, in Sioux
Falls, South Dakota, according to data from the Renewable Fuels
Association, a Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
