Peru’s benchmark sol-denominated
bonds fell, pushing up yields the most in two weeks, after the
central bank’s efforts to weaken the local currency curbed the
securities’ appeal.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent bond due August 2020
increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.78
percent at 2:51 p.m. in Lima, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the steepest rise since Jan. 28. The price
fell 0.29 centimo to 126.15 centimos per sol.  Peru’s central bank has stepped up efforts to tame the sol,
which touched a 16-year high last month, by increasing dollar
purchases and raising banks’ reserve requirements. Finance
Minister  Miguel Castilla  said last month the government will buy
$4 billion in the currency market to offset increased dollar
inflows.  The measures “certainly reduce a little the appeal to buy
a bond considering the currency risk in the current
environment,”  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP
Paribas Brasil SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “Valuations
are extremely stretched” in the Peruvian yield curve, he said.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.5720 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reached a 2.5390 on Jan. 14, the strongest level since
October 1996, according to data from Peru’s financial regulator.  The central bank said on its website it bought $120 million
of U.S. currency today, taking its purchases this year to $2.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
