Credit Agricole SA , France’s third-
biggest lender, won dismissal of lawsuit brought by  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA  over claims it was defrauded in a collateralized
debt obligation investment.  U.S. District Judge  Robert W. Sweet  in Manhattan yesterday
ruled that Intesa’s claims were time-barred, having been filed
“exactly one month too late.” Sweet said Intesa could file
another complaint within 20 days.  Intesa  claimed in the suit filed last year that it lost
$180 million after  Credit Agricole ’s Calyon unit induced it in
2006 to invest in a CDO secretly structured by Magnetar Capital
LLC to lose money.  Intesa argued Calyon told investors that the CDO -- known
as Pyxis ABS CDO 2006-1 -- was based on residential mortgage-
backed securities that had been chosen by an independent
investment firm, Putnam Advisory Co., when the underlying
securities were really selected by Magnetar.  Putnam was also named as a defendant in the case.  Intesa, based in Turin, Italy, and formerly known as Banca
Intesa SpA, seeks unspecified money damages in its fraud
lawsuit.  Philippe Selendy , a lawyer for Intesa, didn’t immediately
return a call yesterday seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Intesa v. Credit Agricole, 12-cv-02683, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
