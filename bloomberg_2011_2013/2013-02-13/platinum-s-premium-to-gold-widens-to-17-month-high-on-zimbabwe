Platinum rose for a second straight
day, widening its premium to gold to a 17-month high, on concern
supply may fall after Zimbabwe seized land from the nation’s top
miner of the metal. Gold retreated.  Zimbabwe, the third-biggest platinum producer and fifth-
largest palladium miner in 2011, repossessed about 69,000 acres
of land from  Zimplats Holdings Ltd.  to offer to new investors,
Mines Minister Obert Mpofu said yesterday. One ounce of platinum
bought as much as 1.0519 ounces of gold in London today, the
most since August 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We see platinum outperforming gold this year on optimism
surrounding the global economic recovery and supply
disruptions,”  Scott Gardner , who helps manage $400 million at
Verdmont Capital SA in Panama City, said in a telephone
interview.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
delivery in April climbed 0.7 percent to settle at $1,729.70 an
ounce at 1:10 p.m. The metal has gained 12 percent this year,
mainly as Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the biggest producer,
said last month it plans to cut output.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$772.05 an ounce, after reaching $777.60, the highest since
Sept. 6, 2011. It is mined alongside platinum and both are used
mainly in car pollution control devices. China’s passenger-
vehicle sales surged 49 percent to a monthly record in January,
the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers
said Feb. 7.  Trading Volume  Futures trading volume was 69 percent higher than the
average in the past 100 days for this time of day.  Gold futures for April delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$1,645.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York, declining for the
second time in three days. Prices have retreated 1.8 percent
this year.  Holdings  in exchange-traded products backed by the precious
metal headed for the second straight monthly fall. Bullion
holdings declined 2.74 metric tons this month to 2,609.53 tons,
after slipping 0.7 percent in January, data tracked by Bloomberg
showed. The assets rose to a record 2,632.5 tons on Dec. 20.  Silver futures for March delivery slid 0.5 percent to
$30.869 an ounce in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
