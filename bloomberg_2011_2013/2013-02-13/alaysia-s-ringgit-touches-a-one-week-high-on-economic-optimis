Malaysia’s ringgit climbed to a one-
week high on speculation data due next week will show the
nation’s economy expanded faster than the government estimated.  Second Finance Minister Ahmad Husni Mohamad Hanadzlah said
last week that growth in 2012 probably exceeded an official
forecast of as much as 5 percent. The nation is scheduled to
release gross domestic product data on Feb. 20. Trade Minister
Mustapa Mohamed reiterated on Feb. 8 a separate projection for
GDP to rise 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent this year.  “Fundamentals remain strong in Malaysia and this could
continue in 2013,” said  Wee-Khoon Chong , a strategist at
Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “The ringgit will likely
trade in a tight range for the rest of the week and could test
the 3 per dollar level by the end of the year.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.0923 per dollar
as of 9:44 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur from the Feb. 8 close of 3.1005,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
3.0921, the strongest since Feb. 7. The market was shut for the
first two days of the week for the Lunar New Year holiday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 7.50 percent.  Government bonds were little changed. The yield on the
3.418 percent notes maturing in August 2022 was 3.47 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
