Treasuries extended a third straight
day of losses after a $24 billion auction of 10-year notes sold
at a higher-than-forecast yield. U.S. stocks, the euro and oil
erased early gains.  Ten-year U.S. note yields increased four basis points at 4
p.m. in New York, topping 2 percent for the first time in a
week. The S&P 500 added less than 0.1 percent to 1,520.33,
paring an early 0.4 percent advance while still closing at the
highest level since October 2007, while the Europe Stoxx 600
 Index  closed 0.4 percent higher. The 17-nation euro currency
depreciated less than 0.1 percent to $1.3447 after climbing as
much as 0.5 percent. Oil slipped 0.5 percent to $97.01 a barrel
after gaining 0.6 percent.  Earlier gains in stocks came as Comcast Corp.’s $16.7
billion purchase of the remainder of NBC Universal bolstered
optimism in dealmaking, while government data showed retail
sales increased in January for a third straight month. In his
first State of the Union address last night, Obama called for a
higher minimum wage, vowed to begin talks on a trade agreement
with the European Union and spend $50 billion on “urgent”
infrastructure projects.  “There doesn’t seem like a lot of appetite to add Treasury
risk as the economy trends better and bearishness slowly
fades,”  Ira Jersey , an interest-rate strategist in New York at
Credit Suisse Group AG, said before the sale. As a primary
dealer, the firm is obliged to bid in U.S. debt auctions.
“There is decent reason to think that we are going to have
growth that is good enough to keep us at or above 2 percent for
a while.”  Auction Results  The notes sold by the U.S. Treasury today drew a yield of
2.046 percent, compared with a forecast of 2.039 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Federal Reserve’s 21
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.68, versus an average of 2.96 for the past 10 sales.  Industrial, commodity and consumer companies led gains
among 10 groups in the S&P 500 while telephone and financial
companies declined the most. McDonald’s Corp. lost 1.2 percent
to help lead the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower after Obama
announced his plan to raise the minimum wage. Cliffs Natural
Resources Inc. tumbled 20 percent after cutting its dividend.  General Electric Co.  climbed 3.6 percent, the most since
November 2011, after agreeing to sell its remaining 49 percent
stake in NBC Universal to Comcast, the largest U.S. cable
company, for $16.7 billion. Comcast rallied 3 percent for its
biggest gain in more than a month.  The S&P 500 has risen to within  3 percent of its record of
1,565.15 reached in October 2007. It’s more than doubled from
its bear-market low in 2009 as the nation emerged from the worst
recession since the 1930s.  ‘Green’ Bias  “I think the bias as of recent has been consistently green
on the screen,”  Mark Luschini , chief investment strategist at
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees
$55 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We didn’t hear
anything shockingly different from Obama’s speech that would
have pulled investors’ enthusiasm for stocks out of the
marketplace.”  U.S. companies are beating analysts’ earnings projections
by the smallest margin since 2008 and most forecasts have
trailed estimates in what investors should consider “warning
signals,” according to Wells Fargo & Co.  Of S&P 500 companies whose earnings topped estimates this
reporting season, 53 percent surprised by more than 1 percent,
Wells Fargo strategist Gina Martin Adams wrote in a report dated
Feb. 11. The so-called beat rate this season is poised to be the
lowest since 2008 and 12 percentage points below the 10-year
average. About 81 percent of forecasts for next quarter trailed
analyst estimates, according to the note.  Euro Factories  Factory production in the euro area rose 0.7 percent in
December from the previous month, beating the 0.2 percent gain
forecast in a Bloomberg survey, the European Union’s statistics
office said today. Italy sold 6.63 billion euros ($8.9 billion)
of bonds compared with a maximum target of 6.75 billion euros.  The euro weakened against 13 of its 16 main counterparts
after gaining against most earlier. Sweden’s krona strengthened
against all 16 major peers, jumping 1.2 percent versus the
dollar. Sweden’s central bank kept the seven-day  repo rate  at 1
percent, defying expectations of a cut by nine of the 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The pound weakened 0.8 percent versus the dollar after the
Bank of England said inflation will remain above its 2 percent
target for the next two years and risks to the economic recovery
are weighted to the downside. The Dollar Index was little
changed. Australia’s currency climbed a second day, rising 0.4
percent to $1.0345, after a gauge of consumer confidence surged
to a two-year high.  European Yields  The yield on Italy’s 10-year note fell 11 basis points to
4.40 percent. The extra yield investors demand to own Italy’s
10-year debt rather than German bunds narrowed 15 basis points
to a one-week low of 273 basis points. Spanish bonds rose,
pushing the 10-year  yield  down 12 basis points to 5.20 percent.  More than three shares gained for every one that fell in
the Stoxx 600.  Heineken NV  climbed 5.7 percent in Amsterdam as
the world’s third-biggest brewer reported full-year earnings
that beat estimates. PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe’s second-
largest carmaker, advanced 7.3 percent after posting a narrower-
than-projected loss.  Societe Generale SA , France’s second-biggest bank, fell 3.6
percent after reporting a quarterly loss. Storebrand ASA sank
8.4 percent in Oslo after the insurer’s profit missed estimates.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  jumped the most in two
weeks, adding 0.6 percent. Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai
Motor Co. led South Korea’s Kospi Index 1.6 percent higher as a
weaker currency boosted exporters’ competitiveness. Russia’s
Micex Index closed up 1.7 percent, snapping a five-day decline,
the longest slump since October.  Natural gas surged 2 percent to $3.293 per million British
thermal units, leading gains in commodities, amid forecasts of a
Midwest chill that may boost demand for the heating fuel.
Aluminum rallied 1 percent, while feed cattle, coffee and cotton
lost at least 1 percent for the biggest declines in the S&P GSCI
Index, which was little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
