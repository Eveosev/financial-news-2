Soco International Plc, a British
oil explorer operating in Vietnam and the two Congos, said it’s
in talks to buy more assets in those countries as it sells a
stake in an exploration block in Angola.  “We are in negotiations with governments of countries
where we operate in, in Southeast Asia and West Africa, for
assets,” Roger Cagle, deputy chief executive officer, said
today in a phone interview from London, where Soco is based.  The expiration of the option to sell its 80 percent Cabinda
stake in Angola has been extended to mid-February, Soco said
today in a statement.  The sale faces logistical delays, Cagle said. Last year
Soco  announced  it was selling its interest to Quill Trading
Corp., which paid a non-refundable deposit to secure the deal.  Soco closed down 4 percent at 380.80 pence in London. That
values the company at 1.3 billion pounds ($2 billion). Shares
dropped as much as 10 percent earlier in the day after Soco said
selling the asset in Angola would take longer than planned.  “The delay is unwelcome, but the deal is not material to
Soco’s investment case,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets said
in a note today.  Production is expected to average 16,000 barrels of oil
equivalent this year mainly from operations in the Te Giac Trang
field in Vietnam, Cagle said. That’s higher than the 15,496
barrels it produced in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
