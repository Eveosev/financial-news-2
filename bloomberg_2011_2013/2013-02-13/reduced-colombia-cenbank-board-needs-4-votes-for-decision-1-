Colombia’s central bank can hold its
February policy meeting with five board members rather than the
full seven, Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas told reporters
today in Bogota.  “We’re assuming the board meeting will be held with only
five co-directors,” Cardenas said.  The board still needs 4 votes to take a decision, Cardenas
said.  President Juan Manuel Santos has yet to name replacements
for co-directors Fernando Tenjo and Juan Jose Echavarria,
who left the central bank after its January policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
