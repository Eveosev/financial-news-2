CME Group Inc. , the world’s largest
futures market, would consider participating in an international
consolidation of its industry, Chief Executive Officer  Phupinder Gill  said.  “To the extent that there is a cross-border
transformational deal to be done and it serves our clients, we
would pursue it,” he said today at the Credit Suisse Financial
Services Forum in Miami. “But at this time I think the most
important thing for our client base is to basically focus on the
change and helping them get through this.”  Gill said on the company’s Feb. 5 quarterly conference call
with investors that while CME remains “opportunistic,” it
doesn’t see any “large” opportunities in mergers and
acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
