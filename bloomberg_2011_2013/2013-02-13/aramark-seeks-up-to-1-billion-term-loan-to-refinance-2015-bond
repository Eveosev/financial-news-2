Aramark Corp. , the food
concessionaire taken private in 2007, is seeking as much as $1
billion in term loans to redeem a portion of a bond coming due
in 2015.  The add-on term loan will pay interest at 3 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, according to
a person with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Libor, a rate
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other, will have
a 1 percent floor, the person said.  Aramark is proposing to sell the loan at 99.5 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp., Barclays Plc and  Wells Fargo & Co. are arranging
the financing, according to the person.  The debt will be an addition to Aramark’s March 2010 credit
pact, the Philadelphia-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The loan began paying interest at 3.25 percentage points
more than the Libor when it was obtained, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will redeem a portion of Aramark’s $1.28 billion
of 8.5 percent notes. The bond traded at 100.625 cents on the
dollar today, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company is also seeking to extend the duration on its
$550 million revolving line of credit and amend certain
requirements under the agreement, according to the filing. The
debt, obtained in 2007, began paying interest at 3.25 percentage
points more than Libor, Bloomberg data show.  Aramark was purchased for about $8.3 billion in January,
2007 by an investor group including Chairman Joseph Neubauer, GS
Capital Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors, JPMorgan Partners,
Thomas H. Lee Partners and Warburg Pincus LLC.  In a revolving credit line, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
