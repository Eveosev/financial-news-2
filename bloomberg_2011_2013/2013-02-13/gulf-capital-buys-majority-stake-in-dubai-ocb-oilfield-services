Gulf Capital, an Abu Dhabi-based
private-equity company, acquired a majority stake in OCB
Oilfield Services, a Dubai-based oil rig crew supplier, as it
continues to tap the Gulf region’s fastest growing sectors.  Gulf Capital said in an e-mailed statement today that it
bought a stake exceeding 51 percent of the company, without
being more specific or disclosing financial details.  The deal “is in line with Gulf Capital’s strategy of
investing in market leaders in defensive and fast growing
sectors in the region,” Chief Executive Officer  Karim El Solh 
said.  Gulf Capital, set up in 2006, is using funds from its $533
million GC Equity Fund II for investments. Last year, the buyout
firm bought an 82.7 percent stake in power generation services
company Sakr Energy Solutions FZCO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
