Almost two-thirds of Icelanders
don’t want the country to join the European Union, a poll by
researcher MMR showed.  Opposition to joining the 27-nation bloc rose to 63.3
percent, according to the poll published today on MMR’s  website .
That compares with 62.7 percent in a January survey. Support for
joining the EU fell to 24.2 percent from 25 percent.  MMR polled 874 people of which 86.1 percent answered. MMR
didn’t provide a margin of error. The survey was conducted from
Jan. 31 to Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
