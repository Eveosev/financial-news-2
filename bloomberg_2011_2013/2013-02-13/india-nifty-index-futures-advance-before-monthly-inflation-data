Indian  stocks rose for the second
day, led by shares of  Tata Motors Ltd.  after sales increased.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index , or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent
to 19,615.56, according to preliminary closing prices. Tata
Motors advanced for the third day after sales of Jaguar Land
Rover climbed 32 percent.  Housing Development Finance Corp. ,
India’s biggest mortgage lender, added 1.9 percent.  The Sensex advanced yesterday, ending the longest losing
stretch in 15 months, after some investors judged the declines
excessive. The 30-stock gauge’s 14-day relative strength index,
a measure of how rapidly prices rose or fell in the period, was
37 on Feb. 11. A reading of below 30 is a signal to buy for some
investors.  “We saw the first pull-back rally yesterday and this can
continue for the next two-to-three days,”  Hemant Thukral , an
analyst with Aditya Birla Money Ltd. in Mumbai, said in an
interview to Bloomberg TV India today.  Overseas funds bought $184 million of Indian equities on
Feb. 11, extending this year’s purchases to a net $7.6 billion,
a record for the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They
bought $24.5 billion of stocks in 2012, the highest among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, helping the Sensex to its
biggest annual advance in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
