Most U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since October
2007, as investors weighed economic reports and President Barack
Obama’s State of the Union address.  General Electric Co. climbed 3.6 percent after agreeing to
sell its remaining stake in NBC Universal to Comcast Corp. for
$16.7 billion.  Comcast , the largest U.S. cable company, jumped 3
percent. Retailers in the S&P 500 rose as a group after
government data showed purchases increased in January for the
third consecutive month. McDonald’s Corp. lost 1.2 percent after
Obama announced his plan to raise the minimum wage.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.1 percent to 1,520.33 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 35.79 points, or
0.3 percent, to 13,982.91. Four stocks gained for every three
that fell on U.S. exchanges, with about 6 billion
shares changing hands, 2.9 percent lower than the three-month
average.  “I think the bias has been consistently green on the
screen,”  Mark Luschini , chief investment strategist at
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees
$55 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We didn’t hear
anything shockingly different from Obama’s speech that would
have pulled investors’ enthusiasm for stocks out of the
marketplace.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 6.6 percent in 2013 as U.S.
lawmakers reached a budget compromise. It has more than doubled
since bottoming in March 2009 as the Federal Reserve conducted
three rounds of bond-buying to lower interest rates and boost
economic growth. The index is 2.9 percent below its record of
1,565.15 reached in October 2007.  Minimum Wage  Obama called for raising the federal minimum wage to $9 an
hour and pledged to expand trade with Europe in the State of the
Union speech late yesterday. He also proposed spending $50
billion on “urgent” infrastructure projects. He lauded steps
by companies such as  Apple Inc.,  Caterpillar Inc. and Ford Motor
Co. to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S  The president repeated his demand that Republicans accept
raising tax revenue along with spending cuts as part of any
“balanced” approach to his goal of $1.5 trillion in additional
deficit reduction over a decade. He said the balance could be
achieved by “getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for
the well-off and well-connected.”  “What I sense today is the ongoing zig and zag of the
market after there’s been a major speech given by the president
and just trying to sift out what it means,”  Matthew Kaufler ,
fund manager at Federated Clover Investment Advisors, said in a
phone interview. The Rochester, New York-based firm manages
about $3 billion.  Restaurants Retreat  McDonald’s lost $1.10 to $94 for the biggest drop in the
Dow. The company’s franchisees, as well as other restaurant
chains, spent money lobbying against minimum-wage increases.
Brinker International Inc., owner of the Chili’s and Maggiano’s
dining chains, slipped 3.2 percent to $31.99, while Darden
Restaurants Inc. retreated 2 percent to $45.86.  Retail sales  in the U.S. rose 0.1 percent last month,
matching the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, which showed household spending is holding up even as
an increase in the payroll tax takes a bigger bite from
paychecks.  Retailers gained 0.6 percent among 24 groups in the S&P
500. Netflix Inc. added 4.7 percent to $186.27. Amazon increased
4.2 percent to $269.47. The world’s largest online retailer is
expanding its content licensing agreement to bring shows from
CBS Television Distribution and Showtime Networks to Amazon’s
Prime Instant Video service.  10 Groups  Six out of the 10  groups  in the S&P 500 rose as industrial
and raw-material shares gained at least 0.3 percent. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index , which measures the cost
of using options as insurance against declines in the S&P 500,
advanced 2.7 percent to 12.98.  GE  rallied 81 cents to $23.39 and Comcast advanced $1.16 to
$40.13. The cable company will buy GE’s 49 percent stake in NBC
Universal, following through on its purchase of a controlling
stake two years ago. The sale will result in a pretax gain of
about $1 billion for GE and it will use proceeds to help
increase repurchases of its shares by $10 billion a year, the
company said.  Comcast also released its fourth-quarter results, saying
net income rose to 56 cents a share from 47 cents a year
earlier. Sales climbed almost 6 percent to $15.9 billion.  Airline Merger  U.S. Airways Group Inc. gained 2.7 percent to $14.66. The
board of bankrupt American Airlines parent AMR Corp. is meeting
to vote on an $11 billion merger after the two sides reached a
tentative agreement that would create the world’s largest air
carrier, people familiar with the matter said.  Lorillard Inc. gained 4.9 percent to $41.68. The cigarette
maker posted quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates for the first time in a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company boosted its dividend 6.5
percent to 55 cents a share.  Groupon Inc. surged 5.4 percent to $5.58. A local e-
commerce marketplace Groupon began a few months ago in Chicago
and New York will boost revenue as it expands nationwide over
the coming quarters, according to  Arvind Bhatia , an analyst at
Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., who raised the online coupon provider
to buy from neutral.  Banks Decline  The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 U.S. lenders, lost 0.6
percent. Citigroup Inc. fell 0.8 percent to $44, JPMorgan Chase
& Co. dropped 0.9 percent to $48.68 and Bank of America Corp.
declined 0.6 percent to $12.17. A  Sheldon H. Solow -led New York
realty company sued the three banks and several others for
allegedly conspiring to manipulate the U.S. dollar Libor rate.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.  tumbled 20 percent to $29.29.
The biggest U.S. iron-ore producer cut its quarterly dividend by
76 percent after the price of the commodity declined and a
Canadian mining project was delayed.  WellPoint Inc.  fell 4.6 percent to $63. The second-biggest
U.S. health insurer named Joseph Swedish, chief executive
officer of the nonprofit Catholic hospital system Trinity Health
Corp., as its next leader after a six-month search. He replaces
Angela Braly, who left WellPoint last year amid investor
discontent over the insurer’s performance.  Dean Foods Co. slipped 9.2 percent to $16.70. The largest
U.S. dairy processor said total volume will decline in a
percentage of “low single digits” this year.  Deere & Co. , the world’s largest agricultural-equipment
maker, fell 3.5 percent to $90.68. U.S. farm cash receipts for
crops, one indicator for equipment sales, will fall 1.7 percent
as corn and soybean prices decline, the Moline, Illinois-based
company said today in a presentation on its website.  Industrywide farm equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada
will be unchanged to 5 percent higher in fiscal 2013, which ends
Oct. 31, Deere said. The company got 64 percent of sales from
that region in fiscal 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
