Five French pig-slaughter companies
were fined a total of 4.5 million euros ($6.1 million) for
agreeing to reduce hog purchases from breeders with the goal of
cutting prices they pay, France’s antitrust regulator said.  The slaughterhouses in Brittany, France’s largest pig-
production region, colluded for 12-week period between June and
September 2009, the Autorite de la Concurrence wrote in
documents handed out at a press conference in Paris today.  France is the European Union’s third-biggest pork producer
after Germany and Spain. Brittany, west of the French capital,
accounted for 57 percent of the country’s pig slaughtering in
2011, with 14.3 million animals processed, government  data  show.  “The main practice that was penalized was a collective
fixing of the quantities of pigs purchased by five large Breton
slaughterers with the goal, in particular, of lowering the  price 
for pigs paid to the breeders,” the authority wrote.  Slaughterers Socopa Viandes SAS and Groupe Bigard SA were
jointly fined 1.8 million euros for the collusion, Groupe Bigard
was fined another 1.3 million euros, Etablissements Abera SAS
was ordered to pay 592,533 euros, Bernard SAS 573,213 euros and
GAD SAS and Financiere du Forest SA jointly 250,000 euros,
according to the regulator.  All companies involved admitted to the violations, the
document said.  Pig breeders face difficulty delaying the sale of
slaughter-ready hogs, according to the antitrust authority,
meaning fewer purchases by the slaughterers increased supply.  “Downward pressure on prices did indeed become evident
during the summer of 2009 in the price of pork,” the Autorite
de la Concurrence wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
