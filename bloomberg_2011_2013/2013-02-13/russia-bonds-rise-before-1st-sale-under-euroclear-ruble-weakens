Russia’s ruble-denominated
government debt climbed before the government’s first auction of
the bonds since foreign access was broadened.  The yield on so-called OFZs due June 2015 fell five basis
points to 6 percent, the lowest since Jan. 25, while the yield
on March 2014 securities declined three basis points to 5.77
percent by 11.40 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble weakened 0.1 percent
against the central bank’s dollar-euro basket to 34.7284.  The Finance Ministry is offering 25 billion rubles ($830
million) of notes due January 2023 at a yield of 6.77 percent to
6.82 percent, it said on its website yesterday. The yield on
existing bonds was unchanged today at 6.8 percent. The auction
is the first since Euroclear Bank SA, which operates the world’s
biggest bond settlement system, started offering direct access
to the local market on Feb. 7.  Barclays Plc  estimates the debt
market liberalization may attract as much as $40 billion of
foreign inflows in the next two years.  “The OFZ yield will decline rather rapidly” if appetite
is strong, Sberbank CIB analysts led by  Alexander Kudrin  wrote
in an e-mailed note today. “In the opposite case a wave of
disappointment will move the yield upward,” Sberbank analysts
said.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export, was little changed,
trading at $97.54 per barrel in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
