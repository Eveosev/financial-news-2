Chorus Aviation Inc.  fell the most
in almost four years after Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sold
its stake in the regional carrier.  Class B shares of Chorus dropped 4.2 percent to C$4.31 at
10:56 a.m. in Toronto. Earlier the stock declined as much as 16
percent, its largest intraday drop since May 2009. Class A
shares fell 6.5 percent to C$4.30.  “We can confirm that Fairfax sold its holding,”  Manon Stuart , a spokeswoman for Chorus said today in a telephone
interview from Halifax, Nova Scotia where the company is based.
She declined to say when the company was notified of Fairfax’s
sale or who acquired the shares.  Canada’s National Post newspaper reported the Fairfax stake
sale earlier today.  Chorus operates regional flights for  Air Canada , the
country’s largest carrier, under the Jazz and Air Canada Express
banners. Fairfax, an insurer and investment management company
based in Toronto, was the third-biggest  holder  of Chorus stock.  About 19.1 million Chorus shares were sold in a block trade
at 3:37 p.m. yesterday, Bloomberg data show. Toronto-based
 Fairfax  held 8.5 million Class A shares of Chorus and 10.6
million Class B shares as of April, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Paul Rivett, a spokesman for Fairfax in Toronto, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
