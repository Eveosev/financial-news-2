U.S. banking regulators should go
easy on community banks and insurers as the agencies finish
capital rules for financial institutions, according to leaders
of the Senate Banking Committee.  The smallest U.S. banks may find parts of the so-called
Basel III rules difficult to implement, and the rules were never
meant for insurance companies, said senators  Tim Johnson , the
South Dakota Democrat who heads the panel, and  Mike Crapo , the
committee’s senior Republican member from Idaho, in a letter
today.  “While it is important to get the new capital standards in
place, it is more important to get the rules right,” the
lawmakers said in the letter to leaders of the Federal Reserve,
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. -- the three agencies working on final versions
of the rules proposed in June.  OCC chief  Thomas Curry  said in October that smaller banks
may get longer transition periods and so-called grandfather
clauses to help ease them into compliance with the rules, which
are based on a global framework adopted by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
