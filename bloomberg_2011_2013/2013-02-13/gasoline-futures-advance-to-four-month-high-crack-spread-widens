Gasoline advanced to a four-month
high in New York after an industry report showed declining oil
and refined product supplies. The March crack spread on Nymex
widened.  Futures gained as much as 1 percent. Oil rose 40 cents to
$97.91 in New York at 9:35 a.m. after the American Petroleum
Institute said crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma,
storage hub declined by 1.12 million barrels to 50.2 million
last week and U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell 810,000 barrels. The
March gasoline  crack spread  widened 67 cents to $31.27 a barrel.  “The linchpin here is going to be the crude oil number at
Cushing,”  Stephen Schork , the president of Schork Group Inc. in
Villanova, Pennsylvania, said by phone. “That could be
supportive of crude oil prices and of course if crude oil prices
rally, gasoline prices are going to follow.”  Gasoline for March delivery rose 2.2 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $3.0723 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Volume
was 81 percent above the 100-day average at 9:57 a.m. in New
York.  March-delivery heating oil slipped 0.59 cent to $3.2303 a
gallon on volume that’s 15 percent above average.  Gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.4 cents
to $3.618 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. Prices are
the highest since Oct. 23, and 10.5 cents above a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
