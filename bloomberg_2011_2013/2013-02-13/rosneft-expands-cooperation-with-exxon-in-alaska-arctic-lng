OAO Rosneft , Russia’s largest oil
producer, and  Exxon Mobil Corp . said they may expand cooperation
in Alaska, Russia’s arctic waters and liquefied natural gas.  Rosneft now has an option to take a 25 percent share in the
Point Thomson project, a gas condensate deposit, on Alaska’s
North Slope. That’s part of the deal signed today by  Igor Sechin , Rosneft’s Chief Executive Officer, and  Stephen Greenlee ,
Exxon’s exploration head, at Russian President  Vladimir Putin ’s
residence outside Moscow.  Rosneft may contribute seven offshore licenses gained today
from Russia’s Natural Resources ministry to its arctic venture
with Exxon, Greenlee said. Rosneft this month announced it
agreed to pay 5.4 billion rubles ($180 million) to the ministry
for 12 licenses.  Rosneft has formed partnerships with Exxon, Statoil SA and
Eni SpA as it looks to explore Russia’s offshore areas and tight
oil fields, while also gaining opportunities abroad. Rosneft and
Exxon are exploring the Kara Sea and drilling pilot wells on
tight oil deposits in Siberia. Rosneft has entered into Exxon
projects in Texas and Canada as Rosneft’s board approved
expanding a cooperation agreement today.  The companies, which are partners at the Exxon-led
Sakhalin-1 project on Russia’s Pacific coast, will study
opportunities to liquefy natural gas in Asia including the
possible construction of an LNG plant cooling the fuel for
tanker travel, according to a joint statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
