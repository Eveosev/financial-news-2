LeBron James  set a National
Basketball Association record with his sixth straight game of at
least 30 points and 60 percent shooting while leading the Miami
Heat to a 117-104 win against the Portland Trail Blazers.  James, 28, scored 30 points on 11-for-15 shooting -- 73
percent -- to break a tie with  Adrian Dantley  of the 1979-80
Utah Jazz and  Moses Malone  of the 1981-82 Houston Rockets,
according to the Heat.  “I know the history of the game,” James said in a
television interview last night at Miami’s AmericanAirlines
Arena. “For me to be in the record books by myself with such a
stat, any stat, it’s big time.”  Chris Bosh  had 32 points and  Dwyane Wade  added 24 for the
Heat (35-14), who lead the New York Knicks by three games for
the best record in the NBA’s Eastern Conference. James added six
rebounds, nine assists, three steals and two blocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
