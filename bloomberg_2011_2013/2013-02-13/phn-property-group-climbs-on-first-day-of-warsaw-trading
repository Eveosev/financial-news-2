Grupa PHN SA, the property company
in which the Polish government sold a 25 percent stake this
year, climbed on its first day of trading on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange.  The shares rose 3.4 percent to 22.75 zloty as of 9:01 a.m
in Warsaw, valuing the company at 987 million zloty ($319
million). Poland sold 10.8 million shares at 22 zloty each in an
initial public offering. The price range was 20 zloty to 26
zloty, PAP newswire reported on Jan. 23, without saying where it
got the information.  Poland, which is selling assets to curb public debt and
boost state investments, will offer a controlling stake in PHN
to a strategic investor this year and will keep as much as 25
percent, Deputy Treasury Minister  Pawel Tamborski  said Jan. 23.  PHNâ€™s net loss widened to 142.9 million zloty in the first
nine months of 2012 from 85.4 million zloty a year earlier. The
company estimates its net value of assets at 1.75 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
