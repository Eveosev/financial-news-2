West Texas Intermediate traded near
the highest level in more than a week. U.S. crude stockpiles
declined for the first time this year, according to the American
Petroleum Institute.  Futures advanced as much as 0.5 percent in New York,
extending yesterday’s 0.5 percent gain. Crude inventories fell
2.3 million barrels last week, the first drop in six weeks, data
from the industry-funded API showed. An Energy Department report
today may show supplies rose, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. The International Energy Agency trimmed forecasts for
global oil demand because of constrained economic expansion.  “Declining inventory levels in the U.S.” are supporting
prices, said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “If the U.S. Energy Department reports a similar
fall in stocks, oil prices are likely to climb further.”  Crude for March delivery was at $97.78 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 27
cents, at 1:27 p.m. London time. The contract rose as much as 46
cents to $97.97, the highest intraday level since Feb 1. The
volume of all contracts traded was 22 percent above the 100-day
average.  Brent for March settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange, which expires today, was up 5 cents at $118.71
a barrel. The more actively traded April contract was 15 cents
higher at $117.90. The European benchmark grade was at a premium
of $20.92 to WTI, compared with $21.15 yesterday. The spread was
$23.18 on Feb. 8, the widest since Nov. 26.  OPEC Output  The IEA reduced its 2013 world demand estimate by 90,000
barrels a day following a weaker growth outlook from the
International Monetary Fund. Global oil use will increase by
840,000 barrels a day in 2013, or 0.9 percent, to 90.7 million a
day. Production among OPEC nations fell to its lowest level in a
year, limiting relief for prices from an increase in spare
production capacity, the IEA said today in its monthly oil
market report.  WTI will average $92.81 a barrel this year, up 3.7 percent
from a January projection of $89.54, the Energy Department said
yesterday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  Oil in New York may rise to $100 a barrel as demand along
the two-year moving average propels futures above technical
support, according to Barclays Plc. Buyers have emerged near the
$95 level, signaling that the market may test a range of $98.25
to $98.35, the bank said in an e-mailed report.  Oil Inventories  U.S. crude stockpiles dropped to 369.5 million barrels last
week, the API data show. Supplies are forecast to increase 2.2
million barrels to 373.9 million, according to the  median
estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gasoline inventories fell 810,000 barrels, according to the
API. This compares with a projected 500,000 barrel gain in the
survey. Heating oil, diesel and other distillate fuels slid 1.1
million barrels, compared with an estimated 1.75 million-barrel
decline in the survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Record fuel exports are straining the capacity of ports
along the Gulf of Mexico, causing congestion at terminals,
deepening a glut of gasoline and pushing prices lower.  Distillates leaving the U.S. in the week ended Feb. 1,
mostly from the Gulf Coast, climbed 8.7 percent from a year
earlier, government data show. Gasoline in the region sank to a
record low versus futures in December, and the discount
yesterday was more than four times wider than the 10-year
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
