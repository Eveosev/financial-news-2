Palm oil reserves in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer, shrank from a record in January as
output fell, according to official data. The drop was less than
expected and prices slumped the most in more than six weeks.  Inventories  contracted 1.9 percent to 2.58 million metric
tons from 2.63 million in December, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board
said today. That missed the median estimate for a drop to 2.53
million tons, according to a Bloomberg survey, and is 28 percent
higher than a year ago.  Output  fell 10 percent to 1.6 million
tons last month, while exports slid 1.6 percent to 1.62 million
tons, the board said.  Reserves in Malaysia and Indonesia climbed last year as
production outpaced demand, pushing prices down 23 percent, the
most since 2008. Rates may increase this year as economies
rebound in China and India, the world’s biggest importers, the
Indonesian Palm Oil Association said on Feb. 5. Malaysia had no
tax on shipments last month in a bid to clear its stockpiles.  “I don’t think there’s much of a catalyst for prices to
recover” as the stockpiles remain high,  James Ratnam , an
analyst at TA Securities Holdings Bhd., said in Kuala Lumpur.
The outlook for demand is also uncertain as India probably
imported a large amount last month, Ratnam said.  Palm oil for April delivery lost 2.2 percent to close at
2,505 ringgit ($811) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
the lowest level for the most-active contract since Jan. 29 and
the biggest drop since Dec. 31. Markets in Malaysia were closed
on Feb. 11 and yesterday for a holiday.  Tariff Revamp  Malaysia said in October it would cut the export tax to
between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent, from about 23 percent,
effective Jan. 1, to clear reserves. The tariff for last month
and February was set at zero as the base price was below the
threshold that triggers the 4.5 percent rate. Indonesia, the
biggest grower, fixed the duty at 9 percent this month.  “The zero export tax is still giving a boost to the
market,”  Chandran Sinnasamy , head of trading at LT
International Futures Sdn., said from Kuala Lumpur before the
January data from the board was released during the midday
break. “February exports look like they may be better.”  In the first 10 days of this month, exports jumped 18
percent to 440,830 tons from 373,462 tons in the same period of
January,  Intertek  said Feb. 9. Shipments in January were 1.46
million tons, 7 percent less than December, said Intertek.
Exports surged 25 percent to 429,070 tons in the first 10 days,
estimates from Societe Generale de Surveillance showed today.  India’s  imports  of crude and refined palm oils jumped 76
percent to 900,000 tons in January, according to a Bloomberg
survey published last week. The Solvent Extractors’ Association
of India will publish data tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
