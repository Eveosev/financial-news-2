Toys “R” Us Inc.  Chief Executive
Officer  Gerald Storch  will step down following a drop in holiday
sales at the world’s largest toy-store chain.  Storch, 56, joined the company in 2006 after Bain Capital
Partners LLC, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust purchased Toys
“R” Us for $6.6 billion. He will remain chairman and stay on
as CEO during a search for his replacement, the Wayne, New
Jersey-based company said today in a statement.  While Storch improved profitability, the chain has
struggled to boost sales amid competition from Amazon.com Inc.
and discount retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. The
company filed paperwork in 2010 for an initial public offering
and has yet to issue shares.  Storch declined an interview request, according to Kathleen
Waugh, a spokeswoman.  Holiday sales in the U.S. from November to December
declined 4.7 percent, while revenue from its international unit
sank 6.4 percent. That came after total sales fell in the
previous five quarters. Over the past 12 months through October,
revenue declined 1.9 percent to $13.7 billion.  Storch, a former Target executive, led an effort to remodel
stores in the U.S. by combining Toys “R” Us stores with
locations from its Babies “R” Us chain. The company now has
more than 1,500 stores globally with 870 in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
