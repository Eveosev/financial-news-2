German airports including those at
Hamburg and Dusseldorf will probably be hit by delays and flight
cancellations tomorrow because of a planned security-guard
strike.  Hamburg has 179 flights scheduled tomorrow and safety
personnel will strike from 3:45 a.m., the airport operator and
Germanyâ€™s Ver.di trade union said in separate statements.  Dusseldorf airport  said it has 550 flights scheduled
tomorrow and that it will also be affected by job action.
Strikes in Hamburg and elsewhere in Germany caused delays and
cancellations last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
