The lira gained the most in almost
two weeks as Turkey’s current-account deficit for December beat
analyst estimates.  The currency extended this year’s advance as the  current-
account gap  shrank to about 6 percent of gross domestic product
last year from almost 10 percent in 2011.  “More positive news from the Turkish external accounts
strengthens our favorable view toward the lira,”  Ilan Solot , a
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Ltd in London,
said in e-mailed comments.  The lira strengthened 0.4 percent, its biggest appreciation
since Feb. 1, to 1.7654 a dollar at 5:03 p.m. in Istanbul,
taking its rise this year to 1 percent. Yields on two-year
benchmark notes climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.82 percent, advancing for a fourth day.  The deficit fell to $4.66 billion in December, from $6.63
billion a year earlier, according to central bank data released
today, compared with a $5.4 billion median estimate of 13
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The full-year gap narrowed to
$48.9 billion from a record $77.2 billion a year ago.  ‘Limited’ Gains  “Today’s data is positive for the lira,”  Ibrahim Aksoy ,
an economist at Seker Securities in London, wrote in an e-mailed
note. “Given the central bank’s determination to prevent
nominal lira strength, potential gains should remain limited.”  Turkey’s central bank reduced its overnight lending and
borrowing rates by 25 basis points each to 8.75 percent and 4.75
percent, respectively, last month. A “measured rate cut to the
interest-rate corridor or policy rate is possible if the Real
Effective Exchange Rate appreciates excessively,” Central bank
Governor Erdem Basci said Jan. 29.  The REER Index climbed to 120.16 in January from 118.08 in
the previous month. A reading of 120 or above signals excessive
currency strength, according to the central bank, which will
publish the REER’s February reading on March 5.  Moody’s Investors Service left Turkey’s rating one level
below investment grade last month, saying it would consider
raising it if the government made further progress in lowering
its external vulnerabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
