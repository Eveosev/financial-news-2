West Texas Intermediate oil in New
York fell after Iran said it was nearing agreement with nuclear
inspectors and as the Energy Information Administration said
U.S. crude output rose to the highest level in 20 years.  Prices dropped 0.5 percent as Iran’s state-run Press TV
quoted  Ali Asghar Soltanieh , the country’s envoy to the
International Atomic Energy Agency, as saying that a basic
accord had been reached. U.S. crude  production  climbed to 7.06
million barrels a day last week, the most since December 1992,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
 Crude stockpiles  rose 560,000 barrels to 372.2 million.  “Prices fell on speculation that IAEA inspectors will come
to an agreement with the Iranian government, reducing tension,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “Anything that points
to reduced tension with Iran will push prices lower.”  Crude oil for March delivery fell 50 cents to settle at
$97.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
have declined 3.9 percent in the past year. The volume of all
contracts traded was 29 percent above the 100-day average at
4:05 p.m.  Brent oil for March settlement, which expired today, rose 6
cents to $118.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The more actively traded April contract increased 13
cents to end the session at $117.88. Volume was 3.4 percent
above the 100-day average.  Widening Spread  The European benchmark grade traded at a $21.71-a-barrel
premium to WTI, up from $21.15 yesterday. The spread was $23.18
on Feb. 8, the widest level since Nov. 26.  United Nations inspectors arrived in Iran to negotiate
wider access to the Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear facilities.
Reuters reported that Iran agreed on “some points” with the
visiting delegation.  IAEA inspectors led by  Herman Nackaerts  are seeking a deal
that would include a visit to the Parchin military site, where
nuclear work may have been carried out according to intelligence
reports received by the agency.  The U.S. and its allies say Iran may seek to make an atomic
bomb, while Iran says it’s pursuing a civilian program.
Sanctions aimed at stopping the country’s nuclear program have
hindered its ability to export oil.  U.S. production rose 67,000 barrels a day last week, the
biggest increase since December, the EIA report showed.  Production Gains  “We continue to see production gains but this has yet to
translate into low prices,” said  Marshall Berol , co-portfolio
manager of the Encompass Fund in San Francisco, which has about
$300 million in assets. “The limited impact of the production
gain may be an indication that the economy is continuing to
modestly pick up.”  The EIA report was projected to show a 2.2 million barrel
increase in crude supplies, according to the  median estimate  of
10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gasoline inventories  declined 803,000 barrels to 233.2
million, according to the EIA. Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, dropped 3.68
million barrels to 125.9 million.  Refineries  operated at 83.8
percent of capacity last week, down 0.4 percentage point from
the prior week.  Total  fuel consumption  rose 5.5 percent to 19 million
barrels a day last week, the most since the week ended Dec. 14,
the report showed.  “The market is well supplied and demand is OK, although
not spectacular,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9 billion
natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at
Manulife Asset Management in Boston. “The focus will turn back
to the economic growth outlook.”  Retail Sales  Retail sales  in the U.S. rose for a third month in January.
The 0.1 percent climb followed an unrevised 0.5 percent increase
in December, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. The slower-paced advance, as an increase in payroll
taxes took a bite out of consumers’ paychecks, matched the
median forecast of 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The International Energy Agency reduced its 2013 world
demand estimate by 90,000 barrels a day following a weaker
growth outlook from the International Monetary Fund.  Global oil use will increase by 840,000 barrels a day in
2013, or 0.9 percent, to 90.7 million a day. Production among
OPEC nations fell to its lowest level in a year, limiting price
relief from an increase in spare production capacity, the Paris-
based IEA said today in its monthly oil market report.  “The IEA report also put some downward pressure on the
market because of their reduced outlook for demand,” Kilduff
said.  Technical Support  Oil in New York may rise to $100 a barrel as demand along
the two-year moving average propels futures above technical
support, according to Barclays Plc. Buyers have emerged near the
$95 level, signaling that the market may test a range of $98.25
to $98.35, the bank said in an e-mailed report.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 626,805
contracts as of 4:06 p.m. It totaled 684,492 contracts
yesterday, 30 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.65 million, the most since May 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
