Talisman Energy Inc. , the Canadian
oil and natural gas producer with operations on six continents,
reported a fourth-quarter profit for the first time in four
years after selling assets and cutting costs.  Net income was $376 million, or 37 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $117 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier, the
Calgary-based company said in a statement on Marketwire today.
Talisman posted a loss from operations of 10 cents a share.  Hal Kvisle , who took over as chief executive officer in
September, has announced plans to reduce spending, cut debt and
exit certain regions, including Peru, to refocus the company on
near-term cash flow. Talisman sold a 49 percent stake in its
U.K. unit to China Petrochemical Corp. for $1.5 billion last
year. Its 2013 capital budget was set at $3 billion, a 25
percent reduction from 2012.  Output fell to the equivalent of 392,000 barrels of oil a
day from 442,000 barrels a year earlier. Maintenance work in the
North Sea and Southeast Asia, coupled with the Sinopec joint
venture, was expected to reduce fourth-quarter production,  Phil Skolnick , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in New York, said in a
Feb. 11 note to clients.  Talisman will spend about $3 billion this year as it
focuses on production in the Americas, Southeast Asia and the
North Sea,  Richard Herbert , executive vice president of
exploration, said in a Jan. 24 speech. The company plans to
reduce general and administrative costs, which would include
some job cuts, by 20 percent this year.  The company, which had its last profitable fourth quarter
in 2008, released results before the start of regular trading on
North American markets. Talisman rose 1.9 percent to C$12.56
yesterday in Toronto. The shares, which have seven buy and 19
hold recommendations from analysts, have gained 12 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
