British Columbia, assuming five
liquefied natural gas terminals will be built in the province by
2020, introduced a tax on the industry that is less than
Australia’s levy, the government said today.  Canada’s westernmost province forecast it will raise as
much as C$260 billion ($259 billion) over the next three decades
to cut debt and funnel revenues into a so-called Prosperity
Fund, according to statements from the government after Premier
 Christy Clark  outlined her LNG plan in a speech.  A study by the government found the new tax will keep the
province “competitive” globally. “This review has concluded
that B.C.’s main competitor is Australia, which has an LNG tax
and royalty regime that is up to one-third higher than B.C.’s,”
according to a statement from the Ministry of Finance.  British Columbia is home to the Montney Shale, with an
estimated 49 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc ,  Chevron Corp . and  Petroliam Nasional Bhd  have
developed potential projects to liquefy the gas and ship it by
tanker to Asian markets, where the fuel sells for about five
times North American prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
