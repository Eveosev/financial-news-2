Chilean traders and investors expect
inflation to stay anchored to the central bank’s 3 percent
target for two years, giving policy makers room to refrain from
raising  borrowing costs  until at least August.  The bank’s board, which hasn’t changed the key interest
rate since January 2012, will keep lending rates on hold at 5
percent for six months before raising them to 5.25 percent by
February 2014, according to the bi-weekly survey of traders and
investors posted on the bank website today.  Since the previous survey, inflation has accelerated,
economic growth slowed and manufacturing contracted in the
Andean nation. Two-year interest rate swaps increased two basis
points from Jan. 22 to 5.23 percent yesterday, implying rates
will rise a quarter-point by August, according to Banco de
Chile.  Economic growth as measured by the  Imacec index , a proxy
for gross domestic product, grew 4.7 percent in December from
the previous year on gains in retail and services, the slowest
expansion in nine months, according to central bank data.
Manufacturing output contracted 2.5 percent in December.  Inflation will speed up to 3 percent in 12 months after
accelerating to 1.6 percent in January from 1.5 percent in
December, according to today’s survey of 57 traders and
investors. Policy makers target 3 percent inflation, plus or
minus 1 percentage point over two years.  The peso rose by less than 0.1 percent to 471.65 per U.S.
dollar at 8:41 a.m. Santiago time today. Chile’s currency will
trade at 472 in seven days, according to today’s survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
