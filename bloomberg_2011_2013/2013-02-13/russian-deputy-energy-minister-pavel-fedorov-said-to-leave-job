Deputy Energy Minister  Pavel Fedorov 
resigned after a year in the job during which he helped change
taxes for Russia’s oil and gas industry, the government said.  The departure was planned following the completion of
proposals on incentives for the development of Russia’s
offshore, hard-to-recover resources, East Siberian oil and gas
and refining modernization, Energy Minister  Alexander Novak  said
in an e-mailed statement. Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  signed
Fedorov’s resignation letter yesterday, he said.  Fedorov, who joined the ministry in March, only planned to
work in the government for one year, according to the an
unidentified official. Fedorov declined to comment when
contacted today by Bloomberg.  Fedorov worked as first vice president at state-run  OAO
Rosneft , Russia’s biggest oil producer, before joining the
government. Prior to that he worked at  Morgan Stanley .  To contact the reporter on this story:
