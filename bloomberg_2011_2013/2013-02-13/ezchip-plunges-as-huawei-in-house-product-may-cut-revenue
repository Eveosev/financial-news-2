EZchip Semiconductor Ltd.  sank to
the lowest level in two years after saying that revenue may be
reduced should one of its customers develop a product that will
negate the need for the Israeli company’s technology.  EZchip, which makes chips for network routers, tumbled 21
percent to $25.50 by 12:53 p.m. in New York, set for the lowest
close since December 2010 and the steepest one-day slide since
August last year.  Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese maker of
telecommunications equipment, is developing an in-house
processor and will use EZchip’s product only “when needed,”
 Eli Fruchter , chief executive officer of the Israeli company,
said on a conference call today after the company reported 2012
earnings. He added that the development was still “mere
speculation,” according to a  call transcript .  “EZchip doesn’t trade on what they’re going to do tomorrow
or a year from now, they trade mostly on their long-term growth
prospects,”  Dov Rozenberg , an analyst at Clal Finance Batucha
Brokerage Ltd. in Tel Aviv who rates EZchip a buy, said by
phone. Should Huawei be developing an in-house product that will
erode EZchip’s share of the market and “lowers the long-term
growth expectations” for the Yokneam, Israel-based company,
Rozenberg said.  A phone message left for Jannie Luong, a North American
spokeswoman for Shenzhen-based Huawei, wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
