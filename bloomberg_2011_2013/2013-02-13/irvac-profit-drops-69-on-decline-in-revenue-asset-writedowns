Mirvac Group , Australia’s third-
biggest diversified property trust by assets, said first-half
profit slumped 69 percent after asset writedowns and a decline
in development revenue.  Net income  fell to A$55.2 million ($57.2 million) in the
six months to Dec. 31 from A$176.6 million a year earlier, the
Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange. Operating profit declined 4 percent to A$194.2
million, it said.  Mirvac last week announced a A$273.2 million writedown on
residential projects after weaker than expected sales. The move
brought writedowns to more than A$1 billion since 2007, figures
from Morgan Stanley research show.  “The group is on track to deliver its full year operating
earnings guidance,”  Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz , who took over as
managing director on Nov. 5, said in the statement today.  Operating earnings per share for the year ending June 30
will be between 10.7 cents and 10.8 cents, and its dividend will
be between 8.5 cents and 8.7 cents, it said. Mirvac will pay a
 dividend  of 4.2 Australian cents for the half, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
