Hochtief AG , the German builder
controlled by Spain’s Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
SA, jumped to the highest level in 11 months after its
Australian  Leighton Holdings Ltd . unit returned to profit.  Hochtief shares  climbed  as much as 5.8 percent to 51.49
euros, the biggest increase in four weeks, and were trading 5.4
percent higher as of 9:38 a.m. in Frankfurt. That extends this
year’s gain to 17 percent, valuing the company at 3.95 billion
euros ($5.31 billion). Volume after less than an hour of trading
almost matched the three-month daily average.  Leighton, Australia’s largest construction company,
reported net income for 2012 of A$450 million as it completed
major projects and reduced debt, propelling its shares to the
highest gain in four years. The Sydney-based company completed a
toll road in Brisbane and a desalination plant in Victoria,
which along with Middle Eastern venture Habtoor Leighton Group
had caused more than A$1.3 billion of losses and impairments.  Shares in the Australian company rose 11 percent to A$23.14
at the close of trade in Sydney. Hochtief  holds  49 percent of
the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
