Kenya’s shilling strengthened and
headed toward the highest in nine trading days after the central
bank removed more money from the market and dollar inflows from
a weekly coffee auction pushed it higher.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.4 percent to 87.13 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent
stronger at 87.30 by 12:58 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close
at that level will be the highest on a closing basis since Feb.
1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has received support from the inflow of
dollars from the coffee auction at a time when demand for
dollars is subdued,”  Solomon Alubala , head of trading at
 National Bank of Kenya Ltd ., said by phone. “The central bank’s
persistent removal of money from the market has created a
liquidity crunch supporting the shilling further.”  The weekly coffee auction brought in $1.05 million,
according to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange. The Central Bank of
Kenya offered 5 billion shillings ($57 million) of seven-day
repurchase agreements, according to a central bank official, who
asked not to be identified in line with policy.  The bank, which uses the repos to reduce money supply and
support the shilling, has absorbed 113 billion shillings from
the market this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Uganda’s currency weakened 0.1 percent to 2,645 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,615 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
