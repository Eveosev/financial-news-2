Treasury 10-year note  yields  may
stay below 2.4 percent after having completed a two-month climb,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. said, citing trading patterns.  The level is the peak of a so-called double top formed in
October 2011 and March 2012 and may meet resistance, said
 Daisuke Uno , chief strategist in Tokyo at a unit of Sumitomo
Mitsui, Japan’s second-largest bank by market value. Yields rose
to 2.06 percent on Feb. 4, the most since April 2012, advancing
from a a record low of 1.38 percent marked on July 25 last year.  “Ten-year rates climbed above 2 percent last week, but the
strong resistance around 2.4 percent will cap a further rise,”
Uno said. “I expect yields to move between 1.6 and 2.1 percent
in the short term.”  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  were unchanged at 1.98
percent as of 9:18 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in November 2022 was
at 96 7/8. Yields climbed 37 basis points over the past two
months. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. So-called resistance is where
orders to trade bonds may be clustered.  The double-top reversal is a pattern typically found on bar
charts, line charts and candlestick graphs. The formation is
made up of two consecutive peaks that are roughly equal, with a
moderate trough in-between.  To contact the reporter on this story:
