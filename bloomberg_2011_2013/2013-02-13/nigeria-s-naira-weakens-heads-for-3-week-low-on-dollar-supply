Nigeria’s naira retreated to a
three-week low after the central bank cut dollar supply at an
auction today.  The currency of Africa’s largest oil producer retreated
less than 0.1 percent to 157.37 per dollar by 4.35 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, its weakest since Jan. 24,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $120 million at a foreign
exchange auction today, compared with $180 million at the
previous sale on Feb. 11, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-
mailed statement. The regulator, which sells dollars on Mondays
and Wednesdays to stabilize the naira, is the major supplier of
foreign exchange.  “Reduction in official dollar supply increases the
recourse to the interbank market for dollars,” Tunde Ladipo,
chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment
Ltd., said by phone today. “Oil company sales have also
declined, adding to pressure.”  Oil companies, which sell dollars to lenders at the end of
the month to meet local spending needs, are the second-biggest
source of foreign currency.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 fell one basis point to 10.87 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data on the  Financial
Markets Dealers Association  website.  The yield on $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
rose two basis points to 4.309 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi gained by 0.2 percent to 1.9050 a dollar in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
