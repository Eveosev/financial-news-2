Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index erasing yesterday’s advance, as the yen climbed after
Group of Seven officials gave conflicting signals about the
currency’s volatility. Gree Inc. plunged after cutting its
profit forecast.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest auto manufacturer,
lost 1.8 percent. Gree slumped 15 percent after reducing its
outlook on delays to new social-networking games.  Pioneer Corp. ,
a maker of audio equipment, plunged 11 percent after forecasting
a loss. Daikin Industries Ltd. lost 6.1 percent as the maker of
air conditioners was cut to underperform from outperform at CLSA
after net income fell.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slid 1 percent to close at
11,251.41 in Tokyo, with trading volume 10 percent above the 30-
day average. The broader Topix fell 1.2 percent to 957.02, with
more than six stocks dropping for each that gained, eliminating
yesterday’s 1.2 percent gain.  “The market has been at a high level and investors want to
sell shares to lock in profit,” said  Kazuyuki Terao , Tokyo-
based chief investment officer of Allianz Global Investors Japan
Co., part of Allianz Global Investors which oversees about 302
billion euros ($406 billion). “When you look at earnings
results, you see many companies doing not so well regardless of
a weaker yen.”  The Topix surged about 32 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 amid optimism a new government will take
aggressive steps to weaken the yen and beat deflation. The gauge
is trading at 1.1 times  book value , compared with 2.1 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Japan GDP  Japan gross domestic product data due tomorrow is expected
to show annualized 0.4 percent growth in the three months
through December, according to the median forecast in a survey
of 32 economists. An expansion would lift the country out of its
third technical recession in the past five years. The Bank of
Japan will conclude a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.  The yen climbed against all its major peers yesterday after
an unidentified G-7 official said Japan will be discussed at the
G-20 later this week in Moscow on concern the currency’s decline
has been excessive. A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas
earnings at Japanese exporters.  Toyota slid 1.8 percent to 4,830 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. , an
automaker that gets 28 percent of its sales in North America,
dropped 2.8 percent to 283 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.  led
declines among shippers, falling 5.2 percent to 184 yen.  Of the 238 companies on the Topix that have reported
earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 63 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 53
percent missed sales projections, the data show.  Gree, Pioneer  Gree fell 15 percent to 1,150 yen, the biggest decline in
nine months. The social-network provider cut its profit target
on new game delays and slower-than-expected overseas sales.  Pioneer plunged 11 percent to 201 yen, capping the biggest
drop since March 2011, after reversing its forecast to a 4
billion yen loss from a 1 billion yen gain.  Daikin lost 6.1 percent to 3,480 yen after its nine-month
net income fell 38 percent from a year earlier to 19.5 billion
yen.  Olympus Corp.  slid 2.7 percent to 2,020 yen after cutting
its outlook for profit on an impairment loss at its imaging
division. The company said it expects to lose 16 billion yen
this year at its camera business, double the target set in
November, and plans to reorganize the division.  THK Co., a maker of industrial linear-motion systems,
surged 8.5 percent to 1,683 yen after raising its full-year
profit forecast.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today as U.S.
President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address.
The gauge gained 0.2 percent yesterday to the highest level
since November 2007 as earnings topped estimates.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index  fell 5.1 percent
to 26.75, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.7 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
