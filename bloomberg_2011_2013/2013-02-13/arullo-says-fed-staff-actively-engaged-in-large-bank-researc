Federal Reserve Governor  Daniel Tarullo  said the central bank’s staff is “actively engaged” in
research and analysis in understanding how the largest banks
operate.  The most “pressing task” is to advise the Federal Reserve
Board on the financial stability impact of large bank mergers,
Tarullo said in a letter to Representative  Edward Royce , a
California Republican. Royce asked the Fed governor in a letter
last month how the central bank was taking up the task of
studying organizational structures of large banks.  Tarullo also said the Fed staff has been actively
“identifying and obtaining” new sources of data that could
help future research. His letter was dated Feb. 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Craig Torres  in
