Sun Life Financial Inc ., a Canadian
insurer, reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as North American and Asian operations improved.  Net income was C$395 million ($394.4 million), or 65 cents
a share, compared with a net loss of C$525 million, or 90 cents,
a year earlier, the Toronto-based insurer said today in a
statement. A year ago, Sun Life recorded costs tied to variable-
annuity and segregated fund contracts.  Excluding some one-time items, Sun Life had a fourth-
quarter profit of 76 cents a share, according to the statement.
That beat the 63-cent average  estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  “Fourth-quarter results reflect overall solid earnings
performance,” Chief Executive Officer  Dean Connor , 56, said in
the statement. “It was a transformational year for Sun Life.”  Profit from the firm’s Canadian unit more than tripled to
C$143 million from C$38 million a year earlier, while Asia net
income climbed 32 percent to C$50 million, the company said. Sun
Life’s U.S. operations, excluding an annuities business that’s
being sold, posted profit of C$93 million, compared with a loss
of C$85 million a year ago.  Shares Gain  Sun Life agreed in December to sell its U.S. annuities unit
for $1.35 billion to a firm owned by New York-based Guggenheim
Partners LLC, reducing risks from equities. Including the
business being sold, U.S. operations had profit of C$202
million, compared with a loss of C$615 million a year earlier,
the firm said.  Sun Life rose 0.8 percent to C$30 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
shares have gained 42 percent in the last 12 months, compared
with a 12 percent  advance  in the 44-company Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Financials Index.  Sun Life is the last of Canada’s three main life insurers
to report fourth-quarter results.  Manulife Financial Corp .
posted profit last week of C$1.06 billion, or 56 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss.  Great-West Lifeco Inc . said
Feb. 7 that profit fell 43 percent to C$353 million, or 37
cents, on costs tied to litigation.  (Sun Life will hold a conference tomorrow at 10 a.m. Toronto
