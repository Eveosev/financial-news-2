Komercni Banka AS ’s profit rose more
than expected to a record last year as the Czech unit of Societe
Generale SA cut its total write-offs.  Net income attributable to shareholders jumped 47 percent
from 2011 to 13.95 billion koruna ($740 million), the Prague-
based bank said in a statement today, beating the 13.75 billion-
koruna median estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. It
proposed a dividend payout of 230 koruna per share.  While the Czech economy contracted in 2012, Komercni
increased lending by 4.1 percent to 469.1 billion koruna and
slashed the amount of reserves and provisioning by 75 percent to
1.9 billion koruna. In 2011, profit shrank 29 percent to a five-
year low as the bank wrote off 5.36 billion koruna from a 7
billion-koruna portfolio of Greek government bonds.  “The lower risk costs were therefore the main driver for
the 47 percent gain in the group’s net profit,” Komercni Banka
said in the statement.  Fourth-quarter net attributable profit increased 25 percent
from a year earlier to 3 billion koruna, the company said.  While economic conditions “will probably remain difficult
this year and market interest rates will stay very low, we must
focus on disciplined cost management,” Chief Executive Officer
 Henri Bonnet  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
