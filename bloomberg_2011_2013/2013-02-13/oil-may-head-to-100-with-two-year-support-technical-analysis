Oil in New York may rise toward $100
a barrel if buying interest along the two-year moving average
propels prices above a range of about $98.25 to $98.35 a barrel,
according to Barclays Plc.  The two-year mean is underpinning closing prices on the
weekly chart at about $95.15 a barrel, Barclays analysts
including  Jordan Kotick , global head of technical strategy, said
in a report dated yesterday. Buyers are emerging near the $95
level, signaling the market may test the $98.25 to $98.35 a
barrel range, according to the report.  Oil last traded above $100 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on Sept. 14. Prices have gained 6.3 percent
this year as improving economic data in the U.S. and China add
to signs of a global economic recovery.  “A move above would target the $100 a barrel barrier,”
Barclays said. “Buyers emerge near range lows.”  Crude in New York, which has slid from a four-month high of
$98.24 on Jan. 30, stemmed its decline with a 1.4 percent gain
on Feb. 11, a “key bullish day” that formed a large white
candlestick on the daily chart, according to the bank.  Oil for March delivery rose 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, to
$97.58 a barrel at 12:01 p.m. Singapore time in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
