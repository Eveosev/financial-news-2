Citigroup Inc .’s main banking unit
had its debt outlook upgraded to stable from negative by Moody’s
Investors Service as the ratings firm cited the lender’s efforts
to improve its approach to risk.  “A sustained improvement in Citigroup’s risk culture is
critical to the firm’s  credit strength ,” Moody’s said today in
a report on the New York-based bank, the third-biggest in the
U.S. by deposits. “The reorganization announced by CEO  Michael Corbat  on January 7 has been orderly. Moody’s believes there has
been no interruption in Citigroup’s efforts to install an
improved risk governance culture.”  Corbat replaced the ousted  Vikram Pandit  as chief executive
officer in October. Moody’s kept the bank unit’s deposit rating
at A3 and maintained the negative outlook on the Baa2 senior
debt and Baa3 subordinated debt ratings of the parent company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
