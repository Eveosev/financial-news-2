The Canadian currency fell against
most of its major counterparts after Bank of Canada Governor
Mark Carney reiterated to lawmakers yesterday that interest-rate
increases are less urgent in the face of a slow economy.  Canada’s dollar was little changed against its U.S. peer
after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said currencies
should be allowed to fluctuate on monetary-stimulus measures.
Canadian employment unexpectedly fell last month and housing
starts dropped to the lowest level since the end of the 2009
recession, reports showed last week.  “People could be paying more attention to Carney’s comment
when he talked about considerable slack in the Canadian economy,
and that’s having a bit more of an impact overnight,” said
 David Watt , chief economist at the Canadian unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc, by phone from Toronto. “We also haven’t had any
Canadian data to focus on. We had that big burst of data on
Friday, and if you had a modestly positive view on the Canadian
dollar before that day you’re probably somewhat more cautious
now.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, traded at C$1.0028 per U.S.
dollar at 8:17 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 99.72
U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
