There is “room to work together”
to make changes in the international tax system that could lead
to lighter burdens on some foreign income of U.S. companies,
said  Jack Lew , President  Barack Obama ’s nominee for Treasury
secretary.  In response to questions from Senator  Mike Crapo , an Idaho
Republican, Lew emphasized that the administration supports a
global minimum tax, which runs in the opposite direction. He
spoke during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Finance
Committee.  Under current law, the U.S. has a so-called worldwide tax
system in which U.S. companies’ foreign income is taxed at the
U.S. rate, though only when brought home and after foreign tax
credits.  Other countries, such as the U.K., have switched to a so-
called territorial system that lightens burdens on foreign
income.  Lew’s comments suggested that the administration could
support a system that is nominally “territorial” and include
limits on companies’ ability to locate income in low-tax or no-
tax countries. He said it depends on where the “dial” is set.  Lew said it would be challenging to get the corporate tax
rate to 25 percent from 35 percent because of the amount of tax
breaks that would have to be curtailed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
