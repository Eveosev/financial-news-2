New Zealand’s dollar gained to its
highest in two and a half years against Australia’s after
manufacturing in the smaller economy expanded last month,
boosting prospects its Reserve Bank will raise interest rates.  The so-called kiwi matched its strongest level since
September 2011 against the greenback after a manufacturing index
 rose  to its highest in eight months and consumer confidence
climbed. Australia’s currency fell versus the U.S. dollar as
traders predicted its central bank will lower rates to a record
this year.  “The RBNZ are likely to maintain a steady rates profile
throughout this year, whereas data in Australia still suggests
that we’ve going to get further rate cuts,” said  Timothy Riddell , the Singapore-based head of global markets research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The data surprises
seem to be supporting kiwi over Australia at the moment.”  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.4 percent to NZ$1.2219 per
Aussie dollar at 4:46 p.m. in Sydney, after climbing to
NZ$1.2197, the highest since July 2010. It gained 0.2 percent to
84.71 U.S. cents after touching 84.93, matching the most since
September 2011. The kiwi advanced 0.4 percent to 79.28 yen.
Australia’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0350 and was little
changed at 96.88 yen.  New Zealand’s Performance of Manufacturing Index increased
to 55.2 in January from a revised 50.4 in December, Business New
Zealand and the Bank of New Zealand Ltd. said in a statement
released in Wellington. A reading over 50 signifies expansion.  Consumer Confidence  A gauge of consumer confidence climbed to 121 in February,
the highest since June 2010, ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. and Roy
Morgan Research said in a separate report.  New Zealand’s two-year swap  rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, added three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.01 percent, the highest since April 17. The RBNZ
will probably raise rates by 0.25 percentage point over 12
months, according to a Credit Suisse AG index.  The kiwi may advance toward NZ$1.19 per Aussie dollar after
breaking through the NZ$1.2220 level, said  Stan Shamu , a markets
strategist with IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne.  “It certainly seems like the strategy among most traders
is to sell Aussie on strength,” he said.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens will
probably lower the 3 percent key rate by 0.41 percentage point
over 12 months, according to a separate Credit Suisse index.
Australia’s benchmark borrowing cost reached 2.89 percent in
January 1960, the lowest level on record in RBA data going back
to 1959.  Australia’s 10-year  bond yield  rose for a third day, adding
nine basis points to 3.59 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
