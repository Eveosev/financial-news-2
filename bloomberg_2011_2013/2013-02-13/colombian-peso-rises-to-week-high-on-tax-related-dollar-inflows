Colombia’s peso climbed to its
highest level in a week on speculation companies will repatriate
dollars to pay local taxes.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,778.27 per U.S.
dollar, its strongest level on a closing basis since Feb. 1. The
currency has dropped 0.6 percent this year as the government and
central bank announced increased dollar purchases to stem a
rally that sent the peso to a 17-month intraday high on Jan. 2.  “Companies tend to bring large flows as they pay taxes
this month, returning the peso to its strengthening trend,”
said  Francisco Chaves , a strategist at Corredores Asociados
brokerage in Bogota. “The peso had been weakening, artificially
kept around 1,790 by the government’s aggressive intervention.”
The currency’s “fair value” is 1,765 to 1,780, Chaves said.  Banco de la Republica said Jan. 28 that it will buy at
least $30 million a day, bringing purchases in the foreign-
exchange market to $3 billion between February and May. A
stronger peso curbs exporters’ profit margins.  Colombia’s “big aspiration” is a weaker currency to help
its exporters, Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said
yesterday. The peso should weaken to its “equilibrium” level
of 1,950, he said.  Planned Issuance  Cardenas said today that the government is scaling back
plans for overseas bond sales this year by $1 billion as part of
its bid to ease gains in the local currency. Colombia will sell
$600 million in foreign bonds in the remainder of this year
after issuing $1 billion of debt last month, Cardenas told
reporters in Bogota. The total is down 38 percent from the $2.6
billion of debt the government had said in December it would
issue overseas.  Colombia will buy $1 billion in the currency market to pay
for interest and principal on foreign bonds coming due this
year, Cardenas said.  The yield on Colombia’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.07 percent,
according to the central bank. The price fell 0.104 centavo to
141.979 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s 2013 financing needs were reduced by 1.8
trillion pesos after a Feb. 8 debt exchange with public
entities, the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today. The government bought back inflation-linked debt due this
year and in exchange gave investors peso bonds due in 2021, 2022
and 2026, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
