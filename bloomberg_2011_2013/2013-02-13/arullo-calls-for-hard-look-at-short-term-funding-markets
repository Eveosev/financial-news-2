Federal Reserve Governor  Daniel Tarullo  said U.S. and international financial regulators need to
take “a hard, comprehensive” look at risks in short-term
funding markets.  “Non-deposit short-term funding remains significant,”
Tarullo said in written testimony prepared for a hearing
tomorrow by the Senate Banking Committee. “Analysis of the
appropriate ways to address these vulnerabilities continues as a
priority this year for the Federal Reserve.”  Tarullo, who is the Fed governor in charge of financial
supervision and regulation, called for more transparency in
short-term funding markets in his testimony and “additional
measures” to reduce the risks posed by money market funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
