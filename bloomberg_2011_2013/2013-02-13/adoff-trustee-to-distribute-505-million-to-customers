The trustee for Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities Inc. said he will make an additional
distribution of $505 million to customers, bringing the total to
more than $5.4 billion, or almost 43 percent of approved claims.  The distribution, announced today, will be the third by
 Irving S. Picard , the trustee. Including $806 million provided
by the Securities Investor Protection Corp., Picard previously
distributed just under $5 billion to customers.  The bankruptcy court in New York will hold a hearing on
March 13 to approve the new distribution to victims of Madoff’s
$20 billion Ponzi scheme, the largest in U.S. history.  The distribution will be made from the $9.317 billion
Picard has recovered so far. He is precluded from paying almost
$2.5 billion held in reserve for disputed claims. In addition,
Picard is holding back $1.3 billion until courts rule on whether
customers are entitled to interest on their claims to take into
consideration the time-value of money.  March 22 will be the record date for the new distribution.  Most of it results from more than $1 billion in a
settlement escrow that expired on Feb. 8.  The funds Picard holds don’t include an additional
$2.2 billion that was forfeited to the government. Late last
year, the government began the process leading eventually to
distribution of the forfeited funds to customers.  There are about 2,200 customers with approved claims. Half
already have been paid in full, as a result of advances from
SIPC, whose fund pays as much as $500,000 per claim. Once
customers all recover 100 percent, SIPC is next in line to
recoup its advances, including liquidation costs. Unsecured
creditors will have a recovery only after SIPC is fully repaid.  SIPC Trustee  The Madoff firm began liquidating in December 2008, with
appointment of a trustee under the Securities Investor
Protection Act.  Bernard Madoff  individually went into an involuntary
Chapter 7 liquidation in April 2009. His bankruptcy case was
consolidated with the firm’s liquidation. Madoff is serving a
150-year prison sentence following a guilty plea.  The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-cr-
00213, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
