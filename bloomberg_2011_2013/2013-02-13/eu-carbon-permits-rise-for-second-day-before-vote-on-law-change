European Union carbon permits
advanced for a second day before a vote next week on a change to
the bloc’s emissions trading law that would enable a temporary
reduction of oversupply in the cap-and-trade system.  EU allowances for delivery in December rose as much as 3.5
percent to 4.74 euros ($6.38) a metric ton and were at 4.67
euros on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 8:54 a.m.
The contract extended this month’s gain to 37 percent.  The EU rescue plan for the carbon market is increasingly
likely to win majority support from the European Parliament’s
environment committee in a vote on Feb. 19, Matthias Groote, the
lawmaker in charge of the measure in the assembly, said in an
interview last week. The proposal will also need approval by the
whole Parliament and member states in the next stages of the
legislative process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
