South African  retail-sales  growth
slowed in December as high unemployment and quickening inflation
curbed consumer demand.  Retail sales rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, below a
revised 3.6 percent pace in November, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. The  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 15 economists was 1.6 percent. Sales
increased 1 percent from a month earlier.  “It confirms the gradual slowdown in the consumption
growth is expected to continue into 2013,”  Ilke van Zyl , an
economist at Absa Group Ltd., said by phone after the data was
released.  Household sentiment slipped to the lowest level since 2008
last year as growth in the continent’s largest economy slowed
and inflation quickened toward the top of the central bank’s
target range.  Unemployment  at 24.9 percent in the fourth quarter
is the highest of 39 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. Weak
consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of
expenditure, may keep the central bank from raising interest
rates.  The economy will expand 2.6 percent this year, near the
estimated growth of 2.5 percent last year, which would be the
lowest since a 2009 recession, the central bank said Jan. 24.
The  inflation rate  rose to 5.7 percent in December and Eskom
Holdings SOC Ltd., which supplies about 95 percent of the
nation’s power, has asked the regulator to approve annual price
increases of 16 percent for electricity through 2018.  A 4.8 percent decline in the value of the rand against the
dollar this year, the second-worst performer among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, may add to the cost of imports
and push the inflation rate higher.  The rand extended its gain after the data was released,
rising 0.3 percent at 1:20 p.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on
the rand debt due in 2021 dropped 3 basis points to 6.42
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
