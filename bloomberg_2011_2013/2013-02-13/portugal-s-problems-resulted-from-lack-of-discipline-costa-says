Portugal’s problems today are the
result of a lack of discipline that was required to belong to a
monetary union, European Central Bank Governing Council Member
 Carlos Costa  said.  In the past, Portugal used to resolve its difficulties by
resorting to “escape valves” such as inflation and the budget,
Costa, who also heads the Bank of Portugal, said today at a
conference in Lisbon.  “We weren’t able to integrate in our behavior the
discipline that is proper of a monetary union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
