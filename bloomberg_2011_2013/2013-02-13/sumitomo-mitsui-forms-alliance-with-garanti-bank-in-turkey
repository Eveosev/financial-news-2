Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. 
signed an accord with Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, becoming the
third Japanese megabank to tie up with a Turkish lender since
September.  The lender’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. unit and
Garanti, Turkey’s largest bank by market value, will cooperate
on export credit agency financing and advice on project and
structured finance, Sumitomo Mitsui said in a statement today.  Japan’s second-biggest bank by market value joins
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.  and Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. in allying with Turkish lenders to capitalize on the
country’s credit demand. The three Tokyo-based megabanks are
seeking to boost lending abroad as persistent deflation
discourages borrowing at home.  Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in September signed an agreement
with  Akbank TAS , the Turkish bank part-owned by Citigroup Inc.,
to cooperate in commercial and investment banking. Akbank and
Mizuho will provide services to Japanese companies operating and
investing in Turkey.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. unveiled an accord with
 Turkiye Is Bankasi AS  in October. The unit of Japan’s biggest
banking group also won approval to set up a bank in Turkey with
capital of $300 million, according to a decision by Turkish
regulators published on Dec. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
