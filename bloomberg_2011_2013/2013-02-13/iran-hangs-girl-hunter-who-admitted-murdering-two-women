Iran publicly hanged a man known as
the “girl hunter” after he said he murdered two women, the
official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported.  The man was hanged at 6:20 a.m. local time today in Tehran,
the capital, IRNA said.  The individual, who was identified only as Ali, confessed
during interrogations to killing two women and wounding five
others, according to the report. The man picked his victims,
some of whom he stabbed and robbed, among young women in the
east of Tehran, IRNA said.  Iran uses capital punishment for crimes including murder,
rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Though most criminals
sentenced to death are executed in prison, some have been hanged
in public to set an example.  To contact the reporter on this story:
