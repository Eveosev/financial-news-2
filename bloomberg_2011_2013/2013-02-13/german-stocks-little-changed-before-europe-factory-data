German stocks were little changed as
investors awaited euro-area industrial output data.  The benchmark DAX Index added 0.1 percent to 7,668.13 at
9:13 a.m. in Frankfurt. The gauge has climbed 0.7 percent so far
this year, the worst performance among the 24 developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg. The broader HDAX index was also little
changed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
