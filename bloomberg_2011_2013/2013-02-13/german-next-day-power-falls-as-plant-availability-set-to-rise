Power for 2014 delivery in Germany,
Europe’s biggest market, rose for a second day as European Union
emissions permits advanced.  Baseload German year-ahead electricity, for supplies
delivered around the clock, advanced as much as 0.8 percent
while carbon climbed as much as 12 percent. Power can track
emissions, which affect production costs.  German power, a benchmark contract in Europe, climbed as
much as 35 cents to 42.90 euros ($57.74) a megawatt-hour, the
highest price since Jan. 18, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg. The contract traded at 42.80 euros as of 5:15 p.m.
Berlin time. French 2014 electricity was little changed at 45.55
euros, broker data show.  EU carbon permits for December rose as high as 5.11 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. That’s
the most since Jan. 23.  The German day-ahead power contract fell for the first time
in three days, losing 8.9 percent to 47.40 euros a megawatt-
hour. The contract settled at 46.66 euros in a daily auction on
EPEX Spot SE. French next-day power dropped 5.4 percent to 56.75
euros, broker data show and settled at 53.49 on EPEX Spot.  Available generation in Germany was forecast to rise to
63,758 megawatts tomorrow from 63,187 megawatts today, according
to data from  European Energy Exchange  AG.  Temperatures in Germany may fall to minus 7.2 degrees
Celsius (19 Fahrenheit) at 6 a.m. tomorrow compared with a
previous forecast of minus 6.9 degrees, according to a GFS model
supplied by MetraWeather to Bloomberg. In France, minimum
temperatures will reach 0.9 degrees at 6 a.m., in line with
predictions.  Wind output in Germany is predicted at less than 1 gigawatt
tomorrow, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather forecaster,
said on its  website . That compares with an average level of 4.9
gigawatts, according to data from EEX on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
