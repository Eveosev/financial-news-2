Taylor Morrison Home Corp. , a
builder of houses in the U.S. and Canada, doubled the amount it
will seek in a U.S. initial public offering to $500 million.  The Scottsdale, Arizona-based company boosted the offering
size in a regulatory filing today, after originally announcing
plans in December for a $250 million IPO. The figure is a
placeholder used to calculate registration fees and may change.  Taylor Morrison is preparing to go public as home  prices 
and sales recover following the worst crash since the Great
Depression. The company may also benefit from increased demand
for equities after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday
reached the highest since 2007. More than three-fourths of U.S.
IPOs this year are trading above their offer price.  Boise Cascade Co. , a Boise, Idaho-based producer of wood
products used in home construction, priced its U.S. IPO above an
increased price range earlier this month and gained 31 percent
in trading through yesterday.  Homebuilder shares are surging. The S&P Supercomposite
Homebuilding Index of 11 companies has gained 13 percent this
year after an 84 percent advance in 2012. Tri Pointe Homes Inc.,
which went public last month in the first builder IPO since
2004, has added 11 percent since the Jan. 30 offering.  Taylor Morrison will be the sixth-biggest public
homebuilder in North America based on 2011 revenue, according to
its filings.  Proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt and for
working capital, according to Taylor Morrison’s filing. Credit
Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. are leading the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
