U.S. Treasury secretary nominee  Jack Lew  said he wasn’t involved in making investment decisions
during his time at Citigroup Inc.  “I was not in the business in making investment
decisions,” Lew said. He said he was aware of funds “that were
in trouble” and of “difficulties that were going on.”  Lew was testifying before the Senate Finance Committee,
which is considering his nomination to succeed  Timothy F. Geithner  as head of the Treasury Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
