GlaxoSmithKline PLC , the U.K.’s
largest drugmaker, isn’t considering large-scale acquisitions,
Chief Financial Officer  Simon Dingemans  said.  “Our emerging-markets business made a number of
acquisitions two or three years ago,” Dingemans said in an
interview today with Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop.” “We’re very comfortable with the footprint we have.
If we do any M&A it’s going to be relatively small bolt-ons and
in-fills.”  Dingemans was responding to a questions about news reports
that Glaxo and other companies are considering acquiring
Brazilian drugmaker Ache Laboratorios Farmaceuticos SA. Glaxo is
seeking to capture more growth in emerging markets. The company
increased its stake in an Indian consumer-health subsidiary to
73 percent from 43 percent, and also is buying shares in its
Nigerian unit.  Closely held Ache had 2011 sales of about $1.5 billion,
according to the company’s  website . Drug companies in emerging
markets are priced in the stock market at about 2.45 times
sales, based on the median multiple in data compiled by
Bloomberg. At that multiple, the Brazilian company would be
valued at about $3.7 billion.  Spending billions of dollars on an acquisition isn’t “on
the cards,” Dingemans said today.  Glaxo is looking mostly at acquisitions of early-stage
compounds and technologies, rather than focusing on spending
billions of dollars to buy experimental medicines in late stages
of testing, Patrick Vallance, the drugmaker’s head of
pharmaceuticals research and development, said in an interview
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
