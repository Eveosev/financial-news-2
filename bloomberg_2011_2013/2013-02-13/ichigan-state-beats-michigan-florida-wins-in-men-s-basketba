No. 8 Michigan State University beat
the fourth-ranked University of Michigan 75-52 in men’s college
basketball to take the outright lead in the Big Ten conference.  Gary Harris scored 17 points, including five 3-pointers,
last night as the  Spartans  improved to 21-4 overall and 10-2 in
 Big Ten  play. Top-ranked Indiana is second in the conference
with a 9-2 mark. The  Wolverines  dropped to 21-4 and 8-4 in the
Big Ten with their 13th defeat in 14 road games against Michigan
State.  The result at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center in
East Lansing gives the Spartans their 20th victory in their last
26 meetings with the Wolverines.  It was the only time the programs have met with both ranked
in the top 10 and the first since Jan. 10, 1998, with Michigan
ranked higher than Michigan State.  Also last night, seventh-ranked Florida defeated Kentucky
69-52 in a matchup between the top two teams in the  Southeastern
Conference . Kentucky freshman forward Nerlens Noel, projected by
some analysts as the top pick in the 2013 National Basketball
Association draft, left the game with a knee injury.  Florida ended a run of five losses against No. 25 Kentucky
to improve to 20-3 and 12-0 at home. The  Gators  have won two
straight since a defeat at Arkansas ended a run of 10
consecutive wins.  Florida leads the SEC with a 10-1 mark, with Kentucky in
second place with an 8-3 record in conference play. The
Wildcats, who shot 42 percent from the field and had 17
turnovers, dropped to 17-7 overall with their first defeat in
six games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
