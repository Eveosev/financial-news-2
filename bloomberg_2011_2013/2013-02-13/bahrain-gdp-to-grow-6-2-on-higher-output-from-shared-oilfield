Bahrain’s economy is set to grow
6.2 percent this year on higher output from its own oil field
and one shared with Saudi Arabia, the country’s Economic
Development Board said.  Growth is set to accelerate from 3.9 percent last year,
when oil production fell due to technical disruptions, the board
said in a quarterly report on its website today. The Abu Sa’afa
field saw output fall below the usual level for most of 2012
before the situation normalized in November, it said. Output
from the onshore Bahrain field “progressed more slowly than
originally expected” at an average of 45,000 barrels a day.  Bahrain, which began pumping oil in the 1930s and is home
to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, is the smallest crude producer
in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. Saudi Arabia, the
largest, supplies Bahrain with 150,000 barrels a day of crude
pumped from their shared Abu Sa’afa offshore field and delivered
to Bahrain’s refinery by pipeline.  Bahrain expects its full share of 150,000 barrels a day
from Abu Sa’afa this year, while output from the other field may
grow to 47,500 barrels a day, the board said. It predicts that
growth will slow to 3.4 percent next year, while inflation may
stabilize around 3 percent for the next two years.  Bahrain’s economy has rebounded after a slowdown in 2011,
when it grew 1.9 percent amid protests that broke out as part of
a wave of Arab unrest. Standard & Poor’s cited improvements in
the “political, economic and fiscal situation” when it revised
the kingdom’s credit outlook to stable from negative last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
