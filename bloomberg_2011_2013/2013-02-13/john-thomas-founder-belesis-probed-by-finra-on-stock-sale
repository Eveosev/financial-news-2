Thomas Belesis , the founder of
brokerage John Thomas Financial Inc., was warned by industry
regulators that he may face disciplinary action over the timing
of some of his company’s stock sales.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s
self-funded watchdog, told Belesis last month it was looking
into whether he sold stock owned by his firm while failing to
properly execute customer orders to sell the same security,
records on Finra’s website show. The regulator, which didn’t
disclose the stock that was sold,  fined  John Thomas $275,000 in
2011 for mischaracterizing commissions as handling fees.  “If a proceeding is brought, JTF intends to vigorously
contest and defend the matter,” David Pitts, a spokesman for
the New York-based firm, said in an e-mailed statement.  Finra accused Belesis of using “manipulative, deceptive
and/or fraudulent means to artificially inflate the price of the
stock” and alleged that his firm failed to preserve records of
the orders.  Belesis, who is also the brokerage’s chief executive
officer, is a frequent guest on business television shows and
appeared in the movie “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.”
