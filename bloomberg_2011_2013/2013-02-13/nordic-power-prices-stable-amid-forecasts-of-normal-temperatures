Nordic electricity prices were
little changed as weather forecasts indicated temperatures will
be near seasonal norms in the coming weeks.  The March contract gained 0.1 percent to 37.90 euros
($51.08) a megawatt-hour as of 10:53 a.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The benchmark near-quarter
contract gained 0.2 percent to 36.55 euros, while the 2014
contract gained 2 cents to 37.50 euros.  Minimum temperatures in Oslo may be minus 7 degrees Celsius
(19 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 26, according to CustomWeather Inc. data
on Bloomberg. That’s the same as today’s low and the 10-year
average. Temperatures in the Nordic region as a whole will also
be near seasonal norms in the coming days, according to Energi
Danmark A/S.  “There are limited changes from yesterday’s weather
forecasts, with temperatures stabilizing around normal levels on
February 16,” the Danish energy trading company said today on
its website.  Flows on the 550-megawatt Fennoskan-1 cable that links
Finland and Sweden stopped last night following an unspecified
malfunction, a filing to the Oslo-based Nord Pool Spot AS
exchange by Finnish grid operator Fingrid Oyj showed yesterday.
No reason or expected duration was given.  Vattenfall AB , Sweden’s biggest utility, reached full
output from its 940-megawatt Ringhals-4 nuclear reactor on the
country’s west coast at 10:19 a.m., after earlier limiting
production due to turbine maintenance, data from the company’s
website showed.  The Nordic region gets a fifth of power output from nuclear
reactors and more than half from hydroelectric plants. The
amount of water and snow available to generate electricity in
the region may be 15.1 terawatt-hours below normal for the time
of year in two weeks, down from 11.9 terawatt-hours today,
