FMC Technologies Inc. , the largest
U.S. provider of subsea gear to the oil and natural gas
industry, climbed the most in more than six months after beating
expectations for orders last quarter and forecasting another
record year.  FMC Technologies  rose 5 percent to $50.46 at the close in
New York, the biggest gain for the Houston-based company since
July 26, 2012.  The company reported orders of $1.38 billion for subsea
equipment in the fourth quarter, according to a statement
released yesterday. That was higher than the $1.05 billion
estimated by  Brian Uhlmer , an analyst at Global Hunter
Securities in Houston.  “The subsea orders were substantially above what anybody
was expecting,” Uhlmer, who rates the shares a buy and doesn’t
own any, said today in a telephone interview. “The expectation
for orders in 2013 to be above 2012 means your 2014 numbers are
going to be pretty well taken care of.”  Subsea orders are expected to increase this year compared
to the $4.6 billion booked in 2012, Chief Executive Officer  John Gremp  told analysts and investors today on a conference call.
Orders awarded to the total industry may grow 30 to 40 percent
this year as large oil exploration projects off the coasts of
West Africa and Brazil and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico lead to
development work on the sea floor, he said.  FMC Technologies expects the operating profit margin for
its largest unit, subsea technologies, to grow to 13 percent
this year, Chief Financial Officer  Maryann Seaman  said on the
call. The company reported a margin of 11.3 percent for 2012,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
