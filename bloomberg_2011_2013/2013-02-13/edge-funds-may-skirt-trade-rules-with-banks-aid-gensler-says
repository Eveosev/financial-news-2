Banks may be helping hedge funds
avoid rules meant to reduce market risks by routing trades
through overseas offices, the top U.S. derivatives regulator
said in testimony prepared for a hearing on the Dodd-Frank Act.  Overseas affiliates of the banks may be conducting trades
with hedge funds that are organized offshore even though their
principal place of business is the U.S., Commodity Futures
Trading Commission chairman  Gary Gensler  said in a statement for
tomorrow’s Senate Banking Committee hearing. The effort may be
used to avoid rules, taking effect in March, requiring trades to
be guaranteed at central clearinghouses.  “The CFTC is working to ensure that this idea does not
prevail and develop into a practice that leaves the American
public at risk,” Gensler said in the prepared remarks.  Gensler also said the CFTC will soon complete regulations
exempting inter-company trades from the clearing requirements. A
group of international regulators also expect to finish in the
second half of the year rules governing collateral for trades
that aren’t settled at clearinghouses, he said.  Regulators plan to hold roundtable meetings in London on
Feb. 20 and at the CFTC on Feb. 26 on efforts to revamp the
London interbank offered rate, Gensler said.  Barclays Plc ,  UBS
AG  and the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  have settled with
regulators and paid fines in a global probe into interest-rate
rigging.  To contact the reporter on this story:
