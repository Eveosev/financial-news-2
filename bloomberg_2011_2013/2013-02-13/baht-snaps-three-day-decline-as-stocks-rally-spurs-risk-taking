Thailand’s baht climbed, snapping a
three-day decline, on optimism regional stock gains and the
Southeast nation’s economic growth will spur capital inflows.
Government bonds fell for a third day.  The currency rose by the most this month as the  MSCI  Asia
Pacific Index of shares advanced 0.1 percent, taking its rally
this year to 3.2 percent. The Bank of Thailand last month raised
its 2013 growth forecast to 4.9 percent from an October
projection of 4.6 percent. The central bank estimates the
economy expanded 5.9 percent in 2012.  “With stock gains, risk sentiment is pretty good again,
supporting regional currencies,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief
currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Countries with a steady economic outlook, such as Southeast
Asian countries, tend to see a good amount of fund inflows.”  The baht advanced 0.2 percent to 29.81 per dollar as of
3:04 p.m. in Bangkok, the biggest gain since Jan. 30, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, slumped 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to
5.25 percent.  Overseas investors bought $1.3 billion more local sovereign
debt than they sold this month through yesterday, Thai Bond
Market Association data show.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 rose one basis point to 3.6 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
