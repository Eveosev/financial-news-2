Prudential Financial Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, promoted  Robert Falzon  to
chief financial officer to replace  Rich Carbone , who is retiring
after 16 years in the job.  Falzon, who’s been treasurer since 2009, takes over the CFO
post on March 4, Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential said
yesterday in a statement.  Falzon’s “experience in managing the company’s capital and
liquidity, corporate finance, banking and cash management will
serve him well in his new role,” Chief Executive  John Strangfeld  said in the statement.  Strangfeld, 59, is restructuring management to boost
investment income and expand operations outside the U.S.  David Durning  was promoted in December to president of the commercial-
mortgage business and  Alfonso Munk  was hired in July from Morgan
Stanley to oversee more than $3.2 billion in assets for the real
estate investment unit in Latin America.  Falzon earned a bachelor’s degree from Rutgers University
and an MBA from Columbia University, Prudential said. He is a
Chartered Financial Analyst and a certified public accountant.  Carbone, a former managing director of Salomon Brothers,
joined Prudential as CFO in 1997, according to yesterday’s
statement. He’ll be an executive vice president after his
retirement from the CFO job.  Ken Tanji , CFO of the international business, was promoted
to treasurer and will report to Falzon, Prudential said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
