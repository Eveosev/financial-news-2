A luxury SLS hotel will be part of a
new $400 million downtown office tower in downtown Seattle, the
first property in the area for the boutique hotel brand.  SBE Entertainment Group LLC, which owns the SLS brand, will
run the 184-room hotel on the tower’s second through 15th
floors, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Sam Nazarian  said.
The Los Angeles-based company also operates Hyde nightclubs and
the Katsuya and Cleo restaurant brands.  Nazarian is betting on continued growth in Seattle’s
hospitality market, which has outperformed the rest of the
country. Occupancy in the city last year climbed to 71 percent
from 69 percent in 2011, and average nightly rates increased 5
percent to $120.39, according to Hendersonville, Tennessee-based
research company STR. That compares with a 61 percent occupancy
rate and $106.10 average room rate nationally.  Construction will start on the downtown building by Oct. 1,
said Kevin Daniels, president of Seattle-based  Daniels Real
Estate , which is developing the 43-story tower with Stockbridge
Capital Group, based in San Francisco. The building is scheduled
for completion in mid-2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
