Principal Financial Group Inc. , the
insurer that expanded in Chile this month, said it cut 154
employees in 2012 as it scaled back from health coverage,
marking the fifth-straight year the workforce contracted.  Principal had 13,373  workers  as of Dec. 31, compared with
13,527 a year earlier, according to the insurer’s annual report
today. The figure was 16,585 at the end of 2007.  Chief Executive Officer  Larry Zimpleman  began exiting
health insurance in 2010, and job cuts are tied to the wind-down
of that unit, said  Susan Houser , a company spokeswoman. The Des
Moines, Iowa-based insurer is turning to fee revenue from
managing assets as low interest rates on bonds pressure profits.
Principal acquired Chilean pension manager AFP Cuprum SA this
month for about $1.5 billion as it expands in emerging markets.  “Apart from the planned three-year exit of our health
insurance business, we actually had new job growth in other
businesses,” Houser wrote in an e-mail. “We also were able to
reabsorb far more employees impacted by the health exit into
open positions in other businesses than we had originally
estimated.”  Principal shares  gained  about 23 percent in the past 12
months including dividends, beating the 20 percent return of the
22-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
