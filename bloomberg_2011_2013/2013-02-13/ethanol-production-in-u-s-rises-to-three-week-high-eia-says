Ethanol production in the U.S. rose
1.9 percent to 789,000 barrels a day last week, the Energy
Information Administration said today.  Output  climbed the most in five weeks and to the highest
level since Jan. 18, data from the Energy Departmentâ€™s
statistical agency showed.  Stockpiles  plunged 3 percent to 19.5
million barrels, the lowest level since Nov. 30 and the steepest
decline in 11 weeks.  At least 19 ethanol plants have been idled since June as
drought in the corn-rich Midwest slashed yields and raised costs
to produce the biofuel, according to data from the Renewable
Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group.  Imports  climbed to 11,000 barrels a day in the week ended
Jan. 8 from none the prior period and none a year ago, the EIA
reported. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, little changed from the previous week.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery declined 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.372 a gallon at 11:08 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. The futures have advanced 8.3
percent this year and are up 6.1 percent from a year earlier.  Production has risen 2.5 percent from a record low 770,000
barrels a day in the week ended Jan. 25 and has fallen 15
percent from a year earlier, EIA data show.  Stockpiles have declined 9.3 percent from a year earlier
and are  below average  for this time of year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
