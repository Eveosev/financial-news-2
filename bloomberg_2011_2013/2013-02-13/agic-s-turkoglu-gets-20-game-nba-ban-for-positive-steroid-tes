Orlando Magic reserve forward  Hedo Turkoglu  will forfeit almost $2.1 million during a 20-game
National Basketball Association suspension for violating the
league’s anti-drug program.  The NBA said in a statement that Turkoglu, 33, a native of
Istanbul, tested positive for the steroid amethenolone. His
suspension began last night when the Magic hosted the Atlanta
Hawks.  The 6-foot-10, 220-pound Turkoglu said he unknowingly took
the banned substance while in Turkey during the offseason. He
said his trainer gave him a medication, which he didn’t check,
to help speed recovery from a shoulder injury.  “I take full responsibility for anything that goes into my
body,” Turkoglu said in a statement released by the Magic.
“This was a complete error in judgment on my part.”  Turkoglu has played in 11 games for Orlando this season,
with one start, and has averaged 2.9 points, 2.4 rebounds and
2.1 assists. The 13-year NBA veteran, who also has played for
the Sacramento Kings, San Antonio Spurs, Toronto Raptors and
Phoenix Suns, has averaged 11.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.1
assists in his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
