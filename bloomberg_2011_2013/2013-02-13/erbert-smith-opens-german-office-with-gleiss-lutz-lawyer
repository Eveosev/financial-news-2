Herbert Smith Freehills LLP will
open a German branch and hired Ralf Thaeter, a corporate partner
from Gleiss Lutz, its former alliance partner in the country.  The law firm will open an office in Frankfurt during the
second quarter, it said in a  statement  on its website today.
Thaeter will move to the firm in April, he said in an interview.  “At Herbert Smith Freehills I see the chance to expand my
practice further on a global and international platform,” said
Thaeter, who last year advised Germany in its role as
shareholder in European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. during
the largest revamp in the company’s ownership since its
creation. “Setting up the German presence is a really exciting
job.”  Herbert Smith ended a decade-long alliance with Gleiss Lutz
after the German firm rejected a merger offer. The London-based
firm merged with Australia’s Freehills last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
