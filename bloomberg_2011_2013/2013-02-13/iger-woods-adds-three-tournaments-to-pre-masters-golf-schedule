Tiger Woods  will return to
competition next week in Arizona, adding three tournaments to
his U.S. playing schedule ahead of April’s Masters.  Woods, who opened his U.S. PGA Tour season last month with
his seventh win at the Farmers Insurance Open in La Jolla,
California, said on his website that he’ll play in the Match
Play Championship in Marana, Arizona, Feb 20-24; the Honda
Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, Feb. 28-March 3; and the
Cadillac Championship in Miami, March 7-10.  The No. 2 player in the Official World Golf Ranking, Woods
tied for 17th in last year’s Match Play event, a tournament he
won in 2003, 2004 and 2008.  At last year’s Honda Classic, Woods was runner-up to
Northern Ireland’s  Rory McIlroy  after an 8-under-par score of 62
on the final day, the lowest final-round total of his career.  Woods has won the Cadillac Championship event at Doral’s
Blue Monster course in Miami six times -- in 1999, 2002, 2003,
2005, 2006 and 2007. He also won the Ford Championship at Doral
in 2005 and 2006. Woods withdrew from last year’s event after 11
holes in the final round due to an Achilles injury.  The Masters Tournament takes place April 11-14 in Augusta,
Georgia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
