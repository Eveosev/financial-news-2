Peru plans to destroy coca bushes
this year at a faster pace than growers expand output as the
government seeks to curtail cultivation that has expanded for
six straight years.  The government will eradicate a record 22,000 hectares
(54,363 acres) of coca plants this year, which will reduce the
size of the crop by 6 percent,  Carmen Masias , the nation’s drug
czar, told reporters in Lima.  Peru’s cultivation of the plant used to make cocaine
increased 2 percent to 62,500 hectares in 2011, according to the
United Nations, even after the government removed about 10,000
hectares of bushes. The Andean nation, which previously relied
solely on foreign aid to finance eradication, will contribute 40
percent of this year’s $30 million budget to expand the program,
Masias said. Total spending on the drug fight will rise 16
percent to $278 million.  “Eradication is completely indispensable but must go hand
in hand with development” of alternative crops, such as cocoa
and palm oil, Masias said. The U.S. government, the main source
of drugs aid to Peru, agreed last year to provide $135 million
through 2017 for alternative development, she said.  President  Ollanta Humala’s  government removed about 14,000
hectares of coca bushes last year, 40 percent more than in 2011,
to slow growth in a crop that the United Nations says now rivals
Colombia’s as the world’s largest.  The drive to curtail cultivation will be extended to the
valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, an area of
jungle in the south of the country where holdout members of the
Shining Path, a Maoist insurgency group, are active, Masias
said.  The government is also removing coca bushes for the first
time in the Monzon valley in northern Peru, where the crop has
been grown for the drug trade for 80 years, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
