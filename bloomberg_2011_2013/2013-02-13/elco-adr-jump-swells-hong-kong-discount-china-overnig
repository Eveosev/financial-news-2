Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. 
resumes trading in Hong Kong today at the biggest discount to
New York since August, after data showing Macau casinos received
record visitors this week drove the U.S. stock higher.  American depositary receipts of Melco, the casino venture
of billionaire  James Packer  and Lawrence Ho, rallied 2.5 percent
over the past two days in New York to trade 5.7 percent  above 
the company’s shares in Hong Kong, which was closed from Feb. 11
for Lunar New Year holidays. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index 
of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. has gained 0.7
percent since Feb. 12 to 96.79. Trina Solar Ltd.  led declines  in
Chinese solar companies.  Melco ADRs added 2.1 percent in the U.S. yesterday after
Macau’s tourism office said  visitor arrivals  from mainland China
jumped 36 percent to 114,363 Feb. 12 and rose 23 percent in the
past week. That’s a record for daily visits, and minimum bet
sizes also increased, Union Gaming Group analysts wrote in a
client note. The Shanghai Stock Exchange reopens Feb. 18.  “The early indications seem to be that the strong start to
the New Year is probably going to put up a very strong
February,”  Brian McGill , a Philadelphia-based analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC who rates Melco ADRs a buy, said by phone.
“There’s considerable upside to Melco as it is relatively
cheaper than some of its peers and is a beneficiary of strong
mass-market trends in Macau. Its Hong Kong stock should catch up
with the gains in ADRs when the market opens.”  Melco Target  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.6 percent to $40.05 in
New York, rallying for a second day. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  was little changed at 1,520.33, after earlier rising as
much as 0.4 percent.  Melco’s ADRs rose to $20.99 in New York, the highest close
since Jan. 24. The ADRs’ premium over the company’s Hong Kong
stock was the widest since Aug. 16, when the advantage reached
7.3 percent.  Melco  added 1.3 percent in Hong Kong when it last
traded there Feb. 8, to HK$51.35, the equivalent of $6.62.  Janney Montgomery’s McGill raised his price target for
Melco by 14 percent to $28 in a Feb. 11 note.  The company’s ADRs trade at about 10 times 2013 earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, lower than
the multiple of 13 for peers  Las Vegas Sands Corp.  and Wynn
Resorts Ltd. Faster growth of recreational gamblers over high
rollers will also boost Melco’s profit outlook as the mass-
market sector is more profitable and China’s outlook is
improving, McGill said.  Nexen Deal  China’s economy, the world’s second-largest, halted a
seven-quarter slowdown in the three months to Dec. 31, posting
growth of 7.9 percent, the fastest pace of expansion since the
first quarter of 2012. A new generation of Communist Party
leaders was appointed in November in a once-a-decade power
shift.  Cnooc Ltd. , the largest offshore oil explorer in China,
climbed 1.5 percent in its second day of gains to $202.59 in New
York, 0.9 percent above the company’s Hong Kong shares. It was
the widest premium since Feb. 5. One ADR equals 100 underlying
shares in Cnooc.  Beijing-based Cnooc won approval to acquire the U.S. assets
of Nexen Inc., clearing its last regulatory hurdle in the $15.1
billion purchase of the Canadian energy company, Nexen said Feb.
12. The deal is expected to close in the week of Feb. 25,
according to the statement.  Suntech Slides  Trina , a solar cell manufacturer, dropped 5.8 percent to
$5.06, leading the first decline in three days for Chinese solar
manufacturers traded in New York. The company, based in
Changzhou, China, plans to report fourth-quarter financial
results Feb. 26, it said yesterday.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. , the world’s biggest solar-panel
maker, retreated 5.7 percent to $1.5 for the steepest slump
since Feb. 4.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co.  slid 5.2 percent
to $3.31 in U.S. trading.  Thirty-day  volatility  on the China-US gauge fell to 15.7
yesterday, the lowest level this year and compared with an
average of 18.1 over the past six months.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  slumped 4.6 percent
last week, while the  Shanghai Composite , which is made up of
domestic Chinese shares, added 0.6 percent in a second straight
week of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
