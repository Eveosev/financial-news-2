German apartment prices, which have
risen so sharply in some cities that the central bank warned of
an overheating property market, fell in January for the first
time in four years, according to the Europace EPX Index.  Europace, an online mortgage broker based in Berlin, said
its apartment index declined 0.7 percent in January from a year
earlier, the first annual drop since December 2009. Europace’s
overall homes index, which includes houses, rose 3.4 percent.  Home prices have been climbing as Germans invest in assets
that would retain their value if the euro crisis leads to higher
inflation. Foreign investors are also buying property in the
country as they try to increase their returns amid low interest
rates. In November, the Bundesbank said German home prices may
be in danger of overheating in some regions, although the risk
of a nationwide bubble is low.  An appreciating euro may have contributed to the decline in
apartment prices, said Michaela Reimann, a spokeswoman for
Europace. The euro gained about 2.8 percent against the dollar
in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Home prices are already quite high, and sometimes there
are seasonal fluctuations and currency effects whose influence
is difficult to measure,” said Reimann.  To contact the reporter on this story:
