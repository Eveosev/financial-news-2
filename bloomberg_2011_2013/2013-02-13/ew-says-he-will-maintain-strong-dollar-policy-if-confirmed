U.S. Treasury secretary nominee Jack
Lew said he will maintain the strong-dollar policy if he is
confirmed.  “Treasury has had a longstanding position through
administrations of both parties over many years that a strong
dollar is in the best interests of promoting U.S. growth,
productivity and competitiveness,” Lew said at his Senate
confirmation hearing today. “If confirmed, I would not change
that policy.”  Lew also said China’s currency is still undervalued.  To contact the reporters on this story:
