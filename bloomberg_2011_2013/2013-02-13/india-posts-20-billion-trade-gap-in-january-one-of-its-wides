India’s  trade deficit  in January was
$20 billion, the Director General of Foreign Trade  Anup Pujari 
said, reporting one of the nation’s widest monthly shortfalls.  Exports  climbed 0.8 percent from a year earlier to $25.6
billion while  imports  advanced 6.1 percent to $45.6 billion,
Pujari said at a briefing in New Delhi today as he delivered
provisional data.  India’s exports have been hampered by an uneven global
recovery even as demand for oil and gold have stoked inward
shipments. Reserve Bank of India Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said
this week that the “external sector is very vulnerable,” adding
the current-account gap may widen to a record in the year
through March 2013 from about 4.2 percent of gross domestic
product in the previous 12-month period.  “The worrying aspect is the widening trade deficit and
petroleum imports are contributing to it,” Commerce Secretary
 S.R. Rao  said at the trade briefing. “We are hopeful that
exports will improve in the future.”  India’s  current-account shortfall , the broadest measure of
trade, widened to an unprecedented $22.31 billion in the quarter
ended September 30.  The deficit has weighed on the rupee, which has weakened
8.6 percent against the dollar in the past year. The currency
has climbed about 3 percent since mid-September, when Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh began policy changes to bolster a
faltering economy.  The rupee was little changed at 53.855 per dollar as of
12:34 p.m. in Mumbai. The BSE India Sensitive Index rose 0.6
percent. The yield on the 8.15 percent note maturing June 2022
fell to 7.84 percent from 7.87 percent yesterday.  The policy steps include an increase in the duty on gold
and platinum imports to 6 percent from 4 percent last month. The
nation is the world’s largest bullion buyer.  The government said in December that it will prolong an
initiative providing subsidized credit to some exporters through
the 12 months to March 2014 to support overseas sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
