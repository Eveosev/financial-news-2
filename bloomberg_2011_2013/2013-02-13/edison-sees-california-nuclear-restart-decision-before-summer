A decision to restart  Edison
International ’s shuttered San Onofre nuclear power plant in
Southern California should be reached before summer,  Peter Dietrich , the company’s chief nuclear officer, said at a
regulatory meeting.  Edison has made plans for a summer without the reactor,
Dietrich said yesterday at a public meeting held by the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Capistrano Beach, California.  The commission is reviewing Edison’s proposal to restart
its Unit 2 reactor at reduced power to prevent the shaking of
pipes and may take other regulatory actions if needed, Arthur
Howell, deputy regional administrator for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, said at the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
