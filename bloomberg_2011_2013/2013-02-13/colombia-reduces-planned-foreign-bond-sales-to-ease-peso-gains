Colombia is scaling back plans for
overseas bond sales this year by $1 billion as part of its bid
to ease gains in the local currency.  Colombia will sell $600 million in foreign bonds in the
remainder of this year after issuing $1 billion of notes last
month, Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters in
Bogota. The total is down 38 percent from the $2.6 billion the
government had said in December it would issue in overseas debt.  The Andean country is stepping up efforts to curb the
peso’s 26 percent gain against the dollar since 2008, which has
hurt exporters’ profits and helped fuel the highest jobless rate
in Latin America. Colombia will buy $1 billion in the currency
market to pay for interest and bonds coming due this year, the
Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We continue to reinforce all the measures to seek a more
competitive exchange rate, and what we’ve done here is no small
thing,” Cardenas said in announcing the bond-sale plan.  The central bank also said Jan. 28 that it will buy at
least $30 million a day in the currency market, bringing
purchases in the foreign-exchange market to $3 billion between
February and May.  Colombia will borrow $1 billion from multilateral lenders
this year, Cardenas said. That amount is unchanged from what the
government had announced in its 2013 Financing Plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
