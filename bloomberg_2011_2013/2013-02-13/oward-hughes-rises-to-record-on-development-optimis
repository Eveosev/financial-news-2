Howard Hughes Corp ., the property
developer whose chairman is hedge fund manager  Bill Ackman , rose
to a record on investor optimism over the company’s U.S. real
estate projects.  Howard Hughes’s One Ala Moana development in Honolulu sold
out 206 luxury condominiums in 29 hours, the Dallas-based
 company  said today in an investor presentation that was included
in a  regulatory  filing. Chief Executive Officer  David Weinreb 
made the presentation at the Harbor Investment Conference in New
York. The event is co-chaired by Ackman, the founder of Pershing
Square Capital Management LP.  “Anytime Bill Ackman is introducing a company, that makes
news,”  Wilkes Graham , an analyst at Compass Point Research &
Trading in Washington, said in a telephone interview.
“Everything seems to be going well right now.”  Howard Hughes rose 7.6 percent to $78.23, the highest
closing price since the stock began trading in November 2010.
The shares have advanced 49 percent in the past 12 months.  Howard Hughes plans to build more than 4,000 condominiums
at Ward Village in Honolulu. Its other projects include the
redevelopment of South Street Seaport in New York and expansion
of the Woodlands Resort and Conference Center in Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
