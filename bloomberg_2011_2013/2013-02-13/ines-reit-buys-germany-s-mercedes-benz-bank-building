Hines, a Houston-based international
property investor, said its Hines Global REIT Inc. bought the
Mercedes-Benz Bank Building in Stuttgart, Germany, for 51.9
million euros ($69.8 million).  The real estate investment trust acquired the 263,038-
square-foot (24,437-square-meter) property from DDE 24 Ltd.,
Hines said today in regulatory  filing . The two-building complex
is the headquarters of Mercedes-Benz Leasing GmbH, a subsidiary
of Mercedes-Benz Bank AG, and is 100 percent leased by the
company through January 2018, according to the filing.  The purchase “complements Hines Global REIT’s existing
portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Hazen said in a
statement. “Germany’s economy is one of the strongest in
Europe, and by purchasing this asset, we have increased the
geographic diversity of the REIT to a fifth country outside of
the U.S.”  Hines Global REIT, whose shares do not trade on a stock
exchange, also owns properties in the U.K., Russia, Austria and
Poland. The company has raised $1.3 billion from the sale of
shares from August 2009 through the end of September, according
to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
