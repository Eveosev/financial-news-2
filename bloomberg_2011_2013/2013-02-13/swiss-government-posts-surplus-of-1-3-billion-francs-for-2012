Switzerland made an unexpected
surplus of 1.3 billion Swiss francs last year, mainly due to
lower interest payments, the government said in an e-mailed
statement today. It had predicted a balanced budget.  Gross federal debt stood at 112.4 billion francs at the end
of 2012, the government said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
