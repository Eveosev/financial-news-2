The Pentagon has created a new medal
to recognize the role of drone operators and cyber specialists
in modern-day combat.  The Distinguished Warfare Medal will be awarded to military
personnel with special training and capabilities that “directly
and precisely impact military operations at times far from the
battlefield,” the Defense Department said in a statement today.  The new medal will “sit directly below the Distinguished
Flying Cross” in order of precedence. That puts the awards
above the Bronze Star Medal for heroism in armed combat and the
Purple Heart for wounds received as a result of hostile action.  “I’ve seen firsthand how modern tools, like remotely
piloted platforms and cyber systems, have changed the way wars
are fought,” Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said at a Pentagon
news conference. “I’ve always felt, having seen the great work
that they do, day in and day out, that those who performed in an
outstanding manner should be recognized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
