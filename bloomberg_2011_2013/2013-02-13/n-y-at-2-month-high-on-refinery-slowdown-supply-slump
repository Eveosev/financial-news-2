Diesel fuel strengthened to the
highest level in two months in New York Harbor as  refinery
activity  slowed and regional  supplies  slumped for a fourth week.  U.S. East Coast refineries processed  982,000 barrels  a day
in the week ended Feb. 8, down 7.5 percent from a week earlier,
Energy Information Administration data showed today. Stockpiles
of  distillates , including diesel fuel and heating oil, fell 1.35
million barrels to 22.1 million in the Central Atlantic region
that includes New York.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region strengthened 0.5 cent
to trade at a premium of 8.88 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:04 p.m., the
highest level since Dec. 12, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or  RBOB , retreated 0.75 cent
to 4 cents below futures. Motor fuel supplies in the East
Atlantic climbed to  32.8 million  barrels.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
profitability for distillates and gasoline based on Brent oil in
Europe, gained 9 cents to $11.73 a barrel.  Gasoline cracks on the U.S. East Coast have been
“supported by reduced refinery output and further scheduled
outages in the second quarter,” according to a report released
by the International Energy Agency today. Gulf gasoline cracks
also posted “exceptional” gains on earlier-than-expected
refinery turnarounds, the report showed.  Gulf Coast spreads,  based on  West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, Oklahoma, advanced 6 cents to $30.47 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread for Light
Louisiana Sweet rose 1 cent to $9.92 a barrel.  Gulf Supplies  Inventories of diesel fuel on the Gulf dropped to 40.9
million barrels last week, while gasoline supplies slipped to 80
million barrels, according to EIA data.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel was unchanged at 5.5 cents below
heating oil futures.  Reformulated gasoline  in the Gulf dropped
0.25 cent to trade at a discount of 10 cents.  The  spread  between gasoline in the Gulf Coast and New York
Harbor rose 0.49 cent to 6.99 cents a gallon, Bloomberg data
show.  Alon USA Energy Inc .’s 70,000-barrel-a-day Big Spring,
Texas, refinery is running a fluid catalytic cracker on a
minimum charge because of a scheduled turnaround, while planned
work is under way at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 345,000-barrel-a-day
 Beaumont refinery , the companies said.  Delta Air Lines Inc .’s Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery is
in the process of restarting a fluid catalytic cracker. The
plant has the capacity to process as much as 185,000 barrels a
day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
