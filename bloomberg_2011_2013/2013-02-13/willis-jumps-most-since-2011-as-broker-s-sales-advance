Willis Group Holdings Plc , the
third-largest insurance broker, jumped the most since 2011 in
New York trading after posting higher-than-expected fourth-
quarter revenue, fueled by growth outside of North America.  The broker climbed 4.5 percent to $37.48 at 10:44 a.m.
London-based Willis has rallied 12 percent this year, beating
the 8.6 percent gain in the 259-company  Dow Jones U.S.
Financials Index .  Commissions and fees increased 7 percent to $867 million
from $810 million a year earlier, exceeding the $844 million
estimate of  Meyer Shields , an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
So-called organic revenue, which excludes recently purchased
businesses and currency fluctuations, climbed 7.5 percent in the
quarter, the insurer said in a statement after the close of
regular trading yesterday. Growth was about 12 percent in the
global segment and 5 percent in North America.  The broker benefited from “very strong organic revenue
growth,” Shields said in a note yesterday. “We expect the
shares to trade up.” Shields has a hold rating on the company.  Willis posted a fourth-quarter net loss from continuing
operations of $804 million, or $4.65 a share, on costs tied to a
goodwill impairment, retention awards and taxes. Excluding those
expenses, profit was 45 cents per share, beating by 1 cent the
average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
