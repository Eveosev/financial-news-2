The U.K. will require power
suppliers to pay a buy-put price of 42.02 pounds ($65.36) from
April for any shortfall they have in certificates they’re
required to hold to prove their power is from renewable sources.  The rate, which applies for the 2013-14 tax year, is an
increase of 1.31 pounds on the current level, according to an e-
mailed  statement  today from the energy regulator Ofgem. The
regulator is required to set a new rate every year in line with
changes to inflation levels.  The charge falls under the government’s Renewables
Obligation program, which requires EON AG, RWE AG and other
power suppliers to hold an annually-increasing amount of the
certificates, known as ROCs, or pay a buy-out price. the
certificates prove the power is from the wind, sun, hydro-power
and other renewable sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
