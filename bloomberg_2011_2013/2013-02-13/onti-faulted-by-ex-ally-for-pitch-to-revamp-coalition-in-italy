Italy’s caretaker prime minister,
 Mario Monti , was criticized by a former ally after newswire Ansa
reported the outgoing head of government was seeking to revamp
the broad coalition that put him in power 15 months ago.  Monti proposed reshaping his defunct coalition by excluding
what he referred to as “extreme” politicians on both sides,
Ansa reported today, citing an interview with the premier.  “It’s time for Monti to decide what side he’s on,”  Anna Finocchiaro , chief whip of Italy’s Democratic Party in the
Senate, said in an e-mailed statement. “I don’t believe there
is any chance of a broad agreement on the horizon.”  Monti, 69, is seeking to maintain his influence in Italy’s
next government even as opinion polls place him in fourth place
in the race for parliamentary elections Feb. 24-25. The
unelected former professor was appointed premier in November
2011 as part of a temporary truce between the Democratic Party
and its historic rival,  Silvio Berlusconi ’s People of Liberty.  “The government will be formed by whoever wins the
election, and we’re going to win,” Finocchiaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
