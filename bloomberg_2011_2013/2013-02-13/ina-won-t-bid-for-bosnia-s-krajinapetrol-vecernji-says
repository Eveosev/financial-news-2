INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , a
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. , will not bid
for the majority stake in  Krajinapetrol AD , Bosnia-Herzegovina’s
oil and gas retailer, Vecernji List reported, citing people it
didn’t identify.  The Bosnian Serb authorities seek to sell the Banja Luka-
based company, which owns 14 gas stations in addition to gas and
oil storage terminals, according to Vecernji. The company’s
assets belonged to INA before the breakup of former Yugoslavia
in 1991 and INA in the past has sued for their return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
