Bonds of  Overseas Shipholding Group
Inc.  fell to their lowest level since November after the U.S.
said it’s owed more than $463 million from the energy-transport
company.  The shipper’s $300 million of 8.125 percent senior
unsecured bonds due in March 2018 fell 7.5 cents to 33 cents on
the dollar at 10:19 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The price was the lowest since the securities traded
at 23 cents on Nov. 14.  The company, which entered into Chapter 11 reorganization
in November, owes the funds claimed today to the Internal
Revenue Service, the government said.  Robert Johnston , who headed Overseas Shipholding’s U.S.-
flagged business, took over from  Morten Arntzen  as chief
executive officer, the tanker company said in a Feb. 11
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
