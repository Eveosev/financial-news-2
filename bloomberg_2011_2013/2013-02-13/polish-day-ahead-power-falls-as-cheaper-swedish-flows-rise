Day-ahead electricity in Poland
decreased as the country increased imports of cheaper power from
Sweden.  Electricity  for the next day dropped 0.3 percent to 166.57
zloty ($53.92) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Poland was set to import as much as 585 megawatts of power
from Sweden from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. tomorrow, compared with 60
megawatts at the same time today, according to data from grid
manager PSE SA. Electricity for tomorrow in the SE4 area of
southern Sweden, to which it is connected, settled at 39.93
euros ($53.81), a megawatt-hour, down 10 percent, according to
the Nord Pool Spot AS power exchange.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia fell 6.3 percent to 46.68 euros a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled 6.7 percent
higher at 46.75 euros a megawatt-hour.  Electricity for delivery next year rose as the German year-
ahead contract, the benchmark for the region, increased to the
highest level in more than three weeks. Polish power for 2014
advanced 0.2 percent to 164.25 zloty a megawatt-hour and the
comparable Czech contract gained as much as 0.7 percent to 42.25
euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
