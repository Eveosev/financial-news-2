A Michigan sheriff’s department is
determining whether bones that washed into an  American Electric
Power Co.  nuclear plant yesterday are human remains.  Divers clearing storm debris from the Donald C. Cook
nuclear plant on Lake Michigan yesterday found the bone
fragments. The twin-reactor plant, located in Bridgman,
Michigan, reported the find to local law enforcement officials
and federal regulators, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said in a daily report posted on its  website .  Berrien County sheriff’s officials collected the bones and
are determining if they are human,  Bill Schalk , a plant
spokesman, said in a phone interview.  “Obviously, it’s quite rare” for bones to turn up in a
nuclear plant’s water intake system,  Scott Burnell , a spokesman
for the federal atomic agency, said in an e-mail. “Of course,
the report did say ‘potential human remains,’ so we’ll see what
the local law enforcement agencies determine.”  Divers found 6-inch (15 centimeter) and 4-inch bone
fragments as they cleaned rocks, driftwood and other debris from
screens that filter lake water that flows into the plant through
three 16-foot-wide tunnels, Schalk said.  A spokesman for the Berrien County’s sheriff’s office in
St. Joseph, Michigan, couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
