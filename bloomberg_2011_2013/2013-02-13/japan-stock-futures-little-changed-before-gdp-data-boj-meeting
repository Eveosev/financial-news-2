Japanese stock futures were little
changed as investors awaited gross domestic product data for the
world’s third-largest economy and the Bank of Japan concludes a
two-day policy meeting. Australian shares gained.  Shares of Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. may be active as the
biggest beer maker in Japan by market share said it will buy
back as much as 4.3 percent of its shares and forecast profit to
rise 15 percent.  Alacer Gold Corp.  slid 4.2 percent in Sydney as
a declined in the price of the precious metal weakened the
earnings outlook for the explorer.  Singapore Telecommunications
Ltd.  shares may be active after Southeast Asia’s biggest phone
company said third-quarter profit fell 8.3 percent on charges
from its Australian and Philippine businesses.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 11,315 in Chicago yesterday, down from 11,330 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
11,320 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 0.1 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced
0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s stock market reopens today while equity
markets in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam remain shut for public
holidays.  A report to be released at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo will probably
show Japan’s gross domestic product data grew an annualized 0.4
percent in the three months through December, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 32 economists. An
expansion would lift the country out of its third technical
recession in the past five years.  BOJ Meeting  The Bank of Japan will conclude its two-day policy meeting
today. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s call for “unlimited” cash
provisions by the BOJ to overcome deflation helped weaken the
yen more than 7 percent against the dollar this year, boosting
exporters’ overseas earnings when repatriated. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average has climbed 8.2 percent in 2013, compared with a
6.6 percent gain on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.8 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.4
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Of the 308 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that
reported earnings this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 53 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 52
percent have missed sales projections. That compares with 74
percent of S&P 500 companies that topped profit forecasts during
the period, while 34 percent fell short of sales estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. The S&P 500
gained 0.1 percent yesterday to the highest level since October
2007 as investors weighed economic reports and President Barack
Obama’s State of the Union address.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 0.5 percent to 96.79 in New
York yesterday.  Gold slid 0.2 percent to $1,642.10 per ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
