A case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild
2009 sold for 7,800 pounds ($12,200) on London’s Liv-ex wine
market yesterday, a seven-month high on the exchange and
extending gains which lifted it 7 percent from its December
level, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The  Lafite  vintage peaked at 14,350 pounds a case in
February 2011 amid strong Asian demand, before a price slump
which took it as low as 6,950 pounds on Dec. 14. Lafite is a
first-growth Bordeaux wine from the Medoc and the 2009 vintage
is its most expensive of the past five years, according to
Liv-ex merchant data.  Editors: John Simpson, James Kraus  To contact the reporter on the story:
