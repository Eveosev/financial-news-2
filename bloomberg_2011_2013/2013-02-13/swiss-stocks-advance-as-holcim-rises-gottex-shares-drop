Swiss stocks  gained for a fourth day
as U.S. President Barack Obama pledged to seek a free-trade
agreement with the European Union and investors awaited a report
on retail sales in the world’s largest economy.  Holcim Ltd. posted the biggest advance on the benchmark
Swiss Market Index. Gottex Fund Management Holdings Ltd.
declined the most in a week.  The benchmark SMI climbed 0.3 percent to 7,447.73 at 9:55
a.m. in Zurich, posting its longest winning streak in more than
two weeks. The gauge has  rallied 6.1 percent  this year as
Transocean Ltd., the world’s largest offshore driller, and
Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, both
surged more than 20 percent. The broader Swiss Performance Index
also added 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 34 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  In the U.S., President  Barack Obama  said he will pursue a
trade agreement with the EU in last night’s State of the Union
speech. Trade and investment between the U.S. and the 27 nations
that make up the EU had a value of $4.5 trillion in 2011.  A report at 8:30 a.m. New York time may show that U.S.
retailers increased their  sales  in January as the job market
improved. Sales climbed 0.1 percent last month, according to the
 median forecast of 80 economists  in a Bloomberg survey.  Holcim gained 2.7 percent to 72.10 Swiss francs as a gauge
of construction companies posted the second-largest gain of the
19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Gottex Fund Management  declined 3.2 percent to 2.72 francs
after saying it will suspend its share-buyback program. The
company also said it has purchased 862,070 shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
