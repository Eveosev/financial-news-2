India’s benchmark bonds snapped a
two-day drop on speculation the central bank’s plan to purchase
debt week will ease a cash squeeze and spur demand for the
securities.  The Reserve Bank of India will buy as much as 100 billion
rupees ($1.9 billion) of government notes due in 2018, 2020,
2026 and 2027 on Feb. 15, it said in a statement yesterday.
Lenders  borrowed  1.24 trillion rupees from the monetary
authority yesterday via overnight repurchase contracts, the most
in more than a month, reflecting a cash shortage in the banking
system.  “The resumption of bond buying is a positive,” said R.S.
Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-income and currencies at State
Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “This will help overcome
the cash crunch.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.84 percent as
of 9:22 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The central bank last bought bonds on Jan. 4 and its
purchases totaled 1.2 trillion rupees in the financial year that
began April 1, compared with 336 billion in the same period a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Industrial  production  fell 0.6 percent in December from a
year earlier, after a revised 0.8 percent drop in November, a
government report showed yesterday.  “Slowing growth may prompt further interest-rate cuts by
the central bank,” said Chauhan.  The RBI lowered its benchmark repurchase  rate  by 25 basis
points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29. That was the first reduction
since April.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.65 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
