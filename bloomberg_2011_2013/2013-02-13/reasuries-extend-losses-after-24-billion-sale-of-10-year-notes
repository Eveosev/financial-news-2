Treasuries fell for a third day as
the government’s auction of $24 billion in 10-year notes drew
higher-than-forecast yields amid signs the U.S. economic
recovery is taking hold.  The notes  yielded  2.046 percent, compared with a forecast
of 2.039 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.68, below the average of 2.96 for the
past 10 sales. Government reports showed retail sales rose for a
third consecutive month and import prices increased.  “Investors needed more yield to compensate them at
auction,” said  Paul Horrmann,  a broker in New York at Tradition
Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “The market is
playing ‘wait and see,’ but the market is still more vulnerable
to higher yields given the economy.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.03 percent at 5:02 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
price of the 1.625 percent security due in November 2022 fell
13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face value, to 96 15/32. The yield
touched  2.058 percent  on Feb. 4, the highest since April 12.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 28 percent of the notes sold today,
compared with 28.5 percent at the Jan. 9 auction and an average
of 37 percent at the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 24.2 percent of
the notes, compared with 14.8 percent at the previous auction
and an average of 20.4 percent at the past 10 sales.  Treasury Losses  The government will  sell  $16 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow. The U.S. auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes
yesterday at a yield of 0.409 percent. Direct bidders purchased
26.9 percent of the three-year debt, the third consecutive
record high.  “Today’s auction was OK, but the setup for tomorrow’s
auction is weighing on the market,” said  Thomas Simons , a
government debt economist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc.,
one of primary dealers required to bid at the sales. “It’s the
real point of interest this week and will give us clues of where
and if investors see value in the long-end.”  Ten-year U.S. debt has lost 1.9 percent this year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, almost
double the 1 percent loss in the broader Treasury market. The
notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a 2.2 percent
gain by Treasuries overall.  Retail Sales  “There doesn’t seem like a lot of appetite to add Treasury
risk as the economy trends better and bearishness slowly
fades,”  Ira Jersey , an interest-rate strategist in New York at
primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG, said before the sale.
“There is decent reason to think that we are going to have
growth that is good enough to keep us at or above 2 percent for
a while.”  U.S.  retail sales  increased 0.1 percent last month,
following a gain of 0.5 percent in December, Commerce Department
figures showed today in Washington. The advance matched the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Prices of goods imported into the U.S. rose 0.6 percent in
January, led by more expensive fuel and building materials,
Labor Department figures showed. Economists projected a 0.8
percent advance, according to another Bloomberg survey. $16
billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow.  “The retail sales number and import prices were positive
for the economy and weakened the bond market,” Adrian Miller,
director of fixed income strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New
York, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
