Deere & Co. , the world’s largest
agricultural-equipment maker, tumbled the most in 12 weeks on
speculation that growth may be limited as corn and soybean
prices decline from records.  Deere  decreased 3.5 percent to $90.68 at the close in New
York, the biggest drop since Nov. 21.  U.S. farm cash receipts for crops, one indicator for
equipment sales, will fall 1.7 percent as corn and soybean
prices decline, the Moline, Illinois-based company said today in
a  presentation  on its website. Industrywide farm equipment sales
in the U.S. and Canada will be unchanged to 5 percent higher in
fiscal 2013, which ends Oct. 31, Deere said. The company got 64
percent of  sales  from that region in fiscal 2012.  “Many investors believe the agriculture market is near a
peak,”  Stephen Volkmann , a New York-based analyst for Jefferies
& Co. who rates the shares hold, said in an e-mail today.
“There is a hope that construction can drive the business ahead
from here, but the construction part of the business was a bit
disappointing or at least doesn’t appear to be a source of
upside.”  While the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings and 2013
profit forecast topped analysts’ estimates, the shares have
dropped as “investors worry they don’t see the same upside” in
the rest of the year,  Matt Arnold , a St. Louis-based analyst for
Edward Jones & Co., who has a buy rating on the shares, said
today in a telephone interview.  Exceeding Estimates  Earnings will be about $3.3 billion for fiscal 2013, the
company said in an earnings statement today. That exceeded its
previous prediction of $3.2 billion and the $3.26 billion
average of 16 estimates. Profit was $1.65 a share in the quarter
ended Jan. 31, beating the $1.40 average of 17 estimates
compiled by  Bloomberg .  Deere Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Sam Allen  has
introduced a record number of new products and built factories
from Brazil to China as higher commodity prices put more cash in
farmers’ pockets in the last three years. In the U.S., where
Deere is the market leader, crop-farming receipts are forecast
to decline to $210.7 billion this year from $214.4 billion last
year, Deere said today.  First-quarter  net income  increased 22 percent to $649.7
million from $532.9 million a year earlier. Equipment sales
climbed 11 percent to $6.79 billion, compared with Deere’s
November forecast for a 10 percent gain. Revenue from machinery
gained 18 percent in the U.S. and Canada and 2 percent in the
rest of the world.  Brazilian Strength  For fiscal 2013, Deere said equipment sales will advance
about 6 percent, more than its previous prediction of 5 percent.  The industry’s revenue in South America will rise as much
as 15 percent, driven by Brazil, Deere said. Industry sales in
the European Union will be down about 5 percent because of
economic weakness and last year’s poor harvest in the U.K.  Most active corn futures climbed as high as $7.01 a bushel
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, down from a record $8.49 in
August. Soybean futures rose as high as $14.1775 a bushel after
touching a record $17.89 in September.  U.S. farmers’ cash flow was helped by collecting a record
$14.2 billion in insurance payments triggered by the worst U.S.
drought since the 1930s, the USDA said in a Feb. 11 report on
its website. Deere’s sales of four-wheel tractors and combines
in December topped U.S. industrywide gains, the company  said 
last month.  The company also has gained market share in Brazil, where
it “outperformed” in tractors and combines last month,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a Feb. 7 report. Brazil is one of
the countries Deere is focusing on as it aims to boost annual
sales to $50 billion by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
