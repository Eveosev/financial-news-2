Apple Inc. ’s request to use the
iPhone name in Brazil was rejected by regulators who ruled in
favor of a local competitor.  IGB Eletronica SA , the Brazilian electronics maker that
applied to register the name in 2000 and won the rights to use
it in 2008, continues to hold the trademark. IGB started selling
its own iPhone model in December.  The institute responsible for granting trademarks, known as
Inpi, issued the decision on its website today, seven years
after Apple submitted its request.  Apple can use the iPhone name for other products, including
clothing and pamphlets, Marcelo Chimento, a spokesman for Inpi,
said in a Feb. 5 telephone interview.  IGB couldn’t be reached for comment.  Amy Bessette , a
spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
