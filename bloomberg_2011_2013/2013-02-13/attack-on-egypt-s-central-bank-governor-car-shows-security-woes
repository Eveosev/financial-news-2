Masked gunmen attacked the car of
Egypt’s central bank governor this morning, shooting dead an
armed police guard in an incident highlighting the lack of
security two years after the 2011 uprising.  Hisham Ramez  said in an interview that he wasn’t in the car
at the time and the attack was likely a robbery attempt. Three
assailants started shooting at the car, and the policeman
returned fire, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported
today.  “I am safe,” said Ramez, who took over as governor
earlier this month as Egypt’s authorities grapple with a
weakening currency and foreign reserves more than 60 percent
below their pre-uprising levels.  Restoring security is one of the key challenges facing
President  Mohamed Mursi . Egyptians complain about widespread
crime, including robberies and attacks similar to that on
Ramez’s car, as well as sexual assaults against female
protesters. The United Nations last month expressed concern at
spreading violence against women.  To contact the reporter on this story:
