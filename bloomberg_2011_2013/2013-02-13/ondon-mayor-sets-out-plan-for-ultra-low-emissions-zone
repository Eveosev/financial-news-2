Mayor  Boris Johnson  plans to create
an ultra-low-emission zone for traffic in central London to
improve air quality and spur the development and take-up of
vehicles that produce little or no air pollution.  Johnson asked Transport for London, which oversees the
capital’s transportation network, to examine introducing a
requirement for all vehicles using the center of the capital
during working hours to be zero- or low-emission starting in
2020.  “Creating the world’s first big-city ultra-low-emission
zone has the potential to be a game-changing moment in the
quality of life of our great capital,” Johnson said in a speech
today at City Hall. “This would deliver incredible benefits in
air quality and stimulate the delivery and mass use of low-
emission technology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
