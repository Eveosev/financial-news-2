Western Canada Select  crude weakened
on speculation that demand from refineries isn’t sufficient to
justify a rally of $17.50 a barrel over the past month.  BP Plc’s Whiting refinery in Indiana won’t be able to
process heavy Canadian crude at full rates until 2014, Chief
Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in the company’s fourth-
quarter earnings call on Feb. 5. Consumers’ Co-Operative
Refineries Ltd.’s Regina refinery in Saskatchewan shut two crude
units, one of which is still down, after a Feb. 11 fire.  “The tightening was a bit overzealous, given that we still
have all these refineries offline for maintenance,” said
Katherine Spector, a commodities strategist at CIBC World
Markets in New York.  The discount of Western Canada Select, an oil blend mainly
produced from oil-sands bitumen,to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate oil widened $1.50 to $24.50 a barrel at 10:23 a.m.,
according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  The heavy crude had strengthened as delays to Exxon Mobil
Corp.’s 110,000-barrel-a-day Kearl oil sands project left room
on Enbridge Inc. pipelines that transport oil from Alberta to
the U.S.  Gulf Coast crudes were mixed after the Energy Information
Administration said U.S. oil output climbed to the highest level
in 20 years.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 10 cents to
$20.60 a barrel at 2:03 p.m. New York time, and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $20.40, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Mars Blend’s premium fell 5 cents to $14.75 over WTI. West
Texas Sour’s discount to WTI widened 60 cents to $4.10 a barrel.
WTI in Midland gained 15 cents on WTI in Cushing to trade at a
discount of 60 cents.  Syncrude, a synthetic light, sweet oil upgraded from
bitumen, declined by 45 cents a barrel to a $2.30 premium to WTI
at 11 a.m., Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
