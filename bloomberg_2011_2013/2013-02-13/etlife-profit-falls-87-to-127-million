MetLife Inc. , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said fourth-quarter profit fell 87 percent on costs
tied to lower interest rates and annuities.  Net income  dropped to $127 million from $990 million a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Operating profit, which excludes some investing results, was
$1.25 per share, beating the $1.18 average estimate of 19
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  MetLife invests payments from clients in a portfolio of
more than $500 billion to help meet future obligations. Near
record-low bond yields squeeze returns from those holdings while
pressuring results from retirement products in which the company
provides guaranteed returns.  “A prolonged period of low interest rates is bad for
insurers because it leads to lower investment earnings and
profit compression,” said  Neil Strauss , an insurance analyst at
Moody’s Investors Service, in an interview before results were
announced. “They do have hedges related to that, but they’re
still seeing impact.”  The insurer took a $752 million charge after it reviewed
assumptions about returns amid the low-rate environment. MetLife
said in December that fewer customers than expected surrendered
some retirement products. The insurer guarantees minimum returns
in offerings such as annuities.  MetLife  declined  about 0.5 percent in the past 12 months,
while the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index  rallied 18
percent. Results were released after the close of regular
trading in New York.  Book Value  Full-year profit fell to $1.32 billion, from $6.42 billion
in 2011. Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, fell
to $57.17 per share on Dec. 31, from $58.35 three months
earlier.  Sales in nations including Mexico, Chile and Brazil helped
drive operating earnings in Latin America 20 percent higher to
$148 million. Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian , 60, set
a goal of generating at least 20 percent of operating earnings
from emerging markets by 2016, and this month agreed to buy
Chilean pension manager AFP Provida SA in a $2 billion deal to
add fee income.  MetLife is “growing our presence in emerging markets with
our recent agreement to acquire AFP Provida in Chile, as well as
our expansion in Central Europe, Turkey and India,” Kandarian
said in today’s statement.  Fourth-quarter profit in the Europe, Middle East, and
Africa region jumped 26 percent to $59 million, driven by growth
in Turkey, MetLife said.  U.S., Asia  In the Americas region, which includes the U.S. and Latin
America, operating earnings rose 21 percent to $1.3 billion in
the fourth quarter. Operating profit in Asia dropped 24 percent
to $198 million, as changes in assumptions related to some
Japanese products contributed to a $62 million charge.  MetLife acquired American Life Insurance Co., with
operations in more than 50 countries, from American
International Group Inc. in 2010 for about $16 billion.  Investment income rose 5.8 percent to $5.18 billion in the
fourth quarter, as so-called variable investments, which include
private-equity and hedge funds, contributed $376 million before
tax, up from $135 million a year earlier.  Variable annuity sales for 2012 fell to $17.7 billion,
matching MetLife’s goal to cut purchases of the retirement
products by about a third. The insurer set a 2013 sales target
of $10 billion to $11 billion as it seeks to reduce risk from
the capital intensive products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
