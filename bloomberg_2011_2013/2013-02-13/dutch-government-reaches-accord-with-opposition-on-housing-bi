The Dutch government coalition
reached a deal with the opposition on a bill aimed at reviving a
housing market that’s been in a slump since 2008.  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  told reporters an agreement was
reached that “will have limited impact on the treasury.” An
accord is “crucial” as a slumping construction industry slows
the country’s economic recovery, he said.  The coalition may give homeowners more time to pay down
their mortgages and cap rent increases after the government’s
initial proposal failed to get sufficient support in the senate.
Housing Minister  Stef Blok  and Rutte are expected to give a
press conference at 10:30 a.m. today where they may provide
details of the accord.  A levy on housing corporations will probably be lowered to
1.75 billion euros ($2.36 billion) from 2 billion euros, De
Telegraaf reported today, citing people with knowledge of the
matter.  Rutte and the Labor Party, its coalition partner, needed
the support of three opposition parties after talks with the
Christian Democratic Party to get Senate approval failed on Feb.
11. It marked the second time that major legislation proposed by
Rutte’s Liberal Party and the Labor Party didn’t win
parliamentary approval. The Cabinet had to adjust a health-care
bill after resistance from within the Liberal Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
