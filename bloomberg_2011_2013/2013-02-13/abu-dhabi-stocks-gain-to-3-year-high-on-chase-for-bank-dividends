Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index rallied
to the highest level in more than three years as investors seek
to tap higher dividends offered by the emirate’s banks.  United Arab Emirates lenders have raised their dividend
payouts as they recover from the impact of the global credit
crisis which slowed lending, hit investment banking and led to a
surge in loan-loss charges as defaults rose. Abu Dhabi banks
offer an average  dividend yield  of 4.1 percent, compared with
3.2 percent for the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial Index  of the
Gulf Cooperation Council’s most-traded equities.  “Liquidity is searching for dividend-paying stocks with
high yields,” said  Nabil Farhat , partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al
Fajer Securities.  First Gulf Bank PJSC , which recommended a  cash dividend  of
83 fils per share for 2012, rose 1.2 percent, the biggest mover
on the  ADX General Index , which gained 1.1 percent to 2,955.44,
the strongest level since November 2009.  Abu Dhabi Commercial
Bank PJSC , the third-biggest U.A.E. lender by assets, advanced
to the highest level in more than four years.  Abu Dhabi Commercial said in January it would pay a 25
percent  cash dividend  for 2012, up from 20 percent from a year
earlier, after fourth-quarter profit rose 19 percent. Shares of
the lender, which said Feb. 11 it hired banks for a possible
dollar bond sale, have surged 6.8 percent in the past three
days. It climbed 1.9 percent today to 3.79 dirhams, the
strongest level since September 2008.  First Gulf, whose 2012 profit grew 12 percent, advanced to
13 dirhams, the highest since August 2008. The bank will
probably post the fastest loan growth in the U.A.E. in 2013,
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said in December. Net income is  set to
grow 7 percent  in 2013, according to the average estimate of 11
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  About  310 million shares  were traded in Abu Dhabi today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 79 million, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure’s  14-day relative
strength index  rose to 83 today from 80. A reading above 70
indicates to some analysts that a security is poised to drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
