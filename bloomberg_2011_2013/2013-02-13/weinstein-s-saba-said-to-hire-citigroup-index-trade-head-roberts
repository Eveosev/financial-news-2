Gabriel Roberts , who led global
credit-index trading at  Citigroup Inc. , is joining Saba Capital
Management LP, the $5.3 billion hedge fund founded by  Boaz Weinstein , said people with knowledge of the moves.  Paul Kazarian  from Royal Bank of Canada also is going to
work at Saba to focus on exchange-traded fund indexes, said one
of the people, who asked to not be identified because the
appointments haven’t been announced publicly. Roberts, who will
start at Saba in New York, was hired by Citigroup in 2011 from
 Deutsche Bank AG  to oversee trading of benchmark credit-default
swaps indexes in North America and Europe.  Scott Helfman , a spokesman for Citigroup, confirmed that
Roberts left the New York-based bank and declined to comment
further.  Jonathan Gasthalter , a spokesman for Saba,  Sanam Alaghband  at RBC and Roberts also declined to comment.  The voicemail box was full at a phone number listed in
Kazarian’s name. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records
show he was registered as a broker at RBC until last month.  Roberts traded Markit CDX indexes at Deutsche Bank and
previously handled trading of the Markit iTraxx European indexes
in London for the Frankfurt-based lender, a person familiar with
the situation said in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
