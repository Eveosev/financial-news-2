U.S. Treasury secretary nominee  Jack Lew  said he was paid “in a manner consistent” with other Wall
Street executives when he worked at bailed-out Citigroup Inc.
during the financial crisis.  Lew, asked today at his Senate confirmation hearing about
being paid a $940,000 bonus in early 2009, said he “will leave
it for others to judge” whether his compensation was
appropriate.  Lew, 57, said he wasn’t “in the business of making
investment decisions” while at the bank from 2006 to 2009. “I
learned a great deal about the financial products, but I wasn’t
designing them, I wasn’t opining on them,” he told the Senate
Finance Committee. “I take away from that experience a deep
understanding that there are risks that we need to be very much
on guard against.”  Lew, President  Barack Obama ’s former chief of staff and
budget director, also said he wasn’t involved in setting up a
Citigroup fund in the Cayman Islands in which he had an
investment he later sold at a loss.  Lew said he knew it was an international fund investing in
emerging markets and much of the fund’s personnel were based in
London. “I actually didn’t know at the time what the address of
the partnership was,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
