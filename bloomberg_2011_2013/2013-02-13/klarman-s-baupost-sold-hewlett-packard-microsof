Baupost Group LLC, the Boston-based
hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, sold its remaining stakes in
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Microsoft Corp. in the fourth quarter,
abandoning bets on two firms tied to the personal-computer
business.  Baupost sold 14.4 million shares of Palo Alto, California-
based  Hewlett-Packard  and 1.4 million shares of Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, according to a regulatory filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm
bought 7 million shares of New York-based American International
Group Inc., the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout last year.  Klarman, known for his emphasis on undervalued securities,
invested in Hewlett Packard and Microsoft in 2011. He started
selling shares in both companies in the third quarter of 2012,
according to regulatory filings, and completely exited his
positions by year-end.  The personal computer industry is facing its second
straight decline in annual sales this year while tablets and
smartphones continue to surge. PC shipments fell 4 percent in
2012 and will slide a further 1.5 percent this year, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. analysts estimate.  Microsoft shares rose 2.9 percent in 2012 while Hewlett-
Packard dropped 45 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Klarman is a bargain hunter who wrote the preface to the
sixth edition of “Security Analysis,” a 1934 book by Benjamin
Graham and David Dodd that is considered the bible of value
investing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
