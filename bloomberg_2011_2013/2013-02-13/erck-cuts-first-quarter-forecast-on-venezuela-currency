Merck & Co . said profit in the first
quarter will be reduced by 5 cents a share because of a
devaluation of Venezuela’s currency.  Earnings excluding one-time items will be 76 cents to 78
cents a share, the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company
said today in a statement. Analysts had been expecting 86 cents,
the average of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The devaluation of the currency won’t change Merck’s full-
year earnings outlook, the company said. The Venezuelan
government said on Feb. 8 that it intended to devalue its
currency, moving the exchange rate to 4.30 bolivars per dollar
from 6.30 bolivars per dollar.  Merck fell less than 1 percent to $41.15 at the close of
New York trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
