Virgin Media Inc. ’s board and Chief
Executive Officer  Neil Berkett  were sued by a shareholder over
the company’s $16 billion sale to  Liberty Global Inc.   Virgin Media, Britain’s second-largest pay-television
provider, is being sold through an “unfair process and for
unfair price,” shareholder Jeff Grimsley said in a complaint
filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  “Given Virgin Media’s recent strong performance as well as
its future growth prospects, the consideration shareholders will
receive is inadequate and undervalues the company,” according
to the complaint.  John Malone ’s Liberty Global, based in Englewood, Colorado,
agreed to acquire New York-based Virgin Media in a cash-and-
stock transaction announced this month to challenge Rupert
Murdoch in Europe’s biggest pay-TV market.  Hanne Wolf, a spokeswoman for Liberty Global, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the
complaint. Virgin Media officials didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail.  The case is Grimsley v. Berkett, 650469-2013, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
