Carnival Corp.  said the fire on the
Triumph cruise ship will cost the company 8 cents to 10 cents a
share in the first half of fiscal 2013 for repairs and travel
disruptions. The stock fell.  Carnival, based in Miami, issued the estimate today in an
e-mailed statement.  The company, the world’s largest cruise operator, is towing
the stricken ship, which suffered an engine room fire on Feb.
10, to Mobile, Alabama. Carnival has reserved 1,500 hotel rooms
and chartered 20 planes for the more than 3,100 passengers when
they arrive. All will receive a full refund and credit toward
another cruise, the company said.  Carnival’s shares fell 4 percent to $37.46 at the close in
New York. The  stock  has gained 1.9 percent this year, trailing a
6.6 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Triumph’s next 14 voyages through April 13 have been
canceled, the company  said  today on its website. Those guests
will also receive a full refund and as much as a 25 percent
discount on future sailings.  McDonald’s Corp. , the world’s largest restaurant chain, has
350 employees, franchisees, family members and friends on board
the Triumph, Danya Proud, a company spokeswoman, said. The Oak
Brook, Illinois-based company’s passengers, who are from the
greater Southwest, Houston and Rocky Mountain areas, were
winners of an incentive program conducted last summer, Proud
said via e-mail. All are safe, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
