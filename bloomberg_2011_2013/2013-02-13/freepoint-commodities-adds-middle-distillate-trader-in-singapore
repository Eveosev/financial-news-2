Freepoint Commodities LLC, an energy
trader founded in 2011 by three former RBS Sempra Commodities
LLP executives, is expanding oil trading in Singapore to tap
Asia’s demand for raw materials.  Jason Gan, who trades middle distillates, joined the office
last month from Sahara Energy International Pte, Sueekuen Shee,
a managing director based in Singapore, said by phone. Shee
started last September from  JPMorgan Chase & Co .  “We don’t have a concrete plan for now but we will
definitely add more people,” said Shee.  Kenneth Wong joined Freepoint’s Singapore office in
November as a fuel oil trader, according to Shee. Wong used to
work for Westport Petroleum Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
