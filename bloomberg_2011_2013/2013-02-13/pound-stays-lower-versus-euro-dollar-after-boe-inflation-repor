The pound stayed lower against the
euro and the dollar after the Bank of England said inflation
will remain above its 2 percent target for the next two years
and risks to the economic recovery are weighted to the downside.  The pound dropped 0.5 percent to 86.29 pence per euro as of
10:36 a.m. London time. It slipped 0.3 percent to $1.5622.  To contact the reporter on this story:
