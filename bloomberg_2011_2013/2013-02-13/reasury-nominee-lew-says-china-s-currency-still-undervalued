U.S. Treasury secretary nominee  Jack Lew  says the Chinese yuan is still undervalued.  “We pushed back on our perception that the currency is
undervalued,” Lew said. “We made progress. It is still
undervalued and more progress,” needs to be made.  Lew was testifying before the Senate Finance Committee,
which is considering his nomination to succeed  Timothy F. Geithner  as head of the Treasury Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
