Power Finance Corp ., India’s largest
state lender to electricity utilities, cut lending rates for
renewable energy power plants by 50 basis points, Chairman
 Satnam Singh  said.  The new rates will be effective Feb. 1, he said in a
telephone interview from New Delhi. The company has cut interest
rates for all power projects by 25 basis points, Singh said.  “We’ve lowered our rates across the board but rates for
alternative energy plants are lower still,” Singh said.  India, which uses coal to fire more than half of its 211
gigawatt electricity output, plans to spend $300 billion on
adding power capacity in the next five years to counter rising
fuel prices and climate change.  Power Finance has approved 23.13 billion rupees ($430
million) for 611 megawatts of renewable capacity in the year
ending March, the company said in an e-mailed reply to questions.
The New Delhi-based company has lent a total 53.73 billion
rupees to wind, solar and hydro projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
