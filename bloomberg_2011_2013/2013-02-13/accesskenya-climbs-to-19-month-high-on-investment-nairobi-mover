AccessKenya Group Ltd ., the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, climbed
to the highest in almost 19 months as AIB Capital Ltd. said
investment in network infrastructure will boost profit margins.  The stock advanced 3.2 percent to 6.55 shillings by 12:18
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the highest since July 2011. About
270,000 shares, or 97 percent of the three-month daily average
volume, traded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  AccessKenya is converting all its wireless base stations to
fiber-optic cable links, which should boost bandwidth capacity
by more than 80 percent, Nairobi-based AIB Capital said today in
an e-mailed note to clients. Reduced operational expenses will
allow for greater profit margins, according to the note. The
move is part of a larger effort to bolster Internet
connectivity, AIB Capital said.  “Investors are buying into the company because they expect
expenses will shrink and the new customers will increase
revenue,” Ted Macharia, a research analyst at AIB Capital, said
in a phone interview.  Shares of AccessKenya have surged 58 percent this year, the
best performer on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The bourse’s
 All-Share Index  has gained 15 percent during the period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
