President  Barack Obama ’s State of
the Union speech drew about 33.5 million U.S. viewers on major
broadcast and cable TV networks, an 11 percent decline from his
previous annual address to Congress.  The speech aired from 9 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. New York time
last night on 15 networks and was carried on tape delay by
Univision, New York-based Nielsen said today on its  website .  The president began campaigning today for the activist
second-term agenda he laid out last night, including a raise in
the minimum wage and a plan to encourage new manufacturing jobs.
Obama’s speech last year attracted 37.8 million viewers, down
from the 52.4 million who watched his first speech to a joint
session of Congress in 2009.  Comcast Corp. ’s NBC said in a statement that it led all
networks with 6.47 million viewers from 9 a.m. to 10:16 p.m.,
compared with 6.4 million for the  CBS Corp.  network. Walt Disney
Co.’s ABC network attracted an audience of 5.94 million. News
Corp.’s Fox broadcast network had 2.12 million, NBC said.  Among cable outlets, Fox News was first with 3.68 million
viewers, and CNN was second at 3.64 million, according to a
statement from  Time Warner Inc. ’s CNN. Comcast’s MSNBC was third
with 3.03 million.  Along with raising the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour,
Obama appealed for votes on immigration and gun control,
proposed making preschool available to all 4-year-olds, said
he’d negotiate a new trade agreement with the European Union,
and asked for $50 billion in infrastructure spending.  He also lauded steps by companies such as  Apple Inc. ,
Caterpillar Inc. and Ford Motor Co. to bring manufacturing jobs
