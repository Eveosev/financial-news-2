University of Kentucky  freshman
Nerlens Noel tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left
knee yesterday and will miss the rest of the college basketball
season.  Noel will undergo surgery in the next two to three weeks,
according to a statement on the school’s athletics website. The
18-year-old was projected by some analysts to be the top pick in
the National Basketball Association Draft in June.  “Minor setback for a MAJOR comeback!” Noel said today on
his Twitter account.  Noel tore the ligament in the second half of Kentucky’s
69-52 loss to Florida last night after landing awkwardly on his
left leg and running into the basket support. He was on the
floor yelling in pain for more than a minute before teammates
carried him off the court.  The 6-foot-10 forward is leading the National Collegiate
Athletic Association in shots blocked, with 106, and is second
in the Southeastern Conference in rebounds per game, with 9.5,
according to the release. He was averaging 10.5 points per game.  The NBA’s age limit prevents players from going directly to
the NBA from high school.  Anthony Davis , the top pick in the
2012 NBA draft after one year with Kentucky, was guaranteed
about $9.1 million over his first two professional seasons.  The defending NCAA-champion Wildcats are 17-7 this year.
They are ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press poll after
opening the season at No. 3.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
