LLX Logistica SA , the port developer
backed by billionaire  Eike Batista , lost the most on the Bovespa
 index  today after the cancellation of a contract to rent space
at its Acu complex to pipeline builder Subsea 7 SA.  LLX  dropped  5.5 percent to 1.91 reais in Sao Paulo today,
the lowest close since Nov. 28. The stock, which has declined 48
percent in the past 12 months, was the worst performer on
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index, which fell 0.2 percent.  The contract for London-based Subsea 7 to rent space at Acu
for making oil and natural gas pipelines was terminated with no
prospects of renewal in the “immediate future,” Rio de
Janeiro-based LLX  said  Feb. 8 after the market closed for
Brazil’s Carnival break. The cancellation is due to “external
factors” mainly related to changes in the oil and gas industry,
the company said in an e-mailed reply to questions today.  Investors become suspicious about the expansion of startups
like LLX when projects aren’t delivered, according to  Pedro Galdi , the chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW
Corretora.  “The exit of a project like this certainly impacts the
company’s shares,” he said in a telephone interview. “It was a
big client that wanted to establish itself at Acu.”  Subsea 7’s communications office in London didn’t reply to
an e-mail by Bloomberg News today seeking comments on the
contract cancellation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
