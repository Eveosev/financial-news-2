Thai  stocks  surged, driving the
benchmark index to its highest level since November 1994, as
data showed domestic investors bought equities for a fourth day.  The  SET Index  climbed 1.7 percent to 1,514.11 at the close
in Bangkok. The gauge’s 30-day  volatility  rose to 11.1, the
highest since Aug. 23. PTT Pcl rose 4 percent, the most since
November 2011, as crude oil traded near a one-week high. Bangkok
Bank Pcl jumped 3.4 percent, the biggest increase since Jan. 28.  Local institutional investors  purchased  928.8 million baht
($31.2 million) of stock yesterday, taking net purchases this
month to 6.7 billion baht. Sentiment was boosted today by gains
in regional markets as Singapore and Malaysia resumed trading
after Lunar New Year holidays, BBL Asset Management Co.’s
 Voravan Tarapoom  said.  “Investors continue to show optimism,” said Voravan,
chief executive officer at BBL Asset, which oversees more than
$7.5 billion. “There is also a significant inflow of money into
equity funds from domestic investors.”  Some 72 billion baht of shares traded on the Thai bourse
today, the highest turnover since Jan. 10 and 64 percent more
than the three-month daily average,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Local investors bought stocks yesterday even as foreign
funds sold a net 1.87 billion baht, exchange  data  show. The
sixth day of outflows brought total foreign sales in February to
11.9 billion baht.  Thai shares advanced as the  Philippine Stock Exchange Index 
climbed 1.1 percent to a record. The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI
Index  gained 0.4 percent, the biggest advance since Jan. 3, and
Singapore’s  Straits Times Index  advanced 0.9 percent to the
highest close since November 2010.  Thailand’s SET Index has gained 8.8 percent this year,
extending a 36 percent  rally  in 2012, as domestic investment and
consumption recovered from floods in 2011 that were the worst in
almost seven decades. The government has increased minimum wages
and offered tax incentives for automobile purchases to boost
growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
