MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that breached regulators’ capital limits, jumped in New
York trading after a report on October home prices showed values
beat forecasts, signaling a sustained recovery.  MGIC  surged  9.2 percent to $2.61 at 4:27 p.m. The
Milwaukee-based firm has slid 30 percent this year. Rival  Radian
Group Inc. (RDN)  rose 4.4 percent today.  The  S&P/Case-Shiller index  of property values in 20 cities
increased 4.3 percent from October 2011, the biggest 12-month
advance since May 2010. Rising home prices can reduce the gap
between the value of a home and how much a borrower owes. They
can also lower costs for mortgage insurers, which cover losses
when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  “You have higher recovery values,” said Jason Stewart, an
analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC in  Washington .
“Higher values of homes improve the ratio of borrowers that go
into default because there’s less people with negative equity.”  The home-price increase accelerated from a 3 percent
advance in the 12 months ended in September. Adjusted for
seasonal variations, prices rose 0.7 percent in October from the
prior month, with 17 of 20 cities showing gains, according to
today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
