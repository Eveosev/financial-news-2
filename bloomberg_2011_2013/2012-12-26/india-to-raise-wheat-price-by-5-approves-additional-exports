India , the world’s second-biggest
wheat producer, will raise the minimum price the government pays
farmers for the grain by 5 percent next year, and also approved
an additional 2.5 million metric tons of exports.  The government will increase its wheat purchase price to
1,350 rupees ($24.61) per 100 kilograms (220 pounds) for the
marketing year starting April 1, from 1,285 rupees this year,
Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after a cabinet
meeting today.  The decision may boost local wheat prices unless the
government sells more grain in the open market at subsidized
rates, said Veena Sharma, secretary of Roller Flour Millers
Federation of India. “Any increase in local prices will make
India uncompetitive in overseas markets,” she said.  The government approved extra wheat exports from state
stockpiles, Chidambaram said. India on July 3 had already
allowed shipments of 2 million tons from official reserves.  Wheat exports by private traders totaled about 4 million
tons and overseas sales from state reserves were 1.23 million
tons as of Dec. 24, after the country scrapped a ban on exports
in September 2011, according to government data.  Wheat planting for next year’s harvest fell to 25.3 million
hectares (62.5 million acres) as of Dec. 21, compared with 25.7
million hectares sown a year earlier, according to the farm
ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
