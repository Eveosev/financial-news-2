The  Tennessee Valley Authority 
returned the 1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor to service in
 Alabama , leading an increase in U.S. nuclear-power production.  Generation  nationwide  gained 0.2 percent from yesterday to
90,411 megawatts, or 89 percent of capacity, according to U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output
was 5 percent less than a  year ago  with 11 of 104 nuclear
reactors offline.  Browns Ferry 2 operated at 20 percent of capacity today
after shutting Dec. 22 because of a power interruption to two
reactor protection systems, said Ray Golden, a company spokesman
based in Knoxville,  Tennessee . The plant is about 84 miles (135
kilometers) north of Birmingham, Alabama.  “Reactor protection systems control a number of systems
throughout the unit, and all systems affected by the loss of
power responded as designed,” the company said in a statement
e-mailed to Bloomberg on Dec. 24. “The NRC resident inspector
was notified and an investigation is under way to determine the
cause of the power loss.”  The increase led production higher by 210 megawatts in the
NRC’s Southeastern region.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
