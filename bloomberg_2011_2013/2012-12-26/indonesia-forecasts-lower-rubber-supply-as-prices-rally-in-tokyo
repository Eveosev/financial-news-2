Rubber output in  Indonesia , the
largest grower after  Thailand , may decline for the first time in
four years in 2013 as the country limits output and shipments in
coordination with other producers to support a rally.  Production may decline 8.9 percent to 2.77 million metric
tons from an estimated 3.04 million tons this year, according to
Agriculture Minister Suswono. That would be the first fall since
2009, when output dropped 11 percent to 2.44 million tons, data
from Indonesia’s Directorate General of Estate Crops show.  Thailand, Indonesia and  Malaysia , representing 67 percent
of global natural supply, agreed in August to combat lower
prices by limiting shipments and cutting down trees, paring
450,000 tons. Yen-denominated futures in  Tokyo , the regional
benchmark, rallied to the highest close since May today as the
Japanese currency fell, lifting costs for tiremakers.  “We have a commitment with two other producers to control
output and exports,” Suswono, who uses a single name, told
reporters in Jakarta today. “We’re not too ambitious to
increase production because we have to maintain prices.”  Rubber for delivery in June climbed 1.3 percent to 296 yen
a kilogram ($3,470 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange,
the highest settlement since May 8. That extended this year’s
gain to 12 percent.  Indonesia’s  Agriculture Ministry  plans to replant 10,685
hectares (26,403 acres) in 2013 and will ask farmers to continue
to cut tapping, said Mukti Sardjono, secretary at the
directorate general. Provincial governments in Riau, Jambi and
South Sumatra have similar programs, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
