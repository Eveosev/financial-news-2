Long Run produced a sprint finish to
take his second King George VI Chase at Kempton racecourse.  Trained by Nicky Henderson with Sam Waley-Cohen on board,
Long Run had taken the lead with three jumps to go, only to be
overtaken by Captain Chris. Long Run beat him in a sprint at the
finish line. Grands Crus finished third. The King George is one
of the biggest events in the U.K. jumps calendar.  Seven-year-old Long Run won the King George in 2011, and
was runner-up to Kauto Star last year. Kauto Star, a record
five-time winner of the King George, was retired in October at
the age of 12.  Long Run had been the 15-8 favorite to win the race in the
nine-horse field, meaning a $8 wager would yield $15 plus plus
the stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
