Global sukuk sales will challenge
this year’s record of $46 billion in 2013 as countries such as
Oman, Tunisia and  Egypt  tap the market for the first time, CIMB
Group Holdings Bhd. and OCBC Al-Amin Bank Bhd. say.  Borrowing costs on Shariah-compliant debt have fallen 11.4
percentage points to 2.82 percent since the end of 2008 as
central banks in Europe, the U.S. and Japan pumped funds into
their economies to spur growth. Demand will be driven by the
rise in Islamic banking assets, which may reach $1.8 trillion
next year, compared with $1.3 trillion in 2011, led by Saudi
Arabia and  Malaysia , Ernst & Young forecast in a Dec. 10  report .  Sales of bonds that comply with Muslim tenets jumped 25
percent in 2012 as companies sold debt as part of government
programs in Asia and the Middle East to build railways, ports
and roads.  Thailand  and South Africa have also announced plans
to issue sukuk once legislation has been passed that will open
up new markets for investors.  “Sukuk is an attractive channel to explore for those
countries looking to expand funding sources,” Kuala Lumpur-
based Alhami Mohd Abdan, head of international finance and
capital markets at OCBC Al-Amin, a unit of  Singapore ’s Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp., said in a Dec. 21 interview. “Liquidity
in the Islamic space is growing quite significantly.”  Biggest Sales  The biggest sales came out of Saudi Arabia and Qatar amid
development programs of $373 billion and $130 billion,
respectively. Malaysia has embarked on a $444 billion spending
spree over 10 years that helped spur Islamic bond offerings to
an all-time high of 95 billion ringgit ($31 billion) in 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Saudi Electricity Co. sold $1.75 billion of notes due in
2017 and 2022 in March. The yield on the five-year 2.665 percent
securities has since dropped 55 basis points, or 0.55 percentage
point, to 1.95 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Borrowing costs on global Shariah-compliant bonds fell 117 basis
points this year and reached a record low of 2.76 percent on Nov.
30, the HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index shows.  Qatar completed a $4 billion offering in July. The yield on
the 2.09 percent notes due in 2018 declined 13 basis points
since the sale date to 1.97 percent.  “There’s an increasing number of governments from the
Middle East and North Africa region looking to tap the sukuk
market as part of efforts to widen their funding sources
following the  European debt crisis ,” Zakariya Othman, head of
Islamic ratings at RAM Ratings Services Bhd., said in a Dec. 18
interview in Kuala Lumpur. “They’re also probably doing so to
meet demand from their Muslim populations as there’s now greater
awareness of  Islamic finance  globally.”  Record Yields  Shariah-compliant bonds sold on the international market
returned 9.5 percent this year, compared with 7.2 percent in
2011, according to the HSBC/Nasdaq gauge. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI Global Composite Index of emerging-market securities gained
18.2 percent, versus 8.5 percent.  The difference between average yields on sukuk, which pay
returns on assets to comply with Islam’s ban on interest, and
the London interbank offered rate narrowed 94 basis points in
2012 to 179 basis points as of Dec. 24, according to HSBC.  In Malaysia, borrowing costs on the 3.928 percent dollar-
denominated Islamic notes due in 2015 dropped one basis point
this month to 1.31 percent, near the all-time low of 1.28
percent reached on Dec. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The difference between Dubai’s 6.396 percent
securities maturing in November 2014 and Malaysia’s debt
narrowed 14 basis points in December to 77 basis points as of
Dec. 24.  ‘New Jurisdictions’  The Bloomberg-AIBIM Bursa Malaysia Sovereign Shariah Index
of the most-active ringgit-denominated bonds rose 3.7 percent in
2012 to 109.5980 and touched a record of 109.882 on Nov. 8.  Central banks in the U.S.,  Japan  and Europe have eased
monetary conditions to support growth. The Federal Reserve has
pledged to keep borrowing costs near zero until late 2014, while
rates in the euro area and Japan are at 0.75 percent and zero to
0.1 percent, respectively. That compares with 2 percent in Saudi
Arabia, 3 percent in Malaysia and 5.75 percent in  Indonesia .  Issuers will be encouraged to tap the sukuk market as
demand increases with a growing pool of wealth seeking Shariah-
compliant assets, according to OCBC Al-Amin Bank.  Government Islamic securities accounted for 18 percent of
the total global issuance this year, with Qatar, Indonesia,
 Turkey  and the United Arab Emirates completing offerings.  “We expect to see issuance from new jurisdictions in Asia
and  Europe  in 2013,” Mohamad Safri Shahul Hamid, the Kuala
Lumpur-based deputy chief executive officer at CIMB Islamic Bank
Bhd., a unit of CIMB Group, said in a Dec. 20 e-mail. “The
benign interest-rate environment would also help spur the sukuk
market in the near to medium term.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
