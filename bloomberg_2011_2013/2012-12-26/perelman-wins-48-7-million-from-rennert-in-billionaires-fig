Investor  Ronald Perelman  won a
judge’s tentative ruling ordering fellow billionaire Ira L. Rennert to pay $48.7 million in a dispute over a company that
makes Humvee vehicles for the U.S. military.  The AM General affiliate of Perelman’s MacAndrews & Forbes
Holdings Inc. sued Rennert’s ILR Capital LLC in June in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington, contending a Rennert firm wrongly
took loans from their joint venture, Ilshar Capital LLC. Judge
John Noble tentatively sided with Perelman in a Dec. 21 opinion.  AM General “has established much more than a reasonable
probability of success on its breach of contract claim” as
litigation continues, Noble wrote in ordering the payment.  In August, AM General was among three companies receiving a
total of $185 million to help the Army develop an advanced
replacement for the Humvee, to be called the Joint Light
Tactical Vehicle.  Christine Taylor , a spokeswoman for Perelman, declined to
comment on the ruling.  Rennert didn’t immediately return phone and e-mailed
messages seeking comment.  The case is AM General Holdings LLC v. Renco Group, 7639,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
