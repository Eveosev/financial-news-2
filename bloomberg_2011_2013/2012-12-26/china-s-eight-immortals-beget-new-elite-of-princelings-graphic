The descendants of Communist  China ’s
so-called Eight Immortals have spawned a new elite class known
as the princelings, who are able to amass wealth and exploit
opportunities unavailable to most Chinese.  Bloomberg News  traced the origins of 103 people, the
Immortals’ direct descendants and their spouses. While the
patriarchs are now all dead, they are revered in communist lore
as revolutionary fighters who led China’s economic opening after
 Mao Zedong ’s death.  To document the identities and business dealings of the
Immortals’ descendants, which are often obscured by state
censorship and complex corporate webs, Bloomberg News scoured
thousands of pages of corporate filings, property records,
official websites and archives, and conducted dozens of
interviews from China to the U.S.  Twenty-six of the heirs ran or held top positions in state-
owned companies that dominate the economy, data compiled by
Bloomberg News show. At least 11 of the 31 members of the third
generation tracked by Bloomberg News ran their own businesses or
held executive posts, most commonly in finance and technology.  To view the graphic click  here .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
