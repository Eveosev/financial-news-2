Invenergy LLC, a closely held
renewable-energy,developer, said its California Ridge wind farm
in Illinois has begun commercial operation.  U.S. government-owned utility  Tennessee Valley Authority 
buys power from the project, which generates enough electricity
for about 65,000 homes a year. Chicago-based Invenergy said
today in an e-mailed statement. The wind farm is located on
private land in Champaign and Vermilion counties and consists of
134 General Electric Co. wind turbines.  Invenergy operates wind farms in Illinois totaling 600
megawatts of capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
