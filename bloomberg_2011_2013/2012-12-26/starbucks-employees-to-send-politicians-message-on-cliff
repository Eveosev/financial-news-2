Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  workers in
Washington will write “Come Together” on cups this week to
encourage U.S. politicians to reach a compromise to reduce the
national debt.  The message, the first time the coffee-shop chain has ever
asked employees to write something on customers’ cups, will last
through Dec. 28, Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  said
today in a post on the company’s  website .  Schultz last year encouraged business leaders to withhold
contributions to U.S. political campaigns until politicians
reached a solution to the nation’s growing debt. He also worked
with Opportunity Finance Network to form “Create Jobs for
USA,” which collected donations online and at Starbucks
locations to help fund loans that would encourage small
businesses to create jobs.  President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker John Boehner have
been unable to agree on a plan to avoid $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts that has become known as the fiscal
cliff. Lawmakers and Obama are scheduled to return to Washington
tomorrow.  Starbucks, based in  Seattle ,  fell  1 percent to $53.13 at
the close in New York. The shares have gained 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
