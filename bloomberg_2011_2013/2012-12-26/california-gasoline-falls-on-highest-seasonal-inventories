Spot gasoline weakened for the first
time in five sessions in the  Los Angeles  and  San Francisco  areas
with seasonal inventories of motor fuel at the highest level in
 at least a decade .  Stockpiles of gasoline on the U.S. West Coast, known as
PADD 5, were 32.6 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 14,
the highest seasonal level since at least 2001, according to
Energy Department data compiled by Bloomberg. Supplies of
 distillate fuel  were 14.2 million in the same time period, the
department reported.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
declined 1 cent to 6.5 cents a gallon over futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:17 p.m. The same fuel in San
Francisco also slid 1 cent to 4.5 cents over futures.  California-grade diesel was unchanged at 2 cents a gallon
over heating oil futures in Los Angeles. Diesel in San Francisco
traded at a discount of 5.25 cents a gallon, also unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
