Medifast Inc. (MED) , a maker of weight-
loss products, declined the most in almost two years after its
acting chief financial officer said he would resign, six weeks
after the company’s prior CFO stepped down.  Medifast fell 13 percent to $25.69 at 12:14 p.m. New York
time, after earlier tumbling 16 percent in its biggest intraday
decline since March 2011. Medifast said earlier today that
Edward J. Powers would leave as acting CFO and principal
accounting officer no later than Jan. 4.  The Owings Mills, Maryland-based company, which sells diet-
plan meals and weight-loss counseling, said Powers was leaving
“to pursue other interests” without offering further
information, according to a regulatory filing. He took over Nov.
13 after Medifast said former CFO Brendan Connors had resigned,
citing the same explanation. The shares more than doubled this
year through Dec. 24.  Joseph Kelleman, the company’s director of finance-supply
chain, will take over as CFO on an interim basis, the company
said in its filing. Medifast said it’s continuing a national
search for a permanent replacement.  Powers is leaving Medifast to take a job at another company
and was always viewed as an interim CFO, Alecia Pulman, a
spokeswoman for Medifast, said today in a telephone interview.
She declined to say where Powers was going.  To contact the reporter on this story:
