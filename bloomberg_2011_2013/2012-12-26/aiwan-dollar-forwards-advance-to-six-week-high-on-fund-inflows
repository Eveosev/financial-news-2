Taiwan dollar  forwards rose to a
six-week high as overseas investors increased holdings of the
island’s assets.  Government bonds  declined.  Global funds bought $126 million more local stocks than
they sold today, taking net purchases this month to $1.5 billion,
exchange data show. The yen fell to a 20-month low before Shinzo Abe takes over as  Japan ’s prime minister amid speculation he
will seek to expand measures that pump money into markets to
spur growth. The  Federal Reserve  said Dec. 12 it will start
buying $45 billion a month of Treasuries, adding to $40 billion
a month of existing mortgage-debt purchases.  “Monetary stimulus from developed countries will continue
to cause inflows into Taiwan,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-
based foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “The
non-deliverable forward contracts show expectations are rising
for the Taiwan dollar to appreciate.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
NT$28.900 per dollar as of 4:29 p.m. in Taipei, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They reached NT$28.887 earlier, the
strongest level since Nov. 15. The contracts are at a 0.8
percent premium to the spot rate, which was little changed at
NT$29.128, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. The currency has
appreciated 4 percent this year, poised for a fourth annual gain.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, rose 15 basis points to 3.15 percent.  Counter Gains  Taiwan ’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past eight
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
monetary authority’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said on Dec. 19.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022
rose one basis point to 1.167 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. Borrowing costs on benchmark 10-year bonds
dropped 12 basis points in 2012.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.39
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
