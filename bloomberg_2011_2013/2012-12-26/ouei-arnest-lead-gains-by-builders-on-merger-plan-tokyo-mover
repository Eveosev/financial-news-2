Touei Housing Corp. (8875)  and  Arnest One
Corp. (8895) , Japanese condominium builders, surged in Tokyo trading
after announcing plans to merge with four other developers to
counter rising competition and declining demand.  Touei jumped 25 percent to 1,292 yen at the close of
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest gain since
March 2009. Arnest One climbed 24 percent to 1,492 yen, its
highest close since March 2007.  The two companies, along with Hajime Construction Co., ID
Home Co.,  Iida Home Max (8880)  and  Tact Home Co. (8915) , with a combined sales
of 779 billion yen ($9.1 billion), will merge under a holding
company by November 2013, they said in a joint statement through
the stock exchange yesterday. The companies cited population
decline and intensified competition in a shrinking residential
market as part of the reasons for merger.  “If the merger is realized, it would strengthen their
ability to negotiate pricing with suppliers and buyers and will
allow them to achieve higher efficiency,” Daisuke Fukushima, a
Tokyo-based analyst at Nomura Securities Co. wrote in a note to
clients today.  The six developers generated a combined operating profit of
74.3 billion yen in their latest business year, according to the
statement. The companies have an average 9.5 percent operating
margin, less than the 15 percent operating margin for the  Topix
Real Estate Index (TPREAL) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg based
on the companies’ release.  The home builders also plan to expand their businesses that
offer growth such as used and refurbished homes business and
overseas markets, the companies said.  All the six companies will be delisted after establishing a
new entity that will seek to be traded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, according to the statement. The merger ratio hasn’t
been decided, the companies said.  Hajime Construction advanced by its daily limit, surging 19
percent to 3,140 yen on the Jasdaq exchange. ID Home, Iida Home
and Tact Home all jumped by their daily limit, gaining 24
percent, 17 percent and 17 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
