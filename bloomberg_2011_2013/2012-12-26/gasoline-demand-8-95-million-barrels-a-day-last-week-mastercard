Gasoline demand was 8.95 million
barrels a day last week,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said, up 4.5 percent
from the previous week.  The data from MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report is for the
week ended Dec. 21. Consumption the prior week was 8.56 million
barrels a day, up 0.5 percent from the seven days ended Dec. 7.  The four-week average for the week ended Dec. 21 was 3.3
percent below a year earlier. It’s been down from the previous
year every week except one since March 18, 2011. Year-to-date
fuel consumption is 3.6 percent below the same period in 2011.  The average pump price fell 8 cents in the past week to
$3.23 a gallon, unchanged from a year earlier. Prices reached a
year-to-date peak of $3.94 on April 6.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
