Irving Oil Corp. is moving more than
90,000 barrels a day of crude from  Alberta  and North Dakota by
rail to its Saint John refinery, Canada’s largest, and plans to
increase those shipments, according to a person familiar with
the plans.  Alberta crude is coming by rail directly to the Irving
refinery rail terminal in  New Brunswick  and Bakken oil is moving
by rail to a port in  Albany , New York, then shipped by marine
tanker to Saint John, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the closely held company’s transportation
plans are private.  Irving, based in Saint John, is saving money on crude
brought in by rail instead of using oil from the North Sea, the
 Middle East  or  Africa  because North American prices are lower.
The Irving refinery is among plants on the continent’s east
coast cut off from pipelines that move crude from expanding
production in the Bakken shale formation and Alberta’s oil
sands.  The price of Western Canada Select, a benchmark for heavy
Alberta crude, was $56.98 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Brent oil futures, a global benchmark,
rose 2.2 percent to $111.24 for February settlement.  Irving’s Saint John refinery has a  capacity  of 298,800
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Carolyn
Van der Veen, a spokeswoman for Irving, wasn’t immediately
available to comment when contacted during a Canadian holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
