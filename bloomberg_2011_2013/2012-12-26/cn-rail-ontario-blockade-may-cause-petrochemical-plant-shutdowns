The blockade of a  Canadian National 
Railway Co. line that helps serve the petrochemical industry in
Sarnia, Ontario, may force plants in the area to shut, according
to the rail operator.  The blockade of the line by a First Nations group began
Dec. 21 and is ongoing, said Jim Feeny, a Montreal-based
spokesman for Canadian National, in a telephone interview. The
spur line, over which an average of 450 Canadian National rail
cars pass each day, runs from a main line to an industrial area
of Sarnia, he said.  “It’s beginning to affect customers on the line,” said
Feeny. “Some of them are facing plant shutdowns if service is
not resumed.”  A telephone message left in the general voice mail for the
 Aamjiwnaang First Nation  in Sarnia, Ontario, wasn’t immediately
returned.  Products carried on the line include ethylene, methanol,
butane and propane, according to Feeny. Canadian National
doesn’t move crude oil on the line, he said.  CSX Corp. (CSX)  also uses
the line to serve customers, he said.  Three refineries operated by  Imperial Oil Ltd, (IMO)   Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  in the Sarnia region have a
combined capacity of 277,730 barrels a day of crude processing
capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
