by Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 20.1,
compared with this year’s average of 17.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai measure were 53 percent

percent since this year’s closing low of 1,959.77 on Dec. 3 as

development as part of economic reforms.  Urbanization  China ’s largest cities including Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou will limit populations under a new urbanization plan,
while smaller cities and towns will loosen controls on
residency, the Shanghai Securities News reported, citing an
unidentified person.  The country will also improve infrastructure and public
services for transportation, communication, sewage and garbage
disposal, health-care and education in urban areas, the report
said. Urbanization is expected to spur 40 trillion  yuan  ($6.4
trillion) of investment by 2020, the Southern Metropolis Daily
reported yesterday, citing a draft plan by the National
Development and Reform Commission on urbanization.  “Developers are gaining on the government’s call to use
urbanization as a new engine for growth,” urbanization as a new
engine for growth,’’ Gao Jian, an analyst at Northeast
Securities Co., said in a phone interview.  A measure of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite

breach of contract by the Shanghai division of China
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission.  High RSI  SAIC slid 2.8 percent to 16.49 yuan, snapping six days of
gains and having its biggest decline since Oct. 26. The 14-day
relative strength measure for the stock, measuring how rapidly
prices have advanced or dropped during a specified time period,
was at 85.2 yesterday. Readings above 70 indicate a price may be

biggest pickup truck maker, lost 1.8 percent to 21.84 yuan.  Integrated Electronic Systems Lab Co. (002339) , a maker of power
