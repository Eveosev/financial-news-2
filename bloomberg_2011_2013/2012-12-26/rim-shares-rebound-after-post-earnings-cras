Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the
beleaguered maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, gained 11
percent today, rebounding from a post-earnings crash that erased
a quarter of the company’s market value.  The shares rose to $11.83 at the close in New York, marking
the biggest one-day increase since Nov. 23. RIM’s stock has
fallen 18 percent this year.  While RIM reported a smaller quarterly loss than projected
last week, the company raised concerns about declining service
fees. Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said that lower-end
users will generate “less or no service revenue” in the
future, a move that affects RIM’s most profitable source of
revenue. The shares tumbled 23 percent the day after the remarks
and an additional 2.7 percent the following trading day.  Investors may have overestimated the impact of the change
on earnings per share, Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie
Securities USA Inc. in  New York , said today.  “We believe that CEO Heins’ comments on changes to
services plans were taken out of context and the EPS impact from
those changes is not as great as the Street is fearing,” he
said in an e-mail. “The stock was largely oversold post-
earnings report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
