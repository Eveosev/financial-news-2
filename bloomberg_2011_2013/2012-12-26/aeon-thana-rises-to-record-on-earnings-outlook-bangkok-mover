Aeon Thana Sinsap (Thailand) Pcl (AEONTS) ,
the Thai consumer loans unit of Japan’s biggest credit-card
company, gained to a record in Bangkok trading on speculation a
rise in the minimum wage and government moves to increase
domestic spending will boost earnings.  The shares jumped 5.4 percent to 92.75 baht at the noon
trading break in Bangkok, heading for the highest close since
the stock listed in 2001. The shares surged 12 percent yesterday
after Aeon Thana reported third-quarter profit of 487.1 million
baht ($15.9 million), compared with a loss of 520.1 million baht
a year earlier. The benchmark  SET Index (SET)  rose 0.3 percent.  Profit in the nine months ended Nov. 20 was 1.14 billion
baht, from a loss of 40.4 million baht a year earlier, the
company said yesterday. Aeon Thana, controlled by Japan’s  Aeon
Credit Service Co. (8570) , joins companies including  Krungthai Card Pcl (KTC) 
and  Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB)  in reporting higher net income from
individual loans as wage rises and government tax incentives
spur domestic spending on vehicles and other consumer products.  “Aeon Thana will further benefit from higher wages in 2013
as increased income will spur consumer demand for loans,”
Usanee Liurut, an analyst at  Asia Plus Securities Pcl (ASP)  in
Bangkok, said in a report today. “The decrease in bad loans
will also be positive for the company’s earnings outlook.”  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra plans to raise the  daily
minimum wage  by as much as 35 percent to 300 baht ($9.80) in 70
of the nation’s 77 provinces in 2013 to meet an election pledge.  Aeon Thana’s nine-month revenue climbed 14 percent to 8.93
billion baht, while expenses for bad debts and doubtful accounts
dropped 32 percent to 2.44 billion baht, according to a
statement. As of Nov. 20, Aeon had 2.04 million active
customers, 61 percent of them outside Bangkok, the company said.  Yasuhiko Kondo, the company’s managing director, wasn’t
available for comment after a call to his office.  -- Editors:  Matthew Oakley , Allen Wan  To contact the reporter on this story:
