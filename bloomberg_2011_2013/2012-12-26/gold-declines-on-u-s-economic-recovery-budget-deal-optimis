Gold dropped for the first time in
four days as optimism that the U.S. economy is recovering and
lawmakers will reach a budget deal damped demand for the metal
as a protection of wealth. Platinum and palladium advanced.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.4 percent to $1,651.62 an ounce
and was at $1,655.73 at 3:25 p.m. in Singapore. It lost 2.3
percent last week, the most since the period to June 22, after
data showed that consumer spending, durable-goods orders and
industrial output increased in November. A separate report
showed the largest economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate
last quarter, exceeding all projections in a Bloomberg survey.  The U.S. may be a “bright spot” for the global economy in
2013, according to Huang Guobo, who oversees management of the
$3.3 trillion foreign-exchange reserves in  China , the largest
foreign lender to the U.S. government. President  Barack Obama 
and House Speaker John Boehner have not yet been able to reach a
deal to avert more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts
and tax increases from Jan. 1, known as the fiscal cliff.  “The U.S. economy has been recovering and the market is
optimistic on resolution of the fiscal cliff,” Janet Kong, an
analyst at China International Capital Corp., the nation’s
largest investment bank, wrote in a note.  Gold for February delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $1,658.30
an ounce on the Comex in New York. Holdings in gold-backed ETPs
reached a record 2,632.516 metric tons on Dec. 20, and have
expanded 12 percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Spot gold is 5.9 percent higher this year, set for a 12th
annual gain, as investors sought the metal to hedge against
weakening currencies and the threat of inflation after central
banks around the world boosted stimulus to prop up economies.  Spot platinum rose as much as 0.9 percent to $1,549 an
ounce, before trading at $1,548.50. The best performing precious
metal in 2012 has risen 11 percent. Palladium rose 0.2 percent
to $687.25 an ounce, 4.9 percent higher this year. Cash silver
fell 0.1 percent to $29.925 an ounce, up 7.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
