The French government’s deficit-
reduction policies are hurting growth and it shouldn’t make
further cuts even though it’s unlikely to hit 2013 European
targets, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  In its annual review of  France , the IMF last week forecast
that the economy will grow 0.4 percent next year, half the
government’s outlook, and as a result the Washington-based IMF
sees France unable to meet a deficit target of 3 percent of
gross domestic product next year. The IMF expects a shortfall of
3.5 percent and says the difference isn’t important.  “Whether it’s 3 percent or 3.5 percent matters less than
whether the government can give credible assurances about the
direction of policy,”  Edward Gardner, the IMF’s mission chief
for France, said in a conference call today.  “Our preferred
policy is not to take any additional measures at this stage. The
path to a balanced budget over the medium term is credible.”  Any budget cuts after next year should come from reduced
spending because “there is limited scope for further increases
in taxes without harming business incentives,” Gardner said.  The IMF also called on France to reduce the cost of labor
and ease labor regulations to regain lost  competitiveness  vis-a-
vis its trading partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
