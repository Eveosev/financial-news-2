The U.S. Treasury Department said it
will reach the debt limit on Dec. 31 and begin employing
extraordinary measures to finance $200 billion in deficits in
2013.  Treasury said in a letter to Congress that “given the
significant uncertainty” that exists for unresolved tax and
spending policies, it is not possible to predict how long these
measures will last.  Under “normal circumstances,” $200 billion would last the
government about two months, Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner 
said in a letter to Congressional leaders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
