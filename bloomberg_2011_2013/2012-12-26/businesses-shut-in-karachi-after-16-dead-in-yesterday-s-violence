Businesses were closed in  Pakistan ’s
commercial capital, Karachi, after an attempt to murder a
politician left six dead yesterday and ensuing violence killed
10 others.  Aurangzaib Farooqi, leader of the hardline  Sunni Muslim 
organization Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat, survived an attack
yesterday by gunmen, prompting his party to demand a day of
mourning, the Dawn newspaper  reported . Farooqi received a bullet
wound to the thigh, while five of his guards and chauffer were
killed in the shootout.  People with bamboo shafts and some with pistols took to the
streets after television channels reported the news of the
attack. Armed men fanned across the city during which 10 more
people were killed, either in reaction or related to the attack,
the daily said.  Trade unions said they will refrain from opening shops to
join a day of mourning, while transportation representatives
said they will keep off roads after two of their vehicles were
set on fire by protesters.  Religious and ethnic clashes have claimed over 8,000 lives
in Karachi since 2008, Geo television reported last week. The
city is the largest in Pakistan, with about 20 million residents.  It is home to Urdu-speaking migrants who settled there
after the 1947 partition from  India , and ethnic Pashtuns fleeing
army operations against militants in the country’s north.  President Asif Ali Zardari is in the city to commemorate
the fifth anniversary of the death of his wife, former Prime
Minister  Benazir Bhutto , who was assassinated in a gun and bomb
attack on Dec. 27, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
