Indonesia ’s rupiah declined by the
most in a week and  government bonds  fell on concern the trade
balance was in deficit last month, which may cause the current-
account shortfall to widen further.  The  trade gap  reached $1.5 billion in October, the largest
since at least 2008, while the central bank forecasts the
current-account deficit will be  2.3 percent  of gross domestic
product this quarter, the biggest since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 2003. The trade data are due Jan. 2.  “Downward pressure on the rupiah is still strong,” said
Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the Jakarta-based head of treasury research
at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “Considering the large demand for
dollars from importers, the upcoming  trade balance  is likely to
remain in deficit.”  The rupiah dropped 0.6 percent to 9,715 per dollar as of
9:24 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest loss since Dec. 17, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It weakened 6.7
percent this year, the second-worst performance among  Asia ’s 11
most-traded currencies after the Japanese yen.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 5.7
percent today, down from 13.2 percent at the end of 2011.  Global investors sold $42 million more Indonesian stocks
than they bought this month through Dec. 21, after taking out
$319 million in November, exchange data show.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent bonds due July
2017 climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
4.85 percent, the biggest increase since Sept. 26, prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield dropped 58
basis points this year and touched a record low of 4.47 percent
on Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
