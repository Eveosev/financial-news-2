Gasoline weakened the most in almost
two weeks on the U.S. Gulf Coast as Motiva Enterprises LLC
restarted units after a power failure last week.  The refinery took “most” units offline Dec. 20 when power
and steam were lost during a storm, said Kimberly Windon, a
Motiva spokeswoman in Houston. The refinery, which has a
capacity of 600,000 barrels a day, reported flaring Dec. 23
associated with the startup of units at the site. Windon did not
immediately respond to an e-mail today.  The  discount  for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, on the Gulf fell 3.25 cents a gallon to 19
cents versus futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:16
p.m., the biggest percentage drop since Dec. 13. Reformulated,
84-octane gasoline retreated 1.75 cents to a discount of 18.25
cents below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel slid 0.25 cent to 4.25 cents
below heating oil futures. The same fuel was  unchanged  in New
York, with a premium of 7.5 cents a gallon.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell
Oil Co., a unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
