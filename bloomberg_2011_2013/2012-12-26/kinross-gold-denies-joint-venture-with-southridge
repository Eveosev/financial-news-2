Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-
largest producer of the metal, denied a statement from another
mining company that the two are forming a partnership to develop
Mexican projects.  Southridge Enterprises Inc. (SRGE) , based in Dallas, said in a
statement today the companies are working to finalize an
agreement for the Cinco Minas and Gran Cabrera properties.  “Kinross has not entered into a joint venture agreement
with Southridge Enterprises, and is not actively pursuing any
such agreement at this time,” Toronto-based Kinross said in an
e-mail.  No one immediately responded to e-mail and voicemail
messages seeking comment from Southridge. Its shares rose 60
percent to 1.3 cents in over-the-counter trading at 11:45 a.m.
in New York.  Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc. are the two largest
Canadian gold producers ranked by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
