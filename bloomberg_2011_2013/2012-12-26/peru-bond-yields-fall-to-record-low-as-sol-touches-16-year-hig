Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields to a record low, on speculation assets denominated in the
sol will benefit from a further rally in the currency.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 declined five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.91 percent at 3:01 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price climbed 0.37
centimo to 125.55 centimos per sol.  The sol is trading at its strongest level in 16 years as
mining investment and corporate bond sales overseas spur
inflows. Foreign direct investment in  Peru  will rise 35 percent
to $11.1 billion this year from last year, while exports will
increase 5.7 percent to $48.4 billion in 2013 on metal sales,
the central bank said in a Dec. 14 report.  “There continues to be interest in the bonds given that
the outlook is for sol appreciation to continue in 2013,” said
Diego Llona, a trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima. “The bonds
are among the few vehicles available” to overseas investors
betting on further gains in the currency.  The sol strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.5530 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s Peruvian unit.
The currency earlier touched 2.5520, the strongest level since
October 1996, data from Peru’s financial regulator show.  Peru will prepay as much as $1.5 billion of foreign debt
next year as part of measures to slow the appreciation of the
sol, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Dec. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
