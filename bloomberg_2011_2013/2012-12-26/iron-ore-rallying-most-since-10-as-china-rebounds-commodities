Iron ore  is rallying the most in
about two years as analysts predict that  China , the biggest
buyer, will import a record amount in 2013 as its accelerating
economic growth spurs demand for steel.  Trade to China will climb 6.9 percent to 778 million metric
tons in 2013, or 65 percent of all shipments, according to the
median of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Seaborne
demand will exceed supply for at least a 10th year, Morgan
Stanley data show. Prices will climb as much as 22 percent to
$170 a ton by June, according to Justin Smirk of  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC) , who correctly predicted this year’s slump and was the
most accurate industrial-metals forecaster tracked by Bloomberg.  Prices tumbled to a three-year low in September as China
slowed for seven consecutive quarters, before rallying 56
percent since then on mounting confidence the nation’s growth
will accelerate for at least the next six months. The rebound
will boost earnings for suppliers and  Vale SA (VALE3) , the biggest
exporter, is expected to report a 19 percent increase in profit
next year, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We’re confident to stay bullish for now,” said Smirk,
the economist at Westpac in Sydney who beat as many as 25 others
in predicting metals prices for two consecutive quarters on a
rolling two-year basis. “We’re seeing the recovery come through
in China. They’ve made a switch to their policy adjustments from
being contractionary to be more stimulatory.”  London Dry  Ore at China’s Tianjin port, a global benchmark, was last
at $139.40, for an annual gain of 0.6 percent and a fourth-
quarter  average  of $119.88. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24 raw materials gained 0.2 percent and the MSCI All-Country
World Index of  equities  rose 13 percent. Treasuries returned 2
percent, a  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  index shows.  The Tianjin price will average $119 in the first quarter
and $122 in the following three months, the medians of 14
analysts’ estimates shows. Investors can trade swaps handled by
brokers including SSY Futures Ltd., London Dry Bulk Ltd., GFI
Group Inc.,  Clarkson Plc (CKN)  and Freight Investor Services Ltd. The
derivatives market may total as much as 150 million tons this
year, from 53 million tons in 2011, The Steel Index Ltd., which
publishes the Tianjin price, said last month.  Seaborne trade will climb 6 percent to 1.18 billion tons
next year, the same pace as in 2012, says London-based Clarkson,
the world’s biggest shipbroker. Morgan Stanley estimates that
seaborne demand will exceed supply by 28 million tons next year,
extending a run of deficits going back to at least 2004. Global
steel output expanded about 50 percent since then, according to
MEPS (International) Ltd., an industry consultant.  Lowest Level  Steel production in China, equal to 47 percent of world
output in the first 11 months, will expand another 6 percent in
2013, Credit Suisse Group AG estimates. Ore  inventories  at
Chinese ports dropped 19 percent since the end of October to
71.32 million tons, the lowest level in more than two years,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., a
state-backed research company. That may spur imports as steel
plants restock, says UBS AG.  China’s manufacturing may expand at a faster pace in
December, according to a preliminary reading on Dec. 14 by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, adding to signs the economy
is strengthening as a new leadership takes power. The government
has approved projects for the construction of about 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles) of roads, subways in 18 cities and
extra spending on railways.  Steel Association  While China is rebounding, the 17-nation euro area and
 Japan  have slipped back into recessions. They represent a
combined 16 percent of global steel output, according to the
Brussels-based World Steel Association. Steel production in the
27-nation European Union retreated 5.3 percent in November from
a year earlier and in Japan fell 2.3 percent, the WSA estimates.  Demand also may weaken in the U.S., the third-largest
steelmaker, should lawmakers fail to reach an agreement on more
than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts that start
automatically next month. The Congressional Budget Office says
the lack of an accord risks sending the world’s biggest economy
back into a recession. President  Barack Obama  is due back in
 Washington  from vacation today, according to a White House aide,
as Congress returns to continue talks on a budget agreement.  Current ore prices are more than double the average cost of
production in  Australia  and  Brazil , the two biggest exporters,
and above the $100 that Chinese mining companies pay to extract
every ton, according to estimates from Credit Suisse and
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  That may spur Chinese
miners to raise supply, diminishing demand for imports.  Capacity Glut  Rising prices and seaborne trade won’t be enough to return
ship owners to profit because of a glut of capacity. Rates for
Capesizes, which carry more iron ore than any other class of
vessel, slumped 82 percent this year, according to the Baltic
Exchange in  London , which publishes prices for 61 maritime
routes. Earnings will average $12,250 a day in 2013, below the
$15,500 that Pareto Securities AS says they need to break even,
the mean of nine analyst estimates shows.  Chinese steel  production  rose 14 percent to 57.47 million
tons in November from a year earlier, while the price of
reinforcement bars used in construction climbed about 11 percent
this month to the highest level since July on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange. Ore imports were the second- highest  ever in
November at 65.78 million tons, customs data show.  Shares of Rio de Janeiro-based Vale rose 8.3 percent this
year to 40.97 reais and will gain 20 percent to 49.02 reais in
the next 12 months, according to the average of 12  analyst 
estimates. Net income will climb to 28.92 billion reais ($13.9
billion) next year, from 23.92 billion reais in 2012, the mean
of seven analyst predictions shows.  Ore Exports  Profit at  Rio Tinto (RIO)  Group, the second-largest exporter,
will rise to $10.85 billion from $10.07 billion, according to
the mean of 20 analyst estimates. Shares of the London-based
company jumped 14 percent to 3,574 pence this year and will
reach 3,868 in 12 months, the forecasts show.  Brazil’s ore exports fell 0.9 percent to 294.3 million tons
in the first 11 months as rain curbed output,  government  data
show. Vale plans to invest the least in three years in 2013 and
will cut production to 306 million tons from 312 million tons
this year, the company said Dec. 3.  India ’s shipments may slump 25 percent to 38 million tons
in 2013, Australia’s Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics
said Dec. 12. The state of Goa, which exports more than half the
country’s ore, banned all mining in September after a panel said
the province lost money because of illegal work.  China’s miners may struggle to make up for any shortage in
seaborne supply because they produce ore that contains about 20
percent iron, compared with 62 percent internationally,
according to HSBC estimates and data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries. Domestic ore  output  dropped 3.4 percent in the past
two months, National Bureau of Statistics data show.  “It’s not a screaming bull year, it’s just a modestly
bullish year,” said Tom Price, a commodities analyst at UBS in
Sydney. “The next six months will be fairly active and positive
for iron ore trade.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
