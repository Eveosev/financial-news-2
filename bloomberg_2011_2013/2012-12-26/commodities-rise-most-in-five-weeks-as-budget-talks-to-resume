Commodities rose the most in five
weeks and oil jumped as the dollar weakened against the euro and
U.S. lawmakers prepared to resume budget talks.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
gained 1.3 percent, the biggest increase since Nov. 19. The euro
strengthened against the dollar for the first time in four days.
President  Barack Obama  planned to resume talks with
congressional officials to avert spending cuts and tax increases
that start from Jan. 1.  “The likelihood of anything substantive is extremely
low,” said James Dailey, who manages $215 million at TEAM
Financial Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania .
“Whether they’ll put together some kind of patch to get us
through another four or twelve weeks, I won’t completely
eliminate the chance of that happening.”  The S&P’s GSCI index advanced to 646.31, the highest level
since Dec. 3. The euro strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to
$1.3254. A stronger euro and weaker dollar increase oil’s appeal
as an investment alternative.  Oil for February delivery added $2.37, or 2.7 percent, to
end at $90.98 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Oct. 18. The futures account for about
30 percent of the GSCI index.  Brent Rises  Brent oil for February settlement rose $2.27, or 2.1
percent, to close at $110.07 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe .  Natural gas gained for the first time in three days as
freezing weather spurred demand for heating fuels. Futures for
January delivery rose 1.4 percent to end at $3.392 per million
British thermal units on the Nymex.  In other commodities, copper capped the biggest gain in
almost four weeks after workers rejected a wage proposal at  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida mine, the world’s largest source of
the metal.  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 1.5 percent to
settle at $3.5975 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
