Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened to the largest gap in three months as the cost of
producing the biofuel eased.  Prices followed corn lower after a U.S. Agriculture
Department report showed export  inspections  for the grain
dropped 66 percent from a year earlier to 13.475 million
bushels, easing demand for the ethanol feedstock.  “Obviously, it’s an ugly day in the grains complex,” said
 Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in
 Minneapolis .  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel expanded to 60.98
cents a gallon based on January contracts, the widest since
Sept. 28. It was 52.26 cents Dec. 24 and 18.79 cents Dec. 6. The
differential has averaged about 61 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 2.2 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $2.206 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have declined 8.4 percent this month and are
little changed this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago slipped 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.185 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive decreased 2.5 cents to $2.24, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast declined 2 cents to $2.335 a
gallon and in  New York  the biofuel lost 0.5 cent to $2.315.  Gasoline Gains  Gasoline for January delivery rose 6.52 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.8158 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The motor fuel gained as President  Barack Obama  cut short
his vacation to return to  Washington  for budget talks tomorrow
in an effort to strike a deal to avoid automatic spending cuts
and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff.  Corn for March delivery slumped 11 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $6.9325 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
30 cents Dec. 24, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
