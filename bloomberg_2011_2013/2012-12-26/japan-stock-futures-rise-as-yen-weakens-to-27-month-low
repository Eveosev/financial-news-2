Japanese stock futures rose,
indicating the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may extend a nine-month
high, as the yen fell against the dollar to the lowest level
since September 2010, boosting the earnings outlook for
exporters. Australian shares dropped.  American Depositary Receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the Japanese
camera maker that gets 80 percent of its sales abroad, gained
1.3 percent. ADRs of Toyota Motor Corp. fell 0.4 percent after
the carmaker said it will take a $1.1 billion write-down to
settle claims that its vehicles lost value because of recalls
for unintended acceleration-related issues.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
Australia’s largest oil producer, gained 0.3 percent as crude
advanced to a two-month high.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,335 in  Chicago  yesterday, up from 10,240 in
 Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,340 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1 percent.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.1 percent.  “The message from Japan is clear,” said Stan Shamu, a
markets strategist at IG Markets Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The
incoming government will do everything in its power to weaken
the yen and stimulate the economy.”  Japan’s currency held near a 27-month low before data
tomorrow that may show Japan’s consumer prices fell
last month, fanning speculation newly installed Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe will push the central bank to boost cash infusions.  The yen has weakened against all of its 16 major
counterparts this year. Abe said in a media briefing yesterday
that “bold’ monetary policy is one of the three pillars of his
economic measures.  Fiscal Cliff  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.1 percent. The
gauge slid 0.5 percent yesterday as President  Barack Obama  and
Congress prepared to resume budget talks and retailers slumped
after the Christmas holiday.  House Speaker John Boehner and the president have been
unable to agree on tax-rate increases for top earners or cuts to
entitlement programs, complicating the chances of getting a
package agreed by year end.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he will
take ‘‘extraordinary measures” to postpone a U.S. default for
about two months while Obama and Congress work out a deficit-
reduction deal. Geithner said the government will hit its
statutory debt ceiling on Dec. 31. To avert a default, the
Treasury will take action to create about $200 billion in
headroom under the debt limit.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York surged 1.3 percent to 96.92 yesterday
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
