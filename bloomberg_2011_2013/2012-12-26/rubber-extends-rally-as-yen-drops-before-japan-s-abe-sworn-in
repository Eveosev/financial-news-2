Rubber extended rally to a seven-
month high as  Japan ’s currency weakened to the lowest since
April 2011 after Shinzo Abe became Japan’s new prime minister,
promising more stimulus.  Rubber for delivery in June climbed 1.3 percent to end at
296 yen a kilogram ($3,471 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange, the highest settlement for the most-active contract
since May 8. Futures have gained 12 percent this year.  The yen weakened past 85 per dollar as the lower and upper
houses of parliament approved Abe’s nomination today. Abe said
he will consider changing the law governing the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
unless it boosts its inflation target next month. A weaker
Japanese currency can raise the appeal of yen-based contracts.  “Expectations grew that Abe will take stimulus measures to
lift the economy from deflation,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  One BOJ policy maker had embraced the idea of open-ended
monetary stimulus as early as last month, according to a record
of the Nov. 19-20 board meeting released today in Tokyo. Abe
agreed with a coalition ally on a policy package that includes
“bold monetary easing” to reach inflation of 2 percent.  Rubber output in Indonesia, the largest grower after
Thailand, may decline for the first time in four years in 2013
as the country limits output and shipments in coordination with
other producers to support a rally. Production may decline 8.9
percent to 2.77 million tons from an estimated 3.04 million tons
this year, according to Agriculture Minister Suswono.  Exports from  Vietnam , the world’s fourth-biggest shipper,
in 2012 were estimated at 1.02 million tons, up 25 percent from
a year earlier, Ministry of Agriculture and  Rural Development 
said in monthly report posted on its website.  Rubber for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to close at
25,320  yuan  ($4,061) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board advanced 0.5 percent to 97.10 baht
($3.17) a kilogram, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
