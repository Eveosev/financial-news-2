The negative outlook on the U.S.’s
Aaa rating will likely be resolved based on budget negotiations
as the nation eventually raises its debt ceiling, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  “We expect the government will act to raise the limit, as
it has done on many occasions in the past,” Moody’s said today
in a statement. “Our view is that the probability of a missed
interest payment on Treasury bonds is extremely low.”  The U.S. Treasury Department said it will reach the debt
limit on Dec. 31 and begin employing extraordinary measures to
finance $200 billion in deficits in 2013. Republicans are
renewing attempts to use a debt-limit increase to force deeper
spending cuts, replicating the 2011 showdown that caused the
U.S. to come within days of default and in part spurred a
downgrade by  Standard & Poor’s .  Treasury said in a letter to Congress that “given the
significant uncertainty” that exists for unresolved tax and
spending policies, it isn’t possible to predict how long these
measures will last.  Under “normal circumstances,” $200 billion would last the
government about two months, Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner 
said in a letter to Congressional leaders.  Moody’s said Sept. 11 that it may join S&P in downgrading
the U.S.’s credit rating unless Congress next year reduces the
percentage of debt-to-gross-domestic-product during budget
negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
