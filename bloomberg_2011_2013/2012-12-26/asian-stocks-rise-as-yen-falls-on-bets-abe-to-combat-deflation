Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index trading less than 1 percent from its highest
close for the year, as the yen dropped and Shinzo Abe was
approved as Japan’s prime minister after promising to promote
more stimulus measures.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that derives almost 80 percent
of sales overseas, gained 2.1 percent in  Tokyo . Hitachi Ltd.
rose 2.1 percent after its president said the company plans to
double its operating margin. Tradewinds (Malaysia) Bhd., a palm
oil and rice producer, jumped 15 percent in Kuala Lumpur after
receiving a takeover offer.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.2 percent to 128.66 at
7 p.m. in Tokyo with about two stocks rising for each that fell.
The measure, which closed at a 16-month high of 129.39 on Dec.
19, gained 3 percent this month through yesterday. Equity
markets in  Hong Kong ,  Australia  and  New Zealand  are closed today
for holidays.  “I think the market will keep a strong momentum,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of about 1.79 trillion yen
($21 billion). “The market focus will switch to what measures
they will actually introduce and how much impact they can make,
after stocks rose on expectations. The market will edge up from
the current level if they meet expectations.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 13 percent this year as
of yesterday as U.S. and Chinese economies showed signs of
recovery and central banks around the world took action to shore
up growth. The Asian benchmark trades at 14.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.8 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  14-day relative strength index  of the Asia-Pacific
gauge was at 70 today, a threshold that some traders say signals
a drop is likely.  Nikkei, Yen  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.5 percent as the
yen touched 85.36 per dollar, the weakest since April 2011. A
weaker yen boosts overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.  The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent after
advancing 2.5 percent yesterday. South Korea’s Kospi Index was
little changed while data showed the nation’s  consumer
confidence  failed to improve this month.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE) 
was little changed and Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained
0.4 percent.  Japan’s incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose  Liberal
Democratic Party  won a landslide victory in the Dec. 16
election, will appoint a cabinet today after the lower house
named him premier. Abe has promised policies aimed at boosting
growth and spurring inflation.  Nissan, Panasonic  Japanese exporters advanced with Nissan rising 2.1 percent
to 782 yen. Panasonic Corp., the maker of Viera televisions,
gained 2.8 percent to 510 yen.  U.S. equity markets were closed for the Christmas holiday
yesterday. The  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  dropped 0.2 percent in  New York  on Dec.
24 amid concern policy makers will fail to strike a budget
compromise by year end to avoid more than $600 billion in
spending cuts and tax increases, the so-called fiscal cliff. 
 Hitachi rose 2.1 percent to 494 yen in Tokyo after President
Hiroaki Nakanishi said yesterday is aims to double its operating
margin to 10 percent or more. The firm is also in talks with
 Lithuania  to build a nuclear power plant there, he said.  Tradewinds soared 15 percent to 8.92 ringgit, the biggest
gain in more than five years, in  Kuala Lumpur  after receiving a
takeover offer from companies linked to billionaire Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary.  Touei Housing Corp. and Arnest One Corp., Japanese
condominium builders, jumped after announcing plans to merge
with four other developers to counter rising competition and
declining demand. Toei surged 25 percent to 1,292 yen and Arnest
gained 24 percent to 1,492 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
