Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
from a five-month high on concern that cold weather across  China 
will reduce demand for the construction material.  Rebar for delivery in May lost as much as 0.3 percent to
3,862  yuan  ($619) a metric ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange
before ending the morning session at 3,867 yuan. Futures closed
at 3,873 yuan yesterday, the highest since July 16, and have
dropped 8.2 percent this year.  A cold front will sweep most of China today, with snow and
rain forecast for the Yangtze Delta region around Shanghai,
portions of Yunnan province and other parts of southern China,
the  China Meteorological Administration  said on its website.
Freezing temperatures and snowfall in northern China in the past
week blocked expressways in Xinjiang and killed two tourists
stranded on a mountain near Beijing.  “Construction has pretty much halted across the country as
the winter bears down,” Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng
Futures Co., said by phone from Jinan. “The weakness in cash
prices is definitely having a drag on the futures market.”  The average spot  price  for rebar dropped for a fourth day
yesterday, falling 0.1 percent to 3,609 yuan a ton, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Spot  iron
ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $135.40 a dry ton on Dec.
