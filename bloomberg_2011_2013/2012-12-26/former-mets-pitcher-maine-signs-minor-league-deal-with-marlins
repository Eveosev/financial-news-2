Former New York Mets pitcher John
Maine signed a minor-league contract with the  Miami Marlins , two
years after his last Major League Baseball game.  Maine, 31, will be invited to the teamâ€™s spring training
camp, Marlins spokesman Matt Roebuck said in an e-mail. He last
pitched on May 20, 2010, for the Mets before having season-
ending surgery on his right throwing shoulder.  In five seasons in New York from 2006 to 2010, Maine was
39-32 with a 4.17 earned-run average and 467 strikeouts over 542
innings. He battled numerous injuries while with the Mets,
including a strained right rotator cuff, a bone spur in the
shoulder and arm fatigue.  He signed in 2011 with the  Colorado Rockies  and pitched
with their Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.
Last year he signed a minor-league deal with the  New York
Yankees  and was 8-5 with a 4.97 ERA in 16 games with the
 Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees , also a Triple-A club.  Maine pitched for two seasons with the  Baltimore Orioles 
prior to joining the Mets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
