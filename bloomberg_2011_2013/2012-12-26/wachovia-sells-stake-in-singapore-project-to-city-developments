Wachovia Development Corp. sold its
stake in two luxury apartment buildings in  Singapore  to its
joint venture partner  City Developments Ltd. (CIT)  after five years at
a lower price than its initial investment.  Wachovia sold its 60 percent stake in the towers at the
Cliveden at Grange development for S$204.5 million ($167 million)
to the country’s second-largest property developer, City
Developments said.  “City Developments has taken a medium to long-term view of
the prospects of the project and has confidence in the
project,” the developer said in a Dec. 21 statement.  Wachovia bought the stake in the 110-unit luxury
residential project on Grange Road, a prime area in the island
city, in 2007. The two partners paid S$432.4 million to acquire
the buildings, which have 44 apartments. The 60 percent stake by
Wachovia was worth S$259.4 million.  The joint venture between Wachovia and City Developments
paid S$3,750 per square foot for the residential project,
according to a Nov. 5, 2007 statement by the developer.  The last transaction at the project named ‘Cliveden at
Grange’, showed a unit sold for S$3,914 per square feet in Feb.
2008, according to data from the  Urban Redevelopment Authority .  Wachovia Development is a subsidiary of Wachovia Corp.,
which was bought by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
