Japan ’s bonds declined as Shinzo Abe
was approved as Japan’s prime minister today amid expectations
he will deliver his pledge of more fiscal and monetary stimulus
to revive growth.  Yields on the 10-year notes climbed to the highest level in
almost two months as gains in the nation’s stocks sapped demand
for the relative safety of  government securities . Japan’s
Ministry of Finance sold two-year notes in its last auction of
the year today.  “In the short run, stocks are likely to rise while bonds
are sold,” on expectations for Abe’s administration, said
Shinji Hiramatsu, Tokyo-based senior investment manager at Sompo
Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. “But I don’t think it is
easy for Abe’s policies to revive growth and help end deflation
in the long term.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note gained 2 basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.785 percent as of 4:29
p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The rate is the highest since
Nov. 1.  The 20-year rate rose 3 basis points to 1.745 percent,
while the yield on 30-year bonds added 2 basis points to 1.955
percent.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery declined to as low
as 143.58 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the least since Sept. 19.
The benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  jumped 1.5 percent to
10,230.36, the highest close since March.  Both houses of Japan’s parliament confirmed Abe as the
nation’s seventh prime minister in six years, returning him to
the office he left in 2007.  ‘Bold’ Easing  Abe’s  Liberal Democratic Party , which swept to power in
lower house elections on Dec. 16, has called for “bold monetary
easing” from the  Bank of Japan (8301)  until 2 percent inflation in
achieved. The LDP is also targeting a nominal economic growth of
at least 3 percent and is planning a “large-scale” extra
budget.  A sale of two-year Japanese government notes today saw bids
worth 9.73 times the 2.7 trillion yen ($31.7 billion) of
securities on offer today, compared with the so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 13.87 in the last auction in November.  “I see this as a good result, although the bid-to-cover
ratio fell from the last sale,” said Tadashi Matsukawa, head
for fixed-income securities at PineBridge Investments Japan Co.
“Demand for the securities is stable on the back of
expectations of the BOJ’s further easing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
