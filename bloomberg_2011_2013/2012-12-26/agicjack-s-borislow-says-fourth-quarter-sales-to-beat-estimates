MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL) , the Israeli
company whose founders invented the technology for Internet-
based phone calls, said fourth-quarter sales will exceed
analysts’ estimates.  The company that offers voice-over Internet telephone
services will post sales of more than $39 million in the fourth
quarter, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Borislow said,
 surpassing  the $38.85 million average estimate of two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We’ve had a breakout year, we’re having a great fourth
quarter” Borislow said today by phone from  West Palm Beach ,
Florida.  Shares of the Netanya, Israel-based company rose 3.6
percent to $16.29 at 3:04 p.m. in New York, pacing a 33 percent
retreat this quarter, the biggest slump in four years.  “It’s the biggest mystery of my business career,”
Borislow said about the stock plunge.  MagicJack’s YMax Communications  subsidiary  settled all
disputes with  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the company said in a
 filing  today. Following the agreement, there’s “definitely a
better chance of a settlement” with AT&T Inc., he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
