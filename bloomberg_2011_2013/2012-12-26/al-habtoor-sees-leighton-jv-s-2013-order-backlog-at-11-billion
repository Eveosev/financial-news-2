Billionaire Khalaf Al Habtoor said
Al Habtoor Leighton Group, the construction joint venture in
which he’s minority shareholder, expects its order backlog to be
at least 40 billion dirhams ($11 billion) next year.  The Dubai-based builder controlled by  Leighton Holdings
Ltd. (LEI) , Australia’s biggest construction company, is seeing
increased demand for building across the  Middle East , Al
Habtoor, who owns 27.5 percent of the company, said in an
interview. He didn’t provide comparative figures for past years.  “They have started seeing an increase in the number of
contracts,” Al Habtoor said. “They have some in Qatar,  Abu
Dhabi , Dubai,  Saudi Arabia  and Iraq.”  Builders in the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu
Dhabi and Dubai, are searching for work in other markets after
the 2008 global financial crisis halted about $757 billion of
projects, Citigroup said in an Oct. 16 report. Dubai real Estate
values fell more than 65 percent in the following year. Leighton
Group, which is building the Paris Sorbonne University campus in
Abu Dhabi, is also building a $1.3 billion hotel complex owned
by the billionaire with more than 1,600 rooms, tennis courts and
a theater.  “We are not prepared to make a forecast at this time,”
Justin Grogan, a Leighton Group spokesman, said by phone from
Sydney when asked about the joint venture’s prospects for 2013.
The company may include a 2013 forecast in its full-year results
to be released in February, he said. Al Habtoor and Leighton
Group started their joint venture in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
