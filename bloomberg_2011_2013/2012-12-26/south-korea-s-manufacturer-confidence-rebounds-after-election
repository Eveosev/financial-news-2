South Korean manufacturers’
confidence rebounded from the lowest level in more than three
years following the nation’s presidential election.  An  index  measuring expectations for January increased to 70
from 67 for December, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in
 Seoul  today. A reading below 100 indicates that pessimists
outnumber optimists.  The ruling New Frontier Party’s Park Geun Hye won the Dec.
19 election to replace  Lee Myung Bak , whose five-year term ends
in February.  A measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing companies 
also increased to 68 from 65, today’s report showed. The survey
was conducted between Dec. 12 and Dec. 20 with responses from
1,453 manufacturers and 1,048 non-manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
