Oil rose in New York for the first
time in three days as President  Barack Obama  and the U.S.
Congress prepared to assemble to discuss a budget solution to
meet a year-end deadline.  Prices gained as much as 0.7 percent before Democrats and
Republicans plan to convene tomorrow for talks aimed at avoiding
more than $600 billion in tax gains and spending cuts, known as
the fiscal cliff, which are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
U.S.  crude stockpiles  probably fell last week to the lowest in
10 weeks as refineries kept utilization at a high rate and
imports decreased, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “The oil market’s movement depends on the fiscal cliff but
I don’t think it will lose ground,” said  Ken Hasegawa , an
energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo. “In a worst-
case scenario the situation may continue as it is now for one
month or a few months.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery climbed
as much as 60 cents to $89.21 a barrel in electronic trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $89.07 at 4:33 p.m.
in Tokyo. Futures slid 5 cents to $88.61 on Dec. 24. Prices have
lost 9.9 percent this year.  The volume for all WTI contracts was down 72 percent from
the 100-day average. There was no floor or electronic trading
yesterday because of the Christmas holiday.  Brent oil for February settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange advanced as much as 60 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $109.40 a barrel. The number of contracts trading
was 61 percent lower than the 100-day average. The European
benchmark crude was at a premium of $20.32 to WTI after closing
at $20.29 on Dec. 24.  Obama Returns  Japan ’s yen slumped to its lowest level since April 2011
and is set for a 3.3 percent decline in December. The currency’s
advance to a postwar high last year had eroded the
competitiveness of Japan’s exporters and contributed to concern
the nation’s manufacturing is hollowing out. The country is the
world’s third-largest crude user.  “The Japanese yen has now exceeded about 85 per dollar for
the first time in almost 20 months,” Hasegawa said. “That may
also be a factor pushing oil markets.”  President Obama plans to leave his Hawaii vacation and
return to  Washington  for the budget talks tomorrow, according to
a White House aide who asked not to be identified. Congress will
return the same day to continue negotiations on averting the
fiscal cliff.  A failure to reach an agreement on the budget plan would
push the U.S. into recession for the first half of 2013, the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said. The country is
the world’s biggest oil user.  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude inventories fell 1.7 million barrels, or 0.5
percent, in the week ended Dec. 21 to 370 million, the lowest
since Oct. 12, according to the median estimate of nine analysts
surveyed before an Energy Department report this week.  Gasoline  stockpiles  probably rose 700,000 barrels, or 0.3
percent, to 220 million, the Bloomberg survey shows. Supplies
gained 2.21 million the previous week to 219.3 million barrels.  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, probably decreased 1 million barrels to
116 million, according to the median of responses. Supplies
declined 1.09 million barrels the previous week.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 11 a.m. on Dec. 28 in Washington, two days later than
usual due to the Christmas holiday. The industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute will publish separate data tomorrow.  2012 Drop  WTI has fallen in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened the
glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s largest storage hub and the
delivery point for New York futures. That has left it at an
average discount of $17.45 a barrel to Brent this year, compared
with a premium of about 7 cents in the five years through 2010.
Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s crude,
has climbed 1.9 percent this year.  Oil is rebounding in New York today as a technical
formation signals selling pressure has ceased after the 1.6
percent drop on Dec. 21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures on Dec. 24 closed 1 cent a barrel above the
opening price, creating a cross-shaped candlestick known as a
“doji.” This formation typically indicates prices will change
direction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
