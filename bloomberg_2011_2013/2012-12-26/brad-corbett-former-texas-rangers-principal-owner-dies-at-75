Brad Corbett, the  Texas Rangers ’
principal owner from 1974 through 1980, has died. He was 75.  The Major League Baseball team said Corbett died on Dec.
24. It gave no details.  During Corbett’s ownership, the Rangers produced their
first four winning seasons and finished second three times in
the American League West. The team’s 94 victories in 1977 were
the most in its history until 1999.  “The spirit in which Mr. Corbett served as owner of the
Rangers will be remembered always,” the team said in a
 statement  on its website.  Corbett moved from Long Island,  New York , to  Fort
Worth , Texas, in 1968. He turned a $300,000 loan from the  Small
Business Administration  into millions in the plastic-piping and
chemical-tubing business, according to t he Dallas Morning News .  In 1974, Corbett formed a group of local investors and
bought the Rangers from Bob Short two days before the start of
the season for $9.6 million and $1 million in assumed debt.  Corbett wanted to build a winner fast, and was known for
trading promising young talent for veterans and for employing
four managers in a span of eight games, the Morning News said.  He sold the team to a group led by oilman Eddie Chiles in
1980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
