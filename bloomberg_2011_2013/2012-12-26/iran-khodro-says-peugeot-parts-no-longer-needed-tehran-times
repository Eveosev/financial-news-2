Iran Khodro Co., the country’s
largest carmaker, can manufacture all automobile parts that  PSA
Peugeot Citroen (UG)  used to supply,  Tehran Times  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Javad Najmeddin.  Iran Khodro  can construct parts for its  Peugeot 206  and
 Runna  passenger cars without backing from the French company,
Najmeddin said.  PSA Peugeot Citroen suspended sales of car assembly kits to
Iran in February, local reports said on July 31.  Energy, trade and financial sanctions imposed by the
European Union, U.S. and  United Nations  over Iran’s nuclear
program have limited international companies’ involvements with
the Persian Gulf nation. Iran rejects western accusations that
its nuclear activities may be aimed at developing atomic weapons
and maintains the program is needed for power generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
