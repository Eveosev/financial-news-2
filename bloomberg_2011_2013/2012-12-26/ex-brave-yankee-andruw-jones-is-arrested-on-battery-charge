Former  Atlanta Braves  and New York
Yankees outfielder  Andruw Jones  was released on bond after being
arrested on a battery count, according to Gwinnett County jail
records.  Jones, who won 10 consecutive Gold Glove awards while
playing with the Braves from 1998 to 2007, was jailed after
police responded to a domestic-dispute call at his home in
Duluth, Georgia, at 1:30 a.m. yesterday, according to the
Associated Press.  Gwinnett County Detention Center  records  show that Jones
was  booked  into the jail at 3:48 a.m. and released at 11 a.m.,
charged with battery. Jail officials couldn’t immediately
confirm details of Jones’s arrest and police department
officials didn’t immediately return a telephone message seeking
additional information.  Jones, 35, hit 434 home runs over 17 Major League Baseball
seasons after beginning his  career  with Atlanta in 1996. He
spent the last two seasons with the Yankees, and a year each
with the  Los Angeles Dodgers ,  Texas Rangers  and Chicago White
Sox.  Jones signed a one-year contract to play with the Tohoku
Rakuten Golden Eagles of Japan’s Pacific League this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
