Lumber futures jumped to the highest
in seven years after U.S. home prices climbed more than forecast
in October, adding to signs of stabilization for the housing
market.  The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities
increased 4.3 percent from October 2011, the biggest 12-month
advance since May 2010, the group said today. The median
forecast of 30 economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a 4
percent gain. The average rate of housing starts from September
through November was the strongest since the three months ended
August 2008, the Commerce Department said last week.  “Housing starts are up fairly dramatically, and the
economy is picking up steam,” Neil E. Harl, an economist at
 Iowa State University , said in an e-mail. “There is a bit of
pent-up demand involved. Many lumber yards had undoubtedly let
their inventories drop with the downturn.”  Lumber futures for March delivery gained 3.8 percent to
$399 per 1,000 board feet at 1:39 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after touching $399.50, the highest since April 2005.  The CME increased the daily-trading limit to $15 after the
price gained by the maximum of $10 in the previous two sessions.  Residential homebuilding has contributed 0.3 percentage
point to gross domestic product on average in the first three
quarters of 2012, according to Commerce Department data. The
last time it added to growth for an entire year was in 2005,
when it boosted the economy by 0.36 point.  A typical U.S. home uses about 16,000 board feet of lumber.  To contact the reporters on this story:
