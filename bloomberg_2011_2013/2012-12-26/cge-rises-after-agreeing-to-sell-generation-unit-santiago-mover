Cia. General de Electricidad SA ,
owner of Chile’s second-largest power distributor, rose to an
eight-month high after agreeing to sell a generation unit for
more than analysts had expected.  CGE advanced 1.9 percent to 2,750 pesos at the close in
Santiago, the highest level since April 27. Chile’s benchmark
Ipsa index gained 0.2 percent.  The company agreed to sell its Iberoamericana de Energia
Ibener SA subsidiary to  Charlotte , North Carolina-based  Duke
Energy Corp. (DUK)  for $415 million, according to a statement today by
Duke. The purchase includes two hydropower plants and excludes
CGE’s water rights for new projects. Duke will assume  27.8
billion pesos ($58 million) of debt that CGE’s Enerplus SA unit
had with Ibener, according to a regulatory filing.  “It’s a good deal as the market was speculating that CGE
would get about $400 million for all of its generation assets,”
Alfredo Parra, an analyst at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA,
said in a phone interview from Santiago. “CGE also reduced debt
through the sale, so it can now give the money back as
dividends.”  CGE said in the filing with the country’s securities
regulator that it will continue to study strategic options for
Enerplus, which is developing a new hydroelectric power plant in
southern  Chile .  To contact the reporter on this story:
