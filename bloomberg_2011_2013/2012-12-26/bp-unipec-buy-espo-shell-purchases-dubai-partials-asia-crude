BP Plc (BP/)  and China International
United Petroleum & Chemical Co., known as Unipec, bought East
Siberia-Pacific Ocean, or ESPO, crude cargoes.  BP paid a premium of $5 a barrel to  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  for 100,000
metric tons of ESPO for Feb. 18 to Feb. 21 loading, according to
two people who participate in the market, asking not to be

Unipec paid a premium of $4.77 a barrel above benchmark Dubai
prices to TNK-BP for a similar sized cargo for Feb. 22 to Feb.
25 loading, according to two traders who participate in the
market, asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought two Dubai partial cargoes from
Phibro, a unit of  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , and Unipec,
