SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , a U.S solar
manufacturer mostly owned by Total SA, rose to the highest in
seven months amid a broader solar rally and year-end technical
factors.  SunPower, based in San Jose,  California , climbed 6.8
percent to $5.80 at the close in New York, the highest since May
7. The  NYSE-BNEF Global Solar Energy Index (NBGLSRDP)  gained 2 percent
today, the most since Dec. 14. The index has dropped 29 percent
this year as manufacturers faced falling prices and an
oversupply of panels.  “It looks like a continuation of the same ‘junk rally’
(particularly among Chinese solar stocks) that has been
intermittently visible throughout December,” Pavel Molchanov,
an analyst at Raymond James & Associates in Houston, said by e-
mail. Molchanov rates the stock underperform, or the equivalent
of sell.  Other analysts cited short-covering or other technical
factors in advance of the New Year’s holiday.  “People would rather cover their positions if they have
profit this year than wait around next year and maybe have to
pay higher taxes,” Ben Kallo, a San Francisco-based analyst at
Robert W. Baird & Co., said by telephone.  Kallo has a neutral, or hold, rating on SunPower and a
target price of $8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
