Thomas Joyce, the chief executive
officer of  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) , is poised to collect a
$7.5 million retention payment tied to Getco LLC’s acquisition
of the market-making firm, according to a government filing.  The bonus would be due when Getco, the Chicago-based high-
frequency trading firm, completes its purchase of Knight, based
on the Dec. 19 filing. The new company will be called KCG, for
Knight Capital Getco, and if the merger is terminated, Knight or
Getco may be required to pay the other party a $53 million fee,
the companies said.  Knight, which almost went bankrupt in August after a
trading error cost the  Jersey City , New Jersey-based company
more than $450 million, agreed to be taken over by Getco last
week. Joyce will be executive chairman of the combined company’s
board, while Getco CEO  Daniel Coleman  will be president and
chief executive of the new firm, based on a statement last week.  The new employment contract with Joyce will end when the
acquisition is finalized or the last day of 2014, whichever is
sooner, the filing said. The cash payment to Joyce is in lieu of
severance and benefits outlined in a previous agreement that was
due to expire at the end of this month.  The software that caused Knight’s trading malfunction was
called Power Peg and has been removed from its systems, the
company said in the filing. There is currently no pending or
“threatened investigation” by a government entity as a result
of the Aug. 1 trading mistake, the filing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
