Brazil’s real rallied the most in
the world as the central bank intervened to stem the currency’s
drop and contain inflation in  Latin America ’s biggest economy.  The real advanced to a six-week high as the central bank
sold $1.8 billion of currency swaps at two auctions and agreed
to lend as much as $2 billion in foreign-exchange credit lines.
Swap rates fell as speculation eased that policy makers will
boost the target lending rate, known as the Selic, to cap
consumer prices.  The currency jumped 1.5 percent to 2.0491 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in  Sao Paulo , the strongest since Nov. 9. The gain
was the biggest among all of the world’s currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The real pared its drop in 2012 to 8.9 percent after
falling on Nov. 30 to a three-year low of 2.1360. Swap rates on
the contract due in January 2014 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 7.14 percent today.  “The central bank aims to keep the real trading at around
2.05 in 2013,” Joao Paulo Correa, manager of foreign-exchange
trading at Correparti Corretora, said in a phone interview from
Curitiba, Brazil. “The swap auctions clearly show that its goal
is to avoid raising the Selic rate in 2013.”  The central bank sold 27,500 of 40,000 currency swaps at
its first auction today and 9,500 out of 40,000 at a second one,
strengthening the currency. The credit lines were offered to
help boost the supply of U.S. currency as Brazilian companies
send dollars abroad to balance their books at year-end.  Policy makers left the target lending  rate  at a record low
7.25 percent last month following 10 straight reductions to
support the economy.  Inflation Outlook  Brazil ’s IPCA index of consumer prices will rise 5.47
percent in 2013, according to the median forecast of about 100
economists in a Dec. 21 central bank survey published two days
ago, when markets were closed. The economists had projected an
increase of 5.42 percent a week earlier.  Annual inflation as measured by the IPCA gauge has exceeded
the 4.5 percent midpoint of the central bank’s target range for
27 months. Consumer prices rose 5.53 percent in November from a
year earlier, compared with an increase of 5.45 percent in the
prior month, the statistics agency reported Dec. 7.  The real gained on Dec. 20 after Carlos Hamilton, the
central bank’s director for economic policy, said a weaker
 exchange rate  has contributed to inflation. Policy makers
consider 2.05 per dollar as more “adequate” when creating
economic forecasts than 2.10, Hamilton said.  Central bankers have swung this year between selling
currency swaps to prevent the real from falling too quickly and
offering reverse currency swaps to protect exporters by keeping
the real from strengthening beyond 2 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
