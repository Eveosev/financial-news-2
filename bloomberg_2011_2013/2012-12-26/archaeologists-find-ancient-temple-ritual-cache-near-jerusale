An ancient temple and cache of
sacred vessels uncovered by Israeli archaeologists provides rare
evidence of rituals held outside  Jerusalem  about 2,700 years
ago,  Israel Antiquities Authority  said.  The cache includes fragments of chalices and pottery
figurines of heads with curling hair as well as harnessed
animals. It was found near a large structure with a wide east-
facing entrance that conforms to traditional temple construction
in the ancient Near East, the Authority said in an e-mailed
statement.  The finds are “evidence for the existence of temples and
ritual enclosures in the Kingdom of Judah in general and in the
Jerusalem region in particular, prior to religious reforms
throughout the kingdom at the end of the monarchic period which
abolished all ritual sites, concentrating practices solely at
the Temple in Jerusalem,” the Authority said.  The current excavation adds understanding to the site, west
of Jerusalem, that archaeologists have been investigating since
the early 1990s.  In the past, archaeologists proposed identifying the dig as
the biblical settlement “Mozah” that’s mentioned in the Book
of Joshua, in part due to the discovery of a building with
storehouses and silos that led them to believe the site was used
to store Jerusalem’s grain supplies.  “The find of the sacred structure, together with the
accompanying cache of sacred vessels, and especially the
significant coastal influence evident in the anthropomorphic
figurines, still require extensive research,” the Authority
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
