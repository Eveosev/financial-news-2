Cotton futures rose to a nine-week
high as exports surged from the U.S., the world’s biggest
shipper. Sugar and coffee advanced, while cocoa and orange juice
fell.  In the four weeks that ended Dec. 13, U.S. export sales of
upland cotton soared sixfold from a year earlier, Department of
Agriculture data showed on Dec. 20. Cotlook Ltd., the publisher
of a benchmark price index, raised its forecast for global
consumption, citing increases in countries including  India .  “Export sales are humming along, continuing at a good
pace,” Gary Raines, an economist at FCStone Fibers and Textiles
in Nashville,  Tennessee , said in a telephone interview.  Cotton for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to 76.72
cents a pound at 11:43 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached 76.73 cents, the highest for a most-
active contract since Oct. 23.  Through Dec. 24, the fiber dropped 17 percent this year as
global inventories expanded. Yesterday, the market was closed
for a holiday.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
19.15 cents a pound on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 1.1
percent to $1.4855 a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$2,265 a metric ton. The price headed for the seventh straight
decline, the longest slump in a year.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$1.3215 a pound. The commodity headed for the fourth consecutive
drop, the longest slump in seven weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
