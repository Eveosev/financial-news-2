SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC)  acquired
800 wireless towers in Brazil from  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s Vivo SA
division for 362.8 million reais ($178 million), letting it
begin operating in the country.  The towers were purchased using cash on hand and the
company’s revolving credit line, SBA said today in a statement.
The assets are expected to produce about 19 million to 23
million reais in cash flow next year, the company said.  Tower companies, which make money by leasing antenna space
to carriers, have been taking advantage of favorable borrowing
conditions -- low interest rates and access to capital -- to
ramp up acquisitions in the U.S. and abroad.  SBA shares  have
increased 64 percent this year, part of an industrywide surge in
valuations.  “It’s such a great recurring cash flow story, and these
companies are great derivative plays on the growth of wireless
demand,”  Paul Sweeney , an analyst at Bloomberg Industries, said
in an interview.  SBA, based in Boca Raton, Florida, is the third-biggest
publicly traded cellular-tower company by market valuation,
behind  American Tower Corp. (AMT)  and  Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI)   SBA  fell 0.5 percent  to $70.42 at the close in New York.
American depositary receipts of Telefonica, down 20 percent this
year,  rose 0.5 percent  to $13.40 today.  The latest acquisition provides SBA with a national
footprint of “high quality towers, including leasing
arrangements with all of the major broadband wireless
providers,” Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Stoops said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
