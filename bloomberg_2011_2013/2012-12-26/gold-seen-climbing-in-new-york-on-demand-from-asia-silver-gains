Gold futures rose in  New York  on
speculation that Japan’s new government will act to bolster the
economy.  Japan’s premier Shinzo Abe said today his government’s
mission is to restore a strong economy. Minutes of the  Bank of
Japan (8301) ’s November meeting showed that a board member suggested
conducting open-ended asset purchases. Gold prices, up 6 percent
this year, are headed for a 12th straight annual gain as
governments and central banks in Japan,  Europe  and the U.S.
boosted measures to shore up growth.  “News about Japan planning to announce some stimulus
measures is perking up the market,” Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “We may see some sharp moves in this very thinly-
traded market.”  Gold futures for February delivery gained 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,660.70 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The exchange was closed yesterday for the Christmas
holiday.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$30.035 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery added 10 cents to $1,539 an ounce. Palladium
