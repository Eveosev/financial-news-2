Tradewinds (Malaysia) Bhd. (TWI) , a palm
oil and rice producer, advanced the most in more than five years
in Kuala Lumpur stock trading after receiving a takeover offer
from companies linked to billionaire Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary.  The stock  surged  15 percent to 8.88 ringgit at 11:18 a.m.
local time, poised for its steepest rise since June 22, 2007.
It’s the biggest gainer today in the  FTSE Bursa Malaysia Top 100
Index (FBM100) , which added 0.1 percent. Today’s jump pares Tradewinds
 Malaysia ’s loss this year to 12 percent, compared with a 9.2
percent gain in the benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index. (FBMKLCI)   Perspective Lane (M) Sdn., Kelana Ventures Sdn., Seaport
Terminal (Johore) Sdn. and Acara Kreatif Sdn., which
collectively own 45.1 percent of Kuala Lumpur-based Tradewinds
Malaysia, jointly offered 9.30 ringgit a share for the rest of
the company they don’t already own, according to a stock
exchange filing on Dec. 24. That’s 20 percent more than the
last-traded price of 7.75 ringgit on Dec. 21, before trading was
halted for the announcement.  “The offer price is attractive,” Ang Kok Heng, who
manages the equivalent of $425 million as chief investment
officer at Phillip Capital Management Sdn., said by phone in
Kuala Lumpur today. “Investors can cash out and use the money
to invest in other plantation stocks.”  Compulsory Buyout  Syed Mokhtar, 61, controls  DRB-Hicom Bhd. (DRB)  and is Southeast
Asian nation’s seventh richest man, with assets totaling $3.3
billion, according to a Forbes magazine ranking in March.  Tradewinds Malaysia, through its  Tradewinds Plantation Bhd. (TWPB) 
unit, manages 126,985 hectares of oil-palm plantation in the
country, according to its website. It also owns 73 percent of
 Padiberas Nasional Bhd. (PNL) , which supplies 45 percent of the
nation’s rice, data from the website show.  Under Malaysian law, the buyers will be required to
purchase subsidiaries Tradewinds Plantation and Padiberas
Nasional if they raise their stake in Tradewinds Malaysia by
more than 2 percent over a six-month period, according to the
statement.  They would offer 4.03 ringgit per share for Tradewinds
Plantation, lower than the pre-suspension price of 4.23 ringgit,
and 3.25 ringgit apiece for Padiberas, which last traded at 3.31
ringgit on Dec. 21.  Tradewinds Plantation slid 6.2 percent to 3.97 ringgit
today, poised for its steepest decline since May 17, while
Padiberas dropped 1.5 percent to 3.26 ringgit, the biggest drop
in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
