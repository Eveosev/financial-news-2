Russian (INDEXCF)  equities increased for the
second day as crude oil climbed while U.S. lawmakers prepared
for talks to avert spending cuts and tax increases that threaten
the economy of the world’s biggest crude consumer.  The 50-stock Micex Index added 0.3 percent to 1,478.61 by
the close in Moscow, with 37 stocks climbing, one little changed
and 12 dropping. The gauge has added 5.5 percent this year. OAO
Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, advanced 1.3 percent.
The stock has the  fourth-largest weighting  in the index at 6.1
percent. Preferred shares of oil producer OAO Surgutneftegas
rose 0.7 percent.  Crude oil rallied 2.6 percent to $90.95 in New York. Russia
receives about half of its budget revenue from the oil and gas
industry. Democrats and Republicans plan to convene tomorrow for
talks aimed at avoiding more than $600 billion in tax gains and
spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, which are scheduled to
take effect Jan. 1. European markets remained closed today for
Christmas holidays, while U.S. markets opened.  Investors in  Russia  have “no incentive to trade actively
before there is more clarity on the fiscal cliff in the U.S.,”
Slava Smolyaninov, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said in an e-
mailed report before the close of trading in Moscow.  The amount of shares traded on the gauge was 58 percent
below the 10-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Failure to reach an agreement would push the U.S.
into recession for the first half of 2013, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office has said.  Uralkali Climbs  Russian markets’ last day of trading this year is Dec. 28
before closing for New Year and Christmas holidays in the first
week of 2013. Trading resumes Jan. 8.  Industrial shares  added 1.2 percent on average, the biggest
gainers among nine sector groups on the Micex. Consumer,
telecommunications and oil and gas shares gained 0.5 percent on
average.  OAO Uralkali, the largest potash producer by output, rose
0.8 percent to 237.03 rubles. Based on suggestions from the
Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, the company will price domestic
potash at a level not exceeding the minimum export contract
price, Uralkali said in a statement today. The amount of shares
traded was 1 million, equivalent to about 41 percent of the
three-month average.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$) , Russia’s dollar-denominated equity gauge,
increased 0.8 percent to 1,526.34. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
stocks (RUS14BN)  measure dropped 0.5 percent to 97.02 on Dec. 24.  The Micex trades at about 5.4 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with a multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index, which has gained 14 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
