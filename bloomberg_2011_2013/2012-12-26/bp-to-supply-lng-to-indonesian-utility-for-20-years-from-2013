BP Plc (BP/)  signed an agreement to supply
liquefied natural gas from its Tangguh plant in Indonesia to the
country’s state-owned electric utility PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara for 20 years.  BP will provide a total of 23.96 million metric tons of
LNG, or the equivalent of 28 cargoes, during the contract to
Listrik Negara starting in 2013, Johanes Widjonarko, deputy
chairman at Indonesia’s interim energy regulator SKMigas, said
in Jakarta today. The fuel will be supplied through a floating
storage and regasification unit in West Java, the agency said in
a separate statement.  “The LNG will be sourced initially from Tangguh’s existing
trains and then from its expansion project with the startup of
Train-3,” William Lin, BP’s Regional President for Asia-
Pacific, said in an e-mailed statement.  The Tangguh plant in  Indonesia ’s West Papua province has
two LNG production lines, known as trains, which can produce at
least 7.6 million tons a year, according to BP’s  website . BP and
its partners plan to build a third facility with a capacity of
3.8 million tons a year which may start operating in 2018, the
company said on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
