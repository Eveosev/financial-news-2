India ’s 10-year bonds rose, sending
the yield to the lowest level since July, on optimism debt
purchases by the central bank will boost demand. The rupee fell.  The Reserve Bank of India will offer to buy as much as 80
billion rupees ($1.5 billion) of notes due in 2017, 2022 and
2027 at an open-market auction on Dec. 28, according to a Dec.
24  statement  on its website. The RBI resumed such purchases this
month to release funds into the financial system and help ease a
cash squeeze. Local lenders borrowed an  average  1.6 trillion
rupees a day from the central bank last week to meet shortages,
compared with 909 billion rupees in the previous five days,
official figures show.  “The continuation of open-market purchases is supporting
bonds,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “Debt buying by the RBI
is helping keep the liquidity crunch under check.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.12 percent as of
10:20 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level since July 27. The yield has
dropped 45 basis points this year.  Indian sovereign bonds returned 10.3 percent in 2012, the
best performance after Indonesian notes among Asia’s 10 biggest
local-currency debt markets tracked by by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.64 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rupee Declines  The rupee weakened as concern stalled U.S. budget talks
will hamper efforts to revive the global economy reduced demand
for emerging-market assets. Congress will return tomorrow to
resume negotiations aimed at averting more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts, due early next year,
that would hurt the world’s largest economy.  The rupee fell 0.1 percent to 55.015 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It lost 3.5 percent
this year, the worst performance after  Indonesia ’s rupiah among
the 10 most-used Asian currencies excluding the yen.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 10.10
percent. The rate has decreased 190 basis points in 2012.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.97 per
dollar, compared with 55.90 on Dec. 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.88 versus 55.79. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
