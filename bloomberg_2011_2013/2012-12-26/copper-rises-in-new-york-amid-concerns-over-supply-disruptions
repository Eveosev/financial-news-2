Copper capped the biggest gain in
almost four weeks after workers rejected a wage proposal at  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida mine, the world’s biggest source of
the metal.  Plant and mine-shift workers “unanimously” rejected the
proposal on Dec. 22, according to their union. A failure to
reach an agreement may strain world supplies next year as
workers can legally go on strike once the deadline for
compulsory negotiations expires on July 31.  Chile  is the largest
copper-mining nation. Prices are up 4.7 percent this year.  “Any negative headlines from Chile will push investors in
just one direction, higher copper prices,” Nikolay Sosnovsky,
an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, said by telephone. “If
there’s a strike, financial investors will take it positively
because production problems will push contract prices up.”  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 1.5 percent to
settle at $3.5975 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest gain since Nov. 29. The exchange was closed
yesterday for the Christmas holiday.  The London Metal Exchange, which accounts for more than 80
percent of global metals trading, is closed for Boxing Day.  BHP’s Escondida mine accounts for about 6 percent of the
world’s mined copper supply. The mine’s workers went on a two-
week strike last year in a protest over bonus payments and
working conditions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
