Thailand ’s export growth quickened
to a 15-month high in November as factories returned to full
capacity after last year’s floods and global demand improved.  Overseas sales  rose 26.9 percent last month from a year
earlier after climbing a previously reported 15.6 percent in
October, the Ministry of Commerce said in Bangkok today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was
26.4 percent.  Signs that the global economy is strengthening have
brightened the outlook for Asian exporters. Thailand’s monetary
authority last month held the  benchmark interest rate  and
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul has said shipments of items from
rice to electronics are expected to recover in the first half of
next year and “really grow” in the second half.  “Signs of improvement in the global economy lately will
ensure export growth next year,”  Pimonwan Mahujchariyawong , an
economist at Kasikorn Research Co. in Bangkok, said before the
report. “We expect the central bank to stand pat from now
unless the global economy takes an unexpected dive.”  Imports rose 24.5 percent from a year earlier for a  trade
deficit  of $1.45 billion, compared with a shortfall of $2.47
billion reported earlier for October, today’s report showed.  The commerce ministry earlier said it expects export growth
of as much as 9 percent next year from 4.17 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
