Chile ’s peso rose as workers at the
world’s biggest copper mine rejected a pay deal, sending prices
for the metal that is the country’s biggest export to a four-
week high.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 478.65 per dollar as
of 1:08 p.m. in Santiago. It earlier weakened 0.1 percent to
479.9 per dollar. Copper for March delivery rose 1.3 percent to
$3.59 a pound on the Comex in New York.  The metal, which makes up more than half of Chile’s
exports, rose after workers at  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida
mine rejected a wage proposal on Dec. 22. A failure to reach an
agreement may strain world supplies next year as workers can
legally go on strike once the deadline for compulsory
negotiations expires on July 31.  The peso has climbed 8.5 percent this year, the best
performance among the six most-traded Latin American currencies
after the Colombian peso’s 9.4 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
