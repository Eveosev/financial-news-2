Japanese stocks rose, with the  Topix
Index (TPX)  and the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  at their highest in nine
months, as the yen weakened as Shinzo Abe, who has promised to
do more to spur inflation, was approved as prime minister.  Panasonic Corp., the maker of Viera televisions, led an
advance by electronics companies as the yen fell to its lowest
level in 20 months. Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest
brokerage, advanced for a 10th day amid optimism for the new
government. Hitachi Ltd. rose 2.1 percent after its president
said the company plans to double its operating margin. Touei
Housing Corp. jumped 25 percent after saying it will merge with
other developers to counter rising competition.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.5 percent to
10,230.36, its highest since March 27. The Topix rose 1.2
percent to 847.71 at the close of trading in  Tokyo , its highest
level since April 3. About three stocks advanced for every one
that fell on the gauge. The measure has gained about 5.8 percent
since Dec. 16 when the  Liberal Democratic Party  won the general
election, boosting optimism that Japan’s leaders will do more to
fight deflation and bolster the economy.  “I think the market will keep a strong momentum,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of about 1.79 trillion yen
($21 billion). “The market focus will switch to what measures
they will actually introduce and how much impact they can make,
after stocks rose on expectations. The market will edge up from
the current level if they meet expectations.”  The Topix is headed for a 16 percent increase this year,
its biggest yearly gain since 2005, when the index surged 44
percent. The measure traded at 1 times  book value , compared with
2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can
be bought for less than the value of their assets.  New Leader  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day  relative strength index , a measure
of price momentum, is at 75.94 today after reaching as high at
84.97 on Dec. 19, the highest since 2005, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Some traders use a measure above 70 as a
sign the market is overbought.  LDP leader Abe was approved as the prime minister today by
the lower house, returning him to the office he left in 2007.
His party has reached an accord with coalition ally Natsuo
Yamaguchi of the New Komeito Party yesterday on a policy package
that includes “bold monetary easing” to reach an inflation
target of 2 percent.  Financial shares gained, with the Topix’s sub-indexes for
 banks ,  brokerages  and  consumer lenders  rising on optimism the
new government will help with borrowing demand and investment.  Nomura gained 2.8 percent to 471 yen, its 10th consecutive
day of increases. That’s the longest winning streak since 2003.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank, rose
0.7 percent to 449 yen. Credit Saison Co., a consumer credit
lender, advanced 6.9 percent to 2,101 yen.  ‘Beef Up’  “Market expectations are on the rise for the new
government as it beefs up efforts to beat deflation and revive
the economy,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Panasonic gained 2.8 percent to 510 yen, while  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
which gets about 19 percent of its revenue from the U.S.,
advanced 4 percent to 943 yen. Mazda Motor Corp., the automaker
which counts  North America  as its biggest market, rose 3.3
percent to 155 yen.  The yen weakened past 85 per dollar for the first time
since April 2011 today and is set for a 3.4 percent decline in
December, boosting exporter shares. A weaker currency boosts
overseas earnings when repatriated.  Condo Builders  Among other stocks that rose today, Hitachi gained 2.1
percent to 494 yen. Hitachi President Hiroaki Nakanishi said
yesterday that the company will aim to double its operating
margin to 10 percent or more eventually. The company is also
still in talks with  Lithuania  for a plan to build a nuclear
power plant there, he said.  Condominium builders Touei Housing Corp. jumped 25 percent
to 1,292 and Arnest One Corp. surged 24 percent to 1,492 yen
after announcing plans to merge with four other developers to
counter rising competition and declining demand. The companies
will merge under a holding company by November 2013, they said
in a joint statement yesterday. Touei and Arnest One were the
third and fourth  biggest gainers  on the Topix.  Volume on the Topix was about 24 percent above the 30-day
average, while on the Nikkei 225 it was up 17 percent. Some
Asian stock markets including  Hong Kong ,  Australia  and  New
Zealand  are closed for holidays today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
