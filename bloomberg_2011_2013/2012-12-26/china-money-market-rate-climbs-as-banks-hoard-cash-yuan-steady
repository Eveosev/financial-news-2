China ’s money-market rate climbed
for a second day on speculation banks are hoarding cash to meet
year-end  capital requirements  and holiday withdrawals. The yuan
was little changed.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand today for seven-
and 14-day reverse-repurchase contract operations tomorrow,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. It
 injected  110 billion yuan ($17.6 billion) yesterday by offering
28-day reverse repos.  “Year-end need is pushing up the rates,” said Liu Junyu,
a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “But the increase will soon stop
after the year-end passes.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, rose nine basis points to 3.81 percent as
of 4:40 p.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It has
dropped 179 basis points this year.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed two
basis points to 3.36 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.24
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  The  yuan  traded at 6.2353 per dollar, compared with 6.2339
yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The central bank weakened the  reference rate  by 0.02 percent to
6.2943, the lowest level since Nov. 19. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, was unchanged 1.85 percent.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.07 percent to
6.3365 per dollar, a 1.6 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Hong Kong’s
offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.1 percent to 6.2315.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
