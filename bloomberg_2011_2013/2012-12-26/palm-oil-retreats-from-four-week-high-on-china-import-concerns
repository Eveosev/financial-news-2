Palm oil  retreated from the highest
level in a month as data showing gains in exports from Malaysia
were countered by concerns shipments to China, the world’s
biggest cooking oil buyer, may decrease.  The contract for March delivery was little changed at 2,427
ringgit ($790) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
at the midday break after climbing to 2,440 ringgit, the highest
price for the most-active contract since Nov. 27. Futures rose
5.9 percent last week and have lost 24 percent this year.  Export from Malaysia, the largest shipper after Indonesia,
gained 0.5 percent in the first 25 days of December to 1.28
million tons, surveyor Intertek said today. Imports by  China  may
fall in the beginning of 2013 as the country enforces the
national food-safety standards on shipments starting Jan. 1,
researcher Grain.gov.cn said in an e-mailed report.  “This may actually slow down exports to China early next
year,” Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options at OSK
Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone today.  China’s palm oil imports may fall to 750,000 tons in
January through February, compared with a total of 1.35 million
tons in November through December, when buyers boosted purchases
to avoid potential restrictions, Grain.gov.cn said.  Production in Indonesia may rise to 27.05 million tons in
2013 from an estimated 23.52 million tons this year, Agriculture
Minister Suswono said in Jakarta today.  Palm oil for May delivery was little changed at 6,868  yuan 
($1,101) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean oil  for
May lost 0.2 percent to 8,582 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
