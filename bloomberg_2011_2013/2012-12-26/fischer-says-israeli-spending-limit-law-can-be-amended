Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer said the law limiting the yearly increase in government
spending can be amended and this is better than raising the
deficit next year.  It’s preferable for the government to keep spending within
the current limit, raise taxes and maintain the deficit below 3
percent of gross domestic product, though it may not be
politically possible to do so, Fischer said. If the government
is forced to choose, it should raise the spending limit instead
of increasing the deficit, he said.  “Is this an excellent idea?” Fischer, 69, said at a Bank
of Israel conference in  Jerusalem . “No, but the Finance
Ministry and the politicians need to draft a budget.”  Fischer has been calling on the government to rein in the
budget deficit, which he said will reach about 4.2 percent of
GDP this year, more than double the original plan. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called early elections, scheduled
for Jan. 22, citing opposition from partners in the coalition
government to his budget plan.  Fischer said that the government has made commitments for
next year that amount to a 10 percent increase in spending,
double the increase permitted under the current fiscal rule.
Israel’s security situation has worsened considerably, and this
also needs to be taken into account, he said.  “To convince people in a democracy to get less than they
want to get isn’t easy,” said Fischer. “This is the work of
politicians, and it isn’t work that I would consider pleasant,
but someone has to do it, and they volunteered.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
