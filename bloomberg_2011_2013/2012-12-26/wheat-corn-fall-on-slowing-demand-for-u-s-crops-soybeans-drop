Wheat futures fell to a five-month
low and corn dropped the most in a week after a government
report showed slowing overseas demand for supplies from the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Soybeans declined.  Shipments of  wheat  inspected for exports slumped 9.1
percent to 15.128 million bushels in the week ended Dec. 20, the
lowest for the period since 2009, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a  report . Corn-export  inspections 
dropped 66 percent from a year earlier to 13.475 million
bushels, the USDA said. Since Sept. 1, shipments of the grain
have tumbled 53 percent from a year earlier.  “The lack of export demand is dragging down the corn and
wheat markets,”  Tim Hannagan , a grain specialist for Alpari US
LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Demand is
declining.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 2.4 percent to close
at $7.745 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade after
touching $7.7375, the lowest since July 2. Still, the grain has
climbed 19 percent this year. The exchange was closed yesterday
for the Christmas holiday.  Corn futures for March delivery dropped 1.6 percent to
$6.9325 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest decline since Dec. 19.
Most-active futures touched $6.875 on Dec. 20, the lowest since
July 11. The grain has risen 7.2 percent this year after the
worst U.S. drought in 70 years cut production 13 percent.  Soybean futures for March delivery declined 1.2 percent to
$14.185 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed has gained 17 percent
this year after drought reduced U.S. production for a third
straight season.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4
billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
