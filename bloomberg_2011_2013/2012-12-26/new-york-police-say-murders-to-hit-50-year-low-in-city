Murders in  New York  City have
dropped 19 percent in 2012 from last year and are set to mark
the lowest total in 50 years, police said.  There were 414 murders through Dec. 23, beating the
previous low of 471 reached in 2009,  Paul Browne , a spokesman
for the New York City Police Department, said today.  Barring a sudden spike in violence in the last week of the
year, 2012 will mark the lowest murder total during the last 50
years that reliable comparisons can be made, Browne said.  “We’re going to try to keep it low and not view it as an
aberration,” he said.  Browne attributed the drop to the police department’s focus
on violent crimes and guns and the deployment of officers to
areas experiencing shootings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
