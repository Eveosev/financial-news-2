Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) ’s mine and
smelter operations are operating normally after workers ended a

Toquepala copper mines and Ilo smelter participated in the Dec.
24-25 strike, said human resources director Alberto Giles in a
telephone interview today. Giles said he didn’t have any
information about the effect of the work stoppage on copper
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
