Asia ’s naphtha crack spread widened
for a fourth day, signaling increased profit for refiners. Hin
Leong Trading Pte sold gasoil at a discount in Singapore, the
region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $4.23 to $121.53 a metric ton at 5:23 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is
the longest rising streak for the crack spread, a measure of the
profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline feedstock,
since Sept. 26.  Vitol Group sold 25,000 tons of open-specification naphtha
for second-half February delivery to Cargill Inc. at $962 a ton,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored
the Platts window.  Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. sold two 50,000-barrel cargoes of
92-RON gasoline in  Singapore , the survey showed. Phillips 66
bought one shipment loading Jan. 15 to Jan. 19 at $117.40 a
barrel. PetroChina Co. purchased for Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 at
$117.80.  PetroChina,  China ’s biggest oil company, sold 50,000
barrels of 95-RON grade motor fuel, loading Jan. 13 to Jan. 17,
to Arcadia at $120.40 a barrel, the survey showed.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
500 parts-per-million of sulfur to Vitol Group for Jan. 21 to
Jan. 25 loading, according to the Bloomberg survey. The cargo
changed hands at a discount of 20 cents a barrel to benchmark
quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 52
cents to $19.74 a barrel at 2:08 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack
spread , a gauge of processing profit, is the narrowest in a
week.  Jet fuel  climbed 8 cents to a  premium  of 5 cents a barrel
to gasoil, PVM said. A positive regrade indicates it is more
profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 38 cents to
$8.26 a barrel at 2:08 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This crack spread widened for the sixth time in seven days,
indicating higher losses for refiners producing residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a sixth day at
$10.25 a ton, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Tenders  Korea East-West Power Co. bought two 50,000-ton cargoes of
fuel oil from Mercuria Energy Trading SA for January delivery to
Ulsan, said an official who asked not to be identified because
of company policy.  Korea Western Power Co. sought to buy two 30,000-ton
cargoes of  fuel oil  for second-half January delivery, according
to a statement on the utility’s website dated Dec. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
