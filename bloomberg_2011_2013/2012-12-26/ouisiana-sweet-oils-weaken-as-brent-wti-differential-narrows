Gulf Coast oil grades weakened as
the discount for West Texas Intermediate oil versus Brent crude
narrowed.  The discount for February West Texas Intermediate oil
versus Brent narrowed 10 cents to $20.09 a barrel in New York.
When Brent loses versus WTI, it typically weakens the value of
U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils priced against the
European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to benchmark West Texas
Intermediate narrowed $2.45 to $18.55 a barrel at 2 p.m. New
York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light
Louisiana Sweet lost $1.90 to $19.60 a barrel over WTI.  The premium for Mars Blend to WTI narrowed 20 cents to
$14.30 a barrel. Southern Green Canyon added $2 to $14.50 a
barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse dropped $1.50 to a $16.50-a-barrel premium to
the U.S. benchmark. Poseidon’s premium to WTI narrowed 30 cents
to $14.45 a barrel.  The discount for West Texas Sour to WTI widened 50 cents to
$17 a barrel.  Canadian crudes were unchanged, with Western Canada Select
at a $34-a-barrel discount to WTI and Syncrude holding at 50
cents above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
