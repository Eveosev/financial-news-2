All-Star relief pitcher Joel Hanrahan was traded to the Boston  Red Sox  from the Pittsburgh
Pirates in a six-player deal.  The Pirates get pitchers Mark Melancon and Stolmy Pimentel,
infielder Ivan De Jesus and first baseman-outfielder Jerry Sands
in exchange for Hanrahan and infielder Brock Holt, the Red Sox
said in a news release.  Hanrahan, 31, was a Major League Baseball All-Star pick the
last two seasons. In that span, he recorded 76 saves and a 2.24
earned-run average, fourth among National League relievers.  The Red Sox also announced the signing of shortstop Stephen Drew to a one-year contract. Financial terms werenâ€™t disclosed
in a news release from the team, with the Boston Globe reporting
the deal is worth $9.5 million.  Drew, 29, batted .223 last season, splitting time with
 Arizona  and Oakland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
