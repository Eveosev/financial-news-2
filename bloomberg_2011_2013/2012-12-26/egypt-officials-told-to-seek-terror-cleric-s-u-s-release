An Egyptian administrative court
ordered the Foreign Ministry to seek the release of convicted
terrorist cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman from a U.S. prison, the
state-run Ahram Gate website reported today.  Abdel-Rahman, known as the blind sheik, is serving a life
sentence in the U.S. after being convicted in 1995 of
participating in a failed 1993 plot to blow up the World Trade
Center and other  New York  City landmarks.  In its ruling, the Egyptian court said the ministry had
taken no steps to date to secure Abdel-Rahman’s U.S. release on
grounds of his deteriorating health, based on reports submitted
by his family.  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi has said he would seek
Abdel-Rahman’s release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
