Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister
Faysal Mikdad will meet in Moscow tomorrow with Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov  to discuss a resolution of the 21-month
conflict in the Middle Eastern country.  In a sign of the growing pressure on the Damascus regime, a
high-ranking Syrian military officer said he has joined the
opposition, according to  Al Arabiya  TV.  Major General Abdul Aziz Jassem al-Shallal, chief of the
military police in  Syria , announced his resignation in a video,
according to Al Arabiya’s  website .  “I declare my defection from the regime’s army because of
its deviation of its fundamental mission to protect the nation
and transformation into gangs of killing and destruction,” the
general said in the video according to Al Arabiya.  Shallal was speaking from the Turkish-Syrian border,
according to the report. He crossed into  Turkey  with members of
his family, according to Turkish news reports.  “Definitely, there are other high-ranking officers who
want to defect but the situation is not suitable for them to
declare defection,” he was cited by Al Arabiya as saying.  Mikdad’s visit to Moscow continues discussions started when
United Nations envoy Lakhdar Brahimi held talks with Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Dec. 24, according to a
Russian Foreign Ministry official who asked not to be
identified, citing the sensitivity of the negotiations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
