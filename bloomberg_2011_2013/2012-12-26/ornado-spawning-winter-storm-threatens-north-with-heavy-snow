A powerful winter storm that spawned tornadoes from  Texas  to Alabama, killing at least six people and leaving thousands without power, is bringing heavy snow to the Midwest and threatening rain and high wind in the East.  A blizzard warning stretches from northeastern  Arkansas  to Cleveland, Ohio, where almost 14 inches (35.6 centimeters) of snow is expected to fall by tomorrow, according to the  National Weather Service . Winter storm warnings are in effect from  Illinois  into  Maine .  “The storm right now is over Tennessee and heavy snow is falling over southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio,” said Gary Best, a meteorologist with  Hometown Forecast Services Inc . in Nashua, New Hampshire. “On the other side, to the east, there is heavy rain and thunderstorms from Florida, Georgia and into North and South Carolina.”  Yesterday, 532 flights around the U.S. were canceled and 900 have been scrubbed so far today, according to  Flight Aware , a Houston-based airline tracking service. Most of today’s cancellations are in Indianapolis, Dallas-Fort Worth,  Chicago , Washington Dulles,  New York ’s LaGuardia and  Cleveland , the company said.  Flights Halted  Wind and rain along the coast will probably tie up air traffic from Charlotte, North Carolina, to New York City, while the heavy snow causes problems at airports across the Midwest, Best said.  Homes, hospitals and businesses were damaged from Texas to Florida by tornadoes and high winds from the storm yesterday, and at least 16 people were injured, according to the  U.S. Storm Prediction Center  in Norman, Oklahoma. The  Associated Press  reported at least six people killed.  More than 243,000 homes and businesses were without power at about 8 a.m. today New York time, most of them in Arkansas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from utility websites and company spokesmen.  Entergy (ETR)  Arkansas, the state’s largest utility, reported 191,293 customers blacked out. An additional 16,525 were without power in western Arkansas and nearby counties in Louisiana and Texas,  American Electric Power Co. (AEP) ’s Southwestern Electric Power Co. reported on its website.  Carolina Impact  Coastal North Carolina has the largest chance of being raked by tornadoes and high winds today, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The area has a 15 percent chance of experiencing a tornado and 46 percent chance of being buffeted by strong winds.  High wind warnings have also been issued from New York City to eastern  Massachusetts , including Boston.  Two inches of rain may fall in New York City overnight. There is a threat of coastal flooding in New York and Long Island during high tide later today, according to the weather service. Tides may be 3 to 5 feet above normal from 8 p.m. to midnight.  “Widespread flooding of vulnerable shore roads and/or basements due to storm tide and wave action,” the weather service said. “Road closures may be needed.”  A flood watch has also been posted for eastern  Pennsylvania  and western  New Jersey ,  including Philadelphia  and Trenton, where as much as two inches of rain may fall, flooding roads and sending streams out of their banks.  Eastern Cities  Best said the track of the storm will spare the large East Coast cities from Philadelphia to Boston any significant snowfall.  “If it was farther south and east, the big cities would get walloped by snow,” Best said. “The farther west and north of the track you go, that is where there will be double-digit snowfall amounts.”  Syracuse, New York, may receive as much as 13 inches of snow by tomorrow and Erie, Pennsylvania, may get 17 inches, according to the weather service.  The storm will also bring snow to Canada, where Toronto is forecast to receive about 4 inches and parts of southern Ontario as much as 6 inches, according to  Environment Canada .
