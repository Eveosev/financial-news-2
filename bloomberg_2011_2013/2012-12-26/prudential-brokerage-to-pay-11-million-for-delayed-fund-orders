Pruco Securities LLC, the brokerage
run by  Prudential Financial Inc., (PRU)  will pay customers at least
$10.7 million to make up for delays in placing more than 850,000
mutual fund orders.  Trades were placed one to two days after the orders arrived
by fax or mail, causing some customers to get inferior prices
from late 2003 until June 2011, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority said today in a statement. Finra also fined
Pruco $550,000 for the errors and oversight failures.  Companies must price mutual fund orders that arrive before
4 p.m. on the day they’re received, Finra said. Prudential, the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, managed  $132 billion  for
retail customers at its retirement division as of Sept. 30.  Prudential reported the errors to Finra after discovering
them when looking into a delay in executing a faxed order.  “Once we did discover it, we moved as quickly as we could
to make certain that we had notified Finra and took steps to
prevent it from happening again,” said  Bob DeFillippo , a
spokesman for the  Newark , New Jersey-based company. “We are
going to make certain that anybody who was harmed receives what
they are entitled to plus interest.”  The errors resulted in some customers receiving more
favorable pricing, and those customers won’t see adjustments
that cut the value of their accounts, he said.  Prudential retreated 0.4 percent to $53.02 at 11:30 a.m. in
 New York . The  shares  have gained 5.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
