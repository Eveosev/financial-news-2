South Africa’s former President
 Nelson Mandela  was discharged from a Pretoria hospital today,
more than two weeks after he was admitted for treatment for a
recurring lung infection and to remove gallstones.  Mandela, 94, will “undergo home-based high care” at his
home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton “until he fully
recovers,” the president’s office said in an e-mailed
statement. He was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 8.  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the  African National Congress  won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. He spent 27 years in prison before that
for his opposition to white-minority rule. This is the second
time he has been hospitalized this year after undergoing
abdominal surgery in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
