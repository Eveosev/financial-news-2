A new Chinese urbanization plan will
grant city residency to more migrant workers, according to the
official Shanghai Securities News, potentially expanding basic
rights to hundreds of millions of people.  The plan will give migrants access to the household-
registration system in cities where they live, giving them and
their children access to services such as education, health care
and pensions, according to the newspaper. “Mega-cities” such
as Beijing and Shanghai may be exempt from the new policies, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified government officials.  Li Keqiang , set to take over from  Wen Jiabao  as premier in
March, is championing urbanization to put economic growth on a
sustainable path.  China  in 2011 had 158.6 million migrant
workers who had left their rural homes to take jobs in cities,
sometimes with their families, according to an annual survey
published in April by China’s National  Bureau of Statistics .  Giving migrant workers more rights is “the cornerstone of
Li’s new-style urbanization strategy,” Steven Sun, the head of
China equity strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong , wrote
in a note last week. Reform of the household registration system
may generate infrastructure investment of 100,000  yuan  for each
of these migrant workers, he estimated.  Of the migrants tracked by the statistics office last year,
14 percent had pension coverage and 17 percent had health care
insurance in the towns where they lived.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
