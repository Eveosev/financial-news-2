OAO Mechel (MTL) ,  Russia ’s biggest
producer of steelmaking coal, is posting the smallest price
swings in 15 months on prospects higher prices for the metal
will boost earnings.  American depositary receipts of  Mechel (MTLR)  gained 2.3 percent
to $6.76 in New York yesterday, as its 100-day volatility
retreated to 49.45, the lowest since September 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Moscow-based Mechel was the biggest
gainer on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-
traded Russian shares in New York, sending the gauge to its
first advance in three days. RTS  stock-index futures  slipped 0.2
percent to 152,550.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge  of 24 commodities rallied
the most in a month and oil climbed to the highest level since
October yesterday as President  Barack Obama  returns to
 Washington  to resume talks aimed at averting spending cuts and
tax gains that threaten the world’s largest economy. Mechel is
poised for the first decline in revenue growth since 2009 this
year as a drop in commodity prices sent shares 20 percent lower,
making it the third-worst performer on the Russia-US gauge.  “Mechel was beaten more than others and therefore has a
bigger potential for growth,” Vladimir Tikhomirov, the chief
economist at Otkritie Financial Corp., said by phone from Moscow
yesterday. “The stock is very sensitive to commodity prices as
well as global economic environment news, and benefits from both
of the factors.”  The  Bloomberg Russia-US gauge  added 0.2 percent to 97.18 in
New York yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest
dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 0.6 percent to
$28.92, gaining by the most since Dec. 20. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock futures , rose
2.4 percent to 23.33 points.  Premium to Moscow  Mechel settled at a 1.4 percent premium to the company’s
Moscow-listed shares yesterday, the widest gap since Dec. 14.
Shares gained 0.7 percent to 203.6 rubles, or $6.66, in Moscow
yesterday.  The company will probably report that 2012 sales fell 6.5
percent to $11.7 billion this year, according to the mean
estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company is
expected to return to profit in 2013 after an estimated $237
million loss in 2012, according to the survey.  Mechel shares have been sinking as the company restructures
some of the $8.8 billion of debt it owed at the end of the first
half that made it the most indebted Russian mining company after
aluminum producer United Co. Rusal.  Oil Increases  Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for half of
the nation’s  federal budget  revenue in 2011, advanced to a two-
month high in New York yesterday, climbing 2.7 percent to $90.98
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are down
7.9 percent this year. Brent for January settlement on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange rose 2.1 percent to
$111.07 a barrel.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export oil blend,
increased 2.1 percent to $110.98.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth-largest oil producer,
climbed the most in two weeks, advancing 1.7 percent to $6.56.
The Moscow preferred  shares  added 0.7 percent to 20.34 rubles,
or 66.6 U.S. cents. One ADR equals to 10 shares.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone
company by subscribers, rallied 1.7 percent to $10.73 yesterday
after four days of declines and was the second-biggest gainer on
the Russia-US Equity index. The stock is up 13 percent this
year.  MTS’s Investments  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , the nation’s chief mobile operator,

since Dec. 7. The ADR is up 24 percent this year. The company’s
Moscow-listed  stock  added 0.5 percent to 246.35 rubles, or
$8.06.  The company’s investments for 2013 will exceed $3 billion
as it expands its network, billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov,
whose AFK Sistema owns 50.8 percent stake in MTS, said in an
interview with Kommersant newspaper published yesterday. MTS’s
capital expenditure is expected at $2.6 billion in 2012,
compared with $2.2 billion in 2011, according to OAO Nomos Bank.  Ruble futures showed the currency little changed at 30.925
