Colombian consumer prices rose 0.29
percent in September, the national statistics agency said. The
result was higher than the 0.16 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 32 analysts.  Annual  inflation  was 3.08 percent, according to the report
posted on the agency’s website today.  Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said this week that
inflation will end the year close to the mid-point of the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range.  Policy makers held their benchmark  interest rate  at 4.75
percent at their September policy meeting, after growth exceeded
expectations. The Colombian economy expanded 4.9 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, beating the forecasts of all
29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of
bond traders’ inflation expectations known as the breakeven
rate, rose to 2.82 percentage points today from 2.18 percent at
the start of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
