Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-
based alternative investment firm, is seeking suitors for truck-
parts distributor FleetPride Inc., which may be valued at as
much as $1 billion, said three people familiar with the matter.  Investcorp is working with  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on a possible sale, said two of the people,
who asked not to be named because the process is private.  Investcorp acquired FleetPride, based in The Woodlands,
Texas, with the company’s management team in 2006 for an
undisclosed sum. FleetPride, led by Chief Executive Officer
Woody McGee, now has 250 locations across the U.S., selling
parts and accessories for heavy-duty trucks, according to its
website. FleetPride also operates more than 200 Fleetcare
service locations.  Investcorp spokeswoman Deborah Botwood Smith didn’t return
an e-mail seeking comment outside regular business hours in
London. Melinda Pryor, a spokeswoman for FleetPride, didn’t
return a call seeking comment.  Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, and John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to
comment.  Founded three decades ago, Investcorp has about $12 billion
in assets under management, according to its  website . The
company’s other portfolio companies include Sur La Table, a
Seattle-based kitchenware retailer, and IPH Group, a French
distributor of industrial supplies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
