A North Korean soldier defected to
the South through the Demilitarized Zone after killing his
platoon and squad leaders, according to an official at  South
Korea ’s defense ministry.  The soldier crossed the western part of the military
demarcation line around noon today, the official said, asking
not to be identified because of military policy.  Six gunshots were heard before the North Korean was seen to
run over the border, Yonhap news agency reported. The man is
being questioned by a joint team of related agencies, Yonhap
said, citing South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.  North Korea  and South Korea remain technically at war since
their 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice rather than a
treaty. No unusual activity by the North Korean military has
been noticed since the desertion today, Yonhap said.  More than 2,700 North Koreans fled to the South last year,
raising the total number of defectors from the communist regime
to 23,100 as of the end of 2011, according to the most recent
estimate from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification in January.  The last time a North Korean soldier fled across the
Demilitarized Zone was in March 2010, according to the Yonhap
report. The division of the Korean peninsula at the 38th
parallel is 250 kilometers (155 miles) long and 4 kilometers
wide, according to  NASA .  To contact the reporter on this story:
