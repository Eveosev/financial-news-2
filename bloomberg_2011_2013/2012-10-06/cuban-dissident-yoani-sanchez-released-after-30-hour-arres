Cuban activist and blogger Yoani Sanchez, who has drawn tens of thousands of followers worldwide
for highlighting shortcomings of her communist government, was
released from custody after being detained for 30 hours.  Sanchez was arrested on Oct. 4 while covering the trial of
a man in the July 22 driving death of another dissident. Pro-
Cuban government blog Yohandry said she was causing a “media
show” at the trial.  Sanchez announced her release on her Twitter account late
yesterday. She said her intentions for covering the trial were
“entirely journalistic” and she had been denied food and water.  She had been covering the trial of a Spanish man as a
freelance reporter for El Pais, the Madrid-based newspaper said
on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
