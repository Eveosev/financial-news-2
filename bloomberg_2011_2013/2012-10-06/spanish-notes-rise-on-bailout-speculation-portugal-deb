Spain ’s  two-year notes  advanced for
the first time in four weeks amid speculation the nation was
preparing to seek a sovereign bailout that will trigger  European
Central Bank  purchases of its debt.  Spain’s 10-year yields fell the most in almost a month
yesterday after the European Central Bank’s President  Mario Draghi  reiterated on Oct. 4 the institution is ready to start
buying the bonds of indebted countries as soon as the necessary
conditions are fulfilled. German bunds fell for the first time
in three weeks as the ECB kept its key rate at a record-low 0.75
percent. Portugal’s 10-year bonds rose for five days, the
longest streak of gains since the period ended Aug. 21, after
the nation completed a debt swap.  “Markets are focused on the idea that we will see Spain
ask for a bailout and this is helping the country’s bonds,”
said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “Asking for aid would clear
the way for the ECB to buy the bonds.”  Spanish  two-year note yields  dropped 38 basis points, or
0.38 percentage point, to 3.05 percent at 5 p.m London time
yesterday. The 4.75 percent security due July 2014, climbed
0.65, or 6.50 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,305) face amount, to
102.925. Ten-year Spanish rates declined 25 basis points to 5.69
percent, and touched 5.68 percent yesterday, the least since
Sept. 25.  The ECB’s plan to buy bonds, called Outright Monetary
Transactions, has already lowered borrowing costs for sovereigns
across  Europe , Draghi said on Oct. 4 at a press conference after
the central bank announced its rate decision.  Investors Reassured  Spanish bonds have returned 4.6 percent over the past three
months, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies as Draghi
reassured investors the central bank would provide a backstop
for indebted nations. German bonds have returned 0.5 percent and
Portuguese bonds have gained 12 percent over the same period,
the indexes show.  “Today we are ready with our OMT,” he said. “Now it’s
really in the hands of governments.” Spain’s Economy Minister
Luis de Guindos said on the same day that no bailout was needed.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield dropped 78 basis points over the
week, the most since the five-day period ended Sept. 7, to 8.22
percent.  The nation’s debt agency, IGCP, on Oct. 3 exchanged
securities maturing next year for notes due in 2015, reducing
its 2013 repayment burden as it tries to regain access to long-
term debt markets.  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed eight basis points to 1.52
percent. The nation plans to sell 4 billion euros of five-year
notes on Oct. 10. It last sold the notes due in October 2017 on
Sept. 12 at an average yield of 0.61 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
