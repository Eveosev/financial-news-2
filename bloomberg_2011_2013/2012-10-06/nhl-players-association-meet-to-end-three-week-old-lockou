The  National Hockey League  and the
players’ association met yesterday to discuss efforts to reach a
contract and end the three-week-old lockout that has resulted in
the cancellation of 189 games.  Commissioner Gary Bettman and Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly
were in Toronto to talk to NHL Players Association Executive
Director Donald Fehr and Special Counsel Steve Fehr.  “Yes, we had a meeting,” Daly said yesterday afternoon.
“Nothing else to report at this time.”  At the center of the disagreement between the two sides are
players’ salaries, salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency. Daly has complained that the union
wants to focus on secondary issues rather than the major
economic elements of the agreement.  The collective bargaining agreement ended Sept. 15, with
the league calling a lockout the following day. The preseason
and the first two weeks of the regular season, slated to start
Oct. 11, have been canceled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
