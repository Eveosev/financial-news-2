Iran ’s Oil Ministry downplayed
reports that the European Union may ban imports of Iranian gas
as “propaganda” against the nation.  Iran doesn’t supply the EU with natural gas, Oil Ministry
spokesman Alireza Nikzad Rahbar was quoted as saying by the
state-run  Fars  news agency in a report today. “The new EU
threat is just propaganda,” he was reported as saying.  Iran exports gas to  Turkey  and has swap deals with Armenia
and Azerbaijan, according to Fars.  The U.K., France and  Germany  are pressing the EU to agree
to new measures to bring Iran’s economy to its knees and bar its
nuclear ambitions, according to several European diplomats. U.S.
Undersecretary of the Treasury David Cohen is visiting  France ,
Germany, Italy and the U.K. this week to discuss coordinating
efforts to increase the pressure on the Iranian government.  EU foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on Oct. 15. EU
diplomats have  reached  a preliminary agreement on banning gas
imports, one of a package of measures which also include other
financial and energy-related proposals,  Reuters  reported on Oct.
4, citing unidentified EU officials.  An EU embargo on Iranian oil came into force in July. Iran
is one of the main producers in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
