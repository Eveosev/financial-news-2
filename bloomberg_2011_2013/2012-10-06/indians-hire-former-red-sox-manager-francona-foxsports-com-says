The  Cleveland Indians  hired former
Boston Red Sox manager  Terry Francona , FoxSports.com reported,
citing people familiar with the situation.  Francona may be introduced as the new manager on Oct. 8 to
replace Manny Acta, who directed the team to a 68-94 record that
put the Indians fourth in the five-team American League Central,
the sports network said.  Francona managed the Boston Red Sox to two World Series
championships in 2004 and 2007 after 86 years of futility and
then was unable to stop the biggest September collapse in the
history of Major League Baseball in 2011.  The Red Sox declined to exercise their option to extend
Franconaâ€™s contract for the 2012 and 2013 seasons, ending an
eight-season term for Francona as  Boston  blew a nine-game lead
for the playoff spot in September 2011. Francona sat out the
2012 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
