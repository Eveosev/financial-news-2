Proposals to lower social charges
paid by employers remain unpopular with the French, according to
a survey this month.  Twenty-nine percent of French people surveyed support
raising the social-security tax to offset a lower contribution
by companies, according to a poll by Ifop for  Sud Ouest 
newspaper.  The level of opposition is similar to former President
Nicolas Sarkozyâ€™s plan to raise the value-added  sales tax  to pay
for lower social charges for employers, the pollster said.
Almost a third of respondents supported the measure when asked
in January.  Ifop questioned 1,004 people by telephone on Oct. 4 and 5.
The pollster estimated a 1.8 percent margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
