Former Blackburn striker  Alan Shearer 
said he’d be interested in talking about becoming the club’s
manager.  Shearer scored 131 goals in four seasons at Blackburn and
helped the club win the Premier League title in 1995.  Steve Kean 
quit as Rovers manager eight days ago, with assistant Eric Black
leading the team in the interim.  “With my history at Blackburn, I would speak to them
absolutely,” Shearer, whose only previous manager experience
came when he took over former club Newcastle for the final eight
games of the 2008-09 seaosn, said on the British Broadcasting
Corp.’s “Football Focus” program. “I think things would have
to change whoever goes in at Blackburn.”  Blackburn was relegated to the second-tier Championship
after finishing 19th in the 20-team Premier League last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
