Oil producers in the Middle East and
North Africa plan to invest $740 billion on energy projects in
the next five years, led by Saudi Arabia, according to Arab
Petroleum Investments Corp.  High oil prices will allow them to resume projects that
were delayed at the height of the financial crisis, the inter-
governmental energy lender said.  Saudi Arabia tops the list with committed investments of
$165 billion, mostly generated by Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , followed by the U.A.E. that plans
to invest $107 billion in the period, the lender known as
Apicorp said in an e-mailed report.  Algeria  overtook Qatar and  Iran  as the third-biggest
investor, with $71 billion of potential spending, largely the
result of catch-up investment. Iran’s energy spending program
has been put at $68 billion.  “Tighter international sanctions, and the retreat of
foreign companies, have ended up taking a toll on Iran’s elusive
energy investment program,” Apicorp said.  Countries in the region can finance projects on their own
as long as the basket of  OPEC crudes  stays at more than $100 a
barrel, the report said. That’s $10 higher than last year’s
review. The OPEC crude basket was at $106.99 as of Oct. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The review covers projects in the oil, gas, petrochemicals
and power industries that are likely to see final investment
decisions being taken. The bank selected the developments from
more than 200 planned and announced public and private projects
in the region estimating in size from from $100 million to $20
billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
