A meningitis outbreak traced to
contaminated steroids used for back pain has killed seven
people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
today in an update on its website.  The steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, was shipped to 75
facilities in 23 states from July to September, according to the
CDC.  Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain
and spinal cord usually caused by an infection from a virus or
bacteria. Sixty-four people in nine states -- Florida,  Indiana ,
Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,  North Carolina , Ohio, Tennessee
and Virginia -- have contracted fungal meningitis and seven have
died since receiving injections of the steroids in their backs,
the CDC said in a  statement .  The fungal illness is not contagious and can be treated
with medication, the Atlanta-based agency said.  The agency and state health departments yesterday released
a  list  of the 75 health-care centers that had received the
contaminated product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
