Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 2-0 to
equal the record of seven straight wins to start the season in
German soccer’s Bundesliga.  Franck Ribery scored both goals as Bayern tied the mark it
set in the 1995-96 season, and later matched by Kaiserslautern
in 2001-02 and Mainz in 2010-11. Bayern’s 21 points are five
better than  Frankfurt , which visits Monchengladbach tomorrow.  Schalke moved up to third with a 3-0 home win over
Wolfsbur, Hamburg won 1-0 at Greuther Fuerth, Mainz beat
Dusseldorf 1-0 and Freiburg defeated Nuremberg 3-0 in the other
matches in  Germany ’s top division.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
