European Central Bank Executive Board
member Benoit Coeure said the euro-area economy will return to
growth next year, Slovenia’s Delo newspaper reported, citing an
interview.  “Economic growth will come back in the course of 2013,”
Coeure was quoted as saying. “At first it will be slow. It will
then accelerate gradually, thanks to reforms.” He said the ECB
is ready to start its new bond-purchase program “once all the
prerequisites are in place,” and the ECB can support economic
growth and financial stability as long as that’s consistent with
its price-stability mandate.  The idea of a common euro-area budget “is interesting and
should be examined,” Coeure said, adding it is “not a short-
term prospect.”  Coeure said he’s “very optimistic” that the debt crisis
will be resolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
