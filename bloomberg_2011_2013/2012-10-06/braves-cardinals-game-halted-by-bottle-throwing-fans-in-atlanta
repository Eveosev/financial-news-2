The National League wild-card playoff
game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves has been
interrupted because fans are throwing bottles and cans on the
field after an umpire’s controversial call.  The fan reaction came in the eighth inning of the Major
League Baseball game after an umpire invoked the infield fly
rule, which means the batter is automatically out, on a popup by
the Braves’ Andrelton Simmons that fell safely to the ground in
short left field.  The Cardinals lead 6-3, and the Braves would have had the
bases loaded and one out if the infield fly rule had not been
called. Instead, they have two men on base and two outs.  The Braves told umpires they are playing the game under
protest.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
