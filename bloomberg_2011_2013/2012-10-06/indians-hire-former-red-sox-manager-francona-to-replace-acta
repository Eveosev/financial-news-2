Former Boston Red Sox manager Terry Francona has reached agreement with the  Cleveland  Indians to
replace Manny Acta as manager, the Major League Baseball team
said.  Francona, 53, will be introduced tomorrow during a news
conference at Progressive Field, the team said on its website.  “It was actually going to be Cleveland or come back here
and work,” Francona said last night during a broadcast of
ESPN’s “Sportscenter,” where he has been an analyst this
season.  Francona worked in the Indians’ front office in 2001 and
his father, Tito, played for the team from 1959-64.  “I’m actually excited,” Francona said on ESPN. “I’m
looking to maybe get back to coaching and being with people on
the field and trying to impact young players.”  Francona managed the Red Sox to World Series championships
in 2004 and 2007 after the franchise’s 86 years of futility. He
left the Red Sox after being unable to stop the biggest
September collapse in MLB history in 2011.  The Red Sox declined to exercise their option to extend
Francona’s contract for the 2012 and 2013 seasons, ending an
eight-season term for Francona, after Boston blew a nine-game
lead and missed the playoffs on the final day of last season.  The Indians said they wouldn’t release any other
information “out of respect for MLB protocol involving
announcements during the postseason.”  The Indians finished fourth in the five-team American
League Central division this season. Acta compiled a record of
214-266 in three seasons before he was fired Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
