Republican National Committee 
Chairman Reince Priebus said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that his party’s presidential candidate won the Oct. 3
debate with President Barack Obama and that he expects another
strong performance from the former Massachusetts governor at the
next debate on Oct. 16.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. We’re joined by the chairman of the
Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus. Mr. Chairman,
Republicans are ecstatic.  Mitt Romney  dominated the debate last
week. But I looked at a little bit of history.  Ronald Reagan  got
clobbered in 1984 in his first debate,  George W. Bush  clobbered
in his first debate in 2004, and it didn’t make any difference.
They still went on to win. These things really don’t matter
much, do they?  REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, I think they do matter quite a bit.
But, you know, the difference between those examples was - and
President Obama was that, you know, I mean, the president just
didn’t look like he was ready to fight. He was meandering. He
was - I would say - slightly boring. He didn’t look inspired at
all.  I think there’s a big difference. I mean, the fact is, it
was Romney who looked presidential. It was Romney that had the
passion, and it was Obama just looked annoyed all night.  And that being said, though, Al, I’ll take a small piece of
your leading question and tell you that we’re not so cocky not
to think that - that was Wednesday, and now we’re in the
weekend, and we have to win every day. It’s not good enough to
just have one great night, and it was a great night.  HUNT: Well, let’s look ahead then?  PRIEBUS: But when you’re trying to beat an incumbent,
you’ve got to keep winning the day. You can’t just look at one
event.  HUNT: Next big event, Biden versus Ryan next Thursday. What
are the expectations?  PRIEBUS: Well, I think - you know, listen - and I’m not
playing coy here. I do think that Biden has - he’s gifted in
rhetoric. Now, he goofs up quite a bit, but, you know what, if
he keeps his head together, he is very good on his feet, and
he’s a clever person, and I think he’s a likable guy. And so
that’s why I just would never undersell  Joe Biden  at all.  That being said, I’ve seen Paul throughout his entire
career. He’s extremely bright. He’s got command of the issues. I
think it’s going to be a very interesting evening, and I expect
that Paul is going to have a great night. I’ve seen him have a
lot of good nights. And I’m excited about next Thursday in
 Kentucky .  HUNT: Let’s talk about the  unemployment rate , dropped to
7.8 percent. Now, that’s the same rate Obama inherited. It’s not
- it’s still a very high unemployment rate, but it shows in a
promising direction. Isn’t that good news for the Democrats?  PRIEBUS: Well, I think direction’s important. And I think
that it’s better for our country to be moving slowly in this
direction than the opposite. But I’ll tell you that, I let the
economists argue about this, you know, household polling that
was done as compared to the payroll poll. The fact is, though,
Al, what matters most is that, what do people in Ohio feel? What
do people in  Wisconsin  and Iowa feel?  And the reality is, is that they’re not jumping up for joy
because the rate went from 8.1 to 7.8. And they’re not arguing
about how the calculation was made. Life just - under  Barack
Obama  - just hasn’t been as he promised it would be. And that’s
really the issue.  I mean, really, what the issue on the table is this. One,
did Barack Obama fulfill the mission of his presidency? Did he
meet the promises that he made? And the second piece is, what -
what is the alternative? And that’s what I think  Governor Romney 
did so well back at the debate on Wednesday, when he laid out
his vision?  HUNT: Would you expect . . .  PRIEBUS: . . . as well as prosecuting the president.  HUNT: Do you expect to see the same Mitt Romney and the
same Barack Obama, then, in the next debate?  PRIEBUS: Ah, you know, I mean, I think you’re going to see
the same Mitt Romney, because it’s the same Mitt Romney I’ve
been seeing for two years, including 20-some debates of our own
that we had in our primary. He’s a very good debater. He’s a
smart man. He’s passionate. He’s got a command of the issues.  And I think what you saw him do was give the American
people the respect that they deserve to come into a very
important debate with passion and details and plans.  HUNT: So we’ll see that figure again?  PRIEBUS: Well, I mean, it is who he is. It isn’t like a
show. I mean, it is what it is. That’s who he is. Now, whether -
what Obama is, is another story.  HUNT: Does the RNC treat Todd Akin’s candidacy any
differently than, say, George Allen or  Tommy Thompson  or any of
the other Republican Senate candidates this year?  PRIEBUS: Well, you know, one thing to keep in mind. I mean,
the senatorial committee focuses on a Senate race. When we have
a presidential cycle - the reality is, we’re the people that
fund this army on the ground. And so what happens in a
presidential year is, with all of the resources spent on the
ground and turning out Republican voters, it helps every
Republican, whether it be in Wisconsin,  Virginia ,  Missouri ,
wherever, every Republican is assisted by the fact that we are
getting identified Republicans into the polls and ultimately
ballots in the box. And that’s what we do.  HUNT: Let me ask you about your home state of Wisconsin.
Every recent poll there, including one done by some reliable
surveys that show  Scott Walker  winning, show Obama-Biden up by
10 or 11 points and Tommy Thompson trailing. Badger Land looks
blue.  PRIEBUS: Well, I don’t know if that’s going to hold up. And
I’m not one for whining about polls, so you’re not going to hear
me whine about it. I will tell you that there’s no way in the
world, Al, that we would be spending millions of dollars - in
fact, I’ll be in Wisconsin tomorrow campaigning with  Paul Ryan  -
there’s no way we’d spend that kind of money if we weren’t in
play, and Obama wouldn’t be in Wisconsin yesterday and - and a
week before that if Wisconsin wasn’t close.  I guarantee you, Wisconsin is going to be tight. We’re
committed there. And, you know, quite frankly, both sides are
committed there. And so we’ll just wait and see what happens
with these polls, but I don’t think you’ve seen the end of it.  HUNT: You know, the RNC and DNC have had two totally
different strategies. They funneled out a lot of money early to
state parties, while you all have held back, but now you have a
lot more cash than they do, for a late drive. Which strategy do
you think is going to prove smarter on November the 7th?  PRIEBUS: Well, let me - Al, let me just push back on your
premise a little bit. Last month and the month before that - I
think it was last month or the month before that - it’s the same
trend, you can go look at it - the DNC spent $21 million. We
spent almost $50 million. We’ve been outspending them and
outraising them for months and months and months.  So I don’t think they spent money early. I just don’t think
- I just don’t think they’ve spent it wisely. I don’t really
care about that. Our deal is that we’re funding the biggest
ground operation in the history of the RNC. We’ve already made
more phone calls and more doors than all of 2008. And our goal
is, in places like Ohio and Virginia and  Florida , we’re going to
make twice as many phone calls and door knocks, personal
contacts, than all of 2004 and 2008 combined.  HUNT: OK.  PRIEBUS: The only thing we can control is our own goals and
objectives, and right now, we’re going to crush our records, and
in turn I think we’re going to crush the Democrats on the
ground.  HUNT: And I know - I know you’re an optimist, Mr. Chairman,
and you think that you’re going to win the White House?  PRIEBUS: You have to be.  HUNT: . . . and the Senate and the House. And I accept
that. Let me ask you this. Give me a surprise. Give me a race
where conventional wisdom says the Democrats are going to win
and Republicans are going to wake up on November 7 happy.  PRIEBUS: I’ll give you two of them. One,  Linda McMahon  in
 Connecticut  and Linda Lingle in  Hawaii .  HUNT: OK.  PRIEBUS: I think those two races are going to be the
surprise.  HUNT: Mr. Chairman, as always, thank you so much for being
with us.  PRIEBUS: OK.  HUNT: And when we come back, what the latest jobs numbers
tell us, and Kate and Margaret’s presidential predictions. The
last word right after this break.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
