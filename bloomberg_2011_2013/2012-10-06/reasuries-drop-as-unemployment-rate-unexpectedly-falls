Treasuries fell for the first time in
three weeks after a report showing the U.S. unemployment rate
unexpectedly declined renewed concern the  Federal Reserve ’s
commitment to strengthen the economy may stoke inflation.  The yield on the  10-year note  rose to the highest in almost
two weeks after the Labor Department said yesterday that the
jobless rate dropped to 7.8 percent in September, the lowest
since President  Barack Obama  took office in January 2009. The
difference in yields between 10-year notes and inflation-
protected debt increased to the most in almost three weeks. The
U.S. will sell $66 billion in notes and bonds next week.  “It’s potentially the end of the ridiculously low yields
for the  bond market ,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-income  money
manager  who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management
Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts . “The trend is going higher. We’ve
been getting better economic data even though it’s not as robust
as the market would like.”  The benchmark 10-year note’s  yield  rose 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to 1.75 percent last week, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. That’s the highest since Sept. 24.
The 1.625 percent security due August 2022 slipped 31/32, or
$9.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 29/32.  The gap in yields between 10-year notes and 30-year bonds
increased to 1.23 percentage points, or 123 basis points, the
most since September 2011, as investors demanded a bigger
premium against the risk of inflation. The longer the maturity
of a security, the more its fixed payments are at risk of being
eroded over time.  Value Measure  “The bear steepening we saw today was consistent with a
 slightly better economic picture in the context of very easy
 monetary policy,” said  Eric Stein , a money manager in  Boston 
at Eaton Vance Management, which oversees $203TK billion.  Treasuries yesterday traded at the least expensive level in
two weeks. The 10-year term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed that includes expectations for  interest
rates , growth and inflation, was negative 0.88 percent. It
reached negative 0.97 percent on Sept. 26, the most costly since
July 25. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
for 2012 is negative 0.75 percent.  Ten-year yields will rise to 1.75 percent by December,
according to the median forecast in Bloomberg surveys of banks
and securities firms.  Speculative Positions  Even so, hedge-fund managers and other large speculators
increased bets the 10-year note will continue to rally in the
five days ended Oct. 2, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data. Speculative long positions, or
bets prices will rise, outnumbered short positions by 161,790
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade. Net-long  positions  rose
by 78,264 contracts, or 94 percent, from a week earlier.  The  unemployment rate  fell from 8.1 percent in August as
employers took on more part-time workers as the economy added
114,000 positions in September. The jobless rate was forecast to
rise to 8.2 percent, according to the median estimate of 88
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The median estimate for job
gains was 115,000, according to another survey.  The so-called  break-even rate,  which measures how much
traders anticipate consumer prices will rise over the life of
the debt, for 10-year securities yesterday touched 2.62
percentage points, the highest since Sept. 17.  Presidential Election  “It’s a combination of higher inflation expectations and
higher growth expectations,” said Michael Pond, head of global
inflation-linked research in New York at Barclays Plc, one of
the 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  The payrolls data, the penultimate before the November
presidential election, may give Obama a boost after he stumbled
in this week’s debate against Republican challenger  Mitt Romney .
The jobless rate had stayed above  8 percent  since February 2009.  “It’s a piece of more optimistic data with regard to the
labor market,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2
billion as chief investment officer at United Nations Federal
Credit Union in New York.  The Fed signaled it’s moving toward linking its outlook for
near-zero interest rates to specific economic conditions such as
a decline in the unemployment rate.  Policy makers including  Charles Evans , the president of the
Chicago Fed, have said the central bank should promise to keep
rates low until the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent, so
long as inflation does not breach 3 percent. In minutes from
their most recent meeting released Oct. 4, participants said
such a strategy would give the Fed more flexibility to adjust to
changing economic conditions, while saying it would be
“challenging” to agree on specific thresholds, given a
diversity of views.  Interest Expense  Policy makers last month also said they could change the
size of the central bank’s monthly asset purchases to reduce the
risks associated with the program, such as disrupting financial
markets and spurring inflation, the minutes showed.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and
mortgage-related debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
purchases, known as quantitative easing. It also began its
Operation Twist program to replace shorter-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term securities and put downward pressure
on long-term borrowing costs.  The U.S. will auction $32 billion in three-year debt, $21
billion in 10-year securities and $13 billion in 30-year bonds
on three consecutive days starting Oct. 9.  The U.S. government’s interest expense fell to the lowest
in seven years as yields on Treasury debt dropped to records
even as debt soared beyond $16 trillion for the first time,
aided by a one-time accounting change.  The U.S. paid $359.8 billion in interest on $16.1 trillion
of debt in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to Treasury
Department  data . That’s down from $454.4 billion for the 2011
fiscal year and the least since $352.4 billion in fiscal 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
