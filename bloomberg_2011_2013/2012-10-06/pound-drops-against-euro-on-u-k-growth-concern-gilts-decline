The pound fell for the first time in
three weeks against the euro as evidence the U.K. economy is
struggling to grow damped demand for the nation’s assets.  The pound was little changed against the dollar after
dropping to the lowest in more than three weeks. An Oct. 3
report showed a gauge of U.K. services rose at a slower pace
than economists forecast last month, while the nation’s
manufacturing industry shrank for a fifth month in September,
according to separate data on Oct. 1. Government bonds fell
after the U.S. employment rate unexpectedly slid to the lowest
level in almost four years.  “Euro-pound has definitely broken lower out of its
range,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and
institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“The U.K. economy is not great. The pound doesn’t seem to have
many friends right now.”  The pound was at 80.61 pence per euro at 5 p.m. London time
yesterday, down 1.3 percent since Sept. 28. It fell to 80.67
pence yesterday, the weakest since Sept. 18. Sterling traded
little changed at $1.6194, after touching 1.6067 on Oct. 3, the
least since Sept. 12.  The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a record-low 0.5 percent at a monthly policy
meeting on Oct. 4, in line with the estimate of all 50 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The central bank also maintained its
bond-purchase target of 375 billion pounds.  U.S. Unemployment  The 10-year gilt yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, from last week to 1.77 percent even after
falling to 1.679 percent on Oct. 4, the lowest since Sept. 10.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.39, or 3.90
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.815. The yield on  two-
year  gilts rose two basis points to 0.21 percent.  The U.S. jobless rate dropped to 7.8 percent in September
from 8.1 percent the previous month and the economy added
114,000 workers after a revised 142,000 gain in August that was
more than initially estimated, according to Labor Department
figures yesterday.  The pound will weaken to 78 pence per euro by the end of
this year, McDarby said, citing Investec’s forecast.  A report will show manufacturing production in the U.K.
dropped 0.7 percent in August, compared with a 3.2 percent rise
in July, according to the median estimate of 25 analysts before
the data is released Oct. 9. The U.K. is scheduled to sell 1.75
billion pounds of gilts due in June 2032 the same day, before a
1.5 billion-pound sale of inflation-linked bonds maturing in
March 2024 on Oct. 11.  The pound rose 0.7 in the past three months, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro gained 1.8 percent and the
dollar slumped 3.9 percent.  Gilts returned 3.3 percent this year through Oct. 4,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
