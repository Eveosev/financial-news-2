Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
world’s largest social network, plans to reduce by half a $3
billion credit line due to a decline in its tax liability, a
person familiar with the matter said yesterday.  The Menlo Park, California-based company also plans to
extend the term of the loan to three years from one year, said
the person, who asked not to be named because the matter is
private.  Facebook said in March that it secured a $3 billion 364-day
bridge loan to fund taxes for employees who exercise their
restricted stock units. It also lined up a $5 billion five-year
revolving line of credit ahead of its initial public offering in
May, according to a filing.  Facebook’s tax obligations are now lower than it had
expected because the value of its shares has  fallen  45 percent
since the IPO. The financing was arranged by banks including
JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Morgan Stanley (MS) , and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.  Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook, and Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment
yesterday, as did  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, and  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier yesterday that
Facebook planned to reduce its credit line and extend the
duration of its term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
