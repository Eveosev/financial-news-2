Kris Medlen’s win streak was broken,
and the  Atlanta Braves ’ season ended with an ugly display by
bottle-throwing fans.  Matt Holliday  hit a solo home run and the defending World
Series-champion St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Braves 6-3
today in the first wild-card playoff game in Major League
Baseball history.  The game was interrupted for about 20 minutes in the eighth
inning when fans at Atlanta’s Turner Field pelted the field with
bottles and cans after an umpire’s controversial call.  The Cardinals move on to face the  Washington Nationals  in a
National League Division Series. The Braves, who had won a
record 23 straight games started by Medlen, were eliminated from
the playoffs.  The Texas Rangers host the Baltimore Orioles tonight in the
AL wild-card playoff, with the winner advancing to a division
series against the  New York  Yankees.  David Ross  hit a two-run homer for the Braves in the second
inning. The Cardinals responded with three runs in the fourth
and Holliday added his home run in the sixth to make it 4-2. The
Cardinals scored two more in the seventh on two errors by
Atlanta, the NL’s best fielding team this season.  The fan reaction came after an umpire invoked the infield
fly rule, which means the batter is automatically out, on a
popup by the Braves’ Andrelton Simmons that fell safely to the
ground in short left field. The call helped end an Atlanta
rally.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
