Carlyle Group  plans to invest as much
as $170 million in Africa, the Financial Mail reported, citing
the regional co-head of investment.  The private-equity firm may spend $30 million to $50
million on deals outside of  South Africa  and $80 million to $120
million in the country, the Johannesburg-based weekly magazine
said, citing Danie Jordaan. The report didn’t say over what
period the money would be spent.  Carlyle sees potential in Africa’s banking, insurance and
health-care industries, the Financial Mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
