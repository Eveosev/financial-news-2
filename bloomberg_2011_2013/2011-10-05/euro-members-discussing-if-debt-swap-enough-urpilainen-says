Euro area countries are discussing
whether investors are taking on an “adequate” share of losses
in Greece’s second bailout, according to  Finland ’s Finance
Minister Jutta Urpilainen.  “Many euro countries have now realized that the July deal
is too advantageous for investors and there’s too little
investor burden sharing,” Urpilainen, 36, said at a press
briefing in Helsinki today.  Euro area finance ministers debated ways to increase burden
sharing at a meeting on Oct. 3, she said. “No solution’s been
put forward so far,” she said.  Still, the debt swap agreed on July 21, in which investors
would absorb a 21 percent loss in net present value terms, is a
“step in the right direction,” Urpilainen said. Finland
“emphasizes” the need for bondholders to share losses, she
said.  Even without changing the terms of the debt swap agreed on
in July, investors may be taking on a bigger share of  Greece ’s
rescue costs as market conditions worsen, according to  Charles Dallara , managing director of the Washington-based  Institute of
International Finance .  “The implied subsidy granted by the private creditors is
much larger today, given that market rates are much higher,”
Dallara said in a telephone interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
