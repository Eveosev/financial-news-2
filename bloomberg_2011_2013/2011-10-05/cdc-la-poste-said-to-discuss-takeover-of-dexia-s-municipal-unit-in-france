French state-owned companies  La Poste 
and Caisse des Depots et Consignations will discuss today the
possible takeover of  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s French municipal-lending
business, two people familiar with the matter said.  CDC’s supervisory commission will meet tonight under the
direction of lawmaker Michel Bouvard to discuss the possibility
of undertaking such a project, one of the people said, declining
to be identified because the talks aren’t public. The board of
directors of La Poste, the French postal service, will also meet
tonight to discuss the matter, another person said.  Paris-based CDC is Dexia’s largest shareholder and is also
an investor in La Poste. A spokesman for CDC declined to comment
as did a spokeswoman at La Poste.  In France, the lender had 82.6 billion euros ($110.2
billion) of outstanding municipal and project-finance loans at
the end of the first half. It had 3.8 billion euros of deposits.  Dexia, the Belgian-French lender bailed out by the two
governments in 2008, will put its “legacy” division, which
held 113 billion euros of assets at the end of June, into a
“bad bank,” Belgian Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  told reporters
in Brussels yesterday.  An important part of the solution to Dexia’s problems will
be put forward tomorrow, French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin 
said in an interview on RTL radio today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
