The Bank of England should consider
easing monetary policy if the outlook for the economy
deteriorates further, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “In the U.K., where the recovery is tepid, and fiscal
tightening stronger, the accommodative stance will need to be
maintained for some time,” the Washington-based fund said in an
e-mailed report today. “The Bank of England should further
loosen its monetary stance if the recent weakening of the growth
and inflation outlook continues.”  The IMF cut its 2011 and 2012 U.K. growth forecasts last
month as threats from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis weigh on
the economy. Growth will be “sluggish” this year as “serious
headwinds,” including the largest government budget cuts since
World War II and a squeeze on household incomes, undermine
demand, the fund said today.  The deteriorating outlook prompted most  Bank of England 
policy makers to say last month that more stimulus for the
economy is “increasingly probable.” Nine of 30 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey say the central bank will resume its
emergency bond-purchase program tomorrow. The rest say it will
hold the plan at 200 billion pounds ($308 billion).  All 53 economists in a separate survey see no change in the
key  interest rate , which is at a record low of 0.5 percent. The
announcements will be made at noon in  London  tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
