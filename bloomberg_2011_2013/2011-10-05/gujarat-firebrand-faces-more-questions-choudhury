The skeletons in the cupboard of  Narendra Modi , the controversial Chief Minister of Gujarat, have once again spilled out into the open. Last week, a suspended police officer who had turned whistleblower in the investigation of the gruesome Gujarat riots of 2002 was suddenly arrested on the charge of fabricating evidence and taken into judicial custody. The controversy broke out less than two weeks after Modi had organized an ornate, even narcissistic,  three-day pageant of "goodwill"  in his state after escaping censure from India's Supreme Court in another case pertaining to the riots. The chain of events that produced the latest crisis in Modi's tumultuous political life had its beginnings in a gruesome chain of events more than  nine years past . On Feb. 27, 2002, a train carrying a large number of Hindu pilgrims was attacked by a Muslim mob just outside the Godhra railway station in Gujarat and set on fire; 58 people lost their lives. The state was then newly under the rule of Modi and the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP), which says it is dedicated to  "cultural nationalism"  or Hindutva, but is seen by its critics as a party of right-wing Hindu chauvinism. In the days after the Godhra incident, retaliatory violence was widely visited upon the Muslims of Gujarat by rampaging Hindu mobs, many of them owing allegiance to right-wing groups. In the most sympathetic interpretation, Modi's government was guilty of not using the state's power to defend the Muslim minority from the violence. In the  most damning analysis , it was culpable of conspiring to organize or support the pogroms. Hundreds were killed in the communal violence. And for years afterwards, thousands of Gujarati Muslims whose homes and belongings had been destroyed were subjected to the indignity of living, in their very own cities and towns, in relief camps. In April of this year, Sanjiv Bhatt, a high-ranking police officer posted in Gujarat at the time of the riots, submitted an  incriminating affidavit  to the  Supreme Court  of India. Bhatt stated that Modi had convened a late-night meeting on Feb. 27, 2002, after the massacre of Hindus at Godhra, at which senior members of the government, the bureaucracy and the police force were present. According to Bhatt's affidavit, at the meeting, "Modi expressed the view that emotions were running very high amongst the Hindus and it was imperative that they be allowed to vent their anger." Although there were questions raised about why Bhatt had waited so many years to make these revelations, there was no doubt that this was the most damning evidence to date about Modi's role in the riots. Other bureaucrats who attended the Feb. 27 meeting  have denied  that Bhatt was present. Among the witnesses who had countersigned Bhatt's affidavit, testifying to his presence at the meeting, was police constable KD Panth, who was then Bhatt's driver. A few months later, Panth submitted a complaint to the Gujarat police, alleging that Bhatt had threatened him and  forced him to sign  the affidavit, and that he, Panth, wasn't present in Gujarat on the day of the meeting. Acting on the complaint about three months later, the Gujarat police grabbed Bhatt on Sept. 30 and are detaining him on multiple charges. Last month, the government launched proceedings against another policeman-turned-whistleblower,  Rahul Sharma , for "unauthorised data collection." The suddenness of Bhatt's arrest was, like many other gaps and delays in the entire chain of events, surely meaningful.  Reporting on the arrest , the Hindu pointed out it took place just two days after Bhatt made further charges implicating Modi in the murder of a political rival: Following Bhatt's arrest, human-rights activists around the country mobilized people in the hundreds to  protest  against what they saw as the intimidation of witnesses in Gujarat, where courts are currently hearing dozens of cases concerning the riots of 2002 (in  March , a special court sentenced to death 11 people accused in the train-burning incident). While Modi was silent, spokesmen of the Gujarat government and the BJP insisted that the law was taking its course. Even so, the matter was a foretaste for the BJP of the political risks involved in choosing Modi as the party's candidate for prime minister in the national elections of 2014. It was also a reminder to Indian citizens, many of whom are disaffected with the present government led by the  Indian National Congress , that behind Modi's record as a successful administrator and his reputation as a political visionary, there lie many murky intrigues that cannot be wished away, and that require Modi to be electorally contained as no more than an exceptionally powerful and popular regional satrap. In a piece on Firstpost.com called " Too many ghosts to handle, Modi should kiss PM dream goodbye ," Akshaya Mishra wrote: And in the Mumbai Mirror, the columnist Nalin Mehta wrote, in a piece called " The masque of Narendra Modi ": In Lounge, the weekend edition of the business newspaper Mint, the columnist Aakar Patel, formerly the editor of a Gujarati newspaper, supplied an exceptionally astute portrait of Modi in a piece called " Everything you wanted to know about Narendra Modi ." Unlike other commentators, Patel, while providing many incriminating observations about Modi, nevertheless suggested that he might be an effective prime minister: For American policymakers curious to know more about Modi, this account adds a wealth of detail to the brief, approving remarks about Modi's government, based mainly on newspaper editorials, supplied by the recent  report on India  by the U.S. Congressional Research Service. These were  widely circulated by the BJP  and linked to by Modi himself on his  Twitter page . In 2005, Modi was  denied a U.S. visa  for his involvement in "severe violations of religious freedom," so the congressional report was cited by BJP spokespersons as evidence that Modi had consolidated his position to such an extent that he was no longer seen by the American government as a political untouchable. It seems sure that Modi will return to power in the next elections in Gujarat, scheduled for 2012. Whether he goes any further in Indian politics depends on how well he is able to weather the storm of the Bhatt affair, as well as any future fallout from 2002.
