Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said the IMF is
working to limit the spread of concerns about  Spain  and  Italy .  “For us, it is absolutely important that we restore
confidence in the debt market of Spain and Italy to bring back
investors to those markets,” Borges said in the text of remarks
at a press conference in Brussels today. Market participants
need to be persuaded that it is “appropriate to keep buying
this debt,” which may require “some official sector
involvement in the process,” Borges said.  He said the situations in Spain and Italy are different
than in Greece and  Portugal .  “In Italy and Spain, the core problem is one of
confidence,” Borges said. “These countries are solvent and
should normally have access to markets.”  Borges said Italy has better primary surplus than  Germany 
and the IMF is “reassured” on the Italian budget.  He said the revamped European Financial Stability Facility
will have new ways to help Italy and Spain. “The EFSF in its
new mandate will have the possibility of intevening in
secontary market in ways that would be very helpful for Spain
and Italy,” Borges said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
