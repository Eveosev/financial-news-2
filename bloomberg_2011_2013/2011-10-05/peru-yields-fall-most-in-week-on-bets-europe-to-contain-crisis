Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in a week, as investors speculated the euro area
will shore up its banks and the South American country’s central
bank said the nation will withstand slower global growth.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.92 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.32 centimo to 113.08 centimos
per sol.  European Union officials are working on plans to boost bank
capital to contain the euro-region’s debt crisis, the
 International Monetary Fund  said. Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
signaled Germany is ready to join efforts to recapitalize banks
and said investors may have to accept bigger losses as part of a
Greek rescue. Peru can post “very good” growth even as the
U.S. and Europe expand at “anaemic” rates, Julio Velarde,
president of the Andean nation’s central bank, told Congress
today.  “Global markets are rising and that’s helping Peruvian
bonds, which had been hit by a sell-off by non-residents,” said
 Roberto Flores , head of research at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-based
brokerage. “The strength of the Peruvian economy may allow Peru
to avoid a recession, even in a scenario in which the world
grows much more slowly than expected.”  The sol rose 0.5 percent to 2.7635 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7775 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
