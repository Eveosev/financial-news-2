Flooding in  Thailand  may cause about
20 billion baht to 30 billion baht of damage as the deluge
destroys crops and property, Deputy Prime Minister Kittiratt Na-
Ranong said today.  Separately, Kittiratt said the government estimates it may
buy about 15 million metric tons of unmilled rice from farmers
at above-market rates once purchases begin later this week.  Local rice packers will also purchase the grain from
farmers at competitive prices to ensure supplies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
