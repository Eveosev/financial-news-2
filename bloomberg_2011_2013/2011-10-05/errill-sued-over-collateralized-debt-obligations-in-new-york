Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch
unit was sued in New York by Loreley Financing over alleged
misrepresentations involving $92 million worth of collateralized
debt obligations.  The suit stems from Loreley’s purchase of classes of notes
issued in connection with two collateralized debt obligations,
according to a complaint filed today in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan.  “Defendants made material misrepresentations to
plaintiffs, omitted material facts, conspired to defraud
plaintiffs, were responsible for fraudulent conveyances, aided
and abetted others’ fraud and fraudulent conveyances,” Lorely
said in the complaint.  William Halldin , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said the company believes “there is no
merit to the claims” and plans to defend itself in court.  The case is Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v.
Merrill Lynch, 652732/2011,  New York  State Supreme Court,
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
