U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said today that Wall Street firms have been “very
wounded” and that he doesn’t understand why they are so
sensitive.  “They resent the huge amount of public anger they’ve been
subjected to because they caused the crisis,” Geithner said at
the Washington Ideas Forum at the Newseum. “They react to what
is pretty modest common-sense observations about the system as
if they’re deep affronts to the dignity of their profession.”  “I don’t understand why they are so sensitive but they’re
very wounded and they’ve seen a huge amount of damage to
people’s confidence and their capacity to not just manage risk
and to meet the needs of their customers but in a broader public
consciousness,” Geithner said.  He did not cite any Wall street firms or banks by name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
