A black fly outbreak that started in
 South Africa ’s Northern Cape province has caused damage
estimated at 333 million rand ($41 million) this year, Farmer’s
Weekly said.  The outbreak, initially limited to the Upington area in the
Northern Cape, has since spread to the Orange River region, the
Free State, Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the Johannesburg-
based magazine said.  Black flies can cause disease and death among livestock,
particularly sheep, and allergic reactions in people. The flies
have cut the number of visitors to the Augrabies Falls National
Park on the Orange River, the magazine quoted Hoffie Joubert, an
executive committee member at Agri Northern Cape, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
