Hong Kong â€™s government said it would
monitor short-selling in the local stock market after seven
brokerages called for a ban on the practice, the  South China
Morning Post  reported today, citing the government and brokerage
representatives.  The brokerages expressed their views in a meeting with
Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Au
King-chi yesterday. Brian Fung Wei-lung, chairman of the Hong
Kong Securities Association, said the government should at least
boost transparency by disclosing whether assets held in
Mandatory Provident Funds were being lent out to short sellers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
