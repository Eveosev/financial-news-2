Corn advanced for the first time in
four days on speculation that a 26 percent slump from this
year’s high to yesterday’s close may attract importers seeking
to rebuild stockpiles.  China , the world’s second-largest user, may need to import
between 5 million and 10 million metric tons before the end of
2012 to replenish corn inventories, Thomas C. Dorr, president of
the U.S. Grains Council, said yesterday.  “A number of analysts estimate China’s corn import
requirements will be greatly above the numbers given by the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture , and that China could have an import
need in the 2011-12 marketing year of between 5 million and 10
million tons,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel said in an
online comment.  Corn for December delivery gained 9.25 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $5.97 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. London time on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures have plunged from a three-year
high of $7.93 on June 9, touching $5.7225 on Oct. 3, the lowest
level since December.  As of Sept. 24, shipments from the U.S. at Chinese ports
were estimated to cost 100 yuan ($15.68) per ton less than
domestic supply, after accounting for taxes, state-backed
researcher Grain.gov.cn said in a report on Sept. 28.  The nation may seek extra imports as it did in March, when
prices fell after the earthquake in  Japan , and after a June 30
report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture showing higher-
than-expected U.S. supply, Morgan Stanley said in an Oct. 3
report.  Wheat for December delivery climbed 11 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $6.15 a bushel in Chicago. Milling wheat for
November delivery rose 1.75 euros, or 1 percent, to 184 euros
($245) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 12.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $11.7275 a bushel in Chicago, heading for their
first gain in four sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
