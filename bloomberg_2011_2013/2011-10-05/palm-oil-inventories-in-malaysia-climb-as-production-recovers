Palm oil stockpiles in  Malaysia , the
second-largest grower, probably advanced to 2 million metric
tons for the second time this year in September as harvests
rebounded and exports dropped, showed a Bloomberg News survey.  Inventories climbed 6.4 percent from 1.88 million tons in
August, according to the median estimate in a survey of three
analysts and two plantation companies this week. Stockpiles were
1.71 million tons a year earlier and exceeded 2 million tons
last time in June, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board,
which is scheduled to publish the official estimates on Oct. 10.  Rising reserves may weigh on futures in Malaysia, which
have fallen 29 percent from a 35-month high of 3,967 ringgit
($1,239) a ton on Feb. 10, and potentially curb profits at
producers including  Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  and PT Astra Agro Lestari.
Futures in Kuala Lumpur may trade between 2,800 ringgit and
3,100 ringgit until the middle of November,  Dorab Mistry ,
director at Godrej International Ltd., said Sept. 25.  ‘It’s normal for stocks to build above 2 million tons in
the last few months of the year, especially as production peaks
around October and November,” said Victor Thianpiriya, an
agricultural commodity analyst at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. “The strength of exports at the moment,
given how cheap palm oil is compared to competing oils, is
what’s keeping stocks at close to 2 million tons.”  Peak Production  Output probably gained 6 percent to 1.77 million tons in
September from a month earlier, while exports dropped 7.1
percent to 1.57 million tons, the survey showed. Shipments fell
6.3 percent to 1.52 million tons in September compared with 1.62
million tons in August, surveyor Intertek said Sept. 30.  Palm oil production probably gained 8.8 percent to 13.8
million tons in the nine months through September from a year
earlier, according to the survey. Output may increase to 18.3
million tons in 2011 from 17 million tons last year, Choo Yuen
May, director-general of the Palm Oil Board, said Aug. 8. Output
typically peaks between July and October.  December-delivery futures fell 0.3 percent to 2,803 ringgit
a ton in  Kuala Lumpur  today, according to Bloomberg data. The
most-active contract has slumped 26 percent this year.  “I don’t see why the major import markets wouldn’t
continue to keep buying, because previously, every time the
prices got down to 3,000 ringgit per ton, you’ve had a big
uplift in purchases from  China ,  India  and  Pakistan ,” said ANZ’s
Thianpiriya. “I don’t see why the demand would fall away now
with prices at 2,800 ringgit, especially given that the discount
to competing oils hasn’t changed substantially.”  Palm oil’s discount to  soybean oil  was $211 per ton today.
That compares with an average of $164.03 a ton this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It widened to $289.97
on Aug. 31, the most since 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
