Grainger Plc (GRI) , the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded residential landlord, rose the most in six
months in London trading after the company reached loan
agreements that extend the maturity of its debt.  The stock advanced as much as 8.7 percent to 84 pence, the
biggest increase since March 24 and the second-largest gain on
the FTSE 250 index. Grainger agreed on new loans worth a total
of 890 million pounds ($1.37 billion) to refinance debt that was
coming due next year.  A group of five banks agreed to provide 840 million pounds
of loans that will mature in four installments starting in
December 2014, the Newcastle, England-based company said today
in a statement. In addition, Partnership Assurance loaned
Grainger 50 million pounds for its retirement-related property
investments, Grainger said.  The new package increases the company’s average loan
maturity to 5.9 years from 3.5 years. Though the refinancing may
add 12 million pounds to annual interest costs, it may ease
concerns about how the company would deal with 927 million
pounds of debt maturing through 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analyst Osmaan Malik said in a note.  “This news should alleviate the pressure” on Grainger’s
share price, which has dropped 42 percent since July, Malik
said. “We take this as a bullish signal for the wider sector.”  Grainger was up 6.1 percent at 82 pence as of 8:44 a.m. in
 London , lifting the company’s market value to 341 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
