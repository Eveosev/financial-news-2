Turkish non-government healthcare
providers agreed to stop “abnormal differences” between
average salaries for their doctors and those working for the
state, Hurriyet newspaper reported.  The commitment was made in a letter issued after meetings
between Health Minister Recep Akdag and Resat Bahat, head of the
association of non-government healthcare providers, the
Istanbul-based newspaper reported.  The state struggles to pay doctors 8,000 liras ($4,200) a
month, while they can earn as much as 20,000 liras for non-
government employers, the newspaper said, citing Akdag.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
