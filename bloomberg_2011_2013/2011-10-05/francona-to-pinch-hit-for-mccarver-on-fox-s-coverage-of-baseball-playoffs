Former Boston Red Sox manager Terry Francona will fill in for Fox lead baseball analyst Tim McCarver
during the first two games of the American League Championship
Series.  McCarver is having a minor heart-related procedure
performed this week, the  News Corp. (NWS)  network said in an e-mailed
statement without disclosing specifics. McCarver, 69, should
return to the broadcast booth in time for Game 3 of Major League
Baseball’s best-of-seven ALCS, which is scheduled for Oct. 11,
Fox said.  Francona’s eight-year tenure with the Red Sox ended Sept.
30 when the team opted not to pick up his $4.5 million contract
for next season. Francona, who guided Boston to World Series
titles in 2004 and 2007, will work with play-by play announcer
Joe Buck in the Fox booth.  The first two games of the AL Championship Series are
scheduled for Oct. 8 and 9. The Texas Rangers will play the
winner of tomorrow’s game between the  New York Yankees  and
 Detroit Tigers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
