German Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich  said the country shouldn’t cede more power to  Europe 
as a response to the region’s fiscal crisis,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing an interview.  “Only because  Greece  embarked on unsustainable policies,
the influence of member states shouldn’t automatically be cut,”
Friedrich told the newspaper. “Europe has to use its
competences it already has before we think about new powers,”
he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
