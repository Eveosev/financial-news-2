Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
insurer, gained the most in 1 1/2 years in Paris trading after
the company reiterated its earnings target and said the balance
sheet remains solid.  Axa rose as much as 83 cents, or 9.3 percent, to 9.74
euros, its biggest intraday increase since May 2010 and was up
8.2 percent at 4:25 p.m. local time. That pares its decline this
year to 23 percent and gives the firm a market value of 22.9
billion euros ($29.3 billion).  The insurer still expects 10 percent annual growth in
operating earnings per share through 2015, the Paris-based
company said today in a presentation on its  website .  Axa’s “earnings generation capacity is diversified” and
the “balance sheet is robust,” it said in the presentation.
