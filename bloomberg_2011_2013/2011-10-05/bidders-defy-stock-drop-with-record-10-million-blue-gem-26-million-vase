Sotheby’s (BID)  raised HK$3.2 billion
($411.3 million) from a six-day sale of art, ceramics, gems and
wines in  Hong Kong  that ended today, compared with a presale
estimate of HK$2.7 billion, the New York-based auction house
said.  Chinese bidders pushed prices of diamonds and Ming
porcelain to records at a Hong Kong auction last night, as
wealthy Asians poured money into an investment class that’s
centuries old amid volatile global stock markets.  The Sotheby’s salesroom erupted in applause after a 6.01
carat blue diamond ring sold for HK$79.1 million ($10 million),
the most paid at auction per carat for such a stone. At the
ceramics sale next door a vase went for HK$167.8 million, the
highest auction price for a Ming dynasty piece and double its
HK$80 million top estimate.  “Chinese art is still going strong,” said London-based
art dealer William Qian, who bid unsuccessfully on the vase.
“People still buying suggests this is a very healthy form of
art to invest in.” Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has slumped more
than 26 percent this year.  The blue-and-white vase was the subject of a 10-minute
battle between two Asian telephone bidders. It was one of 32
lots of Imperial porcelain out of 40 works from the Meiyintang
private collection that sold in about an hour, raising HK$560
million, compared with an estimate of HK$430 million.  Imperial Seals  Together with a separate sale of fine Chinese ceramics and
works of art, including imperial seals, jade and lacquer and
jewelry, Sotheby’s achieved HK$1.48 billion yesterday.  The total for the first five days alone, including
contemporary and 20th-century Asian art and wine, was HK$3.1
billion, exceeding Sotheby’s HK$2.7 billion estimate.  Not all the most-expensive items succeeded. The top lot in
yesterday’s jewelry sale, a 9.27 carat pink diamond ring with a
high estimate of HK$150 million didn’t sell.  Wealthy Chinese keen to repatriate their cultural heritage
helped set a record for 20th-century master  Zhang Daqian  on Oct.
4. His 1961 color picture “Self Portrait in Yellow Mountains”
was the top selling lot. The ink-and-watercolor work fetched
HK$46.6 million, almost four times its high estimate of HK$12
million. Works by  Lin Fengmian  and Qi Baishi also sold at
several times estimates.  Almost 12 hours of bidding on 364 lots of Chinese fine-
paintings on Oct. 4 raised HK$738.3 million including fees, the
highest for the New York-based auction house in that art
category. The presale estimate was HK$200 million at hammer
prices, which don’t include the buyer’s premium.  Actress Jewels  Watches and jewelry from the estate of Hong Kong singer and
actress Anita Mui also went on sale yesterday, with 100 percent
of items selling for a total of HK$6.8 million. Sotheby’s also
raised $HK2.1 million for the University of Oxford’s China
Center in a charity event on Oct. 4.  On the final day, Sotheby's sold HK$112 million, or $14 
million, worth of timepieces. This was the highest it has 
achieved at a watch sale worldwide, with 23 lots selling for 
more than HK$1 million. The most expensive lot was a vintage
Patek Philippe pink-gold wristwatch that sold for HK$5.5 
million, exceeding its high estimate of HK$4.8 million.  Buyer’s premium, the commission added to the hammer price
of works sold, was 25 percent for the first HK$400,000, 20
percent for lots fetching as much as HK$8 million, and 12
percent above that. The wine premium was a flat 21 percent.
Estimates reflect the hammer price, before premium.  Potential buyers who weren’t represented at the  Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre  sale were able to bid 
via Sotheby’s  online bidding system .  To contact the reporter on this story
