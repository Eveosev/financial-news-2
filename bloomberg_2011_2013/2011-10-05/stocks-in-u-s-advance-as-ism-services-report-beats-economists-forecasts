U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses after reports on jobs growth and American  service
industries  topped estimates and investors watched for progress
in  Europe ’s efforts to tame its debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,122.72 at 10:13 a.m. in  New York  after tumbling as much as 0.7
percent and gaining 0.4 percent.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses decreased to 53 in September from 53.3
a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The
figure topped the median estimate of economists for a drop to
52.8.  U.S. stock futures gained before the open of exchanges
after companies in the U.S. added 91,000 jobs in September,
according to ADP Employer Services. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 75,000 gain.
Labor Department data in two days is forecast to show a 90,000
increase in private jobs and a net 60,000 gain in non-farm
payrolls, according to the median economist estimates in a
survey, with the jobless rate projected to remain at 9.1
percent.  Yesterday’s Rally  The  S&P 500  closed 2.3 percent higher yesterday after the
Financial Times quoted EU Economic and Monetary Commissioner
Olli Rehn as saying European leaders were discussing a
coordinated effort to recapitalize the region’s banks. It was
the 10th time since 1985 that the index posted a loss of 1
percent or more at 3 p.m. and was up when the market closed,
according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group LLC in
Harrison, New York. The measure declined the next day eight
times, with losses averaging 1.3 percent, the data show.  Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, will mark
the unofficial start of the earnings-reporting season when it
reports results on Oct. 11. Third-quarter profits for S&P 500
companies are projected to have grown 13 percent, according to
analyst forecast compiled by Bloomberg, down from an estimate of
17 percent when the index traded at a three-year high at the end
of April.  Brian Belski , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &
Co. in New York, predicted a “nice year-end rally” in stocks
after profits come in higher than analysts’ estimated.  “Earnings will surprise to the upside, earnings estimates
have been slashed too much,” Belski said on Bloomberg
Television’s “Inside Track With Deirdre Bolton and Erik
Schatzker.” “Corporate America has gone through so much
structural reform in the last 10 or 12 years that they continue
to be positioned to under-promise, over-deliver.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
