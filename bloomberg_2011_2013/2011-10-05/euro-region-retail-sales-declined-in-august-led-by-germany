European retail sales declined in
August as a worsening debt crisis and slowing economic growth
prompted households from  Germany  to Ireland to cut spending.  Sales in the 17-nation euro region decreased 0.3 percent
from July, when they rose 0.2 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That matched the
median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Sales dropped 1 percent from a year earlier after declining an
annual 0.4 percent in July.  European retailers may struggle to maintain growth as
governments from Italy to Ireland step up austerity measures to
contain the region’s fiscal crisis. Services output contracted
in September and households grew more pessimistic about the
outlook.  L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest cosmetics maker, on
Aug. 30 reported weaker-than-expected earnings.  The euro was little changed against the dollar after the
data, trading at $1.3325 at 10:03 a.m. in  London , down 0.2
percent on the day.  In Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, August retail sales
dropped 2.9 percent from July, when they rose 0.3 percent,
today’s report showed. Irish sales fell 0.4 percent in the
latest month, while Austria reported a decline of 0.2 percent.  In Spain, France and Portugal, retail sales increased from
the previous month. The statistics office didn’t provide August
figures Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
