The last contender to enter the Republican presidential race is on track to be the first in fundraising. Texas Governor  Rick Perry  has raised more than $17 million for his presidential bid,  his campaign announced today . The donations represent just 49 days of fundraising, from his entry into the race on Aug. 13 to Sept. 30. Perry's fundraising total will likely exceed anything raised by his Republican presidential rivals for the third quarter.  Bloomberg News reported today  that, in the same period, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney could report up to $14 million and U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  has raised more than $8 million. The fundraising figures may provide a needed boost to Perry's campaign after his  recent drops in opinion polls . The  latest CBS News poll  of Republican primary voters shows Perry at 12 percent support, an 11 percent drop in two weeks. The poll, conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 2, shows Romney and Herman Cain tied in first place, at 17 percent. With Perry on the defensive lately for his  views on Social Security , his  stance on the death penalty  and his  support of legislation  providing in-state tuition to the children of undocumented immigrants, will this fundraising boost be enough to turn his campaign around?
