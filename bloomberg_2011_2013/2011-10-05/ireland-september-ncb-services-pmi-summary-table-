Markit Economics today released the September
NCB Stockbrokers services purchasing managersâ€™ index for
Ireland. The Services PMI is based on a survey of
companies in the Republic of Ireland services sector and is
designed to provide the most up-to-date picture of business conditions
in the services sector. Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below
50, a contraction. The greater the divergence from 50, the
greater the rate of change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
