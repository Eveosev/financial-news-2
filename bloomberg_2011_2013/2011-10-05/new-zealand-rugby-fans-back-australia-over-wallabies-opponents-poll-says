New Zealand rugby fans are more
likely to support  Australia  than its opponents when they are not
playing the All Blacks, according to an opinion poll.  Forty six percent of New Zealanders would support Australia
while 33 percent would support the opponents, according to a UMR
Research poll of 750 people taken in the four days ended Oct. 3.  When Australia plays  South Africa  in a Rugby World Cup
quarterfinal on Oct. 9 it will have support of 63 percent of New
Zealand fans, while the Springboks will get 25 percent support,
UMR said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
