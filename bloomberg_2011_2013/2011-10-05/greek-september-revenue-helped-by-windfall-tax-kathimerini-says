Greek government net revenue
increased 3.2 percent in September from the same month a year
earlier, helped by a windfall tax on companies and individuals,
Kathimerini reported, without saying how it got the information.  The windfall tax raised 650 million euros ($865 million) in
September, its first month of implementation, according to the
Athens-based newspaper. The target is to raise 1.6 billion euros
by the end of the year, Kathimerini said.  <a href="www.kathimerini.gr">Click here for web link</a>  To contact the reporter on this story:
