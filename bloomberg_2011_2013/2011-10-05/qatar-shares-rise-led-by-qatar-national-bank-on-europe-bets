coordinated approach to halt the debt crisis. Belgian Prime
Minister  Yves Leterme  said a “bad bank” for troubled assets

and global markets are looking healthy” today, said Paul Cooper, Dubai-based managing director at Sarasin-Alpen &
Partners Ltd., which oversees more than $500 million in the

positive in the region, especially compared to the U.S. and
 Europe .”  Profit Rises  Jarir’s third-quarter net income advanced to 152 million
