Spanish savings banks Unicaja,
Novacaixagalicia and BMN asked  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  Chairman
Luis Del Rivero for a detailed plan to refinance the loan it
took to buy 20 percent of  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  and to raise 1.5 billion
euros ($2 billion),  El Mundo  reported.  Sacyr may get the funds by selling assets or by selling a
minority stake in Repsol, which is unlikely now, the newspaper
reported, citing unidentified people close to Sacyrâ€™s board. The
three savings banks own a 13 percent stake of Sacyr, El Mundo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
