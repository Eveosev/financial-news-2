Bertolt Flick, the chief executive
officer of AirBaltic AS, resigned yesterday after shareholders
agreed to a capital increase.  “As an owner of the airline, I want to act for the good of
AirBaltic’s future, and today I have agreed to resign as the
agreement with the shareholders requires,” Flick said in an e-
mailed statement last night.  The Latvian government and the company’s minority
shareholder, Baltic Aviation Systems, agreed to invest a
combined 107 million lati ($201 million) in the company’s
capital after the airline posted a loss last year and continued
to lose money this year. The government made Flick’s resignation
a condition for any increase in capital.  The state owns 52.6 percent of AirBaltic, while Baltic
Aviation Systems has 47.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
