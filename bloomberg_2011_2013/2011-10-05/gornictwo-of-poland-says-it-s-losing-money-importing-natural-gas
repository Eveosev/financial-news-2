Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , Poland’s dominant  natural-gas  supplier, is
posting losses on imports of the fuel that aren’t being covered
by profit on domestically produced gas, a company official said.  “This pattern has persisted since the middle of the
year,” Deputy Chief Executive Officer Miroslaw Szkaluba told
reporters in Warsaw today.  PGNiG, as Gornictwo is known, buys about two-thirds of its
gas from  Russia  at a price set in dollars based on a nine-month
average of oil-related products, and sells it at a rate set in
zloty by the regulator. In the third quarter, the zloty weakened
by 17 percent against the dollar.  The company boosted sales of the fuel in January through
September by “several percent” from a year earlier, Szkaluba
said. Third-quarter sales declined “slightly,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
