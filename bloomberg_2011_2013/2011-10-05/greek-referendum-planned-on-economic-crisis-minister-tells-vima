Greece ’s government will hold a
referendum by the end of the year on matters relating to the
economic crisis, To Vima newspaper said, citing Interior
Minister Haris Kastanidis.  The referendum won’t ask whether the country should remain
in the euro area, the Athens-based newspaper quoted Kastanidis
saying. There is “no chance” of a question on dropping the
euro or re-adopting the drachma, Vima cited him saying. He
didn’t give further details on the subjects, To Vima said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
