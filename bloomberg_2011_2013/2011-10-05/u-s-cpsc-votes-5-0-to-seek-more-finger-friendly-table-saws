The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission voted 5-0 today to take the first steps toward
regulating table saws, which have been blamed for more than
4,000 finger, hand and arm injuries a year.  The agency will examine technologies, such as offered by
closely held SawStop LLC, that can stop the blade instantly when
human flesh is detected and may eventually issue a rule, Scott
Wolfson, an agency spokesman said. The CPSC will seek comments
from the industry and the general public before moving to a more
specific proposal, he said.  Stephen Gass, founder of Tualatin, Oregon-based SawStop,
first petitioned the CPSC more than eight years ago to consider
his technology after being turned down by power-tool companies
on licensing deals. The Power Tool Institute, which represents
manufacturers such as  Robert Bosch GmbH ,  Stanley Black & Decker
Inc. (SWK) ,  Ryobi Ltd. (5851) , and  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , warned that a
mandatory standard could create a monopoly for Gass, who they
say has locked up more than 70 patents.  “Unfortunately, for consumers, such a mandatory standard
could as much as quadruple the cost of current, inexpensive saws
and significantly increase the cost of professional saws on the
market today,” Susan Young, executive director of the
Cleveland-based Power Tool Institute, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
