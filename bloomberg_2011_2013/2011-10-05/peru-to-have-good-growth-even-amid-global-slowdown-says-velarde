Peru can post “very good” growth
even as the U.S. and  Europe  expand at “anaemic” rates, said
Julio Velarde, president of the Andean nation’s central bank.   If the global economy deteriorates, “we would suffer less
than other countries because we have the tools to respond,”
Velarde said in reference to monetary and fiscal stimulus.  Velarde spoke in congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
