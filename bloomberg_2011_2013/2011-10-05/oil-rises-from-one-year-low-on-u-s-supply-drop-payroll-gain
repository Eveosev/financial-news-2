Oil in  New York  rose the most in
almost five months after the U.S. government reported an
unexpected supply decline and economic data exceeded estimates.  Futures climbed 5.3 percent after the Energy Department
said stockpiles fell 4.68 million barrels to 336.3 million last
week. A gain of 1.5 million barrels was expected, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. ADP Employer Services showed U.S.
companies added more jobs than expected in September, and the
Institute for Supply Management reported growth in services.  “The DOE report is bullish, any way you look at it,” said
Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and research with
Blue Ocean LLC in New York. “The key to where prices move from
here is the economy.”  Crude oil for November delivery increased $4.01 to settle
at $79.68 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Yesterday, futures dropped to $75.67, the lowest close since
Sept. 23, 2010. Prices are down 13 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement rose $2.94, or 2.9
percent, to end the session at $102.73 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract’s close
yesterday represented a 21 percent drop since April 8, when
prices ended the session at $126.65 a barrel. A 20 percent drop
is the common definition of a  bear market .  Crude imports fell 10 percent to 8.7 million barrels a day
last week, the report showed. Imports on the Gulf of Mexico
coast, the region known as PADD 3, tumbled 16 percent to 4.26
million barrels a day.  ‘Lot Less Bullish’  “The numbers are a lot less bullish than they initially
appeared,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “It looks like refiners, especially
along the  Gulf Coast , are intentionally working down their
stocks. It’s not a sign that there’s a shortage.”  Crude supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, tumbled 831,000
barrels to 30.1 million, the lowest level since March 2010.  Gasoline supplies declined 1.14 million barrels to 213.7
million last week, the report showed. A 1.5 million-barrel
increase was forecast, according to the median of 15 analyst
projections in the Bloomberg News survey.  “Today’s report was bullish but I am still looking for
spots to sell,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at Adam
Mesh Trading Group in New York. “We were at $90 a couple of
weeks ago and have come down quite a lot. We dropped to the $75
area and found support and when it nears $80 I will sell.”  Recession Concern  Yesterday, oil dropped as much as 3.4 percent to $74.95,
the lowest intraday level in more than a year, on concern the
U.S. and  Europe  are moving into recession.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected that
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP would report an advance of 75,000
jobs. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index fell to 53 in September from 53.3 in August, beating the
median forecast of 52.8. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled yesterday
he’ll push forward with further expansion of monetary stimulus
if needed. He said that the Fed’s remaining tools to boost
growth include giving more information about its pledge to keep
 interest rates  low at least through mid-2013, reducing the rate
paid on banks’ reserve deposits and buying more securities.  Macroeconomic Picture  “The inventory numbers were clearly bullish and
supportive,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston. “Whether we hold onto today’s gains later
this week will depend on the macroeconomic picture and what
equities do.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.2 percent to
1,137.33 at 2:30 p.m., when the Nymex floor closed, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  gained 0.8 percent to 10,892.04. Both
indexes extended gains after the close.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket
of oil grades fell to $98.59 yesterday, the lowest level since
Feb. 14. The group last met in June, when six members including
 Iran  rejected a Saudi proposal to replace lost Libyan barrels.
OPEC next meets on Dec. 14 in Vienna.  “I’m sure that when Brent dropped below $100 someone at
OPEC was taking note,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy
economist at Deutsche Bank in  Washington . “The recent price
move will be taken into account when they meet in December.”  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s biggest oil producer, vowed to use
“an iron fist” after 11 members of the security forces were
injured by attackers during unrest in the Shiite Muslim town of
Awwamiya in the east, the official Saudi Press Agency said. The
government accused an unnamed “foreign country” of seeking to
undermine stability, the news service reported.  “There’s a little unrest in the  Eastern Province  of Saudi
Arabia, which is always a cause for concern,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.3 billion.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 586,593
contracts as of 3:30 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 789,626
contracts yesterday, 19 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.43 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
