Cyprus said it’s ready to sign a deal
for a 2.5 billion-euro ($3.3 billion) loan from  Russia , helping
the east Mediterranean island to control its borrowing costs.  The cabinet asked finance minister Kikis Kazamias to
complete the deal, government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said
today in an e-mailed statement. The annual  interest rate  is 4.5
percent and it will mature in 4 1/2 years, Stefanou said.  “The Republic of Cyprus has a right to pay back the loan
at an earlier stage without any additional charges,” he said.  The deal offers “significant benefits,” including
covering short-term and medium-term financing needs and avoiding
resorting to lending from domestic banks, the spokesman said.  The euro area’s third-smallest economy aims at slashing its
deficit to 2.3 percent of the economy in 2012 from a forecast
6.5 percent this year, Kazamias said Sept. 28. Public debt is
expected to climb to 65 percent of gross domestic product in
2011 and remain at the same level next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
