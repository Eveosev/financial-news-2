The Australian dollar rose against
the dollar and yen as stocks gained amid increasing demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie fell earlier on bets the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will reduce its main  interest rate  and Europe’s
leaders may fail to quell market jitters amid work on a second
aid package for Greece. New Zealand’s dollar rose after a report
showed U.S. service industries expanded last month, damping
economic concern.  “We’re following equity markets,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New
York. “Global equity markets are reasonably firm. The ISM
numbers are consistent with slow growth and not a recession in
the U.S. and I think that’s the view the market has been
shifting to a little bit.”  Australia’s currency rose 0.8 percent to 96.51 U.S. cents
as of 2:28 p.m. in New York, from 95.72 cents yesterday and
after earlier dropping to as low as 94.88 cents. It gained 0.8
percent to 74.12 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar traded at 76.62 U.S.
cents from 76.01. It fetched 58.81 yen from 58.39 yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index fell to 53 in September from 53.3 in August, higher than
the 52.8 forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Aussie and kiwi dropped earlier after Moody’s Investors
Service yesterday lowered Italy’s rating three levels to A2 from
Aa2, with a negative outlook.  Australia’s central bank signaled yesterday it has scope to
lower the nation’s cash target from its current level of 4.75
percent if necessary as inflationary pressures ease. Investors
see a 75 percent chance of a half percentage point reduction in
November, according to cash rate futures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
