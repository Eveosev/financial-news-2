Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures gained for the first day in four after the
U.S. government reported an unexpected decline in inventories.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 49.7 percent at 1:30 p.m. in New
York, down from 55.7 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery jumped $3.69, or 4.9 percent, to
$79.36 a barrel at 1:52 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile

today was December $70 puts, with 1,582 lots changing hands. The
options declined $1.26 to $2.14 a barrel. November $75 puts, the
next-most-active contract, fell $1.57 to $1.35 on volume of
1,226. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The volume of puts outnumbered calls by about 52 percent to
48 percent.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
