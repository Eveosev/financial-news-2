President  Barack Obama  signed a
stopgap funding bill to keep the government operating through
Nov. 18, the White House said in a statement.  The president’s signature buys time for lawmakers to hammer
out long-term funding for the 2012 fiscal year, which began Oct.
1. Congress, divided over spending priorities, hasn’t approved
any of the bills required each year to operate federal
departments and agencies.  The bill is H.R. 2608.  To contact the reporter on this story:
