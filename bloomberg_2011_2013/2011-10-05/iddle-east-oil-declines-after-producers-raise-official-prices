Crude oil from the  Middle East  for
sale to  Asia  fell for a second day after producers raised their
official selling prices, damping demand from refiners.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in November dropped 5 cents to a premium of 8 cents a barrel
compared with its official selling price, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Lower Zakum, also produced in the emirate,
fell 14 cents to a premium of 11 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. Qatar Marine remained at a premium of 13 cents a barrel.  Qatar Petroleum , the state-owned producer in the country
that last year sold all of its supplies to Asia, raised the
official prices of its two export grades. Qatar Marine increased
to $107.85 a barrel, up from $105.60, and Land climbed to $110
from $108.15. This came a day after Abu Dhabi National lifted
its official levels.  Qatar’s change increases the Marine price to a premium of
$1.54 a barrel to the Dubai price published by Platts for the
same period. That’s the most since at least the beginning of
2008, according to Bloomberg calculations. Land climbed to $3.69
above the benchmark, the highest since May.  Dubai swaps for December widened to a premium of 74 cents a
barrel today over January from 70 cents yesterday, according to
data from London-based brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased 58 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $97.19 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December increased 0.6 percent to $96.61. Murban
for spot delivery climbed 1.1 percent to $101.28.  Oman futures for December delivery rose $1.01 to $97.56 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 6:04 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,215 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$98.35 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed 3 cents to $5.15 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December rose 7 cents to $4.07.  To contact the reporter on this story:
