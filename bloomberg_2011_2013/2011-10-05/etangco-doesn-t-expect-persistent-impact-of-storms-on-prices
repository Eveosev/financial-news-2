Philippine inflation remains
manageable even as the central bank monitors the effect of
recent storms on prices, Governor Amando Tetangco said in a
mobile phone message today.  “Our expectation is that this should not have a persistent
impact on inflation over the policy horizon,” Tetangco said
after the government reported that inflation last month
accelerated. “We continue to be mindful of global developments,
particularly growth prospects in advanced economies. We are also
watchful of policy developments to resolve the European debt
crisis as these could impact on risk appetite and capital flows
in emerging market economies, including the  Philippines .”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
