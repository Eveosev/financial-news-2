OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the  oil company  controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , may delay the start of output by another month until
December as it waits for a floating production unit.  The rig will arrive in the Rio de Janeiro port tomorrow and
will have to pass through customs before heading to the offshore
Campos Basin, Luiz Eduardo Carneiro, head of Batista’s  OSX
Brasil SA (OSXB3)  platforms supplier, told reporters in the city today.
OGX had previously pushed back its plan to start production to
November from October because OSX missed an Aug. 1 target to
ship the platform from Singapore.  OGX has had 100 percent exploration success in the Campos
Basin off the coast of Rio and expects combined output in the
country and Colombia to reach 1.4 million barrels a day by 2019,
more than half Brazil’s current production.  OGX closed unchanged from yesterday in Sao Paulo trading,
at 10.80 reais. It’s down 46 percent this year, more than a 26
percent drop in the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
