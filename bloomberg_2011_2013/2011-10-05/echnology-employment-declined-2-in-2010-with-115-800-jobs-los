The U.S. high-technology industry
lost 115,800 jobs in 2010, a 2 percent decline that marked the
industry’s second consecutive year of falling employment.  The job losses were less than half the 249,500 positions
eliminated in 2009, according to a report released today by the
 TechAmerica Foundation , a non-profit, non-partisan affiliate of
the Washington-based trade group TechAmerica.  Three of the industry’s four sectors -- communications
services, technology manufacturing and engineering and
technology services -- lost jobs in 2010, according to the
report, which was based on data from the  U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics . Software services, which includes  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , was the only sector to add jobs, expanding by
22,800 positions for an increase of 1 percent.  The industry has shown signs of recovery this year, adding
115,000 jobs through June, according to a separate report from
the foundation today. Technology companies employed 5.89 million
workers as of June, according to the mid-year report, which was
also based on BLS data. All four sectors added jobs in the first
half of 2011, led by engineering and technology services.  President  Barack Obama  has touted the technology industry
as a vehicle for creating jobs to lower the nation’s 9.1 percent
unemployment rate. As part of his $447 billion jobs proposal,
Obama is pushing policies supported by the technology industry
that include science and math education reforms and the
authorization of trade agreements with  South Korea , Columbia and
 Panama .  Job Growth  “To restore job growth in the U.S. tech industry, the
Unites States needs to focus on” fostering “a technically
skilled workforce by educating American youth in math, science
and engineering, and by welcoming -- not shunning -- highly
skilled talent from across the globe,”  Robert Bennett , chairman
of the foundation, and Matthew Kazmierczak, senior vice
president of the foundation, wrote in the 2010 report.  Technology industry positions paid a 93 percent higher wage
than the typical private-sector job last year, with the average
high-tech worker earning $86,800 in 2010, according to the
annual report. The best paid technology workers in 2010 were
computer and peripheral equipment manufacturers, who brought in
a $125,600 annual wage.  “Innovation has created entirely new industries and is
largely responsible for the dramatic increases in productivity
that help raise American wages and living standards and create
high-paying jobs,” said Bennett and Kazmierczak in the report.  Software Services Dominated  High-tech jobs comprised 10.5 percent of the total private-
sector payroll in the U.S. in 2010. The increase in software
services employment occurred as the area “dominated” growth in
the number of high-tech establishments by adding 5,800
businesses, according to the annual report.  In the first half of 2011, the engineering and technology
services sector added 56,800 positions -- the most jobs added by
sector, according to the mid-year report.  On average, every new technology job supports three jobs in
other areas of the economy, according to Ed Lazowska, former
chairman of the Computer Science Department at the  University of
Washington . The multiplier for information-technology jobs is
nearly 5 to 1 because those jobs pay, on average, nearly double
the state average in wages and benefits, according to Lazowska.  Employment in the technology industry in 2010 surpassed the
finance and insurance industry, which employed 5.48 million
people in 2010. Unemployment in the four high-tech sectors
included in the report averaged 5.5 percent.  Virginia led the nation with the highest concentration of
technology workers for the sixth consecutive year. Ninety-eight
of every 1,000 private-sector workers in the state are employed
in high-tech jobs. Eight states added technology jobs in 2010,
including  Michigan ,  West Virginia  and  Utah , along with the
 District of Columbia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
