Spain  may have its Aa2  credit rating 
lowered two steps by Moody’s Investors Service after the firm
downgraded  Italy  and said European nations ranked below the top
Aaa level face possible cuts, according to  RBC Capital Markets .  “Two-thirds of Moody’s rationale for downgrading Italy can
be applied to Spain as well,” Norbert Aul, a European interest-
rate strategist, said in a phone interview. With Spain under
review for a possible downgrade, that could imply a cut of “two
notches,” he said.  Two-year Spanish notes fell, pushing the yield up two basis
points to 3.50 percent at 10:29 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
