Companies in the U.S. added 91,000
jobs in September, according to data from ADP Employer Services.  The increase followed a revised 89,000 gain the prior
month, Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP said today. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an
advance of 75,000.  Job gains haven’t been sufficient to bring down the
 unemployment rate , which has held at or above 9 percent for 26
of the past 28 months. A Labor Department report in two days is
projected to show businesses added 90,000 jobs in September,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed.  “Employment is likely to languish over the intermediate
term until business leaders see an improvement in both actual
demand and their demand expectations,”  Russell Price , senior
economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in  Detroit , said before
the report.  Projections in the Bloomberg survey of 39 economists ranged
from declines of 10,000 to gains of 117,000.  Service industries  expanded at a faster pace than forecast
in September, another report showed. The Institute for Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses decreased to
53 in September from 53.3 a month earlier. A reading above 50
signals expansion.  Survey Results  The measure was projected to drop to 52.8, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates from 75
economists surveyed ranged from 51.3 to 55. The Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s index averaged 56.1 in the five years to December
2007, when the last recession began.  Stocks climbed after the ISM report. The Standard & Poor’s
50 Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,126.41 at 10:08 a.m. in  New York .
 Treasury securities  dropped, sending the yield on the benchmark
10-year note up to 1.89 percent from 1.82 percent late
yesterday.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in March, when it understated the gain in jobs by
29,000. The estimate was least accurate in June, when it
overestimated the increase in employment by 100,000.  Last month, ADP’s initial figures showed a 91,000 gain in
company payrolls for August, while the Labor Department’s data
showed an increase of 17,000 private payrolls.  ‘Tepid’ Conditions  “You have to characterize labor-market conditions as tepid
and disappointing,”  Joel Prakken , senior managing director of
 Macroeconomic Advisers , which produces that data with ADP, said
on a conference call from  St. Louis . “There is an element of
structural unemployment that persists.”  Employers announced the most job cuts in more than two
years in September, led by planned reductions at Bank of America
Corp. and in the military, another report today showed.  Announced firings jumped 212 percent, the largest increase
since January 2009, to 115,730 last month from 37,151 in
September 2010, according to Chicago-based Challenger, Gray &
Christmas Inc. Cuts in government employment, led by the Army’s
five-year troop reduction plan, and at Bank of America accounted
for almost 70 percent of the announcements.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 1,000 workers in
goods-producing industries last month, which include
manufacturers and construction companies. Employment at
factories fell by 5,000.  Factory Orders  Orders to manufacturers, a stalwart of the expansion,
contracted for a third consecutive month in September, the first
such series of declines since the recession ended in June 2009,
according to figures this week from the  Institute for Supply
Management .  Service providers added 90,000 workers in September,
today’s figures showed.  Companies employing more than 499 workers cut 5,000 jobs.
Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, increased
payrolls by 36,000 and employment at small companies climbed by
60,000, ADP said.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking before
Congress’s Joint Economic Committee in  Washington , yesterday
said the central bank stood ready to take additional steps to
boost growth and urged lawmakers against taking steps to curtain
the  budget deficit  that might harm an already “sluggish”
recovery.  “Recent indicators, including new claims for  unemployment
insurance  and surveys of hiring plans, point to the likelihood
of more sluggish job growth in the period ahead,” Bernanke said.
Fed officials expect a “somewhat slower pace of economic growth
over coming quarters” than they did in June, he said, without
giving a specific forecast.  Unemployment  The Labor Department figures on Oct. 7 will also show the
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent last month, according to the
Bloomberg survey median.  Total payrolls are forecast to increase by 60,000 after no
change in August, according to the Bloomberg survey. Private
payrolls, which exclude government jobs, are forecast to rise
from 17,000 in August.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest  U.S. bank , is among firms
that have turned more cautious about hiring. It said last month
it will limit hiring to only “critical” jobs as the economic
slowdown continues and revenue slumps.  “We are currently only filling positions we believe are
critical to the line of business or function,”  Shannon Bell , a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said in an interview
Sept. 15.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
companies with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
