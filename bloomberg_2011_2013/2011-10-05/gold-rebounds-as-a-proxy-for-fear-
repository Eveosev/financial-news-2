Gold futures rose for the third time
in four sessions on demand for a haven amid persistent concerns
that  Europe ’s debt crisis will hinder the global economy.  Yesterday, Italy’s credit rating was cut for the first time
in almost two decades by Moody’s Investors Service, which said
that other euro-area nations ranked below the top Aaa level may
have their grades lowered amid contagion from the region’s
budget woes. Wheat and corn led a rally in raw materials on
signs the U.S. may take more step to bolster a recovery.  “People are buying gold as proxy for fear,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at MF Global Holdings
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Also, the
strength in the commodities pack is helping gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $25.60, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $1,641.60 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the metal fell as much as 1.2
percent.  “Physical demand has been reinvigorated at these  price
levels ,” Suki Cooper, an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in New
York, said in a report.  Futures reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6 as investors
sought alternatives to equities and some currencies. The metal
has climbed 15 percent this year. Spot gold is in the 11th year
of a bull market, the longest rally since at least 1920.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 51.3 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $30.352 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the
metal tumbled as much as 4.7 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery gained $14.30, or 1 percent, to $1,482.90 an
ounce, ending a five-session slump, the longest since June.  Palladium futures for December delivery climbed $6.20, or
1.1 percent, to $570.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
