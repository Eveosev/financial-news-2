South Korea’s won swung between gains
and losses as the biggest drop in the nation’s foreign-exchange
reserves in almost three years countered optimism the  Federal
Reserve  may take additional steps to revive the  U.S. economy .  The currency advanced as much as 0.5 percent after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress that the central bank
“is prepared to take further action” to boost the world’s
largest economy. South Korea’s foreign-exchange reserves fell to
$303.4 billion in September from $312.2 billion a month earlier,
the most since November 2008, the Bank of Korea said today. The
drop came as Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said the government
will act to stabilize the financial markets when needed.  The won was little changed at 1,193.59 per dollar as of
10:07 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 1,208.25 yesterday, its weakest level since
July 2010. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares rose on
speculation the  European Central Bank  will step up monetary
stimulus at a meeting tomorrow.  “There is a lot of uncertainty in the market, which makes
investors react to the smallest positive, negative news,” said
Hwang Sun Min, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Kookmin Bank.
“European leaders say they will act to stem the region’s debt
crisis, but nothing has really been decided yet.”  South Korea’s benchmark three-year bonds rose for a third
day, pushing yields to the lowest level in a week. The rate on
the 3.5 percent notes due June 2014 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.46 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
