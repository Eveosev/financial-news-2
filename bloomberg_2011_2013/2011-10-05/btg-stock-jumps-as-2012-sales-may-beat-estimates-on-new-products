BTG Plc (BGC) , a British specialist
drugmaker, rose the most in more than a year in London trading
after saying 2012 sales may beat analyst estimates, helped by
new treatments and a rival’s product withdrawal.  BTG jumped 27 pence, or 11 percent, to 265 pence, the
biggest gain since Sept. 10, 2010.  Sales for the 12 months through March 2012 may total as
much as 165 million pounds ($255 million), London-based BTG said
today in a statement. That compares with the 140 million-pound
average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue has been boosted by regulatory approval for Zytiga,
a hormone therapy for prostate cancer, as well as demand for its
hemophilia drug Benefix, BTG said. Sales of the company’s
DigiFab digoxin-poisoning antidote, approved for marketing in
the U.K. in July, have been helped by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s
withdrawal of the competing DigiBind treatment, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
