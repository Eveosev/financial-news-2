Bank Vozrozhdenie rose the most in
more than a week after Vedomosti reported former Promstyroybank
owner Vladimir Kogan wants to buy the regional lender, citing
unidentified people with the knowledge of the talks.  The shares jumped 5 percent higher at 719.9 rubles by the
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest gain since Sept. 26.  “Though this story is unconfirmed, we think it’s worth
staying tuned for further developments on the M&A theme, as M&A
may become a positive catalyst for the stock price,” Svetlana Kovalskaya, an equity analyst at  Renaissance Capital , wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
