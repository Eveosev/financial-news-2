Alstom SA (ALO) , the French maker of power
equipment, is close to signing its third contract in Brazil to
sell wind turbines as the company seeks to capture a greater
share of the country’s expanding wind market.  The turbines will be manufactured at Alstom’s factory in
the northeastern state of Bahia once it begins production in
November, Philippe Delleur, president of the company’s Brazil
unit, said today in a telephone interview.  Brazil plans to build more than 10,000 megawatts of wind
farms over the next nine years, according to a draft of its
latest 10-year energy  plan . Numerous international companies,
including  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , are
building factories in the country to provide equipment the
projects will need.  “We’ve got ambitious plans,” for the Brazilian wind
market, he said. “We already manufacture hydro turbines there
so we have the connections and personnel.”  Alstom, based in Levallois-Perret,  France , has signed two
contracts to supply wind turbines in Brazil worth a total 300
million reais ($163 million) with local developers Brasventos SA
and Desenvix SA.  Its third contract will be signed with a developer that
sold electricity in a government-organized auction for new power
capacity in August, Delleur said.  Brazil has 60 wind farms with total capacity of 1,205
megawatts in operation, according to Brasilia-based electricity
regulator Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
