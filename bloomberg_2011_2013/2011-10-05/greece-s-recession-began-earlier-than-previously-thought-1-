Greece ’s economy entered a recession
a year earlier than previously thought and contracted less last
year than initially estimated, according to revised data from
the  Hellenic Statistical Authority  today.  Gross domestic product declined 0.2 percent in 2008, down
from a previous reading of 1 percent growth, the Athens-based
authority said in an e-mailed report. GDP shrank 3.2 percent in
2009, more than the previously estimated 2 percent drop, and
fell 3.5 percent last year, less than a prior estimate that
showed a 4.5 percent contraction.  The data, revised in cooperation with Eurostat,  Europe ’s
statistics agency, mean Greece’s economy will contract for a
fifth year in 2012, according to the country’s draft budget that
forecasts GDP falling 2.5 percent next year after declining 5.5
percent in 2011. Greece’s  Finance Ministry  said the new figures
don’t affect targets in the 2011 and 2012 budgets.  “The new data don’t impact on the fiscal goals for 2011
and 2012, which are defined in absolute terms and are the basis
on which the draft 2012 budget was submitted to Parliament,”
the Athens-based Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  The new data contained revised estimates for final
consumption, gross fixed-capital formation on homes, and imports
and exports of ships, the statistics authority said. On the
basis of the new figures, the final deficit figure for 2009 was
15.7 percent of GDP, according to the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
