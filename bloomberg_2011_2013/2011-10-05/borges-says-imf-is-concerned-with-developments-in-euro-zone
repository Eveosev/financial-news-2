Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said the Washington-
based fund is “concerned” with the economic and fiscal
developments in the euro zone.  “We are at this moment concerned with developments in
 Europe ,” Borges spoke at a press conference in Brussels today.
The economic outlook has “weakened” and “the sovereign debt
