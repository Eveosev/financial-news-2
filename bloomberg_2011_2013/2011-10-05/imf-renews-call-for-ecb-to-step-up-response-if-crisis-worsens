The  International Monetary Fund 
renewed its call for the  European Central Bank  to step up its
response to the region’s debt crisis if it continues to threaten
growth and destabilize financial markets.  The ECB “should lower its policy rate if downside risks to
growth and inflation persist,” the Washington-based lender said
in its biannual regional economic outlook for Europe,
reiterating comments made in its World Economic Outlook on Sept.
20. “The ECB might need to reinstate some of its longer-term
liquidity provision operations if stresses on interbank markets
intensify further” and make an “explicit commitment” to buy
 government bonds  “for as long as necessary,” the IMF said.  The ECB, which has lifted its benchmark  interest rate  twice
this year to tame inflation stuck above its 2 percent limit,
last month lowered its growth outlook, giving officials the
option to take further action should the crisis worsen. Policy
makers have already reintroduced a six-month loan to banks and
committed to provide them with unlimited liquidity until the end
of the year. They are also considering long-term loans and
restarting covered-bond purchases, according to a euro-region
central bank official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Economists predict the ECB will lower its key rate by 25
basis points to 1.25 percent in December, the median of 34
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  ‘Severe’ Repercussions  The IMF last month cut its growth forecast for the 17-
nation euro area and predicted “severe” repercussions if
lawmakers fail to contain a fiscal crisis that has pushed  Greece 
to the edge of default. European governments yesterday indicated
investors may be saddled with bigger losses on Greek debt,
intensifying market jitters that a second aid package negotiated
in July might unravel.  “Given persistent tensions in euro-area sovereign markets
and global weaknesses, downside risks remain particularly
acute,” the IMF said. “Renewed concerns about policy slippages
in program countries or lack of commitment to continued support
of program countries at the euro-area level could amplify the
shockwaves seen during the 2011 summer throughout the euro area
with adverse repercussions regionally and globally.”  European stocks fell for a third day yesterday and
investors shunned riskier countries’ bonds amid concern that the
crisis is careening out of control. The euro has dropped 10
percent in the past five months and traded at $1.3308 at 10:15
a.m. in  Frankfurt .  ‘Lost Confidence’  “A lot of people have lost confidence in whether Europe is
going to make it,” Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer
 Josef Ackermann  said yesterday, after  Germany ’s biggest lender
scrapped its profit forecast and announced 500 job cuts and
further writedowns of Greek bond holdings.  “My strong conviction is yes, we will, but it will take
much longer than some people think and that will have an impact
on the real economy but also an impact on the financial
markets,” Ackermann said.  The IMF forecasts euro-area growth of 1.6 percent this year
and 1.1 percent in 2012, with the Portuguese and Greek economies
remaining in recession until mid-2012 and early 2013
respectively. Capital buffers remain low in a “significant
number” of euro-region banks and should be strengthened, the
IMF said.  “ Crisis management  in the euro area needs to go beyond its
current approach to secure success,” it said. “Euro-area
leaders need to spell out and recommit to a common vision of how
the euro area is expected to function in the future. This is
essential to anchor market expectations and dispel the
prevailing uncertainty.”  Trichet’s Call  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet , who helped bring the
euro into being, yesterday urged European leaders to work toward
more political unity and repeated his call for the eventual
creation of a European  finance ministry .  Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  has already
signaled support for the creation of an institution with the
power to guide national fiscal policies and issue euro bonds,
while his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Sept. 16
that crisis management has to be guided by  Europe ’s current
rulebook.  “Europe suffers from a coordination problem among fiscal
authorities and between the monetary authority and
governments,”  Andrew Bosomworth , executive vice-president and
senior portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management
Company in Munich, said last week. “Whatever the ECB does,
ultimately it can only provide a bridge to a destination shaped
by governments’ fiscal policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
