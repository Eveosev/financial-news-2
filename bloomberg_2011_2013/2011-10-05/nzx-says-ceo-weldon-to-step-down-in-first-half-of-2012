NZX Ltd. (NZX) , which operates  New
Zealand ’s stock exchange, said Chief Executive Officer Mark Weldon will step down in the first half of 2012.  “Following the successful execution of NZX’s second five-
year strategic plan, Mark has indicated that the time is now
right for him to leave the company,” Chairman Andrew Harmos
said in a statement.  Weldon, 44, took on the role of chief executive in June
2002, leading the company’s initial public offering in 2003. He
has overseen a fivefold increase in sales since starting at the
Wellington-based stock exchange operator.  NZX shares have gained 54 percent this year, the best
performer on the benchmark NZX 50 index. The stock was unchanged
at NZ$2.36 at 10:37 a.m. in Wellington trading.  Weldon owns about 5 percent of NZX, according to a filing
in June. He joined the company from McKinsey & Co. and
previously was an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom.  “Although it’s been a very tough decision to leave, I know
it’s the right time, Weldon said in the statement. ‘‘The
organization is in such good shape, with momentum building that
will provide a positive working environment for the next chief
executive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
