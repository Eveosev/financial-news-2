Asian stocks dropped, led by
exporters, as a downgrade of Italy’s credit rating overshadowed
signs that  Europe  may reach consensus on measures to shield its
banks from the sovereign-debt crisis.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, fell 2
percent in  Tokyo . Japanese utilities slumped on speculation the
government will change the framework for pricing electricity.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the largest mining company, gained 3.8
percent in Sydney as commodity prices rallied after the
Financial Times reported Europe is nearing a plan to
recapitalize its banks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2 percent to 107.44 as
of 6:13 p.m. in Tokyo. Almost two stocks fell for each that
advanced. The gauge tumbled 16 percent in the third quarter, the
biggest drop since 2008, amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis
and a U.S. economic slowdown will drag the world back into
recession.  “There still remains considerable work to be done to
stabilize both the sovereign debt and banking sector in
Europe,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. Stocks in Asia
“remain vulnerable to further disappointments.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.9 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index slumped 2.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
advanced 1.4 percent. The Hong Kong stock exchange is closed
today for a public holiday.  ‘Increasingly Shared View’  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index gained 0.4
percent today. The index finished up 2.3 percent yesterday in
 New York , reversing a loss in the final 50 minutes of trading,
after the Financial Times quoted Olli Rehn, European Union
commissioner for economic affairs, as saying there’s an
“increasingly shared view” that the region needs a coordinated
approach to halt the sovereign debt crisis.  Markets from Tokyo to Taiwan dropped after Italy’s credit
rating was cut by Moody’s Investors Service after U.S. markets
closed. The downgrade, the first in almost two decades, came on
concern Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government won’t be
able to cut the region’s second-largest debt amid weak growth.  Moody’s lowered Italy’s rating three levels to A2 from Aa2,
with a negative outlook, the New York-based agency said in a
statement yesterday. The action followed a ratings cut by
Standard & Poor’s on Sept. 20.  ‘No Concrete Measures’  Exporters to Europe dropped. Toyota fell 2 percent to 2,517
yen in Tokyo.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer
electronics that depends on Europe for 22 percent of its sales,
slid 1.8 percent to 1,404 yen. Brambles Ltd., a supplier of
warehousing pallets, sank 0.5 percent to A$6.17 in Sydney.  “No concrete measures on solving Europe’s crisis have come
out,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a senior strategist in Tokyo at
Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest
listed bank. “There won’t be an end to the market’s volatility
until we see something that will calm the situation.”  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility known as Tepco,
plunged 12 percent to 203 yen. Kansai Electric Power Co. dropped
4.2 percent to 1,239.  Utility Firms  Trade Minister  Yukio Edano  said the government will review
the current electricity price framework, the Asahi newspaper
reported. Edano indicated he will start reforms, including
requesting utilities to review costs used to determine
electricity tariffs, according to the paper.  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360)  slumped 15 percent to
74,100 won in Seoul and Daelim Industrial Co. sank 14 percent to
70,500 won. The builders dropped amid speculation that recent
oil price declines will damp plant construction demand in the
 Middle East , according to Im Jeong Jae, a fund manager at
Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co.  Among stocks that rose today, Australian resources
companies advanced after crude  oil prices  surged as much as 3.7
percent today and the price of copper rose.  BHP Billiton gained 3.8 percent to A$35.13 in Sydney. Rival
Rio Tinto Group climbed 2.2 percent to A$60.30. Lynas Corp., an
Australian rare-earths producer, surged 6.9 percent to 1.005
Australian cents.  iPhone Upgrade  Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-largest maker
of mobile phones, added 1.7 percent to 842,000 won in Seoul
after Apple Inc. unveiled an upgrade to the iPhone 4, short of
an overhaul of the model.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s
third-largest, advanced 0.4 percent to 69,500 won.  “LG has been the biggest victim of the iPhone,” Kang Yoon Hum, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co., said by
phone. “If Apple shows a crack, people in the market seem to
think LG might be able to squeeze in.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 22 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 11 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 21 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark were valued at 11 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.2 times for the S&P 500
and 9 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
