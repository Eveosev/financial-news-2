Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
company, aims to increase sales of the metal by 10 percent in
four years, according to  estimates released  today by the Chilean
government’s budget office.  Annual copper sales at the state-owned company may remain
at about 1.7 million metric tons this year and next, rising to
1.8 million tons in 2013 and 1.9 million tons in 2014 and 2015,
the budget office said in a presentation posted on its website.  Codelco’s Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  plans to
spend about $20 billion this decade to revamp aging mines. The
investments will push production to more than 2 million tons in
a decade, according to a presentation on Codelco’s website.
Without the investment, output would decline to 800,000 tons.  Codelco and other mining companies in  Chile , which supplies
a third of the world’s copper, are struggling to raise output
this year after strikes and bad weather in the Atacama Desert
curtailed operations.  The price of copper has slumped 25 percent since the end of
August as  Europe ’s debt crisis dims prospects for raw-material
demand. The metal for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
settle at $3.106 a pound at 1:19 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
