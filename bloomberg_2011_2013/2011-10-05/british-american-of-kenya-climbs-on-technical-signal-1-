British American Investment Co.,
which started trading on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  on Sept. 8,
climbed for a second day on a technical signal.  Shares in the diversified financial services group advanced
4.2 percent to 6.15 shillings as of the 3 p.m. close of trading
in the capital, Nairobi.  British Americanâ€™s 14-day relative strength index closed at
26.8 on Oct. 3, the day before the stock started its advance. A
level below 30 signals to some technical analysts that the stock
is poised to rise. The RSI identifies possible turning points in
