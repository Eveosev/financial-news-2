The  Chicago Cubs  are seeking
permission to talk to Boston  Red Sox  General Manager Theo Epstein about a job with the National League team, the Boston
Globe reported without saying where it got the information.  Epstein, 37, who has spent nine years with the Red Sox, may
decline to speak with the Cubs, the Globe said. The Red Sox can
also turn down the request or grant a meeting contingent on the
Cubs paying compensation if they hire him, it said.  If Epstein leaves the Major League Baseball team, Ben Cherington, senior vice president and assistant general manager,
may be his successor, the Globe said. Cherington, who joined the
Red Sox in 1999, was among team executives who attended the
meeting that led to manager Terry Francona’s departure last
week.  The Cubs declined to comment on the report, according to an
e-mail from Peter Chase, the team’s director of media relations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
