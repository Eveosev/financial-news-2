Spain ’s first fully private
regasification project, a 1 billion-euro ($1.34 billion) plant
proposed by Grupo Villar Mir to feed gas to its fertilizer and
metals factories, is being considered by the Industry Ministry.  The government will study the project planned in  Huelva
province  as well as the recommendations from the nation’s energy
regulator, according to a ministry official who declined to be
named, in line with the agency’s policy on regulation.  Spain’s decision on whether to permit the first plant for
turning the liquefied fuel into its gaseous state without being
compelled to offer the gas to third parties could affect the
businesses of suppliers such as  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  and pipeline
network operator  Enagas (ENG)  SA.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
