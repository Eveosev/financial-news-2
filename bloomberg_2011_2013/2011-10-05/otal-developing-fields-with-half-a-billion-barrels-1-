Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest oil
producer, is developing two so-called “elephant” oil and
natural gas fields it has discovered in Bolivia and French
Guiana as the company seeks to boost production in the region.  The Zaedyus oil field in French Guiana and the Aquio
deposit in Bolivia each hold at least 500 million barrels of oil
or equivalents, said Denis Palluat de Besset, the head of the
company’s Brazil unit. Total will drill a second well at Zaedyus
in late 2012 with its partners  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) , Besset said. Tullow operates the project.  “We believe it is in the elephant size, a half a billion
barrels,” Besset said today in  Rio de Janeiro . “There might be
other structures to drill to find more oil.”  Zaedyus is similar to the Jubilee discovery in Ghana where
Tullow estimates potential resources of 1.8 billion barrels,
Besset said. The north-eastern coast of South America and West
Africa may hold some of the same oil deposits formed millions of
years ago before the Atlantic Ocean was created by the
separating continents, according to Besset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
