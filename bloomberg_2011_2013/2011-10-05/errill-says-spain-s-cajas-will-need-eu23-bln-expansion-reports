Bank of America Merrill Lynch
forecasts Spanish savings banks will need another 23 billion
euros ($30.6 billion) next year to keep a Tier 1 core capital of
7 percent,  Expansion  reported, citing a report by Merrill Lynch
provided in a London meeting yesterday.  The report suggests savings banks have “problematic
assets,” mainly linked to real estate, valued at 198 billion
euros, which may turn into potential losses that will force
banks to boost their capital, the newspaper said.  If core capital for savings banks, known as cajas, is
raised to 10 percent, these lenders would need 47.57 billion
euros, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
