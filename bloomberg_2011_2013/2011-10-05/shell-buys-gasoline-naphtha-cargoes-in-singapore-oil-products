Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought gasoline
and naphtha in  Singapore , where its biggest refinery remains
shut after a fire. Fuel oil’s discount to crude widened for the
first time in six days.  Light Distillates  Shell bought 95-RON gasoline in Singapore for a second day,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window. Shell, which declared force
majeure Oct. 2 on some fuel exports from its Singapore refinery,
paid $119 a barrel to Vitol Group for 50,000 barrels for Oct. 20
to Oct. 24, the earliest loading period. It paid the same price
to BP Plc for a similar cargo for Oct. 23 to Oct. 27.  Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil company, also bought an open-
specification contract for 25,000 metric tons of naphtha for
first-half December from BP at $858 a ton, the survey showed.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$7.31 to $96.37 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time, Bloomberg
data showed. This crack spread, a measure of refining profit,
was the narrowest since Sept. 15.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Asian benchmark Dubai crude widened
74 cents to $2.73 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
difference narrowed in the previous five days, indicating
reduced losses for refiners turning crude into residual products.  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 380-centistoke fuel oil in
Singapore for a third day, paying $619 a ton to Brightoil
Petroleum Holdings Ltd. and Vitol for 20,000 tons each, based on
the Bloomberg News survey. The cargoes are for loading from Oct.
25 to Oct. 29.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade dropped 25 cents at $7.25 a ton, PVM said. This viscosity
spread narrowed for a second day, signaling higher-quality fuel
oil has declined less than bunker, or marine fuel.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude slid 12
cents to $17.30 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM data. This crack spread was the narrowest since Sept. 28,
when a fire broke out at Shell’s Singapore refinery.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil decreased for the first time
in five days, losing 15 cents to $2.65 a barrel, PVM said. This
regrade on Oct. 3 reached $2.80, the highest since February,
meaning it was profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
