Dustin Kellogg, a Houston-area high
school pitcher drafted by the Astros four months ago, was killed
yesterday when the pick-up truck he was driving collided head-on
with a tractor-trailer. He was 18.  Kellogg was taken by the Astros in the 34th round of  Major
League Baseball ’s first-year player draft in June out of Caney
Creek High School in Conroe,  Texas , which is about 45 miles
north of Houston. The crash occurred in nearby Porter, Texas,
according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which didn’t
disclose further details.  “This is a very sad day for all of us,” Astros assistant
General Manager and director of scouting Bobby Heck said in a
 statement . “Dustin was a Texas kid, and he made his intentions
very clear at our pre-Draft workout that he wanted to pitch for
his hometown  Houston Astros .”  Kellogg appeared in six games for the Astros’ Gulf Coast
League team following the draft, posting a 1-1 record with a
4.26 earned run average and nine strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.  The Astros finished 56-106 this season, the worst record in
the major leagues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
