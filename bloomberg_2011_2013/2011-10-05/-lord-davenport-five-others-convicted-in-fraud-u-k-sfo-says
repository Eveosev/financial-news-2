Six men were convicted over a 4
million-pound ($6.2 million) fraud in which a  London  company
charged fees for commercial loans it never provided.  Edward Davenport , 45, who described himself as an English
Lord while having no official title, was the ringmaster of a
“sophisticated criminal enterprise,” the  U.K. Serious Fraud
Office  said in an e-mailed statement.  Davenport and Peter Riley, 64, directors of the company
Gresham Ltd., were sentenced to seven years in prison last month
and banned from acting as company directors for 10 years.
Another director, Borge Andersen, was sentenced to three years.
David McHugh, Richard Stephens and David Horsfall, who posed as
advisers to Gresham, are to be sentenced Nov. 10.  Gresham claimed to offer commercial funding or venture
capital for construction projects in the U.K.,  Europe , the U.S.,
 India  and the Caribbean. It took millions in “deposits” or
“verification” fees, the SFO said. None of the victims
received any money.  Judge Peter Testar said Riley was a “very accomplished
con-man” who had “spun a web of elaborate lies to explain why
the money had not come,” according to the agency’s statement.  Davenport said he was “shocked and dismayed” at his
sentence, according to an e-mailed statement from his lawyer. He
has filed an appeal at London’s High Court and wants to clear
his name, he said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
