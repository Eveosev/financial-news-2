The Islamic Bank of  Thailand  is
awaiting clarification from government regulators on tax breaks
for Shariah-compliant bonds before proceeding with the country’s
first sale of baht-denominated sukuk.  “We need to know if the tax exemptions cover both land and
properties,” Dheerasak Suwannayos, president of the state-owned
Islamic Bank, said in a telephone interview today in Bangkok. 
“We have been told by the Securities Exchange Commission that 
they will get back to us in a month.”  Thailand’s only Islamic bank originally planned to sell 5
billion baht ($161 million) of sukuk, which pay returns on
assets to comply with Islam’s ban on interest, in the third
quarter. The cabinet approved a ruling in May that ensures
stamp duties on Shariah-compliant transactions aren’t paid twice,
giving equal treatment with non-Islamic investments.  The lender also plans to sell $150 million of sukuk in the
Southeast Asian nation’s first global offering once the baht
issue has been completed, Dheerasak said.  Islamic Bank has appointed  Malaysia ’s CIMB Investment Bank
Bhd. as the adviser for the baht sukuk, which will have a
maturity of three to five years, Dheerasak said.  “We want to issue the sukuk this year as we think
borrowing costs may go up next year,” he said.  The yield on the government’s 5.25 percent non-Shariah-
compliant debt due in May 2014 was little changed at 3.53
percent as of 11:34 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The rate on 5.4 percent notes maturing in July
2016 was 3.63 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
