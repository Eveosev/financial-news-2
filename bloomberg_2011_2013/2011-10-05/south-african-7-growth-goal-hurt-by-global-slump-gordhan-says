South Africa ’s economic growth target
of 7 percent may be difficult to achieve as global growth slows,
the National Treasury said, clarifying comments made by Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  earlier this week.  The “current unpredictable macroeconomic environment” may
undermine the government’s goal for the economy to expand 7
percent a year over the next decade to create 5 million jobs,
the Pretoria-based Treasury said in an e-mailed statement today.  Gordhan said in a speech on Oct. 3 that the government’s
February forecast that the economy will expand 4 percent
annually over the next three years was “far too ambitious.”
Today, the Treasury said in its statement that this may have
created the impression that its estimates are “way outside the
general consensus forecasts.”  The Treasury’s projections “have been in most instances in
line with market forecasts, despite the difficult forecasting
environment,” according to the statement.  The economy may expand 3.3 percent this year and 3.7
percent in 2012, according to the median forecast of 16
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The  International Monetary
Fund  estimates growth of 3.4 percent and 3.6 percent for the
same period.  Gordhan is scheduled to give updated growth estimates in
his mid-term budget on Oct. 25 in  Cape Town .  To contact the reporter on this story:
