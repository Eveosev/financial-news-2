Italy’s credit rating was cut by
Moody’s Investors Service for the first time in almost two
decades on concern that Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
government will struggle to reduce the region’s second-largest
debt amid chronically weak growth.  Moody’s lowered Italy’s rating three levels to A2 from Aa2,
with a negative outlook, the New York-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The action comes after  Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded Italy on Sept. 20 for the first time in five years.
