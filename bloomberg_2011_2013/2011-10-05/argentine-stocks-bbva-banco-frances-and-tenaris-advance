pesos, ending a five-day losing streak. The price of  Argentina 
sovereign bonds increased today, which signals higher value for
banks’ fixed-income assets.  Tenaris SA (TEN)   advanced 4.6 percent to 61.2 pesos, its
second day of gains and biggest advance in four weeks. The
world’s largest producer of seamless steel tubes used in the oil

report of a surprise decline in U.S. inventories.  Transportadora de Gas del Norte SA (TGNO4 AF) fell 1.9
percent to 72.5 centavos, its sixth straight day of losses.
Argentina’s second-biggest gas pipeline operator appealed a
ruling earlier this year that said the government didn’t need to
hold talks on gas tariffs, it said in a regulatory filing
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
