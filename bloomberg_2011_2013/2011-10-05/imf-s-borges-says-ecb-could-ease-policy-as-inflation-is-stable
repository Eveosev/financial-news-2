Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said the  European
Central Bank  could loosen monetary policy as price rises are
under control and inflation expectations are stable.  “This is not really the time to be obsessively focused on
inflation,” Borges said at a press conference in Brussels
today. “Inflation is under control even though the numbers are
on the high side. There is immense credibility in western  Europe 
about inflation. Inflation expectations are very, very well
anchored and in this context it should be possible to have a
monetary policy that’s a bit more relaxed given the concerns we
now have on the downside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
