Dunelm Group, a U.K. retailer of
budget home-furnishings, posted higher first-quarter sales as it
opened a superstore in Dartford and refitted two outlets to
increase selling space.  The Leicester, England-based company said sales grew 5.3
percent from a year earlier, to 133.4 million pounds ($ 206
million) in the thirteen weeks ended Oct. 1, according to a
Regulatory News Service statement today. Revenue increased 11.6
percent in the corresponding quarter a year ago.  Sales from stores open at least a year declined 2 percent
in a “difficult consumer environment,” while contribution from
new space increased 7.3 percent, the company said.  “We remain confident about the growth opportunities
provided both from store expansion and via the web,” Chief
Executive Officer Nick Wharton said in the statement, The
retailer expects to open 15 stores this year, of which 10 are
scheduled for the second quarter, according to the statement.  Gross margin rose by about 50 basis points compared with a
year earlier. Net cleared funds were at 34.3 million pounds, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
