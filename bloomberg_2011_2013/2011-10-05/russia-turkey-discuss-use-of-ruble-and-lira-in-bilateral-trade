Russia  and Turkey discussed ways to
boost the use of the ruble and the lira in bilateral trade.  Central bank and government officials from the two
countries met in Moscow Sept. 26-Sept. 28 to consider
“proposals on possible ways to increase settlements in the
national currencies and measures needed to broaden interbank
cooperation,” Bank Rossii said today in a  statement  on its
website. Policy makers asked commercial banks to help them study
the most promising industries for trade to shift to the ruble
and lira, according to the statement.  Russia has sought to bolster the use of the ruble and other
emerging-market alternatives to the dollar in trade, including
through the so-called BRICS group of Brazil, Russia,  India ,
 China  and  South Africa . Central bankers met officials in
Brasilia in August and agreed that using the ruble and real in
trade was more “appropriate” than the dollar.  Russia and Turkey traded $17.46 billion of goods in the
first seven months of 2011, 26 percent higher than a year
earlier, according to Russia’s customs service. Turkey accounted
for about 3.8 percent of Russian trade, down from 4.1 percent in
the same period last year, customs data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
