Nigeria ’s government plans to end
fuel subsidies, weaken the naira and raise spending by 7 percent
in its budget next year as oil prices ease.  Scrapping the fuel allowance, which is planned over the
next three years, will save the government 1.2 trillion ($7.5
billion) in 2012, according to a three-year plan sent to
parliament by the Budget Office.  Africa ’s top oil producer is facing declining revenue as
the price of oil, the source of more than 95 percent of export
income and 80 percent of government earnings, fell 28 percent in
the past six months. The naira slumped to a record low of 160.65
against the dollar today, while foreign currency reserves, used
to fund the central bank’s twice-weekly auctions to stabilize
the naira, have fallen 9 percent in the year through Sept. 30.  The proposal to remove the fuel subsidy is “positive,”
 Razia Khan , head of Africa economic research at Standard
Chartered Plc in  London , said in an e-mail today. “The subsidy
was expensive, responsible for significant distortions and rent-
seeking opportunities in the Nigerian economy, with little
overall benefit.”  The government plans to increase spending to 4.8 trillion
naira next year and will estimate its revenue using a crude oil
price of $75 a barrel and output of 2.48 million barrels a day,
the Budget Office said.  While aggregate spending will rise to 5.18 trillion naira
in 2015, the government is proposing imposing a ceiling on
recurrent expenditure, such as wages, by that time in favor of
capital investments, it said.  The budget is forecast on an exchange rate of 153 naira per
dollar, compared with 150 currently. The  budget deficit  is
expected to narrow to 2.69 percent of the gross domestic
product, from the current 3.62 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
