August.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the reference at 20,638 per
dollar, compared with 20,628 yesterday, according to its
website. It last adjusted the measure on Aug. 24. The dong is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate and

currency also dropped on speculation companies stepped up dollar
purchases to pay for imports and redeem overseas debt.  “Dollar demand has increased recently because many
