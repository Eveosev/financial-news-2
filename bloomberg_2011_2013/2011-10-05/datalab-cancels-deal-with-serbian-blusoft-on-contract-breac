Datalab Tehnologije d.d., Slovenia’s
only publicly listed information technology company, said it has
terminated cooperation with Blue Soft d.o.o. of  Serbia  due to
breach of contract.  Datalab, based in the capital Ljubljana, said  “non-
sufficient effort, customer dissatisfaction and failure to
complete some projects resulted in taking this hard decision,”
according to the statement to the Ljubljana stock exchange
today.  Datalab bought the rights and source coding of a software
program made by Blue Soft in July last year when it sought to
increase its presence in Serbia and other nations of former
 Yugoslavia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
