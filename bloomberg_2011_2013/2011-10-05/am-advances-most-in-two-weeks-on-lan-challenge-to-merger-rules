Tam SA (TAMM4)  rose the most in two weeks,
snapping a six-day losing streak, after  Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  said it
will challenge restrictions set by a Chilean court that approved
its merger with the Brazilian carrier.  Tam,  Brazil ’s biggest airline by market value, rose 5.9
percent to 28.30 reais at 11:45 a.m. New York time. Shares had
fallen 21 percent in the six trading sessions through yesterday.  “Tam’s main driver today is the merger,” said Rosangela
Ribeiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo, in a
telephone interview. “Tam has fallen too much recently.”  Lan said yesterday it will appeal to Chile’s Supreme Court
to overturn some restrictions that antitrust authorities imposed
on its $2.7 billion purchase of Tam. Mitigation measures set by
 Chile ’s antitrust court, known as TDLC, on Sept. 21 may cut the
expected $400 million in annual savings from the merger by $10
million, Lan said in a statement.  Tam shares are also benefitting from gains in the real,
which strengthened 1.2 percent today. The currency had plunged
12 percent in the month through yesterday, increasing Tam’s
costs and expenses in dollars, Ribeiro said.  “Tam suffered a lot because of the dollar,” said Ribeiro,
who rates the carrier’s stock as “buy.” Tam will remain
volatile until the Lan deal is closed in early 2012, said the
analyst.  Lan gained 7.5 percent to 10,810 pesos in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
