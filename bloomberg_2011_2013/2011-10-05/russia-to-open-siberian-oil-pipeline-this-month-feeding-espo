OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s state-run oil
pipeline operator, plans to open a link later this month that
will help boost exports to Asia from OAO Rosneft’s Vankor field.  The 430-kilometer (270-mile) Purpe-Samotlor pipeline in
northern Siberia will be able to carry 25 million metric tons of
oil a year, Transneft spokesman Igor Dyomin said today by
telephone. Its start date has been brought forward to Oct. 25
from next year.  The pipeline will shorten access to the East Siberian
 Pacific Ocean , or ESPO, link that delivers Siberian oil to Asia
and the Pacific.  Transneft plans to increase the capacity of the ESPO to 50
million tons a year by 2013 from 30 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
