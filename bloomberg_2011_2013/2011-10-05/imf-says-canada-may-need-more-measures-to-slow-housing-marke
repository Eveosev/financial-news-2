Canadian policy makers may need to
consider additional measures to slow the country’s housing
market if households continue to take on more debt, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in a report today.  The Washington-based organization said Canada’s labor and
housing markets have performed “relatively well” and credit
growth remains strong as the economy benefits from low  interest
rates  and a profitable banking sector.  “Developments on the housing front require increased
vigilance, and consideration may need to be given to additional
prudential measures to prevent a further buildup in household
debt,” the Fund said in the report.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage rules
earlier this year as households took advantage of historically
low interest rates to take on mortgage debt. Household debt as a
share of personal disposable income rose to a record 150.8
percent at the end of June from 149.5 percent in the previous
quarter, according to Statistics  Canada  data.  Flaherty said today he would consider further actions if
there was “clear evidence of a bubble in the housing market in
Canada, which we have not seen.”  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said in June 15 speech
that housing prices in some parts of the country are reaching
“severely unaffordable” levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
