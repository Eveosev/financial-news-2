Gasoline gained after reports that
U.S. companies added jobs last month and that inventories of the
motor fuel fell for the first time in five weeks.  Futures rose as ADP Employer Services reported that the
U.S. firms increased employment by 91,000, more than the 75,000
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Gasoline widened gains after the Energy Department reported that
stockpiles declined 1.14 million barrels to 213.7 million.  “What’s bullish is that across the board, we had draws in
crude, gasoline and distillate inventories,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for November delivery increased 6.86 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $2.557 a gallon at 1:42 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Demand, or deliveries to wholesalers, was little changed in
the period ended Sept. 30 at 8.96 million barrels a day. On a
four-week average, consumption was 1.7 percent below a year
earlier.  “Gasoline demand continues to be down,” Lipow said.  Imports of gasoline to the East Coast, where the futures
contract is settled, fell 124,000 barrels to 397,000 barrels a
day last week, according to the Energy Department. It’s the
lowest level since at least 2004, when the department began
showing regional data.  “Since 2004 refinery gasoline production has increased,
the use of ethanol has increased, while gasoline demand” has
slowed, Lipow said.  IMF Plans  Futures were bolstered as the  International Monetary Fund 
said that European Union officials are working on plans to boost
bank capital to contain the euro-region’s debt crisis. If
European leaders can’t contain  Greece ’s debt crisis, fuel demand
and the global economic recovery may be threatened.  “The story that European officials are working on a plan
to boost bank capital makes the market feel a little bit
better,” Flynn said. “But the market is very nervous. We’re
grasping at straws here.”  Supplies of heating oil and diesel declined 744,000 barrels
to 156.9 million, a four-week low.  Demand for industrial, trucking and home-heating fuels rose
282,000 barrels to 4.1 million barrels a day, the highest level
since April 15. On a four-week average, consumption was 2
percent higher than a year earlier.  Heating oil for November delivery gained 4.29 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.7663 a gallon, after settling yesterday at the
lowest level for the front-month contract since Feb. 18.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.9
cent to $3.399 yesterday, according to AAA data. That’s the
cheapest since March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
