Bear Island  Paper Co., a newsprint
producer, won bankruptcy court approval to seek votes on its
amended liquidation plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Douglas O. Tice Jr. in
Richmond,  Virginia , ruled today that the disclosure statement
explaining the proposal provides enough information for
creditors to make an informed decision. A hearing on
confirmation of the plan is scheduled for Nov. 22.  The plan will give holders of certain secured and unsecured
claims totaling about $531.4 million a recovery of 0.5 percent
to 4 percent, court papers show. Holders of intercompany claims
totaling $135.9 million would receive the same recovery while
shareholders would get nothing.  Bear Island sought bankruptcy court protection in February
2010 citing the declining demand for newsprint. The Ashland,
Virginia-based company listed assets of more than $100 million
and debt of more than $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed
in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Richmond.  The case is In re Bear Island Paper Co. LLC, 10-31202, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).  To contact the reporter on this story:
