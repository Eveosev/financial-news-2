The premium for Syncrude oil surged
the most in seven months late yesterday after a person with
knowledge of the situation said Syncrude Canada Ltd. cut its
November forecast by 1.4 million barrels to 9.8 million.  October output was revised downward 100,000 barrels to 7.5
million, according to the person. The forecast reductions are
because additional work must be done during a turnaround at the
Syncrude upgrader in  Alberta , said the person. The work started
in early September.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  said late yesterday that maintenance in
oil sands base and in situ would extend into October. September
output was affected by the work and fell 6.3 percent to 311,000
barrels a day from August.  The premium for Syncrude to West Texas Intermediate crude
strengthened $3.25 to $11 a barrel late yesterday. The grade was
unchanged today at 12:12 p.m. in  New York . Syncrude is a light,
low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at $9
a barrel. The grade narrowed $1.50 a barrel late yesterday.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 45 cents to
$27.60 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium weakened 20
cents to $26.75.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 10 cents to $23.25 a barrel while Poseidon
strengthened 40 cents to $23.25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $22.50 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 90 cents
a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 25 cents
to $27.25 above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
