India ’s 10-year bonds declined,
pushing yields to the highest level since 2008, on concern
increasing government debt sales will damp demand for existing
notes.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said in an interview
telecast by Bloomberg UTV yesterday that the nation may find it
hard to meet its budget-deficit target in the current fiscal
year. The government plans to raise 2.2 trillion rupees ($44.5
billion) selling bonds in the six months ending March 31, more
than the budgeted 1.67 trillion rupees, R. Gopalan, secretary,
Department of Economic Affairs, said last week. The government
raised 2.5 trillion rupees in the first six months of the year.  “The sentiment toward bonds will remain bearish for some
time as the deficit situation doesn’t look encouraging,” said
Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer  at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  in Mumbai.
“The debt supplies will keep yields at higher levels.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.58 percent as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That is the highest level for benchmark 10-year
rates since September 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Mukherjee aims to narrow the government’s shortfall to a
four-year low of 4.6 percent of gross domestic product in the
fiscal year that ends in March 2012, according to budget
estimates published in February.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose three basis points to 7.91 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
