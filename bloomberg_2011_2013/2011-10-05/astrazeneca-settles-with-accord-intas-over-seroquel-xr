AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  agreed to settle a
patent-infringement lawsuit against Accord Healthcare Inc. and
Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd. over Accord’s plan for a generic
version of the Seroquel XR antipsychotic medicine.  Under the settlement, AstraZeneca gave Accord a license to
sell generic Seroquel beginning Nov. 1, 2016, the London-based
