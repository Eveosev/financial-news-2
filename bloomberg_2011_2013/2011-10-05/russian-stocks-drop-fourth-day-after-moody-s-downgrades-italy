Russian stocks erased earlier gains
and fell for a fourth day after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Italy, spurring concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may hurt
demand for the nation’s exports.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 shares lost 0.2 percent to 1,265.67
as of the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, after earlier advancing as
much as 2.8 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index slid 0.6
percent to 1,217.21. VTB Group, the country’s largest lender,
and OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s state-owned telecommunications
holding company, led declines, sliding 1.6 percent to 6.009
kopeks and 2 percent to 134.14 rubles, respectively. OAO
Gazprom, the nation’s gas export monopoly, fell 0.9 percent.  “Moody’s overnight downgrade of Italy’s debt is a reminder
of looming risks,” Peter Szopo, head of research at  Alfa Bank 
in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Moody’s cut  Italy ’s rating three levels to A2, the fifth-
lowest investment grade, citing concern the government will
struggle to reduce the region’s second-largest debt.  Russian stocks are the cheapest in the BRIC group of
countries, with Micex Index members trading at 4.5 times
analysts’ estimated earnings as of yesterday’s close, compared
with 8.7 for Brazil’s Bovespa, 10.9 for the Shanghai Composite
Index and 13.4 for the BSE India Sensitive Index.  “Calling a bottom to the market remains the constant
preoccupation, although it’s really a hopeless exercise because
no one knows exactly how bad it must become for European Union
policymakers to do rather than say something drastic,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in
London, wrote in e-mailed comments today.  Hedge Fund Cuts  Hedge funds  cut their bullish bets, or long positions, on
oil by the most in almost two months in the week ended Sept. 27,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Concern
that economic growth will falter sent crude to the biggest
quarterly drop since 2008 in the three months ended Sept. 30.  Urals crude, Russia’s main export, traded little changed at
$100.36 a barrel, while crude futures in  New York  climbed 2.2
percent to $77.38 a barrel.  OAO Lukoil gained 0.4 percent to 1,548.9 rubles after
deputy chief  Leonid Fedun  was cited by the RIA Novosti news
service as saying that the company has $7 billion of cash
available to pay back debt early.  Copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.6 percent, to
$6,760 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange. Most metals
listed on the LME slumped. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s
biggest producer of the metal, dropped 1.1 percent to 6,136
rubles.  AFK Sistema rebounded after RIA Novosti reported Chief
Executive Officer Mikhail Shamolin said billionaire  Vladimir
Yevtushenkov ’s holding company may expand its buyback program,
rising 0.5 percent to 20.408 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
