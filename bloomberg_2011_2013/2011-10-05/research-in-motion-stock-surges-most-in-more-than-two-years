Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , maker of the
BlackBerry smartphone, advanced the most in 2 1/2 years on
continuing speculation the company may be a takeover target.  RIM rose $2.60, or 12 percent, to $23.60 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the biggest one-day gain since
April 2009.  RIM, down 59 percent this year amid market-share losses,
has jumped by at least 8 percent on three days in the past week
amid speculation it may get bought.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  could be
one of the “potential aggressors” amid “vague rumors” RIM
asked an investment bank to look at strategic options, the
U.K.’s Independent newspaper said yesterday.  “I don’t give much credence to that speculation just
because it is a carrier,” said Jeff Fidacaro, an analyst at
Susquehanna International Group in New York, who rates RIM
“negative.”  Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, declined to comment.
Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM,
didn’t return a call seeking comment.  RIM’s planned move to the new QNX operating system next
year means most bidders would likely wait to see how the company
fares, Fidacaro said. RIM is counting on QNX devices to win back
market share lost to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and handset makers that
use  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system.  “I find it hard to believe that an acquirer would bid for
the company without being assured they can actually port that
software successfully,” Fidacaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
