London Wasps owner Steve Hayes put
the two-time European rugby champion up for sale, three years
after taking control of the club.  The owner is “looking to realize his investment and seek
new owners to take the club forward,” according to a  statement 
released on the club’s website today.  Hayes became sole owner of the team, which plays in High
Wycombe, in 2008. His plans for a new 17,500-seat stadium, hotel
and retail spaces for the club and the Wycombe Wanderers soccer
team lost support of the local government earlier this year.
Wycombe and Wasps share Adams Park, which has a capacity of
about 10,000.  “I remain disappointed that Wycombe District Council
withdrew its support for the Sporting Village project earlier
this year,” Hayes said in the statement. “Since that time I
have been working with the London Wasps board to evaluate the
best steps forward for the club. I fully believe that a new
stadium for Wasps is essential in the coming years as we have
always said that Adams Park was unsustainable as a long term
option.”  Hayes has appointed Baker Tilly to look for new investors
for the club, which has won the English Premiership six times.  He took over Wasps by purchasing the stakes of Chris Wright
and John O’Connell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
