The ruble strengthened against the
dollar after the  International Monetary Fund  said European
authorities were planning to recapitalize the banking industry
and Russian Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said there
were grounds for the currency to strengthen.  The ruble appreciated 0.5 percent to 32.56 per dollar at
the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its first gain since Sept. 27. The
Russian currency was 0.3 percent stronger at 43.34 per euro,
leaving it up 0.4 percent at 37.41 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  European-Union authorities are working on a plan to bring
more capital to  Europe ’s banks, Antonio Borges, the IMF’s
European department head, said today in Brussels. An effort to
aid banks may help revive demand for Russia’s commodity exports
in the euro area. Crude futures climbed 3.7 percent to $78.48 a
barrel in  New York .  “We’re still looking at macro factors pushing the ruble
around,” Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency analyst at
Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva, said by e-mail. Borges’s comments
were an “excuse” for higher risk appetite, he said.  There are “grounds” for the ruble to rally 8.5 percent to
30 per dollar, Klepach told reporters in Moscow today.  “I think that’s credible,” Rosenstreich said. “The trend
is toward tightening dynamics with oil, and I’m not sure oil
will weaken much further.”  Investors pared bets the ruble will depreciate further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 33.1224
per dollar in three months, compared with 33.2968 yesterday.
NDFs provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
interest-rate differentials.  Dollar Eurbonds  Russia ’s dollar Eurobond due 2018 was little changed, with
the yield steady at 4.973 percent. The yield on Russia’s
sovereign dollar bonds due in 2020 declined 12 basis points to
5.353 percent.  Russia’s central bank sold about $8 billion to shore up the
domestic currency last month, the most since it arrested the
ruble’s devaluation in January 2009, Chairman Sergey Ignatiev
told reporters in Moscow today. Bank Rossii intensified sales
yesterday, selling $1.15 billion on the  currency market  in a
“bigger than usual” step, he said.  The central bank probably shifted the floating five-ruble
band in which it manages the ruble to 32.65 to 37.65 versus its
target dollar-euro basket after yesterday’s sales, Rosenstreich
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
