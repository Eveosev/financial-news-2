The Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
situated in the center of  Germany ’s financial capital, was
temporarily evacuated and some trading interrupted amid a bomb
threat as police searched the building.  The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. local time today,
exchange operator  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  said in an e-mailed
statement. Exchange trading in the fully automated Xetra system
was not affected though transactions in the Xetra Frankfurt
Specialist model, formerly floor trading, were interrupted in
all products, it said. Access to the building was restored about
an hour later and trading on the floor was set to resume at 6:30
p.m.,  Deutsche Boerse  said.  “We received a bomb threat via telephone,” said Patrick
Reinhardt, a police officer at the scene. The anonymous caller
said the bomb would detonate at 5 p.m., he said. Police searched
the building but found nothing, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
