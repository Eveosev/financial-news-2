Ethanol production in the U.S.
increased 2.6 percent to 863,000 barrels a day in the week ended
Sept. 30, according to an Energy Department report.  Output rose the most since the week ended Aug. 5, while
rebounding from its lowest level since Sept. 24, 2010.
Stockpiles were steady at 17.3 million barrels, the department
said.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 2 percent, the most since June 10, to 5.16 million barrels
a day. Thatâ€™s the highest level since the week ended Aug. 26.
Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery advanced 4.2 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.50 a gallon at 10:48 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have gained 5.1 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
