The Czech government may need to
raise the value-added  tax rate  to continue reducing the  budget
deficit  because it has limited room to cut spending, Deputy
Finance Minister Jan Gregor said.  Gregor was speaking in an interview on the Radio Impuls.  The Cabinet plans to unify the VAT rates, currently
standing at 10 percent and 20 percent, at 17.5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
