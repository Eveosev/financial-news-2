Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said the IMF is
working to limit the spread of concerns about Spain and  Italy .  “For us, it is absolutely important that we restore
confidence in the debt market of Spain and Italy to bring back
investors to those markets,” Borges said in the text of remarks
at a press conference in Brussels today. Market participants
need to be persuaded that it is “appropriate to keep buying
this debt,” which may require “some official sector
involvement in the process,” Borges said.  He said the situations in Spain and Italy are different
than in Greece and  Portugal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
