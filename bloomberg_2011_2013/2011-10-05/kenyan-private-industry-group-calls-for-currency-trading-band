The Kenya Private Sector Alliance,
which represents almost 200 companies in  East Africa ’s biggest
economy, said it recommended the central bank introduce a
currency band and intervene to stabilize the shilling.  The group met officials including Central Bank of Kenya
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u and Finance Ministry Permanent
Secretary Jospeh Kinyua yesterday, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Nairobi-based body. Other suggestions
included using a core-inflation rate to guide long-term monetary
policy and to reduce recurrent budget expenditure to boost the
economy, it said.  The central bank and Finance Ministry officials gave the
alliance a verbal commitment to adopt its recommendations, an
official from the alliance, who declined to be identified in
line with the group’s policy, said in a phone interview today.  The central bank “agreed that the shilling should be more
predictable and operate on market forces within a set band range
of the Kenya Shilling so that CBK will intervene immediately
there is any variance within this band,” the alliance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
