Norwegian companies predict output
growth will “slow somewhat” in the coming six months and
expressed more “uncertainty,” a Norges Bank survey showed.  “Some contacts reported a more wait-and-see approach among
customers and slightly weaker order intake,” the Oslo-based
central bank said in its regional network report.  The bank said that output in the past three months had
risen “about at the same pace as in the spring,” led by the
oil supplier industry and construction, according to the survey
of 311 enterprises.  Norges Bank in August postponed plans to raise its
benchmark  interest rate  from 2.25 percent and last month
signaled it may not resume tightening until 2012 as a sovereign
debt crisis in  Europe  and slowing U.S. growth threaten exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
