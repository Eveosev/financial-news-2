Hungary’s central bank is
“reluctant” to increase the benchmark  interest rate  and the
market is assuming too big an increase in borrowing costs,
according to  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS)   The Budapest-based Magyar Nemzeti Bank may “tolerate” the
forint depreciating to as weak as 325, RBS economist Timothy Ash
wrote in a research report late yesterday after meeting
officials at the central bank and government this week.  “Markets are hence pricing in too much in terms of rate
hikes,” Ash added.  The forint will “continue with a weakening bias,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
