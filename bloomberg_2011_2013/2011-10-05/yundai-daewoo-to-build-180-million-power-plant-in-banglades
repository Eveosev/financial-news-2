South Korea ’s Hyundai Engineering Co.
and  Daewoo International Corp. (047050)  will sign an accord today with
 Bangladesh ’s  Ashuganj Power Station Co.  to build a 225-megawatt
power plant in the South Asian country.  The project will cost 13.61 billion taka ($180 million),
Mizanur Rahman, company secretary at Ashuganj Power, said in a
phone interview. Standard Chartered Plc will finance 80 percent
of the cost, he said.  Bangladesh, where more than half of the 156 million people
don’t have access to electricity, plans to spend $10 billion, or
11 percent of its gross domestic product, in a decade to
increase generation capacity and attract overseas investment.  The plant is being built in Ashuganj, 90 kilometers (56
miles) north-east of the capital Dhaka, to supply power to the
national grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
