Asia  Retail Group is seeking to sell
Courts Asia Ltd., a furniture and electronics retailer with
operations in Singapore and Malaysia, for about S$500 million
($382 million), two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Asia Retail Group, backed by Baring Private Equity Asia,
has hired  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA for the sale,
which may take place within a few weeks, said one of the people,
who asked not to be named because the information is private.  The sale, which will include the company’s consumer
financing unit, is expected to attract interest from regional
and international retailers, as well as private equity groups,
the person said.  Asia Retail Group acquired Courts, which was listed
separately in  Singapore  and Malaysia, starting in 2007. It
offered 288 million ringgit ($90.3 million) for Courts Mammoth
Bhd. on June 7 of that year. The group first bought 54.2 percent
of Courts Singapore Ltd. for S$56.2 million, acquiring the whole
company by 2009.  In 2010, the company planned an initial public offering in
Singapore. The company generated sales of S$507 million and
profit of S$3.6 million in the year ending March 2009, according
to unaudited financial statements in the offering prospectus.
Courts Asia withdrew the offer in June of last year.  Courts has 10 stores in Singapore selling furniture,
electronics and technology products, and employs 600 people,
according to its  website . In Malaysia, it has 52 stores and
employs 1,100 people. The Singapore-based company is led by
Chief Executive Officer Terry O’Connor.  Asia Retail Group is part-owned by Baring Private Equity
Asia, a  Hong Kong  based private equity firm with $5 billion
under management, according to its  website .  Richard Barton , an
external spokesman for Baring, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
