Chile ’s economy expanded 4.6 percent
in August from a year ago as retail sales gains offset a decline
in mining output, the central bank said today on its website.  Growth compared with 4 percent in July, 6.8 percent in the
second quarter and 10 percent in the first quarter. The median
forecast of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for economic
activity to expand 4.8 percent in August.  Growth is slowing in the second half of the year and may
drop to 5 percent in 2012 from about 6.5 percent this year,
Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told lawmakers in Valparaiso
yesterday. The 2012 estimate exceeded the median forecast of 65
economists in a Sept. 9 central bank survey for 4.7 percent.  “This 2012 growth forecast for the Chilean economy is
within current market projections,” Larrain said.
“Undoubtedly, within the context of a more complex external
environment than we see today, it becomes harder to meet this
forecast.”  The peso rose 1.2 percent to 528.45 per dollar at 7:34 a.m.
New York time from yesterday.  Internal demand will grow 5.5 percent next year, inflation
will slow to 2.9 percent by December 2012 from 3.2 percent in
August 2011, and copper prices will average $3.70 a pound,
Larrain said.  Copper, which accounts for more than half of Chile’s
exports, was trading at $3.126 a pound at 7:27 a.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
