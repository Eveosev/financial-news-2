OAO Rosneft may hire Larry Bates from
BP Plc’s Moscow office to help to oversee strategic development
of the company,  Kommersant  said today, citing people familiar
with the plan.  Bates was involved in talks between BP and Rossneft to form
a partnership to drill in the Russian Arctic, which was blocked
by BP’s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP Holding venture,
newspaper said.  Rosneft also wants to hire a BP manager from  Germany  to
oversee a refinery, newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
