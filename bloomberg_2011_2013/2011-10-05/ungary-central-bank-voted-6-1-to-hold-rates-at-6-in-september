Hungarian policy makers voted six to
one last month to keep the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at
6 percent, according to the minutes of the meeting published
today.  Magyar Nemzeti Bank Vice President Julia Kiraly voted to
raise the two-week deposit rate to 6.25 percent, according to
the minutes, which were posted on the central bankâ€™s website.  The majority of policy makers considered that the
deteriorating global risk environment is preventing policy
makers from cutting the interest rate even as the inflation
outlook may justify such a move, the minutes said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
