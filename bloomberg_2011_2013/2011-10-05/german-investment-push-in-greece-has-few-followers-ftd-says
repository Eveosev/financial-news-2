German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler’s plan to encourage investment in  Greece  is meeting with
little interest from companies,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Roesler, who will head a German business delegation to meet
with Greek leaders on Oct. 7 in  Athens , doesn’t expect major
investments in the debt-strapped nation in coming weeks, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
