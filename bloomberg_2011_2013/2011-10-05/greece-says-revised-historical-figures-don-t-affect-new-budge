Greece ’s  Finance Ministry  said
revised figures for gross domestic product released by the
statistics service Elstat today don’t affect targets in the 2011
and 2012 budgets.  “The new data don’t impact on the fiscal goals for 2011
and 2012 which are defined in absolute terms and are the basis
on which the draft 2012 budget was submitted to parliament,”
the Athens-based Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.
It said that on the basis of the new figures, the final deficit
figure for 2009 was 15.7 percent of GDP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
