The European Banking Authority has
been told to provide a country-by-country breakdown of how much
new capital banks would need in the event that Greek bonds were
written down, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed
senior officials involved in the process.  The move is a precautionary measure aimed at informing
negotiations of EU-wide bank recapitalizations and doesn’t mean
that European Union leaders are preparing for a Greek default,
the newspaper said, citing the officials.  The German government is considering reactivating a rescue
fund for its banks that expired last year, the FT also reported,
citing German Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
