Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s Thaad Missile
Defense System successfully intercepted two targets in a test
over  Hawaii  early today, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said.  The test marked the first time the Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense system detected and struck two different targets
using two interceptors, Lockheed Martin said in a press release.  The first Thaad missile intercepted an air-launched short-
range ballistic missile target in the test conducted at the
Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii. The second
missile then intercepted a sea-launched short-range missile,
according to the company statement.  “It was, by far, Thaad’s most challenging flight test to
date and demonstrates the system’s advanced capabilities,” said
Tom McGrath, Thaad vice president and program manager at
Lockheed Martin, in a written statement.  Troops conducting the test did not know what day or time
the targets would be launched, Lockheed Martin’s statement said.  The system, part of the Pentagon’s Ballistic Missile
Defense System, is designed to destroy ballistic missiles inside
or outside the atmosphere during their final, or terminal, phase
of flight, according to the missile agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
