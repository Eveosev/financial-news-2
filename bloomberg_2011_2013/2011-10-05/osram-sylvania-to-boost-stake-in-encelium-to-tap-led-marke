Osram, the lighting division of
 Siemens AG (SIE) , said it gained full control of Encelium
Technologies, a New Jersey-based software company focused on
lighting control and energy management systems for commercial
and industrial buildings, according to a statement today.  Siemens,  Germany ’s largest engineering company, aims to
sell a majority stake in Osram through an initial public
offering, and the company said recently that the planned IPO
will be delayed because of unfavorable market conditions. Osram
is the world’s second-largest lighting company, trailing Royal
Philips Electronics of the Netherlands.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
