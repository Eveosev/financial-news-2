Euro-area services and manufacturing
output contracted more than estimated in September, adding to
signs of a deepening slowdown as governments struggle to contain
the region’s debt crisis.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries fell to 49.1 in September from 50.7 in the
previous month, London-based Markit Economics said today. That
is less than an initial estimate of 49.2 published on Sept. 22.
The index fell below 50, indicating contraction, for the first
time in more than two years.  European governments are seeking ways to contain the
region’s worsening debt crisis, which threatens to push the 17-
nation economy back into a recession. Moody’s Investors Service
yesterday cut Italy’s credit rating for the first time in almost
two decades and European economic confidence slumped more than
economists forecast in September.  Today’s figure “is even more gloomy than the earlier flash
reading, providing confirmation that the euro-zone recovery has
ground to a halt,”  Chris Williamson , chief economist at Markit,
said in the statement. “Even more disappointing is the steep
drop in new business, which suggests that GDP will contract in
the fourth quarter unless business and consumer confidence
rallies in coming weeks.”  The euro was lower against the dollar, trading at $1.3308
at 10:18 a.m. in Brussels, down 0.3 percent on the day after
being down as much as 0.7 percent earlier.  The euro-area services indicator fell to 48.8 last month
from 51.5 in August, Markit said. The manufacturing gauge
decreased to 48.5 in September from 49.  To contact the reporter on this story:
