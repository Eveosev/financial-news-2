 Slovak Freedom and Solidarity Party
leader Richard Sulik said he sees no compromise in sight to win
his support for legislation that will allow for an overhaul of
the euro-area’s bailout mechanism.  Sulik said his party may consider a proposal that would not
block implementation of the European Financial Stabilization
Facility and at the same time won’t cost the Slovak taxpayers
any money.  Talks will continue with other Cabinet parties and his
party known as SaS remains opposed to the EFSF law in its
present form, Sulik told a news conference today in the capital
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
