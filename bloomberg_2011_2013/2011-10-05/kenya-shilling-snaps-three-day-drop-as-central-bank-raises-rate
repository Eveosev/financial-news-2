Kenya ’s shilling rallied for the
first time in four days against the dollar after the nation’s
central bank increased its benchmark rate by 400 basis points to
11 percent to stem inflation and curb the currency’s decline to
the weakest on record.  The currency of east Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
0.9 percent to 101.07 per dollar by 3:15 p.m. in Nairobi. The
shilling weakened to 104.2 on Sept. 27, the lowest since 1994.  “This move will go a long way to restoring confidence in
Kenya’s monetary authority, which was losing credibility,”
Yvonne Mhango, a Johannesburg-based economist with  Renaissance
Capital , wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
