HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  plans to sell $500
million of bonds backed by credit-card bills to U.K. consumers
in its first issue of asset-backed securities since 2007.  Europe ’s largest bank is offering notes with an expected
maturity of 2.9 years, according to a banker familiar with the
transaction, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
set.  Issuance of asset-backed securities tied to credit-card
payments have plunged as banks use deposits to fund new loans.
About $8 billion of the debt has been sold this year, compared
with $8 billion in 2010 and $47 billion in 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Relative yields are at the highest
since June 2010.  The notes from Turquoise Credit Card Backed Securities plc
Series 2011-1 are being marketed at a yield of 70 to 75 basis
points above the one-month London interbank offered rate, said
the banker. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc are managing the sale with HSBC.  That compares with a spread of 17 basis points  American
Express Co. (AXP)  is paying on a sale of $1 billion of similar-
maturity debt pooling U.S. credit card receivables that priced
yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  Top-ranked debt tied to credit-card payments is yielding 81
basis points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. Spreads expanded to 82 basis
points, or 0.82 percentage point, on Aug. 9, from 62 basis
points on June 1, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
