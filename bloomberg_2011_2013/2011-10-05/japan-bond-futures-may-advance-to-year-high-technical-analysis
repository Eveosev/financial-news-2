Japan ’s bond futures may rise to the
highest level this year, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co., citing an ichimoku chart of the
securities.  The futures may advance toward “considerably high” levels
by the middle of this month as the conversion line and baseline
approach the top of the so-called cloud of the chart, said
 Katsutoshi Inadome , a Tokyo-based fixed-income strategist at the
unit of Japan’s largest bank.  “The top of the ichimoku cloud is acting as a support for
bond futures,” said Inadome.  Ten-year bond futures reached 143.07 on Sept. 6, the
highest for the benchmark contract since Nov. 8, 2010. They
declined to a three-week low of 142.16 on Sept. 30 and rebounded
to as much as 142.62 yesterday. Should the futures breach the
Sept. 6 high, the next target would be the “key psychological
levels” of 143.30 or 143.50, Inadome said.  An ichimoku chart analyzes the midpoints of historic highs
and lows. The baseline is the sum of the highest high and the
lowest low over the past 26 trading days. The conversion line is
the same calculation over the past nine trading days. The cloud
refers to the area between the first and second leading-span
lines on the chart and is used to show an area where buy orders
may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
