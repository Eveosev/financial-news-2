First base coach Mookie Wilson and
three other coaches will not return to the  New York Mets  next
season, the team said today in a statement.  Bench coach Ken Oberkfell, third base coach Chip Hale and
bullpen coach Jon Debus also will not return to those positions
in 2012. Tim Teufel will take over at third base and Ricky Bones
will become bullpen coach, the Mets said. Replacements at first
base and bench coach have not yet been announced.  Hitting coach Dave Hudgens and pitching coach Dan Warthen
will return with manager Terry Collins next season, the team
said. The Mets went 77-85 this season to finish fourth in the
five-team National League East division, 25 games behind the
 Philadelphia Phillies .  Wilson, 55, also was first base coach for the Mets in
1996-2002. He was a member of the last Mets championship team in
1986. Wilson’s grounder through the legs of Boston first baseman
Bill Buckner allowed the winning run to score in Game 6 of the
1986  World Series .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
