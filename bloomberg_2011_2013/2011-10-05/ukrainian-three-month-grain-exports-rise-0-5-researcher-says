Ukrainian grain exports rose 0.5
percent in the current marketing year’s first three months,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Shipments reached 3.482 million metric tons, compared with
3.465 million tons a year earlier, the Kiev-based researcher
said in an e-mailed statement today. The marketing year started
July 1.  The government expects grain exports to more than double in
the year to as much as 25 million tons, Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said last week. Deliveries were 12.1 million
tons in the prior marketing year, according to the country’s
Agrarian Confederation. Ukraine imposed quotas on cereal exports
in 2010 as a drought seared fields.  Outbound shipments came to 1.3 million tons in September,
UkrAgroConsult said, citing industry figures. The total included
763,000 tons of wheat that went to the European Union,  Egypt  and
Tunisia.  Barley exports of 464,000 tons were shipped to  Saudi
Arabia , Syria and Jordan, the researcher said. Deliveries in
September also included 60,000 tons of corn and other cereals.  The government replaced the export quotas with taxes as of
July 1 in an effort to reduce the  budget deficit  and unlock a
$15.6 billion loan agreement with the  International Monetary
Fund . Existing regulations will be changed after agricultural
producers protested against the taxes, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said today.  The economy ministry last week proposed maintaining the
grain-export duties through 2012 and imposing taxes on rapeseed,
sunflower-oil and soybean shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
