BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , John Deere Capital
Corp. and  Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI)  sold a combined $2.65 billion
of bonds, after issuance in the first two days of the week fell
96 percent from a week earlier.  The $1.25 billion three-part sale by BAE Systems was the
first issue by  Europe ’s largest defense company since June 2009,
including $500 million of 4.75 percent notes due in 2021. John
Deere Capital issued $500 million of floating-rate notes due in
2013 and $500 million of 3.15 percent bonds due in 2021.
Orlando, Florida-based Darden sold $400 million of 4.5 percent,
10-year debt.  Relative borrowing costs are at the highest levels in more
than two years after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped the U.S. of its
top credit grade in August and  Greece  strives to avoid a
default. The issuance decline comes after the  Federal Reserve ’s
plan to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio
with longer-term Treasuries failed to prompt borrowing.  The offering from Darden was the first since 2007 for the
operator of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains. London-
based BAE Systems also issued $350 million of five-year, 3.5
percent notes and $400 million of 5.8 percent, 30-year bonds.  Sales of dollar-denominated debt in the U.S. market on the
first three days of this week have decreased 74 percent to $3.4
billion from the $12.9 billion sold between Sept. 26 and 28,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BAE Systems and Darden may use the proceeds to repay debt
and for general corporate purposes, according to people with
knowledge of the transactions. John Deere Capital also intends
to use its proceeds for general corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
