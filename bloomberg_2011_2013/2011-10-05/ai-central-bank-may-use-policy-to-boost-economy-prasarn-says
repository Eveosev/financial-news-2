Thailand ’s central bank is ready to
use monetary policy to boost the economy if necessary amid
rising risks to growth, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said.  “If the situation changes and the economy needs to be
stimulated, monetary policy is ready to do the job,” he told
reporters in Bangkok today. Monetary policy makers need to be
“more careful” balancing the risks between economic growth and
inflation, he said.  Thailand’s baht is expected to strengthen next year on
capital inflows to  Asia  as economic growth in Europe slows, he
said. The baht movements will be volatile, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
