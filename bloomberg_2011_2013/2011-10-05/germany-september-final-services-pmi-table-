Markit Economics today released the September Final
services purchasing managers’ index for  Germany . 
The PMI is designed to provide a single snap-shot of Germany’s service industry.
Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below 50, a contraction. The greater 
the divergence from 50, the greater the rate of change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
