The German Free Democratic Party’s
lawmaker  Frank Schaeffler  has enough signatures to force a
members’ vote on the European Stability Mechanism designed to
support the euro,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing party
officials.  Schaeffler, who has called for Greece to leave the euro
region, opposes the so-called ESM and has collected 3,600
signatures from party members, the newspaper said. About 3,230
signatures would be needed to force a referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
