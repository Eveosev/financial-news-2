Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) , a South
African supermarket chain, fell to the lowest in more than two
years in Johannesburg trading after first-half profit as much as
halved following investments in a  loyalty program  and
distribution systems.  The stock declined as much as 4.3 percent to 35.04 rand,
the lowest intraday price since Aug. 20, 2009, and traded at
35.24 rand as of 11:14 a.m. local time.  “Pick n Pay has been losing market share to other
retailers,”  Ferdi Heyneke , a Johannesburg-based equities trader
at Afrifocus Securities Ltd., said by phone. “While they’ve
been making changes like their loyalty program, it’s going to
take time to win investors’ approval back.”  The Cape Town-based grocer said yesterday that earnings per
share in the six months through August dropped 40 percent to 50
percent, while sales increased 7.4 percent amid “tough economic
conditions, dominated by low inflation and a highly competitive
trading environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
