Hog futures climbed to a six-week
high on speculation that global economic woes will ease,
signaling higher demand for U.S. meat. Cattle also gained.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities rose for
the first time in four sessions after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may take further steps to
help an economic recovery. On Oct. 3, wholesale pork reached
98.32 cents a pound, a five-week high. Yesterday, spot-market
hogs advanced for the fourth straight session, government data
show.  “If the economy does well, everybody’s got more disposable
income to eat,” helping boost meat consumption, Jason Golly, a
vice president of risk-management marketing at Lynch Livestock
Inc., said in a telephone interview from Waucoma,  Iowa .  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1.575 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at 88.425 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price touched 88.7 cents today,
the highest for a most-active contract since Aug. 23. The
commodity has advanced 11 percent this year.  U.S. meatpackers processed 1.282 million hogs in the week
through today, up 1.9 percent from the same period a year
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Cattle futures for December delivery climbed 1.1 cents, or
0.9 percent, to settle at $1.2265 a pound in  Chicago . The price
is up 13 percent in 2011.  The GSCI Index rose as much as 3 percent today after losing
5.1 percent in the previous three sessions. The dollar headed
for the first decline in six sessions against a basket of six
major currencies. A weaker greenback increases the investment
appeal of raw materials.  “It’s a positive commodity day today as much as
anything,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement gained 0.85
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.4175 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
