Uganda ’s shilling appreciated the
most against the dollar in more than a week after the central
bank raised its key  interest rate  by four percentage points to
curb inflation, which is at a more than 18-year high.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy gained
as much as 1.4 percent to 2,824.70 per dollar, the most since
Sept. 26, and traded 0.4 stronger at 2,852.50by 10.46 a.m. in
the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank raised the rate to 20 percent from 16
percent in August after the inflation rate surged to 28.3
percent in September. The interest rate was introduced in July
at 13 percent.  “All this gain is because the Bank of Uganda raised the
central  bank rate , which it is using to mop up liquidity,”
Ahmed Kalule, the head of  currency trading  at Bank of Africa
Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “Banks and other
companies are selling dollars to raise shillings in the wake of
a tight market.”  Uganda’s central bank is offering 95 billion shillings ($33
million) of three-, six- and 12-month bills today. The yield on
91-day bills climbed to 17.412 percent at Sept. 21’s sale, the
highest since at least March 2005.  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 against the dollar on
Sept. 23, the weakest since June 1993, as inflation increased
and on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weaken riskier assets
further. The currency slipped 19 percent this year to the
dollar, making the second-worst performer in the period after
the Kenyan shilling, which fell 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
