Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Chief Executive
Officer Brian T. Moynihan said he’s confident the nation’s
biggest lender can withstand any fallout from the European
sovereign debt crisis, even if it hurts the U.S.  “That contagion stuff is real,” Moynihan said during an
event today in  Washington . “It wouldn’t be good for the
American economy to have an economy that represents one third of
the world stay in the condition it’s in.”  Financial shares are under pressure as European regulators
struggle to quell concern that lenders may be hurt by sovereign
debt defaults. The crisis and signs that U.S. economic growth is
stagnating have helped drive down Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America 57 percent this year in New York trading,
the worst performance in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  “We feel confident” that the company can weather  Europe ’s
turmoil, Moynihan said. “The amount of liquidity in the
American system, the way we are situated is far different” than
in Europe.  European authorities drew lessons from the way the U.S.
handled the credit crunch in 2008, and countries such as Germany
and France are working on solutions “with reasonable pace,”
Moynihan said. Ensuring that there is adequate liquidity is
“critical,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
