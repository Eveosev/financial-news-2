New Zealand  and U.S. agencies are
cooperating to provide emergency water supplies to the Pacific
Island nation of Tokelau, as a drought threatens fresh-water
stocks, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully said.  An air force C-130 Hercules carrying water containers will
leave New Zealand early tomorrow for  American Samoa  where it
will rendezvous with a U.S. Coastguard cutter, which has an on-
board desalination plant, McCully said in an e-mailed statement.
The coastguard vessel will then travel to Tokelauâ€™s three main
atolls, he said.  The extra supplies will, with current stocks, be sufficient
in the short-term, McCully said. Tokelau, about 3,380 kilometers
(2,110 miles) north of New Zealand, has a population of 1,500
people, all of whom are New Zealand citizens, he said.  New Zealand is also responding to a water shortage in
Tuvalu, another Pacific island nation in the same region.  Editor: Chris Bourke  To contact the reporter on this story:
