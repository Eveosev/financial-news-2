The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives is reorganizing senior staff as
lawmakers investigate an agency program that allowed illegal gun
purchases in the U.S. in an effort to link the weapons to
Mexican drug cartels.  B. Todd Jones, the firearm agency’s acting chief, told
reporters in  Washington  today that 11 senior managers are being
reassigned.  “We’re going to hit the reset button and move forward,”
Jones said.  Attorney General Eric Holder named Jones, who is also the
U.S. attorney for Minnesota, acting director in August amid
congressional criticism of the ATF gun operation, called Fast
and Furious.  Two of about 2,000 guns that ATF allowed to be carried away
were found at the scene of the December 2010 murder of U.S.
Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in  Arizona , according to a
report released in June by Republican  Darrell Issa , of
 California , chairman of the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee, and Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, the top
Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The lawmakers are continuing to investigate. Representative
 Lamar Smith , a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, asked President Barack Obama in a letter
yesterday to appoint a special prosecutor to determine whether
Holder misled lawmakers in congressional testimony about Fast
and Furious.  The operation sought to show a connection between straw
buyers of assault-style weapons in the U.S. and Mexican drug
trafficking organizations working on both sides of the border,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
