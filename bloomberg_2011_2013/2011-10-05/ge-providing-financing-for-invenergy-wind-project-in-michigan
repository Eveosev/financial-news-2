General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
biggest maker of power-generation equipment, is providing equity
financing for a wind farm that Invenergy LLC is building in
central  Michigan .  Invenergy didn’t say how much GE is investing in its 110.4-
megawatt Gratiot County project in a statement today. UniCredit
Bank AG,  Natixis (KN) , Rabobank and Siemens Financial Services GmbH
are providing debt financing, the closely held developer  said .
DTE Energy Co. will buy the project’s electricity under a 20-
year contract.  Invenergy, based in  Chicago , also is building a second,
102.4-megawatt phase that DTE Energy will acquire when complete.
GE is supplying 133 of its 1.6-megawatt  wind turbines  for the
two phases, and construction is expected to be complete in the
first quarter of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
