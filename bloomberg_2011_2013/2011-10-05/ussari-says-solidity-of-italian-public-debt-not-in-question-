Giuseppe Mussari, head of  Italy ’s
banking association, said the solidity of the nation’s public
debt is “not in question” following the downgrade by Moody’s
Investors Service.  Mussari, speaking to reporters in  Rome  today, said Italy
needs economic-growth measures. “Borrowing costs are a result
of weak growth,” he said, adding that he was waiting to see
about possible downgrades of Italian banks by Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
