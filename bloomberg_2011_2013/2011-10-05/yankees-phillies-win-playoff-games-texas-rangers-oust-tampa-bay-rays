A.J. Burnett  and three relievers
combined on a four-hitter and the New York Yankees won 10-1 at
Detroit, tying their best-of-five American League Division
Series with the Tigers at two games apiece.  The winner of a decisive Game 5 at New York’s Yankee
Stadium on Oct. 6 will face the Texas Rangers in the AL
Championship Series. The Rangers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3
earlier today to win that series three games to one and return
to the ALCS.  In the National League, Ben Francisco’s pinch-hit three-run
homer broke up a scoreless game and gave the Philadelphia
Phillies a 3-2 win against the  St. Louis Cardinals  for a 2-1
lead in their playoff series.  Cole Hamels  allowed five hits in
six scoreless innings for the Phillies, who are now one win from
reaching the NL Championship Series for the fourth straight
season. Albert Pujols had three doubles for the Cardinals.  In the other NL Division Series, the Milwaukee Brewers are
trying to complete a 3-0 sweep tonight at the Arizona
Diamondbacks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
