Richards Bay Coal Terminal Ltd., the
largest facility of its kind in  Africa , said Chief Executive
Officer Raymond Chirwa resigned after two years in the job.  Chirwa will pursue “other ventures,” the company said in
an e-mailed statement today. Alan Waller, general manager of
finance, will be acting CEO until further notice, it said.  RBCT, capable of shipping 91 million metric tons of coal a
year, exported 63.4 million tons in 2010, mainly because of
limited railroad capacity. Chirwa became chief operating officer
on July 1, 2008, and worked at RBCT for nine years.  The terminal is owned by the largest producers of coal in
 South Africa , including  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , BHP Billiton Ltd.
and  Xstrata Plc. (XTA)  It ships coal to  India , China and Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
