The  European Central Bank  said a
quarterly revaluation drove up the value of its gold holdings.  The value of gold and gold receivables rose 56.8 billion
euros ($75.6 billion) to 420 billion euros in the week ending
Sept. 30, the central bank said in a statement today.  “In line with the Eurosystem’s harmonized accounting
rules, gold, foreign exchange, securities holdings and financial
instruments of the Eurosystem are revalued at market rates and
prices as at the end of each quarter,” the ECB said in the
statement. The ECB said it used a gold price of 1,206 euros per
fine ounce to carry out the adjustment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
