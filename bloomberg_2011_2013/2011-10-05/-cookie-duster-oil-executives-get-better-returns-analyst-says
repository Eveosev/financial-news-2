Oil and natural-gas companies with
executives who sport a mustache, a facial feature donned by
Confucius, Einstein and Magnum P.I., had better returns during
the past decade than those without the “cookie duster,”
according to Global Hunter Securities LLC.  Among 104 U.S. exploration and production companies
surveyed, 29 had at least one senior executive with facial hair,
Michael Bodino, managing director at Global Hunter in  Fort
Worth , Texas, wrote today in a  note  to investors. Those with the
“soup strainer” generated a 17 percent compounded annual
growth rate over the past 10 years while those with only clean-
shaven senior management grew 8 percent.  Leading the “hairy lip hall of fame” is Roger Manny,
chief financial officer at  Range Resources Corp. (RRC) , which had a
compound annual growth rate of 147 percent since he joined in
2003, according to the note.  Mustachioed executives successfully sold oil and gas
companies. Chairman Bob Simpson sold XTO Energy Inc. to  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  for $34.9 billion last year, a 26 percent premium to
the share price.  Petrohawk Energy Corp. (HK)  President Dick Stoneburner sold the company to  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  for $14.9
billion, a 61 percent premium, in August.  Companies with clean-shaven executives have beaten their
competitors in the recent “challenging” market, Bodino wrote.
“But as true flavor saver enthusiasts know, like a company, a
good ’stache takes time to grow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
