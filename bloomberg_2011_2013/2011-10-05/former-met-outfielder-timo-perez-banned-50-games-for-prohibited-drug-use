Former  New York  Mets outfielder Timo Perez, a free-agent minor-leaguer, was suspended for 50 games
after testing positive for prohibited drugs.  Perez was banned after testing positive for Ritalinic Acid
and Methylphenidate, Major League Baseball said in a statement.
The suspension would begin when he signs with a major-league
organization.  Perez, 36, hasn’t played in the majors since 2007, when he
was with the Detroit Tigers. He hit .304 this year with Triple-A
Toledo, the Tigers’ top minor-league team.  Perez was a rookie with the Mets when they faced the New
York Yankees in the 2000  World Series . He went 2-for-16 as the
Yankees won in five games.  He left the Mets in 2003 and went on to play for the
 Chicago White Sox , St. Louis Cardinals and Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
