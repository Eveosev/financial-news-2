Houston Texans wide receiver  Andre Johnson  is out indefinitely after undergoing a minor procedure
on his right hamstring, coach Gary Kubiak said today.  Kubiak didn’t specify the nature of Johnson’s injury and
wouldn’t estimate how much of the National Football League
season the five-time Pro Bowl selection might miss.  Johnson was injured without being touched during the second
quarter of the Texans’ 17-10 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers
last week. The All-Pro receiver has a team-leading 25 receptions
for 352 yards and two touchdowns this season.  The Texans have a 3-1 record and host the  Oakland Raiders 
this week before playing at Baltimore and Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
