Polyus Gold International Plc,
 Russia ’s largest gold miner, is focused on its growth strategy 
and doesn’t currently plan mergers, said James Nieuwenhuys, 
chief operating officer of the company's OAO Polyus Gold unit.  “We are far too busy now,” Nieuwenhuys told reporters at
a conference in Moscow. Polyus is concentrating on increasing 
production, moving its domicile from Jersey to the U.K. mainland 
and gaining inclusion in the benchmark FTSE 100 Index, he said.  Billionaire co-owner Mikhail Prokhorov said in December the
company was seeking to merge with an international rival as
early as this year to become one of the world’s three biggest
gold miners. Polyus completed a reverse takeover of Kazakhgold
Group in July, gaining a primary London listing.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ,  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  and  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  were the top three producers in 2010, according to
London-based researcher GFMS Ltd. Polyus Gold was in 10th place
with 43.1 metric tons of gold produced, it said.  Polyus plans to spend $8.7 billion by 2020 on increasing
production, Nieuwenhuys said. The company targets spending of
$4.7 billion to double output to 2.8 million ounces by 2015, and
the rest of the investment to reach 4.4 million ounces of
production by 2020, he said earlier at the Minex Russia
conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
