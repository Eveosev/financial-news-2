Turkey’s Export-Import bank signed an
agreement with  Saudi Arabia ’s  Islamic Development Bank  to offer
political risk insurance to exporters and help Turkey’s trade
with Islamic countries,  Dunya  newspaper reported.  The so-called Arab Spring uprisings and political
uncertainty in parts of the Middle East and Africa have
increased risks and made export insurance more important for
Turkish exporters and investors, the Istanbul-based newspaper
quoted Turkey Eximbank general manager Hayrettin Kaplan as
saying.  The two organizations plan to offer a broader range of
insurance products and services to encourage trade between
Turkey and other member nations of the Islamic Development Bank,
Kaplan was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
