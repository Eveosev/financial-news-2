The Bank of  New York  Mellon  China  ADR
Index, which tracks American depositary receipts, advanced 2.5
percent to 352.75. The New York Stock Exchange China Index
increased 1.8 percent to 212.77. Markets in China are closed
this week for a holiday.  The following companies were among the most active Chinese
shares in New York trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses and
prices are as of the close of trading at 4 p.m. New York time.  CDC Corp. (CHINA)  , a business software service provider,
plunged 52 percent to a record low of 42 cents before trading
was halted. The company yesterday filed a petition for
 bankruptcy protection  from creditors in the  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Atlanta, according to its regulatory filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission today. CDC listed $377.4
million in assets and $250.2 million in debt as of June 30 in
Chapter 11 documents submitted to the court.  Solar panel inventories built up during a second-quarter
slowdown are now largely depleted because of higher demand in
the second half of the year, said Martin Simonek, a solar
analyst at the London-based Bloomberg New Energy Finance. He
said sales of solar panels may decline for the first time in
2012 after “significant” drops in subsidies in key European
markets. Demand may gain in 2013, when cheaper panels make solar
energy competitive in more sunny nations and developing
economies, Simonek said.  Suntech Power Holdings (STP US), the world’s largest maker
of solar panels, jumped 16 percent to $2.38.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  , China’s largest solar panel
maker by market capitalization, leaped 16 percent to a one-week
high of $7.53.  JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS US), a manufacturer of solar
cells and modules, gained 11 percent to a two-week high of
$6.36.  JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO US), the world’s largest solar-
cell maker by capacity, soared 11 percent to $1.89.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE US), China’s fifth-
largest maker of solar modules, soared 14 percent to $3.73, the
highest since Sept. 16.  Oil futures rose the most in almost five months in New York
after a U.S. Energy Department report showed an unexpected
supply decline and U.S. companies added more jobs than expected
last month.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  , China’s largest offshore energy
producer, rose 3.6 percent, the most in a week, to $155.82.  PetroChina Co. (PTR US) the nation’s biggest oil producer,
added 3.3 percent to $120.61.  To contact the reporter on this story:
