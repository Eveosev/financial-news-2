Chancellor Angela Merkel  said  Germany 
is ready to join any potential move to recapitalize banks if
such a step is necessary. Speaking to reporters in Brussels
today, Merkel urged the euro-region to commission independent
advice to help establish uniform objective criteria whether such
recapitalization is necessary.  “Time is running out” to establish whether
recapitalization is necessary, she said following talks with EU
Commission President  Jose Barroso .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
