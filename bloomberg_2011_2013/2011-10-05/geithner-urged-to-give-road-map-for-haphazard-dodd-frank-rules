U.S. regulators should publish a
schedule for when all Dodd-Frank Act rules will take effect to
smooth a “haphazard implementation process” that is hurting
the economy, Representative  Scott Garrett  said in a letter.  “To put it gently, the piecemeal rulemaking process has
perpetuated uncertainty, which is holding back economic
growth,” Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, wrote to Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  in the letter released today.  Garrett, a member of the House Financial Services
Committee, said the Financial Stability Oversight Council led by
Geithner should publish an implementation schedule by Nov. 15 to
address “grave concerns about the lack of direction that U.S.
financial regulators have provided thus far.”  Geithner is scheduled to testify tomorrow before the
Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee to
discuss the first annual report from FSOC, a 10-member council
of regulators created by Dodd-Frank, the financial-rules
overhaul enacted last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
