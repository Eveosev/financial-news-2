Crude oil shipments from Dansk
Undergrunds Consortium, the producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller
Maersk A/S, for November are scheduled to be unchanged from this
month at six cargoes, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News showed.  Exports for November will total 3.6 million barrels, or
120,000 barrels a day, the plan showed.  Copenhagen-based Maersk holds 39 percent of the venture,
known as DUC.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns 46 percent and  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  has 15 percent. Maersk will receive three cargoes, Shell
will get one and Chevron two, according to the schedule.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
