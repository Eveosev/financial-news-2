JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Dmitry Pugachevsky, who oversaw analysis of some of the bank’s
derivatives risks, joined Quantifi Inc. to run the research
division.  Pugachevsky, who has more than 18 years’ experience in the
field, was the head of counterparty credit modeling at  New York- 
based JPMorgan. Before that, he was the global head of credit
analytics at Bear Stearns Cos.  Changes to derivatives regulation in the U.S. and new
international capital rules for banks “have brought a
heightened focus on counterparty risk and highlight the need for
firms to adopt active counterparty risk-management systems,”
Pugachevsky said in a statement released by Summit, New Jersey-
based Quantifi today.  Pugachevsky has a doctorate in applied mathematics from
 Carnegie Mellon University  in Pittsburgh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
