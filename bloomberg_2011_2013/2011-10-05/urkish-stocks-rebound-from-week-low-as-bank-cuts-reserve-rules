Turkish stocks rebounded from the
lowest level in more than a week after the central bank cut
foreign-currency  reserve requirements  for lenders.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  surged 1.5 percent to
58,084.55 by 12:05 p.m. in Istanbul. Banks led the advance, with
the gauge of Turkish lenders rallying 2.2 percent.  The central bank earlier today cut reserve requirements on
foreign-currency deposits by as much as 250 basis points, saying
it would add $1.3 billion to the banking system. The bank is
today offering $1.35 billion at a currency auction, the most
since it started the daily sales on Aug. 5. The sale may shore
up the lira, which depreciated 13 percent in the third quarter
and reached a record-low 1.9096 per dollar yesterday.  Stocks “rebounded from yesterday’s selloff, supported by
the central bank’s foreign-currency reserve-rate requirement
cut,” Funda Afacan, an analyst at BGC Partners Inc. in
Istanbul, said by phone. The currency auction is also supporting
the market, she said.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the largest lender by market
value, gained 2.1 percent to 6.90 liras.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi
AS (HALKB) , a state-run bank, recovered 2.5 percent of its 6.5 percent
drop yesterday, trading at 12.45 liras, and  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , the
lender part-owned by Citigroup Inc., rose 2.4 percent to 6.92
liras, paring its 6.1 percent loss yesterday.  The banking index had dropped 5.2 percent yesterday on
concern the European debt crisis would affect the continent’s
banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
