BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
provider of exchange-traded funds, called for higher standards
of disclosure and stronger, more uniform regulation of the
funds, to allay regulatory concerns about risks they pose to the
financial system, the Financial Times reported.  Joseph Linhares, who heads BlackRock’s iShares unit in
 Europe , said that, while ETFs “started out as transparent,
liquid, simple vehicles,” some “have gone to opacity,” the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
