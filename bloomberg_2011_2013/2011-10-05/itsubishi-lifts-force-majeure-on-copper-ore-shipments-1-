Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) ,  Japan ’s
third-largest copper producer, has lifted force majeure on
concentrate shipments to its Onahama smelter, more than six
months after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  The smelter, located in Fukushima prefecture, resumed
partial operations from June 30 after the disaster halted
output, damaged the nearby port and drove the company to declare
force majeure, a legal clause allowing companies to miss
deliveries because of circumstances beyond their control.  “We started notifying suppliers from Sept. 29,” spokesman
Toshiaki Yamada said today. The Onahama smelter, which has an
annual capacity of 258,000 metric tons, has been running at full
capacity since Sept. 3, Yasunobu Suzuki, executive officer at
the company’s sales department, said on Sept. 15.  The company has a 50 percent stake in the smelter, followed
by Dowa Holdings Co. with 31.6 percent and Furukawa Metals &
Resources Co. with 12.7 percent. The remainder is owned by
companies including Mitsubishi Cable Industries Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
