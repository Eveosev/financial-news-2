Israel ’s 2022 bond rose for a 10th
day, pushing the yield to the lowest since it was sold, on
concern economic growth will be hurt by  Europe  even as the
region’s policy makers look for ways to stem the debt crisis.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
notes due January 2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.53 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The
rate swung between gains and losses as the  International
Monetary Fund  said European Union officials are working on plans
to boost bank capital. The rate on the 10-year securities has
dropped 31 basis points in the past 10 days.  “It’s still unclear what the depth of European
intervention will be and how determined and swift the injection
of liquidity to the banking system will be,” said Amir Haik,
chief economist at Union  Bank of Israel  in Tel Aviv. “All of
the markets are very volatile.”  The global economic recovery is still tentative and Israel
continues to grapple with fallout from the world financial
crisis, the Bank of Israel said in a report today. Governor
 Stanley Fischer , who had raised rates for more than two years,
reversed policy on Sept. 26 and cut the key rate by a quarter
percentage point to 3 percent, citing the worsening global
economic outlook.  Shekel Gains  The shekel was little changed at 3.7382 against the dollar.
The currency has dropped 3.6 percent in the past 12 months, the
best performer among 10 emerging markets in Europe, the  Middle
East  and  Africa  tracked by Bloomberg.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, increased one basis
point to 2.73 percent. The two-year breakeven rate, which
reflects market expectations for inflation over the period,
gained for the first time in four days, gaining three basis
points to 179, implying an average annual inflation rate of 1.79
percent.  Consumer prices may rise 2.3 percent in the next 12 months,
according to the average of forecasters surveyed by the Bank of
Israel, the bank said Sept. 20. Inflation-linked bonds due June
2013 rose for the first time in four days, lowering the yield
four basis points to 1.15 percent.  The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds snapped a three-
day drop, gaining 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
