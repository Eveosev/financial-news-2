Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding,
Egypt’s biggest publicly traded property developer, was raised
to “outperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG,
citing “relatively strong sales in the second half and
attractive valuation.”  “We re-iterate our cautious view on Egypt real estate
sector owing to continued weakness in property transactions as a
result of land disputes,” analysts Ahmed Badr and Vincent
Resillot wrote in a note to clients today. “However, we upgrade
Talaat Moustafa to outperform on the back of sales recovery
which breaks the current market trend and makes it a
differentiated story with significant upside that is not priced
in by the market.”  The share price estimate was raised to 5.67 Egyptian pounds
from 5.13 pounds. Talaat Moustafa shares have lost 57 percent
this year and closed 4 percent lower at 3.6 pounds yesterday.  Credit Suisse cut the price estimate of  Palm Hills
Developments SAE (PHDC)  to 1.32 pounds from 3.08 pounds with an
“underperform” rating and lowered the estimate of  Six of
October Development & Investment (OCDI)  Co., or Sodic, to 15.7 pounds
from 38.3 pounds with a “neutral” outlook.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
