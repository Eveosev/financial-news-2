The Philippine Stock Exchange is
aiming to introduce exchange-traded funds and  securities lending 
to lure overseas investors to one of  Asia ’s smallest stock
markets, according to President Hans Sicat.  The bourse, which lengthened its trading day by an hour to
1 p.m. starting Oct. 3, is in talks with government agencies to
introduce ETFs and “a system for borrowing and lending
securities to increase trading activity,” Sicat said in an
interview in Manila today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
