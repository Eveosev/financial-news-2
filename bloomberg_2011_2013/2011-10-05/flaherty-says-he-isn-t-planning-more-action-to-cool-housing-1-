Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he’s not planning further action to cool the
country’s housing market.  Flaherty said that before acting, he would need to see
“clear evidence of a bubble in the housing market in Canada,
which we have not seen.” He defined that as “dramatic surges
in prices in some part of the country.”  Flaherty, who was speaking to reporters in New York,
tightened mortgage rules earlier this year amid a surge in
household debt. He said those actions had led to “some
softening in the Canadian housing market.”  Canadian  house prices  rose 1.3 percent in July, a gain of
5.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the Teranet-
National Bank home price index published last week.  Flaherty noted there has been some “unusual” demand in
some markets, citing Asian investors purchasing real estate in
 Vancouver .  To contact the reporter on this story:
