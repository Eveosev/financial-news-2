Investors who expect  Turkey ’s lira to
depreciate will “suffer” as the central bank plans its biggest
dollar auction since starting sales last month to defend the
currency, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. said.  “The Central Bank of Turkey will play hardball in foreign
currency going forward, and their reserve position allows for
that,” emerging markets strategist  Luis Costa  wrote in a report
e-mailed to clients today. “Shorts in the Turkish lira will
suffer as the central bank is likely to increase the magnitude
of currency interventions.” Investors who sell short hope to
profit by repurchasing an assets later at a weaker price and
returning them to the holder.  The central bank said it would sell as much as $1.35
billion for liras today, its biggest sale since starting daily
currency auctions on Aug. 5.  The lira rebounded from a record low against the dollar
reached yesterday, strengthening 1.2 percent to 1.8653 by 1:53
p.m. in Istanbul.  Turkey’s foreign-currency reserves stood at $85.6 billion
last week, down from a 2011 high of $93.3 billion on July 8,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
