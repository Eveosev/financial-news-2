European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said policy makers should learn
from past experience and focus on systemic risk.  “This big financial crisis follows the same sequence of
events” as previous crises, including high leverage, bursting
bubbles, a financial crisis, recession and sovereign debt
crises, Liikanen said at a conference in Kiel,  Germany , today.
“It is extremely important that we never neglect history the
way we did a few years ago.”  “If the financial sector grows out of proportion it’s
always associated with risks,” Liikanen added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
