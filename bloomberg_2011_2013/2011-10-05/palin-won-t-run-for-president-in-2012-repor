Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
told supporters she won’t run for president in 2012, ABC News
reported.  In a letter to supporters, Palin, a Republican, said she
decided that “my family comes first” and that she can be more
effective in helping elect other “true public servants” to
office, according to ABC, which published the letter on its
