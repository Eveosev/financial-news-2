Cyprus wants to borrow 2.5 billion
euros ($3.3 billion) from  Russia  for 4 1/2 years, helping the
eastern Mediterranean island to control its borrowing costs.  The Cabinet asked Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias to
complete the agreement, government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou 
said today in an e-mailed statement. The annual  interest rate  is
4.5 percent, Stefanou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
