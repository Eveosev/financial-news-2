Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest
pipeline owner, is studying the feasibility of building a
pipeline to Colombia’s Pacific coast, said Chief Executive
Officer Patrick Daniel.  Enbridge, based in Calgary, is working with “eight or
nine” partners to study the possible pipeline to the Pacific
Coast, Daniel said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in
 New York  today. He declined to name the companies Enbridge is
working with.  “When customers provide money for a study that’s a good
sign,” he said, responding to a question about how close the
company is to an agreement to build the pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
