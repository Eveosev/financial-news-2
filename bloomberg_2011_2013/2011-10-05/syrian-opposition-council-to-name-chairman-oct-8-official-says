The Syrian National Council, a group
formed this week in opposition to the regime of President Bashar
Al-Assad, will name a chairman in Cairo on Oct. 8, according to
Burhan Ghalioun, a political sociologist at Parisâ€™s Sorbonne
University who is a member of the group.  The council is against foreign intervention in  Syria  and
will seek recognition from Arab nations before seeking support
from other countries, Ghalioun said in an interview with Al-
Jazeera television in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
