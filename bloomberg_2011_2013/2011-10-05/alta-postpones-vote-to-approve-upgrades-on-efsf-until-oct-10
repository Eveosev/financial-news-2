Malta, one of three euro-area nations
yet to approve an enhanced rescue fund to counter the region’s
debt crisis, failed to vote on the measures after an opposition
lawmaker raised procedural objections.  Acting speaker Vincent Galea said last night that a debate
in parliament would resume on Oct. 10. The session finished at 1
a.m. without the vote taking place after queries were raised by
former Premier Alfred Sant.  Slovakia and the Netherlands are also yet to approve
passage of the bloc’s main defense against the sovereign-debt
crisis spreading, while the other 14 members of the euro area
have already signed up. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner yesterday added to pressure for European officials to
move more quickly, saying they need to build confidence and
“hold this thing together.”  While Malta’s opposition Labour party has said it will vote
in favor of the legislation, Sant raised questions about the
legality of the procedure for tabling the bill.  Dutch lawmakers are due to decide today after a majority of
parliament signaled suppport. In Slovakia, where ruling parties
are yet to reach an accord on the measures, a vote is set for
Oct. 11.  The enhanced powers of the 440 billion-euro ($587 billion)
EFSF were approved at a July 21 meeting of European leaders in
Brussels. The measures would allow the fund to buy the debt of
distressed euro-area nations, aid troubled banks in the region
and offer credit lines to governments. The EFSF’s current role
is to sell bonds to finance rescue loans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
