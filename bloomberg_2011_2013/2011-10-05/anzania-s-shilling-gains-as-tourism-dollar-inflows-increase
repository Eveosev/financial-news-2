Tanzania’s shilling appreciated as
dollar proceeds from the  tourism industry  increased.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 4.8 percent at 1,591.5 per dollar, and traded 0.7
percent up at 1,660.5 by 12:52 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital, paring its decline this year to 11 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have seen inflows from the tourism sector,” said Eric
Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of Commerce Ltd., Absa
Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone. “But the shilling
is still in a weak zone, because we expect demand for dollars to
increase, so may not hold for long.”  Tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross
domestic product is expected to increase to 13.4 percent of GDP
by 2021 from 12.9 percent now, the World Travel & Tourism
Council said on its website.  Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1 percent in August
on higher energy and food costs, the National Bureau of
Statistics said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
