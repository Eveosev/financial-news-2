Tropical Storm Philippe has turned
north in the Atlantic Ocean and may become a hurricane tomorrow,
while two potential storms take shape in the Pacific, according
to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  Philippe, 495 miles (800 kilometers) south-southeast of
 Bermuda , is moving north at 7 miles per hour with 65 mph winds,
the Miami-based center said in an  advisory  before 5 p.m. East
Coast time. Philippe is the 16th named storm of the  Atlantic
hurricane season , which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.  “The shear over the cyclone is finally decreasing as
predicted and Philippe has a very small window of opportunity
for strengthening,” the center said in a forecast analysis.  In the Pacific, the hurricane center is tracking two
potential storms off the coast of Mexico.  The first, 525 miles south-southwest of  Acapulco , Mexico
has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical system in the
next two days, according to the hurricane center. The second,
825 miles southwest of Manzanillo,  Mexico , has a 70 percent
chance of becoming a storm.  -- Editors: Richard Stubbe, Dan Stets  To contact the reporter on this story:
