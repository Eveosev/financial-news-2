Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest auto-parts maker, will focus its investments on  Asia  in
the coming years, where sales will account for a third of the
German company’s total, board member Heinz-Gerhard Wente said.  While Europe will remain the biggest market for
Continental, next year might “bring some problems” because of
a possible economic slowdown triggered by the sovereign-debt
crisis, Wente said in an interview in Bucharest today, adding
that he doesn’t see signs of a “dramatic downturn.” Asian
sales now represent 21 percent of overall sales.  “We expect the highest market volumes in Asia in the next
few years and our investment focus is Asia, especially India and
 China ,” Wente said. “Operationally, we see quite a stable
business but we don’t know what impact the euro crisis will be
and we are quite reserved about the possible number of cars
produced next year.”  A recovery in global auto markets has helped Continental
improve its financial situation and report the highest quarterly
profit in more than three years. The Hannover-based manufacturer
received its first credit-rating upgrade from Moody’s Investors
Service in six years in April after arranging a 6 billion-euro
($8 billion) loan package to cut borrowing costs.  Continental also plans to increase investments in  Romania 
and spend about 40 million euros to increase output of its tire
plant in the western city of Timisoara, according to Wente.  To contact the reporter on this story:
