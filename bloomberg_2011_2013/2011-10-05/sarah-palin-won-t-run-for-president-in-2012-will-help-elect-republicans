Sarah Palin said she won’t seek the
2012 Republican presidential nomination, ending a lengthy and
attention-grabbing political flirtation that kept voters and
potential rivals guessing while buttressing her public profile.  The former Alaska governor and her party’s 2008 vice
presidential nominee -- more recently a reality TV star and
cable-news commentator -- said in a statement sent to supporters
that she opted against a White House run because she believed
“that at this time I can be more effective in a decisive role
to help elect other true public servants to office -- from the
nation’s governors, to congressional seats and the presidency.”  Her announcement removed a major uncertainty surrounding
the Republican presidential race while raising questions about
how she might use her celebrity and political following to shape
the primary.  “I will continue driving the discussion for freedom and
free markets, including in the race for president,” Palin’s
statement said. “I will help coordinate strategies to assist in
replacing the president, retaking the Senate and maintaining the
House.”  Palin, whose unconventional tactics and star quality
generated attention for her even from the sidelines of the
presidential contest, will likely offer a coveted endorsement
for one of the Republican contenders.  Her decision not to run could provide a boost to Texas
Governor  Rick Perry , who is competing with Minnesota
Representative  Michele Bachmann  and businessman  Herman Cain  for
the backing of those Tea Party-aligned voters who favored Palin,
as well as the fiscal and social conservatives who hold sway in
the Iowa caucuses that start the nomination process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
