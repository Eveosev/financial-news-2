Nigeria ’s naira depreciated against
the dollar and headed for the weakest closing level on record
after the government outlined plans to adopt a weaker exchange
rate in calculating its budget for next year.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.4
percent to 160.1 per dollar in the  interbank market  by 11:29
a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. A close at this level
would be the weakest since at least 1994, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria plans to raise spending by 7 percent to 4.8
trillion naira ($30 billion) in 2012 in its budget, increasing
funding for capital projects, according to a three-year plan
sent to parliament in Abuja yesterday by the Budget Office.
Africa’s top oil producer will estimate its revenue using a
crude-oil price of $75 a barrel and an  exchange rate  of 153
naira per dollar, weaker than the current 150 naira, according
to the document.  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions. It broke that
band on Sept. 26, reaching 155.02 naira per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
