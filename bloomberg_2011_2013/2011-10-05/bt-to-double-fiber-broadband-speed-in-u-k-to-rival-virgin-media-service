BT Group Plc (BT/A) , the biggest British
fixed-line phone company, said it will roll out a faster fiber
broadband service as it seeks to win clients and take market
share from rival  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)   BT will double the speed of its main fiber product to up to
80 megabits per second, while also starting a service directly
to customer homes, the London-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “All our fiber products are fit for the future and these
developments show that to be the case,”  Liv Garfield , chief
executive officer of BT’s Openreach unit, said in the statement.
“As always we want to go further and faster.”  BT plans to spend 2.5 billion pounds ($3.9 billion)
building a fiber network serving two-thirds of British homes by
2015. The company added 141,000 net broadband customers to its
retail unit in the three months through June, while Virgin Media
and  TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc (TALK)  both reported subscriber losses.
Virgin is already rolling out a 100 megabits-per-second service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
