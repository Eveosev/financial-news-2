Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said that the fund
could use its own resources to restore confidence in the debt
markets of Italy and  Spain .  “We could also be part of this process of restoring
confidence in the debt markets,” Borges said in an interview
with Dublin-based broadcaster RTE. The IMF could be “helpful”
to the debt markets of the two countries by providing
“precautionary lending” or “special purpose facilities,” he
said.  Borges said that there are no “immediate proposals on the
table” as policy makers focus on the approval of changes to
 Europe ’s bailout fund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
