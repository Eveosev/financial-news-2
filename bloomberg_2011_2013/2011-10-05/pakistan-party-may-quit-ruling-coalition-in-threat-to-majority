Pakistan’s third largest political
party may quit the coalition of Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  after its key demands were not met, one of its leaders
said, in a threat to the government’s majority in parliament.  “Our ministers and advisers have submitted their
resignations to the party chief,” said Chaudhry Shahbaz Goshi,
a vice president of the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid) led by
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, in a phone interview. “The prime
minister has failed to deliver on our demands, which include
creation of new provinces and ending power blackouts. Now it’s
up to our leadership to decide whether we should remain part of
the government.”  Gilani needs the PML-Q’s backing to maintain his majority
in the lower house of parliament. Another partner, the Muttahida
Qaumi Movement, left the coalition in June citing policy
differences. The  Pakistan  Peoples’ Party of Gilani and President
Asif Zardari has 125 lawmakers in the 342-member National
Assembly, while Hussain’s PML-Q has 50 representatives.  Hussain’s party joined the ruling alliance in May, ending a
rivalry with the Peoples’ party going back four decades.
Zardari, the husband of assassinated former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto, had sought support as he struggled to revive
growth in an economy battered by militant attacks and floods.  The Bhuttos lived in exile during two Pakistani military
governments -- in the 1980s and from 1999 until 2008 -- that
were backed by Hussain’s family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
