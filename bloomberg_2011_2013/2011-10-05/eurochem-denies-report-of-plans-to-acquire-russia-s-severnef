OAO Eurochem,  Russia ’s largest
producer of nitrogen fertilizers, denied a report that it plans
to acquire OOO Severneft, a natural-gas producer in the
country’s Yamalo-Nenets region.  “We have never planned to, aren’t planning and will not
buy this company,” Vladimir Torin, a spokesman for Eurochem in
Moscow, said by telephone. Interfax reported earlier today that
the company may buy Severneft, citing people it didn’t identify.
Nitrogen fertilizers are produced from natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
