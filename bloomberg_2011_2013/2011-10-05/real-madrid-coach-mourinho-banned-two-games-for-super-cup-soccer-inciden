Real Madrid coach  Jose Mourinho  was
suspended two games by the Spanish soccer federation for his
part in a brawl during a match with rival Barcelona.  Television replays showed Mourinho appeared to poke
Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova in the eye near the end of the
Aug. 17 Spanish Super Cup match at the Nou Camp stadium.
Vilanova responded by pushing Mourinho and was handed a one-
match ban.  A Spanish soccer official said in a telephone interview he
didn’t know when the bans would be served.  The incident was part of a brawl involving players just
before Barcelona’s 3-2 home victory sealed a 5-4 win in the two-
game series. The Super Cup opens the Spanish season and pits the
defending league champion against the domestic cup winner.  Mourinho has just finished serving a two-match suspension
in Real’s first two Champions League group games after
suggesting in April that Barcelona gets preferential treatment
from European soccer ruling body UEFA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
