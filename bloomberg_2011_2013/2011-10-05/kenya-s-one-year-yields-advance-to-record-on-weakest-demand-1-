Kenya ’s one-year bill yields climbed
to a record as inflation runs at more than triple the target
rate, with investors bidding for 4 percent of the amount
offered, the weakest demand since the debt was first sold.  The yield on the bills rose to 14.449 percent from 12.536
percent at a sale on Sept. 7, the highest since it was first
offered in August 2009, the Central Bank of Kenya said in an e-
mailed statement today from Nairobi, the capital. It issued
182.2 million shillings ($2 million) of 364-day bills, having
received 218.5 million shillings of bids, or 4 percent of the 5
billion shillings offered.  “The yields are expected to rise due to the prevailing
high inflation rates,” Fred Moturi a fixed-income dealer at
Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview
before the auction.  Kenyan inflation accelerated for the eleventh consecutive
month in September to 17.3 percent, more than triple the 5
percent target, compared with 16.7 percent in August, on rising
food and fuel costs.  The central bank today raised its benchmark rate by a
record 400 basis points, signaling a policy shift in a bid to
combat inflation and curb the shilling’s slump to a record-low
104.2 per dollar, reached on Sept. 27. The rate was increased to
11 percent, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
Forecasts ranged from 7.5 percent to 10 percent.  The bank also issued 3.5 billion shillings of 182-day
bills, with they yield rising to 14.283 percent, the highest
since February 2001, from 13.493 percent at the previous sale,
the central bank said.  It received 4.07 billion shillings of bids, or 1.4 times
more than the 3 billion shillings offered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
