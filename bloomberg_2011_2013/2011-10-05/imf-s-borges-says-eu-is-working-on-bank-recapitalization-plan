Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said European Union
authorities are working together on a plan to recapitalize the
banking sector.  European authorities are “all working together on a plan
to bring more capital into the banking system,” Borges said at
a press conference in Brussels today. “We would recommend that
it move to a European approach,” he said. “More should be done
on a cross-border basis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
