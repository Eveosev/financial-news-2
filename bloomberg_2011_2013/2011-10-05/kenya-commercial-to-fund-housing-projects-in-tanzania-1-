Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
nation’s biggest lender by branches, said it will provide more
than $31 million to finance four housing projects planned by
 Tanzania’s National Housing Corp .  Kenya Commercial Bank plans to fund a total of 10 of the
corporation’s projects, Mortgages Director Joram Kiarie told
reporters in Nairobi today.  The state-run National Housing Corp. owns most of the prime
residential and commercial land in Tanzania, Kiarie said. The
housing deficit in east  Africa ’s second-biggest economy is
estimated at three million units and growing at a rate of
200,000 units a year. It is estimated that only 1 percent of new
houses are funded through mortgages, according to the
corporation’s  strategic plan , which runs until 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
