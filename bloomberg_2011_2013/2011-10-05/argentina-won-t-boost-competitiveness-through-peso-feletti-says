Argentina  won’t change its  exchange
rate  policy in order to make the country more competitive,
Deputy Economy Minister Roberto Feletti said today.  In a remark to a congressional budget committee in  Buenos
Aires , Feletti said trade between Argentina and  Brazil  doesn’t
depend on the exchange rate but on demand.  Argentina plans to boost competitiveness through investment
in energy and infrastruture, Feletti, who was speaking on the
2012 budget, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
