Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s
government, if reelected, will stick to its plan to eliminate
the country’s general government budget deficit in 2015 and run
a balanced budget for the following three years, Finance
Minister Jacek Rostowski said today in Warsaw.  The fiscal plan would result in cutting  Poland ’s debt to 45
percent of gross domestic product in 2018, Rostowski said in a
lecture at the Warsaw Technical University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
