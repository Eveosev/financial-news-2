Gasoline in New York Harbor
strengthened after a government report showed imports of the
fuel to the East Coast dropped to the lowest level on record.  Imports of gasoline to the region fell 124,000 barrels to
397,000 barrels a day last week, according to the Energy
Department. It’s the lowest level since at least 2004, when the
department began showing regional data.  “Since 2004 refinery gasoline production has increased,
the use of ethanol has increased, while gasoline demand” has
slowed, said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  The premium for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor gained 2 cents to 11.25
cents versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:05 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 8.11 cents to $2.662 a gallon.  PBF Energy Partners LP hasn’t secured a hydrogen cyanide
and carbon sulfide release at its  Delaware  City, Delaware,
refinery after a pipe broke in a boiler used with a catalytic
cracker, according to a filing with the National Response
Center.  Michael Gayda, PBF’s president, said in a telephone
interview there is no timetable for repairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
