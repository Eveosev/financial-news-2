The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission will consider improving spent-fuel cooling-pool
safety as a “top-tier” priority in a report to be released
this week, Chairman  Gregory Jaczko  said.  “The staff, I expect, is going to recommend this to the
Commission” in the report that will weigh priorities for the
agency’s work on safety, Jaczko said today during a meeting with
reporters in  Washington .  NRC staff didn’t include as an immediate concern in a Sept.
9 memorandum to commissioners a proposal by a task force that
nuclear-plant owners be required to upgrade precautions, such as
installing water sprays at the cooling pools. The reservoirs
hold used radioactive material from reactors.  The NRC is weighing regulations to improve safety at 104
U.S. commercial reactors following meltdowns and radiation leaks
at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, caused
by a March earthquake and tsunami. Tepco took emergency measures
to keep fuel rods cool in the pools at four damaged reactors.  An agency  task force  in July issued recommendations for
immediate action, including requirements for plant owners to
review earthquake and flooding hazards.  NRC staff weighed the priority of the task-force’s
recommendations in an Oct. 3 report, which the agency hasn’t yet
published. Jaczko said he expects the report to be released
within “the next day or so.”  The commission plan to hold a public meeting Oct. 11 to
discuss the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
