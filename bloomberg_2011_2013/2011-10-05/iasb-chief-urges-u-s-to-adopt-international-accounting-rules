U.S. regulators should adopt
international accounting rules, known as IFRS, to improve
transparency, the chairman of the  International Accounting
Standards Board  said today.  Adopting the standards would give U.S. companies “the same
financial reporting language for both internal management
reporting and external financial reporting on a worldwide
consolidated basis,” Hans Hoogervorst, IASB chairman, said in a
speech in  Boston .  Hoogervorst this week criticized U.S. accounting rules that
differ from standards set by the IASB during a hearing in the
European Parliament. Banks don’t need to show all their
derivatives exposure on their balance sheet under U.S. rules,
known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
