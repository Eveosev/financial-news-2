Irish bond yields may tighten further
as about 20 billion euros of privately-held sovereign and bank
debt is repaid in the next six months, to be largely replaced by
official funding sources, said Dublin-based Glas Securities.  The shift from private funding to financing from Ireland’s
bailout partners “should boost demand for debt securities” of
varying maturities as the supply in the market shrinks,
according to fixed-income firm Glas.   “In recent weeks we saw the impact of a fresh wave of
demand entering the Irish market,” Glas said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
