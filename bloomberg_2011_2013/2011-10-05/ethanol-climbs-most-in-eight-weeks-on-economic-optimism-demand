Ethanol futures climbed the most in
almost eight weeks in  Chicago  on signs of a stronger economy and
after a report showed increased demand for the biofuel.  Futures gained 2.5 percent after an Energy Department
report showed production of conventional gasoline blended with
ethanol rose 2 percent, the most since June 10, to 5.16 million
barrels a day, while gasoline stockpiles declined. Separately,
ADP Employer Services reported that U.S. firms increased
employment by 91,000, exceeding the 75,000 forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “Everything was kind of supporting it,” said Jerrod Kitt,
an analyst at the Linn Group in Chicago. “The EIA demand
numbers were up.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 6.2 cents to
$2.52 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest one-
day gain since Aug. 11. Prices have climbed 6 percent this year.
The contract expired today.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  surged 18 cents,
or 7 percent, to $2.76 a gallon and on the West Coast the
biofuel added 7 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.68, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf advanced 6 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $2.565 a gallon and in Chicago the additive climbed 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.50.  Crude oil for November delivery jumped $4.01, or 5.3
percent, to settle at $79.68 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gasoline for October delivery soared 8.08 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $2.5692 a gallon in New York. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
