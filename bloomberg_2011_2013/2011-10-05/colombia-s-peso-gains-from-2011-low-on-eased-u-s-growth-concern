Colombia’s peso rose from its lowest
level this year after reports on U.S. jobs growth and service
industries topped estimates, tempering concern about an economic
slowdown in the world’s biggest economy.  The peso rose for the first day in six, gaining 1 percent
to 1965 per  U.S. dollar  at 10:58 a.m. New York time, from
1,984.60 yesterday. Yesterday’s closing price was its weakest
level since Dec. 28.  “The numbers coming out of the U.S. are motivating local
investors to come into the market and buy,” said Daniel Lozano,
an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses decreased to 53 in September from 53.3
a month earlier, and above the median estimate for a drop to
52.8 in a Bloomberg survey. A reading above 50 signals
expansion. Separately, ADP Employer Services said companies in
the U.S. added 91,000 jobs in September, more than the median
forecast for a 75,000 increase in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on  Colombia ’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
7.65 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.556 centavo to 118.811
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
