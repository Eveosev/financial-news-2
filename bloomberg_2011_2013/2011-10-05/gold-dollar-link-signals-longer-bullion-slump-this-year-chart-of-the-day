Gold may extend its slide from a
record as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis spurs demand for
dollars, eroding the appeal of the metal as an alternative,
according to  John Stephenson  at First Asset Management Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows gold plunged 11 percent last
month, the most since 2008, as Europe’s worsening fiscal crisis
sent the U.S. Dollar Index to an seven-month high of 78.863 on
Sept. 26. The precious metal, which reached a record $1,923.70
an ounce on Sept. 6, may drop to $1,450 by Dec. 15, while the
dollar index rallies to 89, the highest since March 2009, said
Stephenson, who helps manage $2.6 billion.  “The fear is Europe,” Stephenson said in a telephone
interview from Toronto. “The dollar will go up significantly as
we are seeing people liquidating other assets and buying the
dollar and dollar-backed assets. Europe is nowhere near to
finding a real solution.”  Gold has rallied 22 percent in the past year as investors
shunned equities and some currencies. Prices have slumped 15
percent from last month’s high as investors sold the metal to
cover losses in other markets. Gold futures for December
delivery closed yesterday at $1,641.60 on the Comex in  New York .  Hedge funds  and other large speculators increased their
net-long positions in the dollar to 128,155 contracts in the
week ended Sept. 27, according to Commodity Futures Trade
Commission data. Before last month, traders had been net short
the dollar versus the yen, euro, Australian dollar, Swiss franc,
Canadian dollar, British pound, Mexican peso and  New Zealand
dollar  for 14 months.  Money managers cut bullish bets on gold for a third week
and their holdings were the lowest since February, CFTC data as
of Sept. 27 show.  To contact the reporter for this story:
