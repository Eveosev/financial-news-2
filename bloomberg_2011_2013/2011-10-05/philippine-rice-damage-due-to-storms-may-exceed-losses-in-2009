Philippine rice damage on storms last
week may exceed losses from two typhoons two years ago,
Agriculture Undersecretary Antonio Fleta said in a phone
interview today.  Typhoons Nesat and Nalgae destroyed at least 760,207 tons
of rough rice or 11.7 percent of the nation’s expected harvest
in the fourth quarter, Fleta said in an interview with DZMM
radio early today.  In 2009, the Southeast Asian nation lost about 18 percent
of its fourth quarter target of 6.48 million tons due to
Typhoons Ketsana and Parma, which hit the country in late
September to early October, the disaster coordinating council
said in a report posted on its website.  “The extent of the damage may be larger,” Fleta said by
phone. “We’re now in the middle of the planting season, unlike
two years ago when we were able to harvest and recover most of
the crops.”       To contact the editor responsible for this story:
