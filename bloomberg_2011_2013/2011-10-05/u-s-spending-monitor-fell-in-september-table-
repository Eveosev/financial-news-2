The Discover U.S. Spending Monitor 
weakened in Sept. according to Discover Financial Services.  More consumers reported having less money left over
after paying debts in Sept. than the month earlier. The survey also 
found that 71.7 percent of consumers plan on spending at least 
as much or more next month.  The survey, conducted by  Rasmussen Reports , queries about 
8,000 adult consumers about spending intentions. It has a margin
of error of plus or minus one percent.
