day during the week ending September 30, 73 thousand barrels per
day below the previous weekâ€™s average. Refineries operated at
87.7 percent of their operable capacity last week. Gasoline
production increased last week, averaging nearly 9.3 million
barrels per day. Distillate fuel production increased last week,
averaging about 4.7 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged 8.7 million barrels per day last
week, down by 1.0 million barrels per day from the previous
week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports have averaged
8.8 million barrels per day, 246 thousand barrels per day below
the same four-week period last year. Total motor gasoline
imports (including both finished gasoline and gasoline blending
components) last week averaged 505 thousand barrels per day.
Distillate fuel imports averaged 208 thousand barrels per day
last week.  U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased by 4.7 million barrels

range. Total commercial petroleum inventories decreased by 4.6
million barrels last week.  Total products supplied over the last four-week period have

percent compared to the similar period last year. Over the last
four weeks, motor gasoline product supplied has averaged 8.9
million barrels per day, down by 1.7 percent from the same
period last year. Distillate fuel product supplied has averaged
