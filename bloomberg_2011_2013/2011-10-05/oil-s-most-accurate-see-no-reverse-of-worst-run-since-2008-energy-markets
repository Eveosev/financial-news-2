Brent oil will struggle to recover
from its longest slump since the 2008 financial crisis as a
weakening global economy cuts growth in demand to the lowest
level for any fourth quarter in the past three years.  Brent crude  will trade an average 2 percent higher than
Oct. 5’s opening price of $101.81 a barrel during the final
three months of the year, according to the mean prediction of 10
analysts whose third-quarter projections were the most accurate
of 31 compiled by Bloomberg. Futures lost 8.6 percent in the
third quarter, extending a 4.2 percent drop in the second.  Oil is falling as  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
exporter, pumps crude at near-record levels and Libya revives
production just as the economic slowdown shows signs of sapping
demand. Consumption, which typically climbs toward the end of
the year as the northern hemisphere’s winter approaches, will
rise 4 percent this quarter, about half the levels of 2009 and
2010, according to the  International Energy Agency .  “The outlook is deteriorating more and more, and the
velocity is somewhat alarming,” said  Eugen Weinberg , the
Frankfurt-based head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG
who predicts Brent may average less than $100 a barrel in the
fourth quarter. “The risks to forecasts right now are to the
downside, and not just on demand. Libyan production is coming
back sooner than expected.”  Back-to-Back Decline  Brent will average $103.80 a barrel in the final three
months of the year, based on the mean of the 10 most accurate
forecasters tracked by Bloomberg. It settled at $99.79 on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange on Oct. 4, after averaging $112.09
in the third quarter.  The 13 percent slide in futures in the past six months was
the first back-to-back quarterly decline since the second half
of 2008, when prices sank to a four-year low of almost $30 a
barrel amid a slump in lending between banks that led to the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Brent lost 11 percent
in September this year, the biggest monthly drop since May 2010.  Oil exports from  Libya  are resuming as opposition forces
cement their control over the country and hunt the deposed
leader  Muammar Qaddafi . The nation, home to  Africa ’s largest
crude reserves, is producing 300,000 barrels a day, Oil Minister
Ali Tarhouni said in Tripoli on Sep. 29. It pumped 1.6 million a
day before the conflict started.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has yet to signal it will reduce
production from the 9.76 million barrels a day it’s pumping even
as Libya restarts operations. The kingdom began increasing
output in April to compensate for the loss of Libya’s oil.  ‘Heavyweights’  The highest estimates among the top-ranked 10 for Brent
prices in the fourth quarter are at $115, by Barclays Plc, and
$110, by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “Yes, there are some weak spots in demand, but the
weakness seen continues to be less pronounced than that seen
during the troughs of the 2008-2009 cycle,” said Amrita Sen, an
analyst at Barclays in  London . “Growth rates in demand
heavyweights India and  China  continue to remain strong. And we
remain cautious regarding the prospects of a swift reprise in
Libyan production.”  Demand for oil is weakening as Europe struggles to contain
its sovereign debt crisis while the economies of the U.S. and
China, the biggest energy consumers, show signs of decelerating.
U.S. consumer spending slowed in August as incomes unexpectedly
fell, according to the Commerce Department. Manufacturing in
China shrank a third month, the longest streak since 2009, an
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics index showed Sept. 30.  Falling Demand  Fourth-quarter oil demand will increase by 400,000 barrels
a day to an average of 90.2 million a day, the Paris-based IEA
said in a Sept. 13 report. Consumption increased by 700,000
barrels a day in the same quarters of 2009 and 2010.  Brent averaged $112.09 a barrel from July 1 through Sept.
30. The closest forecast among 31 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg before the quarter started was $112 by Pedro Moreno Alonso, a commodity strategist at Banco Bilbao in  Madrid ,
followed by a prediction of $111.80 a barrel by  Edward Morse ,
head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. in  New York . The
third best was $114, by Goldman Sachs analysts led by  Jeffrey Currie  and  David Greely . Commerzbank was fourth.  “Falling oil demand growth is paralleling the recent
macroeconomic headlines,” said Morse, who predicts Brent will
average $95 a barrel this quarter. “This downside tail risk is
elevated as the euro zone struggles to prevent larger sovereign
dominoes from falling.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
