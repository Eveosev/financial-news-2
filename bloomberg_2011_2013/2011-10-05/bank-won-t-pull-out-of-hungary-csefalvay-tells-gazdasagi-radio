Hungarian Economy Ministry State
Secretary Zoltan Csefalvay said he thinks banks owned by foreign
companies won’t leave the country because of a law allowing
early repayments of foreign-currency mortgages below market
rates that forces the banks to swallow the difference, Gazdasagi
Radio reported.  Banks won’t pull out as they can only count on expansion in
the east to recover from  Europe ’s crisis, Csefalvay said,
according to excerpts from an interview posted on the radio’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
