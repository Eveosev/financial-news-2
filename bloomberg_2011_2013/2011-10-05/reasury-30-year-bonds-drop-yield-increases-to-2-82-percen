Treasuries dropped, with 30-year bond
yields extending their advance from a two-year low, as optimism
European leaders are stepping up efforts to resolve the region’s
debt crisis sapped demand for the safest assets.  U.S. debt securities extended their slide after a private
report two days before the Labor Department’s payrolls figures
showed companies added more jobs in September than economists
forecast. European Union officials are working on plans to boost
bank capital, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “There’s hope that the European situation will get better
and there will be some kind of backstop,” said Jeffry Feigenwinter, head of Treasury trading in New York at Societe
Generale SA, one of the 22 primary dealers that trade government
securities with the  Federal Reserve . “We are at extreme levels
in the market, and people are unwinding some trades.”  Yields on 30-year bonds increased five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.85 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities maturing in August 2041 dropped 1 2/32, or $10.63 per
$1,000 face amount, to 117 31/32. The yields fell yesterday to
2.69 percent, the lowest level since January 2009, before
advancing eight basis points.  Rally in Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.8 percent after
rallying yesterday. Crude oil futures surged 2 percent to $79.80
a barrel.  Benchmark 10-year note yields advanced seven basis points
to 1.89 percent, compared with the record low 1.6714 percent
reached on Sept. 23. Two-year note yields were little changed at
0.26 percent.  Government debt securities surged last quarter on
speculation  Greece  is heading for a default and as the U.S.
central bank prepared to buy longer-term Treasuries to counter
an economic slowdown.  Yields on 30-year bonds decreased 146 basis points in the
third quarter, the most since falling 164 basis points in the
last three months of December 2008.  The Fed purchased $1.369 billion of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities maturing from January 2018 to February 2041
today as part of its effort to support the economy by keeping
borrowing costs low.  Rehn’s View  Bonds slid yesterday after the Financial Times cited
European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn as
saying finance ministers recognize the need for a “concerted,
coordinated approach.” A spokesman for Rehn told reporters
today there is no concrete plan to recapitalize banks.  “There is no secret at all that European authorities and
the European Commission are all working together on a plan to
bring more official capital, more public-sector capital, into
the banking sector,” Antonio Borges, the IMF’s European
department head, said today in Brussels.  Moody’s Investors Service followed its three-level
downgrade of  Italy  by warning yesterday that euro-area nations
rated below the top Aaa level may see their rankings cut.  Greeks walked off their jobs and as many as 20,000 marched
through  Athens ’ central square to protest Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s 6.6 billion-euro ($8.7 billion) austerity plan,
challenging a government seeking European bailout funds to stave
off default.  ‘Primary Drivers’  “The issues in  Europe  are the primary drivers,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at BTIG LLC in New York.
“The news that we are starting to inch closer to bank
recapitalization suggests that from a positioning standpoint,
reducing your portfolio duration isn’t the worst thing in the
world.”  In the U.S., companies added 91,000 workers to payrolls in
September after a revised increase of 89,000 in the previous
month, ADP Employer Services said. The median forecast of 39
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 75,000.  “It’s encouraging to see jobs increase 90,000, but there’s
an element of stagnation,” said Thomas Simons, a government
debt economist in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc., a primary
dealer.  U.S. Payrolls  The Labor Department is projected to report on Oct. 7 that
nonfarm employers added 60,000 workers last month after zero
growth in August. The  unemployment rate  stayed at 9.1 percent, a
separate survey showed.  Growth in services industries in the U.S. slowed in
September less than forecast. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s non-manufacturing index fell to 53 from 53.3 in
August, the Tempe, Arizona, group reported. The median forecast
of 75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop to
52.8. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction in services, the largest part of the economy.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told U.S. lawmakers in
 Washington  yesterday he’ll push forward with further expansion
of monetary stimulus if needed, resisting pressure from
Republicans concerned that he’s fanning inflation.  The central bank announced on Sept. 21 its plan to purchase
$400 billion of  U.S. debt  with maturities of six to 30 years
through June while selling an equal amount of securities due in
three years or less.  To contact the reporter on this story:
