OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s diamond
producer, may spend $1 billion to buy back the Urengoy gas
company and Geotransgas from VTB Capital,  Vedomosti  said today,
citing unidfentified people familiar with the deal.  The diamond company sold the stakes in both gas units in
2009 for $620 million, but VTB Capital retained the right to ask
Alrosa to repurchase the stakes in 2012, Vedomosti said. Alrosa
decided to buy back the assets earlier as otherwise it would
have to cover VTB Capital’s expenditure on development of the
gas companies, the newspaper said..  To contact the reporter on this story:
