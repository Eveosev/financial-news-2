(Corrects Pfizer plans in sixth paragraph in story
published Oct. 5.)  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, said it stopped a clinical trial of its epilepsy
medicine Lyrica after results showed it was as effective as a
stand-alone therapy for certain-types of seizures.  Lyrica generated more than $3 billion in sales last year
for New York-based Pfizer, according to data collected by
Bloomberg. The study aimed to show whether Lyrica worked without
other drugs against partial seizures, the most common type
experienced by people with the disorder.  Partial seizures are those limited to one side of the
brain, according to the  Epilepsy Foundation , based in Landover,
 Maryland . A monitoring committee recommended the tests end after
interim results proved its efficacy, MacKay Jimeson, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  “Pfizer has accepted the recommendation and has stopped
the study,” Jimeson said in an e-mail.  Lyrica is approved for use in combinations with other
treatments in epilepsy, and for fibromyalgia, a condition
involving pain in joints and muscles.  Updated results will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov by
April of 2012, Jimeson said. In the meantime, Pfizer will
continue to analyze the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
