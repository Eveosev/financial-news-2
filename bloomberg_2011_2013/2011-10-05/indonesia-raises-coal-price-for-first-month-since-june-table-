Indonesia , the largest exporter of
power-station coal, raised the reference price for sales in
October by 2.56 percent, the first increase in four months, the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources said.  The benchmark for coal with a gross energy value of 6,322
kilocalories a kilogram was raised to $119.24 a metric ton on a
free-on-board basis from $116.26 in September, the  Directorate
General of Coal and Minerals  at the energy ministry said in a
statement published on its website yesterday.  Below is a list of price references and markers, used to
calculate prices for coal of similar quality, from eight leading
coal brands in  Southeast Asia â€™s biggest economy, as compiled by
the energy ministry. Grades are in kilocalories a kilogram,
while prices are in U.S. dollars a ton.  Note: Percentage changes calculated by Bloomberg News. The price
reference is an average of the Indonesia Coal Index, Platts-1,
Newcastle Export Index and the  globalCOAL NEWC Index  from the
previous month. The average of the price reference for the last
three months is used to set prices for a one-year contract for
the following year. For sales in barges, the reference price
excludes the cost of barging and transshipment into the vessel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
