The  Philippines ’ peso bond sale to
individual investors this month can “easily” match or even
exceed the 104 billion pesos ($2.37 billion) it raised at the
last offering of such securities in March,  First Metro
Investment Corp. (FMIC)  President Roberto Juanchito Dispo said today.  The government will hold a price-setting auction for 10-
and 15-year retail bonds on Oct. 10 and offer the securities
until Oct. 17, Dispo said in a phone interview.  A “recommended” offer size is between 100 billion pesos
and 150 billion pesos and “that will depend on the issuer’s
decision,” Dispo said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
