Corporate repatriation legislation to
be unveiled by Senators  Kay Hagan , a North Carolina Democrat,
and  John McCain , an Arizona Republican, would allow U.S.
businesses to bring home offshore profits at an 8.75 percent  tax
rate .  The rate would drop to 5.25 percent if payrolls expand
during 2012, according to a summary of the legislation confirmed
by an aide to McCain. The current top corporate tax rate is 35
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
