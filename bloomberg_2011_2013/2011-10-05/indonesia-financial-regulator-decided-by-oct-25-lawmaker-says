Indonesian lawmakers may decide the
composition of a planned financial regulator by Oct. 25, Nusron
Wahid, chairman of the parliament’s Financial Services Authority
working committee, said by phone today.  “The composition of the commissioners is still dynamic,
we’ll make sure to decide it not later than Oct. 25,” he said.  Lawmakers and the government failed to decide the
composition in July and extended a deadline for parliament and
government to choose the board of commissioners.  Indonesia ’s parliament wants two of its members on the
financial supervisory authority’s board, alongside five
government nominees proposed by the president and two former
officials from the  finance ministry  and the central bank. The
government’s proposal is two former finance ministry and central
bank members and seven presidential picks vetted by parliament.  To contact the reporters on this story:
