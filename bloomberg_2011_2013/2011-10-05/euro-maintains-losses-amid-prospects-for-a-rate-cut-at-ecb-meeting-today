The euro strengthened against the
dollar and yen on speculation a reintroduction of loans to banks
by the  European Central Bank  will buoy crisis-ridden markets.  The 17-nation currency weakened earlier as ECB President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the region’s economy is facing
“intensified downside risks.” The pound fell after the  Bank of
England  unexpectedly expanded its bond-purchase plan.  Brazil ’s
real surged after inflation rose more than forecast, raising
bets the central bank may slow the pace of interest-rate cuts.  “What the ECB did today, plus talk of more support for
banks, is inducing some short covering,” said  Marc Chandler ,
global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman &
Co. in New York. “It’s a bit of a relief rally.” A short is a
bet the price of an asset will fall.  The euro rose 0.6 percent to 103.09 yen at 5 p.m. in  New
York  after dropping to 100.76 on Oct. 4, the weakest level since
June 2001. The currency slid as much as 0.8 percent against the
dollar before trading 0.7 percent higher at $1.3437. It dropped
to $1.3146 on Oct. 4, the lowest since Jan. 13. The yen gained
0.1 percent 76.72 per dollar.  Sterling declined 0.1 percent to $1.5445, and weakened 0.8
percent to 87 pence per euro.  ECB Decision  ECB officials left their benchmark rate at 1.5 percent, as
predicted by 41 of 52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Trichet, announcing a policy decision for the final time,
said the ECB will resume covered-bond purchases and reintroduce
year-long loans for banks as the sovereign-debt crisis threatens
to freeze money markets. Trichet will step down at the end of
the month and be succeeded by Italy’s  Mario Draghi .  “The markets are a bit relieved that they’re getting some
support rather than no support from the ECB in the form of
liquidity measures,” said  Kathy Lien , director of currency
research at this online trading firm GFT Forex in New York.  Futures traders increased bets the euro would fall versus
the dollar to net 82,473 contracts in the week ended Sept. 27,
the most since June 2010, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Sterling tumbled after U.K. policy makers said they would
increase their bond-purchase program by 75 billion pounds ($115
billion). The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for no change.  The main rate was maintained at 0.5 percent, as predicted
by all 53 economists in a separate survey.  Recovery Threatened  The central bank, which expects to complete the round of
purchases in four months, said in a statement that slowing
global growth and the turmoil in  Europe  “threaten the U.K.
recovery.” It also said it’s “more likely” that inflation
will undershoot its 2 percent goal in the medium term.  Currencies of higher-yielding countries rose after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.8 percent after earlier
losing as much as 0.8 percent.  “There’s a shift in risk sentiment,” said  Niall O’Connor ,
a technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York.
“There’s potential for risk to improve and the dollar to
weaken.”  Australia ’s dollar added 0.9 percent to 97.46 U.S. cents
and  New Zealand ’s currency advanced 0.7 percent to 77.17 cents.  Brazil’s real rose the most among the major currencies,
adding 2.8 percent to 1.7811 per dollar. The IGP-DI inflation
index showed prices rose 0.75 percent in September, compared
with a 0.61 percent increase in August, according to a report
from the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation.
Economists had forecast a 0.65 percent increase, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  The nation’s central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate 
in August to 12 percent from 12.5 percent, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global economy.  Franc Falls  The franc dropped for a third day against the euro on
speculation the central bank will impose further measures to
contain its strength after imposing the cap last month at 1.20
per euro. Reserves jumped to 282.4 billion francs ($306 billion)
at the end of September, from 253.4 billion francs the previous
month, the SNB said.  The franc dropped 0.4 percent to 1.2370 per euro.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.5 percent to 78.582 as stocks reversed
earlier losses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
