The U.S. should maintain its leading
role in multilateral development banks to keep China and other
nations from taking the American shares, the  U.S. Treasury ’s top
international official said today.  Lael Brainard, Treasury undersecretary for international
affairs, called the U.S. leadership “essential” to have an
“outsize influence as leading shareholders at these
organizations.”  Brainard cited the  World Bank  as an example where the U.S.
has veto power over changes to the articles of agreement that
govern bank membership and leadership. At the  African
Development Bank , the U.S. holds its own board seat to influence
regional developments, she said.  “Other nations, particularly China, are eager to take up
our shares in these institutions if we do not meet our
commitments,” Brainard said in a speech at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
