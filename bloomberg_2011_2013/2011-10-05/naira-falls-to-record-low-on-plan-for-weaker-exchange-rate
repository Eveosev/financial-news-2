Nigeria’s naira depreciated against
the dollar to the weakest level on record after the government
outlined plans to adopt a weaker  exchange rate  in calculating
its budget for next year.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 1.3
percent to 161.5 per dollar in the  interbank market  by 4:31 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital, the weakest since at least
1994 when Bloomberg started compiling the data. Nigeria’s
central bank sold $400 million at a foreign currency auction
today, compared with $685.4 million demanded by lenders, at
155.40 naira.  The “naira remains under pressure as dollar demand for
imports continuously exceed supply,” Usman Onoja, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Lovonus Trust and Investment
Ltd., which trades currencies, said by phone today.  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions. It broke that
band the first time on Sept. 26, with today’s rate the weakest
on record at 3.5 percent above 150 naira.  Nigeria  plans to raise spending by 7 percent to 4.8
trillion naira ($30 billion) in 2012 in its budget, increasing
funding for capital projects, according to a three-year plan
sent to parliament in Abuja yesterday by the Budget Office. The
West African nation will estimate its revenue using a crude-oil
price of $75 a barrel and an exchange rate of 153 naira per
dollar, weaker than the current 150 naira, according to the
document.  The currency won’t be defended “at all costs,” central
bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said today in an interview on CNBC
Africa. “There is no definite change in foreign exchange policy
at present, but the central bank is weighing all the options,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
