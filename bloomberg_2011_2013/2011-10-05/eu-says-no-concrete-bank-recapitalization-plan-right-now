The European Union doesn’t have a new
plan to recapitalize banks, the European Commission said.  EU Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn “doesn’t
speak of a concrete plan in hand,” his spokesman,  Amadeu
Altafaj , told reporters in Brussels today. “He speaks of an
initiative, of discussions in progress and he pleads for a
European approach.”  Altafaj was responding to questions about Rehn’s comments
to the Financial Times yesterday.  The commissioner “clearly indicated he doesn’t have a new
recapitalization plan,” the commission’s chief spokeswoman, Pia
Ahrenkilde Hansen, said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
