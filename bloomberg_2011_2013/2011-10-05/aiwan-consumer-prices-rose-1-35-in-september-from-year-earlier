Taiwan ’s consumer prices rose at a
slower-than-estimated pace in September as the climb in housing
and clothing costs moderated.  The consumer-price index increased 1.35 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 1.34 percent advance in August, the
statistics bureau said in Taipei today. The median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1.4 percent gain.  Taiwan’s central bank left its key  interest rate  unchanged
at 1.875 percent last week, snapping a run of five straight
quarterly increases as  Asia ’s policy makers seek to shield
growth from a weakening world economy. Governor Perng Fai-nan
expects easing global prices this quarter to slow the island’s
imported inflation.  “If global uncertainties and market volatility persist,
the central bank will continue to adopt a wait-and-see approach
with a dovish bias in the fourth quarter,” Raymond Yeung, an
economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Hong
Kong , said before the release.  Food prices rose 1.88 percent in September from a year
earlier, today’s report showed. Prices in the transportation and
communications category advanced 1.72 percent and clothing
prices climbed 2.62 percent.  Core consumer prices, a category excluding vegetables,
fruit, fish and energy, increased 1.17 percent after rising 1.26
percent in August.  Wholesale prices, which track the cost of goods sold to
retailers and producers, advanced 5.14 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a revised 4.02 percent increase in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
