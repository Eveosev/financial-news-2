Former  England  fast bowler Graham
Dilley died at the age of 52 after a short illness, the  England
and Wales Cricket Board  said today on its website.  Dilley, who played for Kent and Worcestershire, appeared in
41 Test matches and 36 one-day matches for England over his 10-
year international career.  He was part of the Ashes-winning squad in 1981, teaming
with Ian Botham for a 117-run second-innings stand as England
took the third Test by 18 runs, and again in Australia in 1986-
87.  “Few will forget his contribution during the historic
Ashes win at Headingley in 1981 and the part he played in two
Ashes series victories,” England Cricket Board Chief Executive
Officer David Collier said. “Graham will be sadly missed by all
his friends throughout cricket.”  Following his retirement, Dilley spent time as an assistant
coach with the England men’s team and as a bowling coach with
the women’s national team before becoming head coach at
Loughborough University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
