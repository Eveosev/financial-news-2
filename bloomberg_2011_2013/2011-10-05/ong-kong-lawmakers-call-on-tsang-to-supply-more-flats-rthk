Hong Kong’s lawmakers today called on
Chief Executive  Donald Tsang  to announce an increase in the
supply of housing for low-income families when he makes his
policy address on Oct.12,  Radio Television Hong Kong  said on its
website.  Unionist legislator Wong Kwok-hing said the government
should build an extra 13,000 public housing units every year to
shorten the average waiting time for such families to live in
public housing flats, according to the report. Separately, Fred
Li, a Democratic Party lawmaker, urged the city government to
relaunch the Home Ownership Scheme and provide 3,000 to 5,000
such flats every year.  RTHK reported later that the government is considering such
a scheme, citing people it didn’t identify. Flats under the new
scheme are expected to be completed in three to four years, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
