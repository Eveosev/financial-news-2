Debt-laden European governments must
explain to their citizens that fiscal restraint is necessary to
protect their countries’ future, Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said.  Flaherty reiterated that the European Financial Stability
Fund needs to be made larger and more flexible, and that
governments need to “expedite” their approvals of the bailout
fund, in a speech in  New York  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
