Turkey ’s central bank cut reserve
requirements for lenders’ foreign currency liabilities,
releasing an additional $1.3 billion in liquidity to the
banking system after the lira set a historic low against the 
dollar.  The move will ease liquidity and support banks’ efforts to
extend the maturity of their foreign currency financing once it
takes effect on Oct. 14, the Ankara-based bank said in a
statement on its website today.  The bank cut the reserve ratio by half a percentage point
for liabilities up to three years and by 2.5 percentage points
for longer-term liabilities such as bonds issued in foreign
currencies by Turkish banks, according to the statement.  The cut will “support the lira a little,” Gizem Oztok,
economist for Garanti Securities in Istanbul, wrote in an e-
mailed comment. “It will also impact bank industry profits by
about 0.6 percentage points.”  Governor Erdem Basci said Sept. 28 the reduction was
likely, and would be designed to encourage banks to borrow
externally over longer terms.  The main share index gained 1.5 percent at 10:07 a.m. after 
the announcement, with the advance led by Turkiye Garanti Bankasi
AS, the biggest listed bank, which rose 2.1 percent to 6.90
liras.  The lira fell to a record low of 1.9096 per dollar
yesterday and was trading at 1.8952 per dollar after the central
bank announcement, a decline of 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
