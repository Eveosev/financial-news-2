Bahraini telecommunications operators
are at a disadvantage to their competitors because the regulator
has yet to allocate bandwidth for fourth generation wireless
usage, said Abdulhamid Chehab, general manager of mobile
networks at Batelco.  “We are losing competitive edge here,” Chehab told
reporters at a conference in Dubai. Demand is rising with
average data volume per user doubling every six months, he said.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp., known as Etisalat,
offered 4G services last month and operators in  Saudi Arabia 
rolled out the enhanced network in September. 4G is the fourth
generation of cellular wireless standards which allows for
faster data transmission, better voice quality and new mobile
phone applications. Batelco, based in Manama, competes in
Bahrain with  Kuwait ’s Zain and Viva, a Saudi Telecom Co. unit.  Operators have yet to receive a “firm” response from the
telecoms regulator on “when and which spectrum” will be used,
Chehab said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
