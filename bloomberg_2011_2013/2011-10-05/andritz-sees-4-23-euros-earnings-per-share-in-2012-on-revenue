Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s second-
biggest builder of hydropower plants, will raise its dividend
payout to 60 percent of net income in the “medium term” as it
expects a bulging order book to lift earnings.  Andritz, whose second-biggest division makes machinery for
pulp and paper makers, expects earnings per share to rise to
3.69 euros this year and to 4.23 euros in 2012, from 3.48 euros
last year, it  told journalists in Vienna today . Andritz paid
49 percent of EPS, or 1.70 euros a share, for 2010.  The company, based in Graz,  Austria , will generate more
than 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in revenue this year and at
least 4.5 billion euros in 2012 after orders soared to record
levels in the last two quarters, boosted by an agreement to
build the Montes del Plata pulp factory in Uruguay.  “We don’t see in any of our businesses concrete signs of a
slowdown,” Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Leitner said today
at a press briefing in Vienna. Andritz is “not dramatically
pessimistic,” he said.  Andritz, which has made 12 acquisitions since 2010, may
complete additional takeovers “in the next months and
quarters,” Leitner said.  Analysts predict adjusted earnings per share of 4.19 euros
on revenue of 4.3 billion euros this year and 4.76 euros on
revenue of 4.8 billion euros in 2012, according to the average
of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The dividend for 2011 is
predicted to be 2.10 euros a share, according to Bloomberg
research and analysis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
