Canada ’s dollar traded at almost the
weakest level in more than a year versus its U.S. counterpart
after Moody’s Investors Service cut Italy’s credit ranking,
spurring concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will crimp global growth.  The Canadian currency fell against a majority of its major
peers. Losses in Canada’s dollar were limited by gains in U.S.
stock-index futures and commodities such as crude oil.  “The big problem in Europe is still weighing down the rest
of the market,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing director for
 currency trading  at Bank of Montreal, by phone from Toronto.  The Canadian currency was little changed at C$1.0514 per
 U.S. dollar  at 7:37 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0513
yesterday, when it depreciated to C$1.0658, the weakest level
since August 2010. One Canadian dollar buys 95.11 U.S. cents.  Moody’s cut  Italy ’s debt rating three levels, citing
concern the government will struggle to reduce the region’s
second-largest debt levels.  “We’re starting to see a reversal of that risk-off type of
trade, meaning U.S. equity futures so far are showing some
decent moves towards the upside,” said Gavsie. “That first
little taste of risk-on is starting to follow through into
dollar-Canada and we’re seeing those weak longs get shaken out
of the market.” A long position is a bet that an asset will
rise in value.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
