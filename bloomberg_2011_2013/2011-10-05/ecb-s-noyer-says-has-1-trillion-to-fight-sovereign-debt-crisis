European Central Bank  governing
council member  Christian Noyer  said that the European Financial
Stability Facility, together with the International Monetary
Fund support, has effective firepower of $1 trillion.  “The fund will be operational in several days,” Noyer
said today on Europe 1 radio. The fund has “440 billion euros,
that means in practice, together with IMF support, $1 trillion.
It’s a very significant amount.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
