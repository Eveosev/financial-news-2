Portugal ’s borrowing costs increased
at an auction of 722 million euros ($962 million) of three-month
bills.  The securities due in January 2012 were issued at an
average yield of 4.972 percent, the country’s debt management
agency said. That compares with an average yield of 4.931
percent at a previous auction of three-month bills on Sept. 21.
The auction attracted bids for 2.2 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.7 in September.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on Sept. 30 said the
indicative amount for today’s auction was between 500 million
euros and 750 million euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
