The headquarters of  Guardian News &
Media Ltd.  in  London ’s King’s Cross district will be put up for
sale by developer and philanthropist Peter Millican, according
to a spokeswoman for the property.  “The office rent-free periods have ended” and the music
and arts spaces are rented on long-term leases to their
operators,  Kings Place  spokeswoman Erica Bolton said today in an
e-mailed statement. DTZ Holdings Plc is handling the sale on
behalf of Millican, who completed the development in 2008,
Bolton said without disclosing an asking price.  As well as the Guardian newspaper publisher’s offices, the
Kings Place has two public concert spaces, bars and restaurants.
The plan to sell was reported earlier by Reuters, which said the
building could fetch 235 million pounds ($362.5 million),
without disclosing where it got the price information. DTZ
declined to comment.  Parabola Land Ltd., whose main asset is Kings Place, held
investment property valued at 181 million pounds by its
directors, including Millican, at the end of March 2010,
according to a regulatory filing.  The property had a historical cost of 126.7 million pounds,
and Parabola owed lender Eurohypo AG 132.4 million pounds at the
end of the financial year, according to accounts filed with
 Companies House . Millican was owed 37.9 million pounds at that
time, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
