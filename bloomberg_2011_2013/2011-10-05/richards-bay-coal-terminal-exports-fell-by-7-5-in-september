Shipments at Richards Bay Coal
Terminal,  Africa ’s largest export facility for the fuel, fell
7.5 percent last month on weak demand from Europe and  Asia .  Deliveries from the port on South Africa’s northeast coast
dropped to 4.96 million metric tons in September from 5.36
million tons a year earlier, RBCT said today on its  website .  “It is principally a demand issue,” Bevan Jones at London
Commodity Brokers said by phone in Johannesburg. “We’re seeing
a lot of cargoes available and not many buyers. Producers have
to sell at a significant discount and they’re not prepared to do
that.” European power stations “seem to be very well stocked”
and buyers from  India , the main destination for South African
thermal coal, and  China  are “cautious,” Jones said.  Prices for coal traded through RBCT declined 1.4 percent to
an average $115.77 a ton in September from a month earlier, and
gained 34.9 percent from the same period in the previous year,
according to IHS McCloskey data on Bloomberg.  The port, whose owners include BHP Billiton Ltd. and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , received 6.25 million tons of coal in the month,
and had stocks of 5 million tons, according to RBCT, which
didn’t give a reason for the drop in September shipments.  It has capacity to export 91 million tons annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
