Taiwan ’s commercial property
transactions may reach between NT$110 billion and NT$120 billion
this year, the highest since President Ma Ying-jeou took office
in 2008, the local branch of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Ltd. said
today.  The transactions reached NT$100.5 billion last year,
compared to NT$97.7 billion in the first nine months this year,
Charlie Yang, chief of institute valuation and advisory services
at DTZ in Taiwan, said. “Ample liquidity, low  interest rate ,
limited supply, investment from insurance companies and warm
relations between Taiwan and China are the contributing
factors,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
