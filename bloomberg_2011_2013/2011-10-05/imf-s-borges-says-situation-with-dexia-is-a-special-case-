Antonio Borges, the International
Monetary Fund’s European department head, said  Dexia SA (DEXB) , which
plans to pool its troubled assets into a so-called bad bank, is
a “special case.”  “First of all, it’s not a surprise,” Borges said today at
a press conference in Brussels. “It’s one of the most
vulnerable banks, and it’s going to have its own solution as the
French and Belgian governments have now already indicated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
