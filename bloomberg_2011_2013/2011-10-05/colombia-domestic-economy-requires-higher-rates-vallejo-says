Colombia’s domestic economy shows a
“very clear” need for higher  interest rates , central bank
director  Cesar Vallejo  said.  The central bank’s seven-member board nevertheless decided
to leave borrowing costs unchanged at its last two policy
meetings since the effects of the global financial crisis on
Colombia are unpredictable, Vallejo said in an interview in
Bogota yesterday.  Colombian policy makers held their benchmark rate unchanged
at 4.5 percent for a second straight month in September.  The central bank’s announcement last week that it will buy
or sell $200 million dollars in the  spot market  when the peso
moves more than 2 percent from its 10-day moving average was
taken “in a moment of emergency” and will be withdrawn when
the current bout of “excessive volatility” is over, Vallejo
said.  Vallejo said that  Colombia ’s lower-than-expected budget
deficits this year may be partly due to an anti-corruption
drive. A fall in public works spending since last year could be
traceable to ministries’ and regional governments’ fear of being
investigated for irregularities, said Vallejo, who headed the
National Planning Department in the 1980s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
