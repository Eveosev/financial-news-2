Zimbabwe’s economy will probably
expand as much as 9 percent next year, led by increased
agricultural and mining production, Finance Minister  Tendai Biti 
said.  The southern African nation’s economy is estimated to grow
9.3 percent this year, Biti said in a pre-budget statement to
parliament handed to reporters today in Harare, the capital.
Exports may climb 11 percent to $4.6 billion next year, helping
to cut the current account deficit to $1.2 billion, he said.  The southern African nation is recovering from a political
crisis and decade of economic decline that ended in 2009 when
President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front and the Movement for Democratic Change, led by
Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , formed a power-sharing
government. Zimbabwe has the world’s second-biggest reserves of
platinum and chrome after neighbor  South Africa  and its exports
also include gold, diamonds and tobacco.  Government spending  will probably jump to $3.4 billion next
year from the $2.7 billion for 2011 that was forecast in the
budget, Biti said. Inflation is estimated to average 3.7 percent
this year, accelerating to 5 percent in 2012, he said.  Biti will present the 2012 budget next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
