Markit Economics today released the September final
purchasing managers’ index for the eurozone.
The PMI’s are designed to provide a single figure snap-shot for the Eurozone.
It is based on a survey of over 2,000 business executives in the Euro area and
it’s designed to provide the most up-to-date picture of business conditions.
Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below 50, a contraction. The greater
the divergence from 50, the greater the rate of change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
