New World Resources Plc, the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, rose the first day in five,
rebounding from its lowest level in more than two years.  The stock jumped as much as 6.6 percent today and traded up
2.9 percent to 125.4 koruna by 10:18 a.m. in Prague. NWR fell 13
percent in the previous four days to the lowest since July 2009.  NWR’s four-day drop pushed the 14-day relative strength
index to 29 yesterday. Readings below 30 suggest to technical
analysis that a security or an index may gain. The stock’s RSI
rose to 32 today.  European shares advanced amid speculation policy makers are
examining measures to shield banks from the sovereign-debt
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
