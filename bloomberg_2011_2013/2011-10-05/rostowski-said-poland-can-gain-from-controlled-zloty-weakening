Poland as an exporting country can
benefit from a weaker zloty as long as its depreciation remains
“under control,” Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said today
in Warsaw.  The central bank was right to intervene in the  currency
markets  over the past two weeks, selling foreign currencies and
buying zloty, to show that investors can’t count on reaping
profits by betting on a weaker zloty, Rostowski said during a
lecture at Warsaw Technical University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
