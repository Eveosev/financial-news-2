A Thai committee representing
workers, businesses and the government failed to reach an
agreement on a proposed increase in the  minimum wage , said
Somkiat Chayasriwong, the labor ministry’s permanent secretary.  The committee will meet again on Oct. 17, Somkiat told
reporters today in Bangkok.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai party won
elections in July after pledging to increase the minimum wage to
300 baht ($9.64) per day. The plan has faced criticism from
business groups who argue that higher costs will erode exports
and force them to fire workers.  “Raising wages to 300 baht a day nationwide would have a
severe impact on businesses,” said Atthayuth Leeyavanija, a
commission member representing employers. “The 300 baht minimum
wage was a promise made by the politicians to win votes, so they
must pay for the additional increase.”  Two alternatives are being discussed, Somkiat said.  Representatives of workers and the government are
supportive of a proposal to raise wages by 40 percent nationwide
in 2012, and to 300 baht a day in any province that still falls
short of that level, Somkiat said.  Employers prefer an increase to 300 baht per day over four
years, and will only accept the first proposal if the government
provides assistance to help them cope with higher costs, Somkiat
said.  “We have to reach a conclusion in the next meeting so all
business operators have time to adjust themselves to new
wages,” Somkiat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
