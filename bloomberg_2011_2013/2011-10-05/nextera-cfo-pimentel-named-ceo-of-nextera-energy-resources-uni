NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  named Armando
Pimentel as president and chief executive officer of its NextEra
Energy Resources unit. The unit is the largest wind-energy
producer in the U.S.  Pimentel was previously the  Juno Beach , Florida-based
company’s chief financial officer and replaces Mitch Davidson,
who is leaving NextEra. Moray Dewhurst was named CFO and will
remain vice chairman and chief of staff, NextEra said in a
statement. All the management changes are effective today.  NextEra said in a filing it expects 2011 earnings,
excluding certain items, to be “toward the low end” of its
previously announced range of $4.35 to $4.65 a share. The
company was down 6 cents to $52.98 at 10:05 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  The company said last week that it would purchase, with
General Electric Co., a 550-megawatt solar project in Riverside
County, California from First Solar Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
