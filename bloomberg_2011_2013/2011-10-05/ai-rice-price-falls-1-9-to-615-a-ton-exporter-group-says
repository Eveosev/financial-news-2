Thai rice prices, the benchmark for
 Asia , declined 1.9 percent as overseas demand weakened,
according to the Thai Rice Exporters Association.  The price of 100 percent grade-B white rice dropped to $615
a metric ton, from $627 a ton on Sept. 28, said Pisanu Sangyoo,
an official at the association. The price climbed to $629 a ton
on Sept. 7, the highest level since December 2009, on
expectation the government will buy unmilled rice from
farmers at above market rates.  The price of 25 percent broken rice fell to $551 a ton,
from $559 a week earlier, he said.  The exportersâ€™ association holds a meeting every week to
set prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
