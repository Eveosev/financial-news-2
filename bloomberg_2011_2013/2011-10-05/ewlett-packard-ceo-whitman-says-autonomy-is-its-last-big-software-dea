Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  won’t look for
big takeover targets in the software industry following its
$10.3 billion purchase of Autonomy Corp., Chief Executive
Officer  Meg Whitman  said at an event in San Francisco today.  “It’s certainly the end of big acquisitions,” said Whitman,
when asked whether she would continue the software expansion
strategy of her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, who was ousted as
CEO last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
