U.S. stocks are at their cheapest
relative to bonds since share prices began surging 2 1/2 years
ago, based on a comparison between earnings and Treasury yields.  This relationship is so far out of line with historical
norms that stock-market gains might be inevitable during the
next 12 months, according to a study by  Tobias Levkovich ,
Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the differential between the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s earnings yield, the inverse of its
price-earnings ratio, and the yield on 10-year Treasury notes
since 1970. The differential rose above 6.5 percentage points
this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the
 Federal Reserve , and peaked at 7 points in March 2009.  “Valuations have become compelling based on 40 years of
history,” Levkovich wrote yesterday in a report with a similar
chart. He identified 57 weeks during the period when the yield
gap favored stocks by two to three standard deviations, a
statistical gauge of its distance from the average.  In every instance, the  S&P 500  was higher a year later,
according to the report. The average increase was 26 percent.
After six months, the index was higher 93 percent of the time.  The track record is just one argument in favor of stocks,
Levkovich wrote. He also cited the potential for a rebound in
investor sentiment, the absence of a surge in borrowing costs, a
swing toward more favorable economic data and the likelihood
that share prices already account for slower profit growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
