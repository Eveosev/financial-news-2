Ben Franciscoâ€™s pinch-hit three-run
homer broke up a scoreless game and gave the Philadelphia
Phillies a 3-2 win against the  St. Louis Cardinals  for a 2-1
lead in their best-of-five National League Division Series.  Cole Hamels allowed five hits in six scoreless innings for
the Phillies, who are now one win from reaching the NL
Championship Series for the fourth straight season. Albert
Pujols had three doubles for the Cardinals.  In the other NL Division Series, the Milwaukee Brewers will
try to complete a 3-0 sweep tonight at the Arizona Diamondbacks.  The Texas Rangers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 earlier
today to return to the AL Championship Series, where they will
play either the  Detroit Tigers  or the New York Yankees. The
Tigers lead that series 2-1, with Game 4 tonight in  Detroit .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
