Grain importers such as  China  and
 Egypt  may make purchases to boost inventories after corn and
wheat prices fell last month,  Standard Chartered  Bank said.  Corn prices may rise on lower global inventories and
soybeans may gain as Chinese demand remains “resilient,”
analyst  Abah Ofon  wrote in a report today. Wheat futures may
advance as livestock feeders substitute the grain for high-
priced corn, he wrote. Prices for the two commodities declined
23 percent in September and soybean futures dropped 19 percent.  “We do not think the current sluggishness in grain prices
will last, as we still expect corn supply, in particular, to
remain tight,” Ofon said. “We expect corn prices to lead the
pack higher once market volatility wanes and as inventories are
drawn down in” the first half of 2012, he said.  Prices in September fell partly on fears that demand for
raw materials would decline amid the European debt crisis and
because the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  pegged corn and wheat
stockpiles higher than expectations. Importing countries may
take advantage of the prices and make purchases as they bet
futures will gain, according to the report.  “The deep decline in grain markets plays into the hands of
buyers,” Ofon said. China will “relish the recent collapse of
grain prices, given it has been grappling with high domestic
demand for corn.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
