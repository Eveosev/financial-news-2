The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment declined,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 4 basis points to 274 as of
8:28 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. Thatâ€™s set for the first drop since Sept. 27, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc., and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to 239
as of 11:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking Corp.
The benchmark is headed for its first decline since Sept. 27,
CMA prices in New York show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index slid
1 basis point to 220 basis points as of 9:30 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
