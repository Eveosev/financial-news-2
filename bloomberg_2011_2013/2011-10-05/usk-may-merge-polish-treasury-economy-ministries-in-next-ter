Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
said he wouldn’t rule out merging the Economy and Treasury
Ministries during the next government’s four-year term if he’s
re-elected on Sunday.  The Treasury Ministry’s role is “slowly ending” as it
sells off state-owned companies, he said at a news conference in
Warsaw today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
