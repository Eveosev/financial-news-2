full compensation to people who developed narcolepsy after
receiving  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Pandemrix pandemic flu vaccine
against the swine flu.  The government committed to pay all claims to ensure all
children and young people who developed narcolepsy due to the
vaccine will get full compensation, the Helsinki-based cabinet
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
