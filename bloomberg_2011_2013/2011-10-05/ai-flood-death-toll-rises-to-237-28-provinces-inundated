The death toll from flooding in
 Thailand  rose to 237, and 28 provinces remain submerged,
disrupting rail transport in the country’s north and northeast
provinces, according to the Department of Disaster Prevention &
Mitigation.  Heavy rain since July 25 has caused flooding in 59 of the
country’s 77 provinces, the agency said today on its website.  Floods also forced at least 40 factories at the
Saharattananakorn Industrial Estate in Ayutthaya province to
temporarily shut down, Narapote Thewtanom, deputy governor of
the Industrial Estate Authority Thailand, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
