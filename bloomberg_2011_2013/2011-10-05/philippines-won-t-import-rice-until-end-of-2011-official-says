The  Philippines  won’t import rice
until the end of the year even as recent storms damaged about
11.7 percent of the nation’s expected harvest for the fourth
quarter, Agriculture Undersecretary Antonio Fleta said in an
interview with DZMM radio today.  Rough rice damaged by typhoons have so far reached 760,207
tons, or about 11 billion pesos worth. The government earlier
predicted fourth-quarter harvest to reach 6.5 million tons,
Fleta said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
