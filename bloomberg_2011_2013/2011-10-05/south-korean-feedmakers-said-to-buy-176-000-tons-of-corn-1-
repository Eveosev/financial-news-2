Feed makers in  South Korea , the
world’s third-biggest buyer of corn, purchased 176,000 metric
tons of U.S. corn for January delivery in private deals late
last week, said three industry executives.  The Korea Feed Association, South Korea’s biggest grain-
buying group, bought 55,000 metric tons of the grain from  Itochu
Corp. (8001)  at $319.98 a ton on a cost and freight basis, the industry
executives, who took part in the negotiations or have direct
knowledge of the deals, said today.  Korea Feed’s members in Busan also purchased 55,000 tons at
$322.76 a ton from Mitsui & Co., while the Major Feedmill Group
bought 66,000 tons from Cargill Inc. at $328.25 a ton, they
said, asking not to be identified because purchases are
confidential.  Corn futures lost 7.2 percent last week, the fifth-straight
decline, amid concerns that global economic growth may falter,
reducing demand for raw materials from grains to copper. The
December-delivery contract traded 1 percent higher at $5.9375 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:39 p.m. Seoul time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
