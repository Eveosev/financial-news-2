Take-home pay growth at Britainâ€™s
largest publicly traded companies slowed for a third month in
September, led by the services industry, VocaLink Ltd. said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions climbed 2.2 percent
in the three months through September from a year earlier, the
group said in a statement in  London  today. That compares with
2.7 percent in the quarter through August.  Wage growth at service companies slowed to 2.3 percent from
2.7 percent, while the rate at manufacturers was unchanged and
government workers saw a faster pace of increase, VocaLink said.  The company, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, used salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the  FTSE 350 Index (NMX)  and more than 600
government-related organizations for the report.
