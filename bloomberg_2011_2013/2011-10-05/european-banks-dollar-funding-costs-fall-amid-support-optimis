A measure of how much European banks
pay to fund in dollars fell amid speculation policy makers are
planning ways of protecting banks from the sovereign crisis.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay
to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 72 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate as of 5 p.m. in
London, down from 75 basis points yesterday. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  European Union finance ministers are discussing measures to
coordinate the recapitalization of banks, the Financial Times
reported. Optimism that policy makers are tackling the crisis
offset concern that it’s spreading to  Italy , which had its
 credit rating  cut by Moody’s Investors Service for the first
time in almost two decades.  “The EU is currently only examining the idea,” Anke Richter, a credit strategist at Mizuho International Plc in
London, wrote in a note. “While markets took the headline as a
positive, we think the idea will likely go nowhere as it is the
wrong solution to the problem.”  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 106.5 basis
points under Euribor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The cost was 112.5 basis points below the benchmark on Sept. 12,
when the swap was the most expensive since December 2008.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to each other rose.
The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the borrowing
benchmark and overnight index swaps, was 82 basis points from 79
yesterday. The gap increased to 89 basis points on Sept. 23, the
widest since March 2009.  Deposits Rise  Lenders increased overnight deposits at the  European
Central Bank  to the highest in more than a year. Banks parked
213 billion euros ($283 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, up from 209 billion euros on Oct. 3. That’s the
highest since July 2010 and compares with a year-to-date average
of 53 billion euros.  The ECB today allotted $500 million to one bidder in a
regular seven-day liquidity-providing operation at a fixed rate
of 1.09 percent. Last week, the Frankfurt-based ECB also lent
$500 million to one institution. The ECB doesn’t identify the
banks it lends to.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.558 percent from 1.557
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.17 percent from
1.184 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 19th day to 0.384 percent from 0.381 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 11, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was 38.4
basis points, the biggest gap since July 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
