Global funds cut their holdings of
 South Korea ’s local-currency bonds in September for the first
time in eight months and pulled funds from the nation’s shares,
the financial markets watchdog said.  The amount of debt owned by overseas investors fell by 2.5
billion won ($2.1 million) and their overall holdings totaled
85.1 trillion won as of Sept. 30, the  Financial Supervisory
Service  said in an e-mailed statement today. European funds were
the largest sellers as the region’s debt crisis prompted banks
to free up cash, the FSS said.  Funds based in the U.K. and  France  cut holdings by 924.6
billion won and 823.5 billion won, respectively, FSS data show.
Thai investors were the biggest buyers with their ownership
increasing by 726.5 billion won, while U.S. funds boosted
holdings by 619.3 billion won.  Global investors sold 1.3 trillion won more of the nation’s
stocks than they bought in September, the FSS said. The outflows
were recorded amid lingering concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis
and signs the global economy is slowing, the watchdog said.  The won fell 9.5 percent in September, the biggest slump
since February 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The nation’s benchmark three-year bond yield rose 4 basis points
to 3.54 percent and the Kospi Index of shares dropped 5.9
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
