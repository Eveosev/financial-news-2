The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  dropped 0.2
percent to 1,265.67 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, reversing
an earlier gain of as much as 2.8 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index declined 0.6 percent to 1,217.21 rubles.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  Bank Vozrozhdenie (VZRZ RX) rose the most in more than a
week, adding 5 percent to 719.9 rubles after Vedomosti reported
that former Promstyroybank owner Vladimir Kogan wants to buy the
regional lender, citing unidentified people with the knowledge
of the talks.  OAO Lukoil (LKOH RX),  Russia ’s second-biggest oil producer,
rose for the first day in four, adding 0.4 percent to 1,548.9
rubles. Oil advanced for the first time in four days after the
U.S. government reported an unexpected stockpile decline in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming country.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN RX), the world’s biggest
producer of the metal, slid for the fourth day in Moscow,
declining 1.1 percent to 6,136 rubles after nickel slumped in
 London .  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)   plunged 7 percent to 73.05
rubles, the weakest since July 2009, after Kommersant yesterday
reported the Russian coal producer may produce less than 6.5
million metric tons this year, missing its output target by 24
percent, citing analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
