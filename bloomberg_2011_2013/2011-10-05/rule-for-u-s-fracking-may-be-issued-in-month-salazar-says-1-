The U.S. Interior Department may
issue a rule on hydraulic fracturing in about a month, aimed at
ensuring the natural-gas extraction process is conducted safely,
Secretary  Ken Salazar  said.  “I think hydraulic fracking can be done in a safe way, and
environmentally responsible way,” Salazar said today during a
meeting with reporters in Washington. “What we will include in
the rule is still in formation.”  Fracking, used by companies such as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Southwestern Energy Co., injects
millions of gallons of water, chemicals and sand into
subterranean rock formations to liberate trapped gas.  Opponents including environmental groups cite failures and
accidents that lead to tainting drinking water. Industry
advocates say the process hasn’t caused a major incident for
more than 60 years, though current techniques were introduced
less than a decade ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
