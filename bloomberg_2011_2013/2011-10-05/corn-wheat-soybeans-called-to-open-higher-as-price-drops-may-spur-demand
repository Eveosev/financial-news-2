What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that last
monthâ€™s 23 percent plunge in prices will spur demand from
livestock producers and ethanol refiners seeking to expand
inventories,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that commodity demand may improve
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
that the central bank may take further steps to sustain an
economic recovery, Gerlach said. Wheat prices fell 23 percent in
September.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that the lowest prices in almost a
year will improve demand for U.S. supplies, Gerlach said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open up 0.5 cent to 0.75
cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $4 to $6 higher
for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
