Two Pakistani cricket players
conspired to take a bribe to fix plays in a Test match against
England last year at Lord’s Cricket Ground in  London ,
prosecutors said.  In a “depressing tale of rampant corruption at the heart
of international cricket,” former Pakistan team captain  Salman Butt , 27, and fast bowler  Mohammad Asif , 29, agreed to perform
poorly on three plays in the match to affect gambling outcomes,
 Aftab Jafferjee , a lawyer for the  Crown Prosecution Service ,
said in the opening day of trial today.  The alleged crime was uncovered by a journalist at the now-
defunct News of the World tabloid, who offered Butt’s agent,
Mazhar Majeed, a 140,000-pound ($216,000) bribe. Majeed accepted
the money so Butt would arrange for Asif and another player to
bowl “no balls” on Aug. 26 and 27 last year during the fourth
cricket Test against  England .  “The activity of these four men not only contaminated the
games which took place and were watched by millions in this
country, but their activity represents a betrayal by them of
their own team, their own Board of Cricket, and most damaging of
all, a betrayal of the sport,” Jafferjee said.  After his arrest, Butt said the fact that three no-balls
were bowled at the same time his agent told the journalist that
they would be, was a series of “freakish occurrences,”
Jafferjee said. Asif also claims the fact he bowled no balls was
chance and unrelated to the bribe, according to the prosecutors.  Lawyers for Asif and Butt will present their defense later
in the trial, scheduled to last about four weeks at a criminal
court in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
