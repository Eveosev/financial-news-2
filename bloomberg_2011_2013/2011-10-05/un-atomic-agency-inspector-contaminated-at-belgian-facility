Three people including an
International Atomic Energy Agency inspector were contaminated
by radiation yesterday at a Belgian nuclear waste facility, the
Vienna-based United Nations agency said in an e-mail.  “The three individuals evacuated the area and have
undergone external decontamination procedures and medical
checks,” the IAEA said in a statement. “They are now being
assessed to determine the level of their  radiation exposure .”  The incident took place at the Belgoprocess nuclear waste
processing facility in Dessel,  Belgium , the statement said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
