The euro rose against a majority of
its most-traded counterparts as an agreement on a second
international bailout for  Greece  reduced investor concern the
region’s debt crisis will worsen.  The 17-nation currency reached a three-month high against
the yen this week and broke through key technical levels against
its Japanese and U.S. peers. The dollar dropped against its
higher-yielding counterparts as reports showed an improving
economic recovery, damping demand for safety. Currencies of
commodity-exporting countries rallied as oil surged and
volatility fell to a three-year low. The  European Central Bank 
will offer banks unlimited three-year loans next week.  “There was some optimism following the Greek deal and
optimism ahead of next week’s second liquidity tender by the
ECB,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington  at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “The
euro is rallying and all gauges of risk appetite are pointing to
a risk-on week, whether it’s the Australian dollar, the  New
Zealand dollar , crude oil or the dollar being down.”  The euro rose 2.3 percent to $1.3448, reaching $1.3487, the
highest level since Dec. 2. It rallied 4.4 percent to 109.18
yen, reaching 109.25 yesterday for the first time since Oct. 31.
The yen weakened 2.1 percent to 81.20 per dollar and touched
81.22, the weakest level since July.  Franc Leads Gains  The implied volatility of three-month options on G-7
currencies as tracked by the  JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index (JPMVXYG7)  fell
to 9.71 percent yesterday, the least since Aug. 8, 2008, as
options traders scaled back the risk of large exchange-rate
swings. Lower volatility makes investments in currencies with
higher benchmark rates more attractive because the risk in such
trades is that market moves will erase profits.  The Swiss franc led gains against the dollar among the 16
most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency
appreciated 2.6 percent to 89.60 centimes and gained 0.3 percent
to 1.2051 per euro. The  Swiss National Bank  on Sept. 6 imposed a
currency ceiling in the rate, at 1.20 per euro, for the first
time since the 1970s after the Swiss currency surged to record
strength.  The shared currency rose for a third week against the yen
after euro-area finance ministers awarded 130 billion euros
($175 billion) in aid to Greece and reached an accord for
greater debt relief from investor representatives in an exchange
offer to tide the nation past a bond redemption next month.  Greece’s government yesterday formally asked investors to
exchange their holdings of government debt for new securities in
the biggest sovereign restructuring in history.  German Confidence  The currency also benefited after a report showed German
business confidence rose to the highest level in seven months,
easing crisis concern. Munich-based Ifo institute said its
 business climate index  climbed to 109.6 from 108.3 in January,
the highest reading since July.  The euro rose for a seventh-straight day against the yen,
the longest run since January 2010, after demand was boosted by
the prospect that Group of 20 officials meeting this weekend may
discuss committing further resources to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “You could put the decline in the yen and the gain in some
of the European currencies in the context of a more constructive
mood on the market and positive attitudes about recent
developments,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy
at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “Developments are continuing
to move in an overall favorable direction and that’s why we’re
seeing the markets behaving as they are.”  470 Billion Euros  Financial institutions will ask the ECB for 470 billion
euros ($630 billion) in three-year funds for allotment on Feb.
29, the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  Futures traders  decreased their so-called net-short
positions on the euro versus the dollar to 142,159 contracts in
the week ended Feb. 21. The positions reached a record high of
171,347 last month.  The shared currency traded above its 100-day moving average
of $1.3308 Feb. 23 for the first time since Oct. 31. It broke
through its 200-day moving average against the yen yesterday for
the first time since August.  The yen dropped for a third straight week against the
dollar. The  Bank of Japan  said this month it would expand its
asset-purchase program to 30 trillion yen ($372 billion) from 20
trillion, with 19 trillion yen set aside for  government bonds .
The central bank also said it will target 1 percent inflation
“for the time being.”  The greenback weakened against its higher-yielding
counterparts, including the Swedish krona and  South Africa ’s
rand, as data showed a quickening recovery.  Jobless Claims  Applications for U.S. jobless benefits were unchanged in
the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since March 2008,
Labor Department figures showed Feb. 23. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment
for February rose to 75.3 from 75 at the end of last month.  “The U.S. data is improving and no doubt that’s adding to
the positive sentiment,” said  Tony Allen , global head of
foreign-exchange trading in Sydney at  Australia  & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. “Higher equity markets in the States equals
higher risk currencies.”  Sweden’s krona rose 2.5 percent to 6.5580 per dollar and
South Africa’s rand added 1.9 percent to 7.5986 against the
greenback.  Rally in Oil  The riskier currencies also benefited from a rally in  oil
prices . Crude for April delivery advanced 5.3 percent to $109.62
a barrel, reaching $109.95, the highest since May.  Norway’s krone strengthened to 7.4371 per euro Feb. 23, the
highest level in nine years, before ending the week up 2 percent
at 7.4971. It added 2.4 percent to 5.5745 per dollar.  Australia’s dollar strengthened for an eighth week against
the yen, its longest such streak since 2003, as former Prime
Minister  Kevin Rudd  said he will challenge his successor,  Julia
Gillard , in a Feb. 27 leadership ballot as the ruling  Labor
party  seeks to end weeks of rivalry that’s undermining the
government.  Brazil ’s real gained even as the nation’s central bank
intervened in both the forward and spot markets in an attempt to
stem the currency’s 9.9 percent three-month rally.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.7100 per dollar
and strengthened to beyond 1.70 for the first time since
October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
