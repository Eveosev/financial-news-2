Italy’s markets watchdog Consob
asked  Electricite de France SA  to provide more data before it
rules on the power company’s plan to take over  Edison SpA. (EDN)   Consob will need more information about transactions
between Paris-based EDF and current investors in Milan-based
Edison, including those involving the Italian energy company’s
Edipower unit and gas supplies, to assess whether the proposed
price of 84 euro cents a share for Edison is fair, the regulator
said in a  statement  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
