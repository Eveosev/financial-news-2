Cleveland Cavaliers rookie Kyrie
Irving scored 34 points to lead Team Chuck to a 146-133 win
against Team Shaq and the  New York Knicks ’ Jeremy Lin in the
 National Basketball Association ’s Rising Stars Challenge during
All-Star weekend.  Lin, who has averaged 22.6 points and 8.7 assists in 12
games since taking over as the Knicks’ point guard, was held to
two points on 1-for-4 shooting last night at the Amway Center in
Orlando,  Florida .  “Just to be here and to see the company and all the
players that are here,” Lin said in a pregame news conference.
“It’s just been unbelievable, and I’m just trying to take it
all in and embrace it and enjoy it every step of the way.”  Lin and the  Miami Heat ’s Norris Cole were added to the pool
of “rising stars” at the last minute by honorary commissioner
Kenny Smith.  Two days before general managers  Charles Barkley  and
 Shaquille O’Neal  drafted their teams, Harvard University
graduate Lin had become the only player to score more than 20
points and win each of his first five starts since the NBA
merged with the American Basketball Association in 1976.  Barkley passed on Lin in favor of Irving, although he
conceded the Knicks’ player had had “a fantastic week.”  “It wasn’t very difficult to be honest,” Barkley said
after he put together his team. “Irving is terrific.”  Irving hit all eight of his 3-point shots and 12 of 13
field goal attempts. The Indiana Pacers’ Paul George scored 23
points and the Sacramento Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins had 18 points
for Team Chuck, which had a 77-65 halftime advantage.  Cavaliers rookie Tristan Thompson scored 20 points, hitting
10 of 11 field goal attempts, for Team Shaq, and the  Detroit
Pistons ’ Greg Monroe had 19 points.  Two mixed teams of NBA rookies and sophomores participated
in the game, which started the three-day weekend that culminates
with the All-Star Game tomorrow night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
