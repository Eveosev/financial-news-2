U.S. governors are optimistic about
state economies as unemployment slowly declines, the chairman of
the National Governor’s Association said.  “I get a sense that most governors are feeling a little
bit better,” Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman, a Republican,
said today as he opened the group’s winter meeting in
 Washington . “The budget pictures have improved.”  For the past four years, U.S. states struggled to close
more than $500 billion of budget shortfalls caused by the
longest recession since the 1930s, ushering in tax increases,
spending cuts and clashes with public-employee unions. Now,
state revenue is rising at the fastest pace since 2006, before
the housing-market collapse, according to the  U.S. Census . The
national  unemployment rate  in January was 8.3 percent, down from
as high as 10 percent in October 2009.  “The way that we feel generally has a whole lot to do with
how many of our people are working and are not working,” said
 Delaware ’s Jack Markell, a Democrat and vice chairman of the
association, said at a news conference. “That’s essentially
what is driving all of us these days.”  The three-day meeting, which includes a black-tie dinner
with President  Barack Obama  tomorrow, includes sessions on
enlarging economies and economic development.  “I wouldn’t say any of us are yet feeling great,” Markell
said. “But I think we’re feeling better. We’re moving in the
right direction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
