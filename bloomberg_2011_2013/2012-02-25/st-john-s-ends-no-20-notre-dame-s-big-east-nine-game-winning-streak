Moe Harkless had 22 points for St.
John’s University, which broke 20th-ranked  Notre Dame 
University’s nine-game  Big East  Conference winning streak with a
61-58 victory in men’s college basketball.  St. John’s, 11th in the 16-team Big East, got its first win
in 11 games this season against a ranked team. Notre Dame missed
a chance to tie 10th-ranked Marquette University for second
place in the conference.  D’Angelo Harrison had 15 points and Amir Garrett scored 11
points for the Red Storm (13-16, 6-10 Big East), who earned
their third straight victory yesterday.  “The stat sheet shows they weren’t able to make their
normal number of 3s and that was the difference,” St. John’s
assistant coach Mike Dunlap said after the game at  New York ’s
Madison Square Garden.  The Fighting Irish were 4 for 31 (13 percent) in 3-point
attempts for the worst showing in a season where they were
averaging 34.3 percent outside the 3-point line. Alex Dragevich
missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer which would have forced the
game into overtime.  Scott Martin and Jack Cooley each had 18 points for Notre
Dame (20-9, 12-4 Big East).  To contact the reporter on this story:
