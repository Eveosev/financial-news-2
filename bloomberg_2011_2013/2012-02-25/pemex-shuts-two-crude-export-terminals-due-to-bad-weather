Petroleos Mexicanos  closed the oil
export terminals Coatzacoalcos and Dos Bocas in the  Gulf of
Mexico  because of adverse weather conditions, Mexico’s Merchant
Marine said today in its daily weather bulletin.  The port of Cayo Arcas remained open, the Merchant Marine,
an agency of Mexico’s Communications and Transportation
Ministry, said in the report published on its website.  Pemex, as the state-owned company is known, is the third-
largest supplier of oil to the U.S., exporting about 1.3 million
barrels of crude a day in December. Canada is the largest
supplier of crude to the U.S. followed by Saudi Arabia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
