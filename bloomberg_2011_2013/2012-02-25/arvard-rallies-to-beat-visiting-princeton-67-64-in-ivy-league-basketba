Kyle Casey  scored 20 points to help
Harvard University rally from a 10-point deficit to earn a 67-64
menâ€™s college basketball win against  Princeton University  and
set a school record for victories in a season.  Princeton had handed the Crimson its only Ivy League
conference loss this season, beating Harvard 70-62 on Feb. 11.  Brandyn Curry scored 15 points, Oliver McNally had 13 and
Keith Wright added 12 for the Crimson (24-3, 10-1 Ivy League) at
Lavietes Pavilion in Boston.  Ian Hummer and Douglas Davis each had 14 points for
Princeton (15-11, 6-4 Ivy League), which had a 33-32 halftime
advantage.  The 24 wins are a season record for Harvard, which has a
28-game home winning streak that is the second longest in the
nation.  Harvard finishes its home schedule tonight against the
 University of Pennsylvania . A victory would clinch at least a
share of the Ivy League title for the Crimson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
