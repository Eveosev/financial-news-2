The British Medical Association
council is set to decide whether to ballot for a strike, the
British Broadcasting Corp.  reported .  The move follows a dispute over pension changes that would
see contributions for the highest earning doctors rising to 14.5
percent of their salary, the  BBC  said. It would be the first
time U.K. doctors have been balloted for industrial action since
1975, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
