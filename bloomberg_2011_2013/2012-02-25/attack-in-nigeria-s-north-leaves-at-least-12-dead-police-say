At least 12 people were killed
yesterday in  Nigeria  in an attack on a police station by
suspected Islamist militants in the northern city of Gombe,
police said.  “Two policemen and 10 civilians died as a result of the
attack,” Orubebe Gandhi, Gombe’s state police commissioner,
said by phone today. He said officials believed the attack had
been aimed at freeing people from a nearby prison and was
carried out by Boko Haram, a group seeking imposition of Islamic
Shariah law that’s been blamed for attacks in northern Nigeria
and the capital, Abuja, since 2009.  Nigerian authorities imposed a 24-hour curfew in Gombe
after the bomb blasts and shootings at the police station.  Boko Haram last week issued a statement saying it would
carry out attacks in order to secure the release of members held
in prison without trial.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous country of more than 164
million people, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north
and predominantly Christian south. More than 14,000 people died
in ethnic and religious clashes in the West African nation
between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporters on this story:
