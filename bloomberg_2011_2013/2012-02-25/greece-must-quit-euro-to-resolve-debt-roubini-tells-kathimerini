Greece  is likely to leave the euro
and adopt its own currency next year to improve competitiveness
and foreign trade, as it must achieve economic growth to resolve
its sovereign debt burden,  Kathimerini  cited New York University
Professor  Nouriel Roubini  as saying in an interview.  The only way to restore growth is through devaluation,
which requires the return to a national currency, and there’s a
“strong chance” this will happen in Greece by 2013, the
Athens-based newspaper cited Roubini as saying in a preview of
the interview to be published in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
