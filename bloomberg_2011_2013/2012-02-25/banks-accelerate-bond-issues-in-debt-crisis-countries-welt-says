Banks in  Greece ,  Spain ,  Italy ,
 Portugal  and Ireland have issued 54 billion euros ($72.6
billion) of bonds this year and most will probably be used as
collateral for loans from the  European Central Bank , Die Welt
said,  citing  its own research.  The amount of government-backed bank bonds issued in the
five countries has risen to 263 billion euros from 209 billion
euros at the start of the year, the Berlin-based newspaper said
in an article e-mailed in advance of publication tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
