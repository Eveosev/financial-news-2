Flint Hills Resources LLC released
gases yesterday at its Port Arthur chemical plant in  Texas ,
according to a  filing  with the U.S. National Response Center.  The release came from a cooling tower and included 10
pounds each of butadiene and benzene, and 100 pounds each of
ethylene, propylene, toluene and xylene, according to the
filing.  U.S. refineries and other facilities must notify the center
if they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldnâ€™t immediately verify that the
information in the filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
