AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s  American Airlines 
rejected proposals from two unions designed to reduce 13,000
planned job cuts, saying incentives for workers to leave early
wouldn’t provide permanent savings for the bankrupt carrier.  American said today it wants to reach agreements “within
the next few weeks” on steps to trim annual labor spending by
$1.25 billion as it responded to the  Association of Professional
Flight Attendants  and the  Transport Workers Union . The APFA had
said as many as 3,000 members would retire under its proposal.  “As currently structured, these early-out incentives would
significantly increase costs and do not address the company’s
need for sustainable cost savings and efficiency,”  Fort Worth ,
Texas-based AMR said in a statement.  AMR’s reply capped a review of union plans offered Feb. 15
to counter the airline’s strategy for dumping 13,000 jobs. The
carrier wants to shift some work to third-party vendors, freeze
pensions, extend work hours and make other changes to pare an
$800 million annual labor-cost disadvantage to its peers.  The APFA program would have provided full pensions and
medical coverage to workers retiring early and allowed American
to immediately begin hiring 500 new workers at lower salaries.
The airline wants to cut 2,300 jobs from among the 16,000
attendants represented by the union.  The TWU, which represents mechanics, baggage handlers and
other airport ground workers, proposed a one-time payment of
$75,000 and certain health and other benefits for members who
chose to leave. American’s plan calls for 8,800 job cuts within
the union, which represents more than 23,000 workers.  AMR also is in talks with the  Allied Pilots Association ,
whose board has said it wants the airline to freeze pensions
instead of terminating them following the company’s Nov. 29
bankruptcy filing.  American’s plan to secure $1 billion in new annual revenue
after leaving Chapter 11 protection rests on winning the $1.25
billion in labor cuts and $750 million in other savings, Chief
Commercial Officer Virasb Vahidi said on Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
