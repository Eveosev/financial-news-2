Peru’s economic growth slowed to an
annual 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter as the expansion of
private investment and exports eased, the central bank said.  The increase in gross domestic product slowed from 6.7
percent in the previous three months and 6.9 percent in the
second quarter, the bank said on its website today. The fourth-
quarter expansion brought growth for the full year to 6.9
percent.  Peru’s government has begun to ease a decline in fiscal
investment as the European debt crisis damps demand for its
commodity exports. Fiscal investment slid 5.5 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with a drop of 23.3
percent in the third quarter. Private investment grew 7.8
percent in the last three months of the year, compared with 8.5
percent in the third quarter and 16 percent in the second.  The government posted a fiscal surplus equivalent to 1.8
percent of gross domestic product in 2011, reversing the
previous year’s deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP.  The shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure
of trade in goods and services, represented 1.3 percent of GDP
in both the fourth quarter and the full year, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
