Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO)  said it
isn’t interested in selling its 50 percent holding in the
Monoprix supermarket chain and is ready to acquire full control
from partner  Galeries Lafayette SA (GL) .  “If Galeries Lafayette wants to sell its stake in
Monoprix, as seems to be the case, Casino is ready to buy it,
but at a fair price,” the Saint-Etienne, France-based retailer
said in an e-mailed response to a report in Le Figaro newspaper
that Casino is studying a disposal to resolve a dispute.  Casino and Paris-based department-store operator Galeries
Lafayette disagree with each other’s valuation of Monoprix, with
Casino estimating the stake at 700 million euros ($941 million)
and Galeries Lafayette calculating it at 1.95 billion euros.
Galeries Lafayette filed a complaint at the Paris commercial
court over the affair, Casino said on Feb. 22.  Casino’s board is studying Galeries Lafayette’s offer to
buy it out of Monoprix for 1.35 billion euros, Le Figaro
reported today, citing Galeries Lafayette Chairman Philippe Houze. Casino’s lower valuation of the Monoprix stake is “very
worrying” as it shows the retailer isn’t focused on the chain’s
growth, Le Figaro cited Houze as saying.  Casino has “invested a lot in Monoprix” and “reiterates
its confidence in the management and workers,” the company said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
