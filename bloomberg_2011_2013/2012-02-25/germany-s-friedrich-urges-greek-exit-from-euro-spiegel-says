German Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich  said Greece would have better chances of overhauling
its economy and restoring growth if it left the euro area,  Der
Spiegel  said, citing an interview.  Friedrich, a member of the Bavaria-based  Christian Social
Union  that’s allied with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
larger Christian Democratic Union, is her first Cabinet member
to suggest Greece’s exit from the euro, the magazine said today
in an article e-mailed to other media before publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
