Fraport AG (FRA) , the operator of
Frankfurt Airport, said it can handle “extended strike
periods” by ground staff, who walked out for five of the last
10 days in a contract dispute and haven’t ruled out more
stoppages.  Fraport has taken measures to ensure that flight operations
will be largely unaffected, the company said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. More than 80 percent of flights went ahead on
days when the GdF union’s ground staff members staged all-day
strikes, and intercontinental flights weren’t affected,
according to the statement.  Frankfurt ranks behind  London Heathrow  and Paris Charles de
Gaulle in  Europe  in terms of annual passenger numbers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
