Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) 
submitted to the Italian authorities yesterday the documentation
related to its plan to merge with  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA) ,  Il Sole 24
Ore  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Unipol provided the insurance regulator Isvap and the
antitrust agency with the integration plan, including industrial
synergies stemming from the proposed merger, in order to get
their approval after having already asked market regulator
Consob to give its go ahead, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
