Kenyan troops deployed in  Somalia 
will join the  United Nations  backed African Union military force
operating in the country, a spokesman for  Kenya ’s armed forces
said.  “Kenya Defence Forces have formally received United
Nations endorsement to join AMISON troops in Somalia,” Colonel
Cyrus Oguna, an armed forces spokesman, told reporters in the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi, today.  AMISON  is the African Union
Mission in Somalia.  The Kenyan forces, which entered Somalia in mid-October,
will join African Union troops from Uganda, Burundi and
Djibouti. The foreign troops are deployed in Somalia alongside
government soldiers and Ethiopian forces, which separately
entered Somalia in December, in pursuit of the Islamist al-
Shabaab militia that the U.S. says has links to al-Qaeda.  “The approval from the United Nations will enlarge the
AMISON from the current 12,000 troops to 17,000 troops,”
Antony Safari, an official at the Kenya’s Ministry of  Foreign
Affairs , told reporters in Nairobi. “This effectively means
Kenya will no longer bear the cost of keeping its troops in
Somalia but will be supported by the United Nations kitty.”  Al-Shabaab has been battling Somalia’s western-backed
government led by President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed for five
years and controls most of the southern and central regions.
Somalia has had no effective central government since the
downfall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre two decades ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
