Russia  said it will pay its $15
million debt to Kyrgyzstan for leasing military bases and is
prepared to consider options to resolve nearly half a billion
dollars it’s owed from the Central Asian country.  Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev said earlier that
Russia hadn’t paid its lease for four years, Interfax reported,
citing an interview with Echo Moscow radio station.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  said Russia is willing to pay the
debt “in the near future” following talks with Atambayev,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Kremlin. “More
complicated is the question of repayment of public debt from
Kyrgyzstan to the Russian Federation, constituting nearly half a
billion dollars,” the statement added.  Russia understands the former Soviet state is facing
“severe financial and economic situation” and is ready to look
at different options to resolve the debt, it added.  Land-locked Kyrgyzstan is the only country in the world
that hosts both Russian and U.S. military bases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
