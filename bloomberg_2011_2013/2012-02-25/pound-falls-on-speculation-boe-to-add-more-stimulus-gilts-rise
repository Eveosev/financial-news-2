The pound fell the most in eight
months versus the euro this week as  Bank of England  minutes
showed two policy makers voted for a larger increase in asset
purchases than agreed at this month’s meeting.  Gilts advanced after Bank of England policy maker  David Miles  said he and  Adam Posen  voted to add 75 billion pounds
($119 billion) to the central bank’s stimulus plan because the
economy is in a “precarious situation.” The Monetary Policy
Committee finally agreed on a 50 billion-pound increase.
Sterling fell to a two-month low against the euro as a report
confirmed U.K.  gross domestic product  shrank last quarter.  “The minutes were dovish,” said  Steve Barrow , head of
Group-of-10 research at Standard Bank Plc in London. “U.K.
policy makers are being quite guarded about anything positive.
That’s pushed the pound down against the euro because the market
thinks there might be a case for more stimulus.”  The U.K. currency depreciated 2.3 percent this week to
84.90 pence per euro at 4:11 p.m.  London  time yesterday, the
biggest weekly drop most since June 3. It reached 85.06 pence,
the weakest level since Dec. 12. Sterling was little changed at
$1.5828.  Gross domestic product dropped 0.2 percent in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months, confirming the previous
estimate, the  Office for National Statistics  said yesterday.  Quarterly Decline  The pound has weakened 1.8 percent over the previous three
