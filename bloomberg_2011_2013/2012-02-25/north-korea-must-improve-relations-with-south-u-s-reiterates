Further progress in  North Korea ’s
relationship with the U.S. hinges on an improvement in the
communist nation’s interaction with the South, U.S. special
representative Glyn Davies reiterated today.  “We will continue to raise this issue,” the U.S. diplomat
said at a briefing in Seoul after meeting his South Korean
counterpart Lim Sung Nam. South Korea expects to hold further
talks with the North building on progress made last year, Lim
said, without offering a timeframe.  Davies and Lim met following talks between the U.S. and
North Korea in Beijing earlier this week, the first since the
death of Kim Jong Il. The discussions, which yielded what Davies
described as “a little bit” of progress, were the third since
the U.S. resumed direct talks with North Korea to bring the
communist regime back to six-party negotiations on dismantling
its nuclear weapons program.  North Korea backed out of the six-party talks in April 2009
and hasn’t shown any sign since Kim Jong Un took over as leader
that it’s willing to resume them. The participants in the talks
are Russia,  China , the U.S.,  Japan , North Korea and  South Korea .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
