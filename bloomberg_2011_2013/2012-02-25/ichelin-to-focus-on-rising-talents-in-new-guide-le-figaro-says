The 2012 Michelin Guide to  France 
supports young talents in the restaurant world, awarding one
star to chefs at Paris’s Cobea and Restaurant Kei, and Akrame in
Tours, Le Figaro said, citing unnamed sources ahead of the Feb.
27 release of the book.  Emmanuel Renaut at Flocons de Sel in Megeve will receive
his third star, the newspaper said. Among those receiving two
stars are Thierry Marx at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Paris,
Philippe Labbe at L’Abeille in Paris, and Philippe Mille at
Chateau Les Crayeres in Reims, Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
