Turkey ’s plan to join the European
Union has been delayed as the region struggles to resolve its
debt crisis, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said.  “Our ambitions to become a member of the euro zone
eventually, unfortunately, is being diminished by the current
situation,” Babacan said during a speech in Mexico City at the
Group of 20 meeting yesterday. “We still think that the
European Union is a union of values, is a union of common
principles, and we still find merit in following that.”  EU leaders are trying to avert the first sovereign default
in the euro’s 13-year history by providing bailout funds to
Greece. The Turkish economy, grew the fastest behind  China  among
major economies last year at a rate of more than 8 percent.  In July, Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said Turkey
will press forward “sincerely” with EU membership talks.
Certain members of the bloc aren’t treating Turkey’s candidacy
objectively, Erdogan said July 8 in a televised address to
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
