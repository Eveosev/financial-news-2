Manny Ramirez , who faces a 50-game
drug suspension if he makes the Oakland Athletics’ roster, said
he found God in the offseason and that he is eager to show his
children and his teammates that he has changed.  Ramirez, 39, a 12-time All-Star whose 555 home runs rank
14th on the Major League Baseball career list, agreed to a
minor-league contract with the A’s earlier this week and
reported to spring training camp in Phoenix yesterday.  Ramirez retired from baseball last season while with the
 Tampa Bay Rays  rather than face a second unspecified violation
tied to the sport’s anti-doping rules. He also was suspended 50
games in May 2009 while playing for the  Los Angeles Dodgers .  “Sometimes when you don’t got God in your heart, you do
stupid things,” Ramirez, who hit seven balls out of the park
during batting practice yesterday, told reporters. “When you
have a problem, you can get up and fix it.”  Ramirez is a non-roster invitee to Oakland’s spring camp.
If he makes the major league roster, he would be eligible to
play no earlier than May 30, his 40th birthday.  Ramirez, who won two World Series titles with the  Boston
Red Sox , asked to be reinstated as a player on Dec. 5. He said
he hopes to mentor some of the younger players on the A’s.  “I can tell them what happened to me, you don’t want to be
in a deep hole,” he said. “Everyone knows my story. I can tell
them how I changed, and the way I used to think.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
