Italy ’s  10-year bonds  rose for a
seventh week, the longest run of gains in the euro-era, after a
decision by European finance ministers to bail out Greece
boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  Spanish 10-year (GSPG10YR)  securities posted their biggest weekly
advance in a month after Greece was given 130 billion euros
($172 billion) of aid following talks in Brussels. German bunds
gained as the European Commission said the region’s economy will
shrink this year, underpinning the attraction of safer
investments. The  European Central Bank  is next week scheduled to
offers a second round of three-year loans to banks.  “Italian and Spanish bonds have extended gains this week
as risk sentiment improved” following the Greek bailout, said
 Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “We’ve seen better
demand for peripheral bonds since the turn of the year.”  Italy’s  10-year (GBTPGR10)  yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, this week to 5.49 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday. The 5 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.685, or 6.85
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 96.865. The yield has
declined 165 basis points over the past seven weeks.  Spanish 10-year yields dropped 21 basis points this week to
5.05 percent, reducing the extra yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of German bunds by 17 basis points to
3.16 percentage points.  Greece Deal  Greece  reached an agreement with its private creditors on
Feb. 21 to secure the biggest sovereign restructuring in
history. Investors agreed to forgive 53.5 percent of their
principal and exchange their remaining holdings for new Greek
bonds and notes from the European Financial Stability Facility.  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  fell four basis points over the
week to 1.88 percent, the biggest decline in a month.  The euro-area will shrink 0.3 percent this year, the
European Commission said Feb. 23, scrapping an earlier forecast
of 0.5 percent growth. The reduction was mainly based on
projected contractions of 1.3 percent in Italy and 1 percent in
Spain, it said.  European financial institutions may ask for 470 billion
euros of loans from the ECB’s planned longer-term refinancing
operation this month, compared with 489 billion euros in
December, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “The LTRO is the big event and overshadows the rest of the
landscape,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG in London. “The overall  market sentiment  is
still positive.”  Italian bonds have advanced 9 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds gained 2.1 percent
and German bunds fell 0.2 percent.  Italy will sell as much as 3.75 billion euros of 10-year
bonds and up to 2.5 billion euros of five-year notes on Feb. 28.
Germany will sell 4 billion euros of 10-year bonds the following
day. France will auction five-, seven-, 10- and 14-year bonds on
March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
