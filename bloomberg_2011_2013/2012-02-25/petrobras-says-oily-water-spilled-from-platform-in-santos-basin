Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil â€™s
state-controlled oil producer, said oily water spilled from an
offshore platform at the Urugua field in the Santos Basin.  About 70 liters (18.5 gallons) of oily water spilled during
equipment maintenance on Feb. 18, the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. All of the material
was collected by the end of that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
