Saudi Arabian shares rose for a
sixth day, sending the benchmark index to its highest level in
more than three years, after U.S. and emerging market stocks
advanced on signs of a global economic recovery and oil rallied.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) ,  Saudi Arabia ’s largest publicly-traded
lender by assets, advanced to its highest price in almost 10
months, climbing 2 percent to 77 riyals ($20.53).  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest petrochemicals maker,
known as Sabic, gained 0.8 percent, rising for a fifth day, to
101.25 riyals.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.6 percent to 7,075.86 at
the 3:30 p.m. end of trading in Riyadh, its highest close since
Sept. 28, 2008. The 151-member index’s six-day rally is the
longest since a 10-day surge that ended on Feb. 5. The  volume of
shares  traded was 504 million, the highest since Feb. 1.  “The index is getting support from global market closes in
the past week,” said Turki Fadaak, head of research at Riyadh-
based Albilad Investment Co. “Bank and petrochemical shares are
gaining in an optimistic atmosphere boosted by speculation the
market will open to foreign investors soon.”  U.S. stocks  rose this week, driving the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index to the highest level since 2008, while emerging-market
equities advanced for a second week as oil neared a 10-month
high. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 0.8 percent at the
close in New York yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery added 1.8 percent to $109.77 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest settlement since last May. The front-month contract
increased 6.3 percent this week. Crude’s seven-day advance was
the longest since the period ended Jan. 6, 2010. Saudi Arabia,
the world’s biggest crude exporter, depended on oil for 93
percent of its revenue in 2011.  Foreign Entry  Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority is in discussions
with international banks to open the country’s stock exchange to
foreign investors in early 2012, three bankers familiar with the
matter said in October. Investors outside the  Persian Gulf 
currently can’t directly invest in Saudi shares. The kingdom
hasn’t set a timeline for opening its market to foreigners,
stock exchange Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Al-Suweilmy said
in December.  Turkey halted anti-dumping duties on petrochemicals
imported from Saudi Arabia,  al-Eqtisadiah  reported today, citing
Turkish officials unidentified by name.  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , an investment company controlled by
Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, gained 1.4 percent,
the largest increase since Feb. 13, to 11.10 riyals. The board
of the Riyadh-based company recommended distributing 0.125 riyal
a share in quarterly dividends from retained profit this year.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
