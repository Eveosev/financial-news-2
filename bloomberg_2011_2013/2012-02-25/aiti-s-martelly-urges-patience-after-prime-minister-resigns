Haitian President Michel Martelly
urged the Caribbean nation to remain calm as he seeks to replace
his prime minister who resigned yesterday and accelerate
recovery efforts from the 2010 earthquake.  Prime Minister Garry Conille, a former United Nations
diplomat supported by  Haiti ’s opposition parties, left from his
post amid disputes over how relief aid was handled.  “We’ve taken action for a quick exit from this situation
and I will propose a new prime minister,” Martelly said in a
televised address late yesterday. “I regret that the
resignation occurs in a context in which the country is
beginning to take off.”  Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, is
still rebuilding from the January 2010 quake that killed 300,000
people. The U.S. and  Canada  called on Martelly to quickly
appoint a new prime minister, warning that a void in leadership
could undermine the recovery.  “We continue to believe that political stability in Haiti
is critical to its ability to attract the domestic and foreign
investments needed to increase economic development and create
jobs,” the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
