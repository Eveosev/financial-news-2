Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF)  will
support  Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) ’s plan to merge with
 Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA) , Il Messaggero reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The advisers of Premafin, the biggest investor in Italy’s
No. 2 insurer Fondiaria, confirmed their commitment to
 Mediobanca SpA (MB)  Chief Executive Officer Alberto Nagel in a
meeting yesterday, the newspaper said.  Private-equity fund Sator Capital Limited and Palladio
Finanziaria SpA tried in vain to contact Banca Leonardo SpA
Chief Executive Officer Gerardo Braggiotti to start negotiations
on their offer for Premafin, the newspaper reported. Banca
Leonardo is advising Premafin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
