Mergers and acquisitions may
increase in 2012 as the euro area’s debt crisis wanes, Dorothee Blessing, a partner at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in Germany, was
quoted as saying in an interview with Die Welt.  After European governments and the  European Central Bank 
took steps to stem the crisis, the months ahead will be decisive
for stabilizing the economic outlook, the Berlin-based newspaper
quoted Blessing as saying in comments published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
