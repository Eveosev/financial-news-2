China issued a preliminary list for
official-vehicle purchases this year that excludes all foreign
brands.  The list contains of 412 domestic models from companies
including  BYD Co. (1211)  and  Geely Automobile Holdings (175)  Ltd., the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  said in a
 statement  posted on its website yesterday. Five alternative-
energy vehicles were included.  The 2012 vehicle-purchase list indicates foreign brands
such as  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes Benz and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi,
that have been traditionally among those selected by the
government, are out of favor to their local competitors. The
ministry’s statement didn’t specify whether the list covers
vehicles used by all government bodies, including those at
senior levels.  China issued  rules  in November on vehicle procurement by
government and Communist Party agencies to better regulate
official car purchases and increase transparency of the
procedure. The government said it’s also part of its efforts to
cut administrative costs, save energy and reduce pollution.  Vehicles used for official purposes, such as tax collection
and criminal investigation, must not have an engine size of
above 1.8 liters and cost no more than 180,000 yuan ($28,571),
according to the rules. Manufacturers must have spent no less
than 3 percent of their core revenue on research and development
in the past two years, the rules say.  --Victoria Ruan with assistance from Tian Ying. Editors:  Mike Harrison , Gavin Serkin  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
