Cement prices in  Saudi Arabia ’s
western region have more than doubled to as much as 30 riyals
($8) a bag,  Al-Hayat  reported, citing Khalaf Al-Otaibi, chairman
of the building and construction panel at the Jeddah Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.  Al-Otaibi, who didn’t say how fast prices have climbed,
said some builders budgeted for prices of 12 riyals and are
being challenged, according to Al-Hayat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
