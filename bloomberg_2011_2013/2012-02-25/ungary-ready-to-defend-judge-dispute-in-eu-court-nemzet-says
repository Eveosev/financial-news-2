Hungary isnâ€™t prepared for any
further compromise in a dispute with the European Union on age
limits for judges, one of the disagreements obstructing talks on
an international bailout,  Magyar Nemzet  reported.  Hungary would rather go to the  European Court  of Justice to
defend its position than make further concessions to the
European Commission, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
government official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
