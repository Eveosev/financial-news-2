Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  is seeking
to buy about 20 branches from Spanish saving banks being
restructured, Expansion said citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter.  The operations may allow the Portuguese lender to almost
double its network of branches in  Spain  where it currently has
25 offices, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
