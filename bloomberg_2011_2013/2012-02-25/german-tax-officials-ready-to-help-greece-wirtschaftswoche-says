More than 160 German tax officials
have offered to help  Greece  modernize its revenue collection,
 Wirtschaftswoche  reported, citing an interview with Deputy
Finance Minister Hans Bernhard Beus.  Greeks with the biggest tax liability owe the government 63
billion euros ($84.7 billion), the German magazine said today,
citing a confidential European Commission study. The commission
and the  International Monetary Fund  will start projects to
overhaul Greeceâ€™s tax system in the next few weeks,
Wirtschaftswoche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
