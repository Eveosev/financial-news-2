Abdurabu Mansur Hadi was sworn as
Yemen’s president today after winning elections that officially
ended the 33-year rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh, the fourth Arab
leader to succumb to uprisings in the region over the last year.  The government in Yemen “has been backed by popular
legitimacy that no one can doubt,” he said during his speech
aired by Al-Jazeera television. Hadi was the only presidential
candidate in the Feb. 21 elections, which were part of a Gulf-
brokered accord to end protests in the country.  Saleh agreed to relinquish power in the Arab world’s
poorest country after months of protests inspired by the revolts
that forced out leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and  Libya .  Saleh returned to Yemen last night from the U.S., where he
received medical treatment, and went to his residence, state
television reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
