U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  ruled out any further fuel tax cuts in next
month’s budget after providing more than 4 billion pounds ($6.35
billion) of support, the  Financial Times  reported, citing aides.  Edmund King, president of The Automobile Association lobby
group, in a letter asked Osborne to ditch a planned inflation-
linked rise in August and a policy of such increases altogether,
the Financial Times said.  “The private car is, for most people, a necessity, not a
luxury,” King wrote, as cited in the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
