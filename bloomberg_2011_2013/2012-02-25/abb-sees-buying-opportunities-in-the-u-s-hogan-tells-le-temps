ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  may make more acquisitions
in the U.S. following its agreement to buy  Thomas & Betts Corp. (TNB) ,
Chief Executive Officer Joe Hogan told  Le Temps .  As the world’s biggest economy, the U.S. offers more buying
opportunities, Hogan told the Swiss newspaper in an interview
published today. ABB doesn’t envisage any purchase near the size
of the Thomas & Betts acquisition, Hogan was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
