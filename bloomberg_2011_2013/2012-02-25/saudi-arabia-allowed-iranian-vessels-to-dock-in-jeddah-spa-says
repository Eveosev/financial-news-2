Saudi Arabia  allowed Iranian navy
ships to dock at its port in Jeddah earlier this month, the
Saudi Press Agency reported, citing an unidentified official
with the kingdom’s defense ministry.  The ships docked at the port from Feb. 1 to 7 as a
“training tour for students of the Iranian navy in the
framework of friendly visits,” the  official news service  said.  Iranian warships sailed through the  Suez Canal  earlier this
month. Iranian vessels also sailed into the Mediterranean Sea a
year ago in a move that Israel said was a provocation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
