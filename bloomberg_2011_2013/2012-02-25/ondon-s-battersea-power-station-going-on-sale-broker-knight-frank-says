Battersea Power Station, the London
landmark slated for a 5 billion-pound ($7.9 billion)
redevelopment, will be offered for sale on the open market for
the first time,  Knight Frank  LLP said.  “As one of the U.K.’s most recognizable landmarks, Knight
Frank anticipates considerable interest” in the site, Stephan Miles-Brown, head of residential development, said in a
statement yesterday on the property broker’s website.  The sale of the Grade II-listed building on the south bank
of the  River Thames  will be advertised globally starting next
week, Knight Frank said.  The 39-acre (16-hectare) site was valued at 500 million
pounds, developer and controlling shareholder  Real Estate
Opportunities Plc (REO)  said on Oct. 26. REO was given planning
consent in 2010 to redevelop the site, which is 2.2 miles (3.5
kilometers) by car from the Houses of Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
