British police have bailed two men
arrested in connection with an investigation into computer
hacking.  The men, aged 50 and 51, were detained in Hertfordshire and
Surrey, in southern  England , yesterday, the Metropolitan Police
said in an e-mailed statement. They were questioned under the
Computer Misuse Act 1990 and the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000.  The police said the arrests, part of Operation Tuleta, were
not directly linked to any news organisation or the activities
of journalists.  Both men were released on bail until dates in June and
July, the Met said in a statement today.  Tuleta is investigating allegations regarding breach of
privacy that fall outside the remit of Operation Weeting, the
forceâ€™s phone-hacking probe, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
