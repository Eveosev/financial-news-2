Austria’s Benjamin Raich won today’s
men’s super-G in  Switzerland  for his first World Cup skiing
victory in more than two years and 36th of his career.  Raich finished in 1 minute, 34.57 seconds in Crans-Montana
for his first win since taking a super-combined race in November
2009.  France ’s Adrian Theaux was second, 0.24 seconds behind,
with Switzerland’s Didier Cuche a further 0.12 back in third.  Cuche pulled within seven points of Norway’s Askel Lund
Svindal, who was ninth today, in the super-G season standings.  Today’s women’s downhill in Bansko, Bulgaria, was canceled
because of high winds and won’t be rescheduled. Lindsay Vonn of
the U.S. last week clinched her fifth straight World Cup donhill
title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
