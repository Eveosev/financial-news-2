Atlantia SpA (ATL)  and transport company
Gavio SpA signed an agreement on shifting the Italian toll-road
operator’s stake in builder  Impregilo SpA (IPG) ,  Milano Finanza 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Gavio will get Atlantia’s holding in IGLI, the biggest
investor in Impregilo, the weekly newspaper said, adding that
the transfer may be completed by March 10. The asset-swap
agreement also includes the transfer in a couple of months of
Autostrade Sudamerica, which controls Chile’s Autopista do
Pacifico motorway, to Rome-based Atlantia, Milano Finanza
reported.  An option for Gavio to buy control of Atlantia’s Turin-
Savona toll road is also included in the agreement, Milano
Finanza said.  Mobile-phone calls and a voicemail message to spokesmen for
Atlantia seeking comment outside of business hours weren’t
immediately returned, and there was no answer at the offices of
 Autostrada Torino-Milano SpA (AT) , a Gavio unit that the newspaper
said is involved in the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
