barrels per day during the week ending September 6, 2013,
roughly the same as the previous weekâ€™s average. Refineries
operated at 92.5 percent of their operable capacity last week.
Gasoline production was flat compared to the previous week,
averaging 9.1 million barrels per day. Distillate fuel
production was also unchanged last week, averaging about 5.0
million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged about 8.0 million barrels per
day last week, down by 238 thousand barrels per day from the
previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports
averaged over 8.1 million barrels per day. Total motor gasoline
imports (including both finished gasoline and gasoline blending
components) last week averaged 401 thousand barrels per day.
Distillate fuel imports averaged 99 thousand barrels per day
last week.  U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the
