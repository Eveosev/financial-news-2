Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s supervisory
board is considering extending co-Chief Executive Officer
 Juergen Fitschen ’s contract, according to a person briefed on
the matter.  The company may issue a statement as soon as today, said
the person, who asked not to be identified as the matter isn’t
public. A Deutsche Bank official declined to comment.  The chairman’s committee of the supervisory board agreed
yesterday to seek an extension of Fitschen’s contract by two
years to mid-2017, Die Welt reported earlier today, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. The committee will
put the proposal to the supervisory board, the newspaper said.  Fitschen, 65, who leads Deutsche Bank’s operations in
 Germany , became CEO together with Anshu Jain, 50, the former
head of the company’s corporate and investment bank, in June of
last year. The pairing is an attempt to balance Deutsche Bank’s
dual roles: A global trading house that competes with the likes
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and gets most of its revenue abroad,
and a German institution with longstanding ties to the nation’s
companies and political establishment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
