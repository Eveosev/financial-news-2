Kamada Ltd. (KMDA) , the maker of
treatments for hereditary  lung disease , climbed to a record on
speculation that results of clinical trials will boost profits.  The Nes Ziona, Israel-based company rose 1.5 percent to
49.08 shekels, or about $13.79, at 10:50 a.m. in  Tel Aviv . The
 New York  shares closed at $13.66 yesterday, a 35 percent advance
since their May 31 offering, with trading volume almost three
times the three-month daily average.  Kamada announced last year an agreement with Chiesi
Farmaceutici SpA for the exclusive distribution of the inhaled
version of its medicine for a genetic condition called Alpha-1
Antitrypsin deficiency that can lead to liver and lung damage.
The company expects to initiate a U.S. phase 2 study of an
inhaled treatment in the second half of 2013 and to report the
results of a European trial by early 2014, it said in an Aug. 1
statement. Adjusted net income will double to $5.9 million in
2013 and leap another 165 percent in 2014, according to the
average of four analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Should they bring the inhalable version of Antitrypsin to
the market, they would capture a significant share,” Raj Denhoy, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York, said by phone
yesterday. “If the trial is successful, and I think there is a
pretty good chance for it to be a success, Kamada will have the
only inhalable version of the drug on the market. It’s a lot
easier to consume the inhalable version.”  Jefferies estimates the market for the Antitrypsin drug at
$800 million a year globally, including $600 million in the U.S.  Kamada said the Chiesi agreement could bring in $60 million
if regulatory conditions and sales targets are met and estimates
sales potential of “hundreds of millions of dollars.” The
company already sells an intravenous version of the AAT
treatment with  Baxter International Inc. (BAX)   The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Israeli stocks in the U.S. rose for a third day, adding 0.2
percent to a one-month high of 97.61 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
