Aluminum buyers in  Japan ,  Asia ’s
biggest importer, won the first cut in nine months on fees they
pay to producers as London Metal Exchange proposals to ease the
backlog at warehouses pushed down global premiums.  The fee for the three months starting in October fell to
$245 a metric ton over the price for immediate delivery on the
LME from $249 to $251 this quarter, said three executives
involved in the negotiations. They asked not to be identified as
the talks are private.  The LME has proposed obliging warehouses where waits extend
for 100 days or more to let more metal out than they take in.
Premiums to obtain metal will drop 60 percent to about $100 as a
result of the rules the bourse is expected to approve in
October, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The global market is
heading for an eighth straight year of surplus in 2014, says
 Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  Demand in Japan shows signs of recovery on Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic stimulus.  “Consumers are in a hurry to buy homes and vehicles before
the government raises  sales tax , supporting metal demand from
manufacturers,” said Koji Iida, head of statistics at the Japan
Aluminium Association. Abe will weigh business confidence data
Oct. 1 before deciding whether to go ahead with a plan to raise
the tax to 8 percent in April from 5 percent.  Aluminum for delivery in three months gained 0.3 percent to
$1,802 a ton on the London Metal Exchange at 12:37 p.m. Tokyo
time. The contract slid to $1,758 on June 27, the lowest level
since July 2009, and lost 13 percent this year.  Rates Drop  Rates to obtain aluminum tumbled the most in 20 months in
 Europe  in July and retreated from a record in the U.S. as
lawmakers and regulators scrutinized long waiting times to
withdraw metal from warehouses.  The decline of about 2 percent in Japan’s quarterly fee is
less than the drop in the U.S., where the premium slid to 11
cents a pound last month from 13 cents in June.  Premiums in Japan more than doubled in 2012 and reached a
record $255 in the fourth quarter. They slid to $240 to $245 in
the three months through March. Lower premiums would curb costs
for  Furukawa-Sky Aluminum Corp. (5741) , the largest mill. Company
spokesman Ryu Sawachi declined to comment on fees.  Shipments of rolled-aluminum products by Japanese
fabricators to domestic and overseas markets expanded 4.3
percent in July, the first increase in nine months, led by the
 construction industry , the largest user.  The global surplus will widen to 994,000 tons next year
from 883,000 tons in 2013, according to Sumitomo, Japan’s
fourth-largest trading company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
