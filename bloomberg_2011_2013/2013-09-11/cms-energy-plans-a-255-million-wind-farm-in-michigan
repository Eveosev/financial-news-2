CMS Energy Corp. (CMS)  plans to build a
$255 million wind farm in  Michigan  as part of a plan to meet the
state’s renewable-energy goals.  CMS-unit Consumers Energy, Michigan’s largest utility,
hired Barton Marlow Co. to design and construct the 105-megawatt
Cross Winds Energy Park in Tuscola County, about 100 miles (160
kilometers) north of Detroit, the Jackson, Michigan-based
company said today in a statement.  Construction will begin this year, which may qualify the
project for federal tax credits that finance a premium for the
wind farm’s output over a decade. The federal incentive expires
at the end of 2013.  Under state law, Consumers Energy must get 10 percent of
its power from renewable sources by 2015. The utility completed
the 100.8-megawatt Lake Winds wind farm last year.  The turbine manufacturer wasn’t named in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
