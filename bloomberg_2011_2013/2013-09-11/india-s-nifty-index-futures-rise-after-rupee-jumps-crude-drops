Indian stock-index futures gained
after the rupee capped its biggest four-day gain in at least 40
years and  oil prices  declined.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for September delivery rose 0.2
percent to 5,921.5 at 9:53 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX

2.2 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since June 20.  The rupee rose 6.1 percent in the past four days, the
biggest gain since at least 1973, as U.S. jobs data that fell
short of estimates tempered concern the  Federal Reserve  will cut
stimulus this month. Falling crude prices and a strengthening
currency cut import costs for a nation that buys about 80
percent of its crude from overseas. Oil imports jumped 18
percent from a year earlier to $15.1 billion in August,
according to data from the Trade Ministry yesterday.  “There is a sense of euphoria triggered by the rupee again
and the drop in crude oil prices,”  Gajendra Nagpal , chief
executive officer at New Delhi-based Unicon Financial
Intermediaries Ltd., said by phone.  Trade Data  The Indian gauge’s 30-day volatility index, a measure of
price swings, rose to 30.4 yesterday, the highest level since

from the Trade Ministry yesterday. Imports shrank 0.7 percent to
$37.1 billion and exports jumped 13 percent to $26.1 billion.  The Sensex and the rupee have also surged in the past week
after new  Reserve Bank of India  Governor Raghuram Rajan
announced plans to boost the financial sector and support the
rupee, which has dropped 16 percent this year.  Overseas investors  bought a net $194 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 6, data from the regulator showed yesterday.

the week ended May 31.  Foreign investors have bought a net $11.6 billion of  Indian (SENSEX) 
shares this year, the second-highest among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg. They pulled $3.7 billion from local
equities in the three months to Aug. 31 as capital fled  emerging
markets  amid prospects of the Federal Reserve paring its record
stimulus.  The Sensex has increased 2.9 percent this year in local
currency terms and is  valued  at 14.2 times projected 12-month
earnings. It has lost 12 percent this year in dollar terms. The
