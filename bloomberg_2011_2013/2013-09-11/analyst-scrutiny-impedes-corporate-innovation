Companies covered by larger numbers of analysts generate  fewer  patents, and the patents they produce have  lower impact  than those from other firms, according to an analysis by Jie (Jack) He of the University of Georgia and Xuan Tian of Indiana University. The findings suggest that analysts exert so much pressure on managers to meet short-term financial goals that they impede companies' investment in long-term projects, the researchers say.
