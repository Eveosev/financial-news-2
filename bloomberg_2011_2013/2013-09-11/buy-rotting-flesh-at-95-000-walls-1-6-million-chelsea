Six years after Sol LeWitt’s death, one of his largest murals has been recreated at  Paula Cooper gallery  in Chelsea.  “Wall Drawing #564: Complex forms with color ink washes superimposed” was originally made for the Venice Biennale in 1988 and hasn’t been exhibited since. It’s a feast for the eyes.  Nine artist assistants worked for more than a month to fashion the spectacular piece that spans three walls from floor to ceiling.  The work consists of large and small rectangles separated by black lines. Each cell has a solid background and an irregular, central mass composed of numerous colored triangles and trapezoids. The geometric assemblages seem to float in space. The effect is at once meditative and kaleidoscopic.  “My very first show in 1968 was Sol’s very first wall drawing,” said veteran art dealer Paula Cooper. “At the end of the exhibition I asked Sol, ‘What do I do now?’ He said, ‘Oh, just paint it out.’”  The price is $1.6 million. The show runs through Oct. 12 at 534 W. 21st St.; +1-212-255-1105;  http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/   Matthew Day Jackson  In 2010 a painting by little-known Matthew Day Jackson surged to $938,426 at Christie’s in  London . The artist has been on a roll ever since.  That year he joined Hauser & Wirth, an international heavyweight with galleries in  New York , London and Zurich. His work scaled up and prices more than tripled. He teaches at the New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.  “Something Ancient, Something New, Something Stolen, Something Blue,” the artist’s first New York show with Hauser & Wirth, fills its cavernous Chelsea space with bulky works that feel morbid and produced.  There’s an apocalyptic 10-by-15-foot landscape depicting charred Yosemite Valley and made with steel, rope and wood; a portrait of the artist wrapped like a mummy and presumably dead at 39; skeletons in glass vitrines.  As a parting gift, a severed, rotting arm salutes from high up on the wall.  Prices range from $95,000 to $750,000. The exhibition runs through Oct. 19 at 511 W. 18th St.; +1-212-790-3900;  http://www.hauserwirth.com .  David Noonan  It’s been six years since David Noonan’s last solo show in New York, and his new exhibition at  Foxy Production  doesn’t disappoint.  The London-based Australian artist’s current work centers on the imagery of  Japan ’s Butoh performers, whose naked, gaunt bodies appear in layered, richly textured silkscreened collages on linen.  Done in various shades of gray, the images are poetic and provocative. One depicts two women sitting in lotus pose while wearing nothing but wigs and dildos. Another shows a nude male torso, ribs protruding and limbs stretched out.  The human shapes are surrounded by swatches of Japanese boro fabrics, whose stripes and patterns obscure and bring into focus parts of the composition, adding softness, depth and sensuality.  Prices range from $12,000 to $70,000. The show runs through Oct. 26 at 623 W. 27th St.; +1-212-239-2758;  http://www.foxyproduction.com   Muse highlights include  Ryan Sutton  on dining,  Joe Mysak  on  books .
