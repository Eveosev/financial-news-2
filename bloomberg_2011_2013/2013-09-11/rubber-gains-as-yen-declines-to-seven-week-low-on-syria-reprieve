Rubber climbed as the yen weakened
to the lowest level in seven weeks after the U.S. called for a
pause in authorizing military strikes on Syria, boosting demand
for the commodities priced in the Japanese currency.  The contract for February delivery gained as much as 1.1
percent to 285.5 yen a kilogram ($2,844 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, before trading at 285 yen at 11:55
a.m. local time. The gain pared losses to 5.9 percent this year.  The yen dropped against the dollar after U.S. President
 Barack Obama  asked Congress to delay a vote on military action
against Syria, and a worldwide equity rally eroded demand for
Japan’s currency as a haven. The yen fell 1.7 percent in the
past week, the biggest loss among 10 developed market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes.  “A weakening yen helped boost gains in commodities in
Japan,” Gu Jiong, an analyst at broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said
by phone from Tokyo.  Thailand , the world’s largest rubber producer and exporter,
will double the subsidy paid to farmers to 21.2 billion baht
($659 million) after they threatened to step up protests across
the nation’s key plantation areas, Deputy Government Spokesman
Chalitrat Chandrubeksa said yesterday. The subsidy is equivalent
to a rubber price of 12 baht per kilogram, according to the
government.  Thai rubber free-on-board fell 1.4 percent to 86.15 baht  a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand. The contract for January delivery in  Shanghai  rose
0.8 percent to 20,710  yuan  ($3,384) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
