Coffee futures gained the most in
eight months on speculation that dry weather will curb 2014
output in Brazil, the world’s largest producer. Cocoa also rose,
while orange juice, sugar and cotton slid.  Flowers that bloomed on coffee trees during last week’s
rain may be damaged by dryness this week in southern Zona da
Mata, before precipitation resumes by Sept. 16,  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based World Weather Inc. said in a report yesterday. The
area is located in  Minas Gerais , the biggest producing  state .
Prices slumped 16 percent this year on abundant global supply,
including a  bumper crop  from the South American nation.  “There is some concern about dry weather in Brazil causing
damage to trees that have already flowered,” Sterling Smith, a
futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said by e-mail.  Arabica-coffee for December delivery jumped 3.6 percent to
settle at $1.208 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Jan. 2.
Prices earlier reached $1.211, the highest since Aug. 20.  In the week ended Sept. 3, money managers and other large
speculators cut their net-short position, or bearish bets, by
1.3 percent to 22,717 futures and options, government data show.  This week,  Brazil ’s crop forecasting agency, called Conab,
trimmed its estimate for 2013 output by 2.3 percent from a May
projection and said that next year’s harvest may not match the
record reaped in 2012, in part because farmers cut investments.
In 2013-2014, world production will exceed demand for the fourth
straight year, the U.S. government projects.  Upside ‘Limited’  “The reduced crop estimate is also supporting prices,”
John Caruso, a senior commodities broker at RJO Futures in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The upside will be
limited because global supplies remain ample.”  Cocoa futures for delivery in December rose less than 0.1
percent to $2,571 a metric ton, after reaching $2,599, the
highest for a most-active contract in almost a year.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery tumbled 1.4
percent to $1.3505 a pound.  Hurricane Humberto, the first of the season in the
Atlantic, is expected to turn north, away from orange groves in
 Florida , on track to sweep by  Nova Scotia  and strike
Newfoundland later this week, according to Environment  Canada .
Florida is the world’s largest citrus grower after Brazil.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery fell 0.1 percent to
17.17 cents a pound on ICE, snapping a four-session rally.
Cotton futures for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
84.35 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
