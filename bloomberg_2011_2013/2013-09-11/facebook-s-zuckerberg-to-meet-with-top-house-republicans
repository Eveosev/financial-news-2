Facebook Inc. (FB)  founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has been pushing for a revision of U.S.
immigration law, plans to meet with the top four Republicans in
the House next week in Washington.  The meeting, scheduled for Sept. 19, will include House
Speaker  John Boehner  of Ohio, Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  of
Virginia, Whip  Kevin McCarthy  and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of
Washington, the head of the Republican conference, according to
two leadership aides who weren’t authorized to speak publicly.  Topics of discussion will include a range of issues such as
Internet privacy, the economy, a revision of the tax system and
changes to immigration law, according to one of the aides.  “Mark is coming to Washington to discuss issues important
to the knowledge economy, including immigration reform,” Jodi Seth, a Facebook spokeswoman based in Washington, said in an e-mail. Seth said she couldn’t confirm any private meetings.  Zuckerberg has joined other technology companies to create
the pro-immigration advocacy group Fwd.us.  While the Senate passed its comprehensive immigration plan
on June 27, the House has yet to take up related legislation.
House leaders oppose the Senate’s comprehensive measure and have
decided on a bill-by-bill approach, and no votes have yet been
scheduled.  Facebook,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Microsoft Corp. face scrutiny
over what kind of information they turn over to the federal
government as part of the National Security Administration’s
surveillance programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
