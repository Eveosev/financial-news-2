New Zealand recalled blindside
flanker  Liam Messam  in one of five starting changes for this
weekend’s Rugby Championship match against South Africa as the
two top-ranked teams in the world meet in Auckland.  Messam replaces Steven Luatua, who moves to the bench, in
the back row after recovering from a calf injury. Prop Owen
Franks, hooker Dane Coles, inside center Ma’a Nonu and openside
flanker Sam Cane also start in the other changes to the lineup
from last week’s win against Argentina.  “In selecting the team, there were some tough decisions to
be made, none more so than between Liam and Steven,” All Blacks
coach  Steve Hansen  said in a statement. “But in the end we have
gone for Liam’s extra experience and physicality and we also
know that Steven will enter the contest at some stage.”  No. 8 Kieran Read will captain the top-ranked All Blacks at
Eden Park, where they are on a 30-match winning streak, in the
absence of the injured Richie McCaw.  South Africa, which leads the southern hemisphere
championship standings by a point, was the last team to avoid
defeat to New Zealand at the stadium, drawing 18-18 there in
1994. The Springboks yesterday named an unchanged 23-man squad
from last week’s 38-12 against Australia in Brisbane.  NEW ZEALAND: Israel Dagg, Ben Smith,  Conrad Smith , Ma’a
Nonu, Julian Savea, Daniel Carter, Aaron Smith, Kieran Read
(captain), Sam Cane, Liam Messam, Sam Whitelock, Brodie
Retallick, Owen Franks, Dane Coles,  Tony Woodcock .  Replacements: Keven Mealamu,  Wyatt Crockett , Charlie
Faumuina, Steven Luatua, Matt Todd, Tawera Kerr-Barlow, Beauden
Barrett, Charles Piutau.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
