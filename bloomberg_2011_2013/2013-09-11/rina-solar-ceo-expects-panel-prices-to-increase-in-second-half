Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Jifan Gao said he expects panel prices to increase in
the second half of this year after the European Union agreed to
not impose punitive tariffs on shipments from China.  “The European market will be stabilized, while  emerging
markets  will continue to grow,” Gao said in an interview while
attending a conference organized by the  World Economic Forum  in
the Chinese city of Dalian. “This year, good companies will
progress in recovery and weak ones will be phased out.”  China agreed in July to curb shipments of solar panels to
the EU to avoid tariffs, with the China New Energy Chamber of
Commerce saying the deal would allow Chinese companies to
continue exports and keep a “reasonable” share of the market.
Sales of Chinese solar panels to  Japan , the U.S. and  India 
increased in the first half as shipments declined to Europe,
which buys about half of the exports.  “The settlement of the EU investigation is not ideal but
reasonable,” Gao said today. Trina, China’s third-biggest panel
maker, last month raised its forecast for 2013 annual shipments
to 2.3-2.4 gigawatts from an earlier 2-2.1 gigawatts.  Gao also reiterated that he expects the Changzhou-based
company to return  to profit  in the second half of this year.
Trina in August reported a second-quarter net loss of $33.7
million, narrowing from $63.7 million a year earlier.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
