The real climbed to a one-month
high as eased concern that the U.S. will attack Syria and the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce monetary stimulus bolstered the
Brazilian central bank’s effort to support the currency.  The real appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.2738 per dollar at
4:16 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest level on a closing basis
since Aug. 9. The currency earlier dropped as much as 1.1
percent. Swap rates on contracts due in January 2016 declined
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 11.21 percent.  “The real is now reducing its slide against the dollar
after a flight to safety caused by Syria concern,”  Eduardo Suarez , Latin America currency strategist at Bank of  Nova
Scotia , said in a phone interview from Toronto. “And from now
until the Fed meeting, people are placing their bets as they
wait to see what will happen.”  The currency dropped to a four-year low on Aug. 21 as
concern mounted that Fed policy makers would vote at their Sept.
17-18 meeting to reduce $85 billion in monthly bond purchases
that have supported  emerging markets .  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said last night in a speech in
Washington that he had asked Congress to delay a vote on Syria
while the administration pursued a proposal that would have the
Mideast nation surrender its chemical arms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
