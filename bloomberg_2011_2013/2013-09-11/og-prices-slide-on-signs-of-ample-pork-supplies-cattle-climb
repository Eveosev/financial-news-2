first two-day slump since last month, on signs of increasing
U.S. pork supplies. Cattle prices rose.  Meatpackers processed 430,000 hogs yesterday, up 0.5
percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Pork  production  will climb 13 percent in the three months

forecasts show.  “We’re going to have ample supplies of pork in the fall,”
Lawrence Kane, a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group, said in a telephone interview from Yates City,  Illinois .
“The fourth quarter is usually a big production time frame for
hogs. The market is going to be leery of that.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.3 percent to
87.275 cents a pound at 10:51 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after dropping 0.1 percent yesterday. The last time
