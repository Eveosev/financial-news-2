British Airways is extending a
discount option for passengers traveling with hand-luggage only,
offering the service to select routes from its Heathrow hub in a
sign the carrier is embracing no-frills tactics.  Passengers on nine short-haul routes to destinations
including Amsterdam, Stockholm and Barcelona stand to reap a
discount of 20 pounds (£31.5) off the current lowest return
fares when traveling with hand-luggage only, the carrier said in
a statement today. The airline is also making the service
available for select cities from the  London  City airport.  British Airways first announced the plan in February from
London’s Gatwick airport, and the carrier said today that the
model had proven “very popular” with customers. Persuading
travelers to avoid baggage check-in on shorter routes emulates a
push by discount airlines including  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , which
charges passengers extra for each piece of luggage they hand in.  “If it proves as successful, we plan to roll it out across
the whole short-haul network in the coming months,” said Robin
Glover-Faure, British Airways’s head of short-haul.  British Airways, which is part of  International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) , will also introduce what it
called semi-flex fares between London and a selection of eight
European cities that provides last-minute free booking changes
and seat selection. The hand-luggage option becomes available
from Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
