U.S. oil  production  jumped last
week to the highest level since May 1989, cutting consumption of
foreign fuel and putting the U.S. closer to energy independence.  Drilling techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, pushed crude output up by 124,000 barrels, or 1.6
percent, to 7.745 million barrels a day in the seven days ended
Sept. 6, the Energy Information Administration said today.  Rising crude supplies from fields including North Dakota’s
Bakken shale and the Eagle Ford in Texas have helped the U.S.
become the world’s largest exporter of refined fuels including
gasoline and diesel. Texas pumped 2.575 million barrels a day in
June, according to the EIA, enough to rank it ahead of seven
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  “It’s amazing,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC, a Houston-based consulting firm, who predicted
last month that the U.S. would be pumping 7.75 million barrels a
day by the end of the year. “The state of Texas is now
producing more oil than the country of  Iran .”  Iran produced 2.56 million barrels a day in June, according
to a Bloomberg survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.
 Saudi Arabia , Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela pumped more than Texas that month.  West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, rose 17 cents,
or 0.2 percent, to settle at $107.56 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Brent futures advanced 25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $111.50 on ICE Futures  Europe  in London.  Rising Supplies  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, EIA data show. Domestic crude output will average
7.5 million barrels a day in 2013 and 8.4 million in 2014, the
EIA said yesterday in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Rising domestic supplies have curbed consumption of foreign
fuel. Net imports of crude oil and petroleum products will fall
to 5.4 million barrels a day by 2014, down from 12.5 million in
2005, the EIA, a unit of the Energy Department, said in the
report.  The abundance of crude has made the U.S. an increasingly
important refining hub. U.S. exports of distillate  fuel oil ,
largely comprised of diesel, rose to an all-time high of 1.285
million barrels a day in June, the EIA said Aug. 29.  Charters for product tankers from the U.S. Gulf Coast
reached a record of 42 last week, according to a Sept. 6 weekly
shipping report by Charles R. Weber Co., a ship broker based in
Greenwich, Connecticut. About 15 of those were bound for Europe,
also a record, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
