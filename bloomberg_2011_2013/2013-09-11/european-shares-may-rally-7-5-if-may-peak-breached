The Stoxx Europe 600 Index may
climb as much as 7.5 percent to the highest level in more than
five years if the gauge surpasses its May peak, according to
technical analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG.  The Stoxx 600 reached an intraday high of 310.08 yesterday,
testing the 311.07 level it hit on May 22, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Breaching the 307-to-311 range could push
the measure of European equities to between 330 and 333,  David Sneddon  and Christopher Hine wrote in a report today.  “A break should see a fresh bull leg into the 330/333
zone,” the analysts wrote. At 333, the Stoxx 600 would still be
below the intraday high of 400.99 reached in July 2007 and the
record of 407.56 the index hit in March 2000.  The Stoxx 600 jumped 1.3 percent yesterday, advancing to
the highest level on a closing basis since May 22, as Chinese
economic data beat estimates and the U.S. offered to defer an
attack on  Syria  if it complied with a Russian proposal to give
up chemical weapons. The gauge advanced 0.3 percent to 310.63 at
11:27 a.m. in  London  today.  Technical analysts look at price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
