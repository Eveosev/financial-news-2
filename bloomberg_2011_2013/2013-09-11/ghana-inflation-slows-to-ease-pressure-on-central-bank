Ghana ’s  inflation  slowed for the
first time in seven months in August, easing pressure on the
central bank to raise rates next week to curb price increases.  The inflation rate fell to 11.5 percent from 11.8 percent
in July, Baah Wadieh, a statistician at the Ghana Statistical
Service told reporters in Accra, the capital, today. Prices
declined 0.7 percent in the month, he said.  The  Bank of Ghana  held the  key interest rate  at 16 percent
on July 31 to help arrest the cedi’s slide, which has dropped 13
percent this year against the dollar, putting pressure on
inflation. Revenue from loans for cocoa purchases and the sale
of Eurobonds in July should boost foreign-currency reserves and
support the currency, Governor Kofi Wampah has said. The bank
will announce the monetary policy decision on Sept. 18.  “August inflation coming down reduces pressure on the
Monetary Policy Committee to increase  interest rates ,” Collins Appiah, director of asset management at NDK Asset Management
Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “The cedi is still not very
stable.”  Food inflation rose to 7.9 percent in August from 7.3
percent the month before, Wadieh said. Non-food inflation
decreased to 14.2 percent from 15.4 percent.  The cedi was unchanged at 2.18 per dollar at 2:35 p.m. in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
