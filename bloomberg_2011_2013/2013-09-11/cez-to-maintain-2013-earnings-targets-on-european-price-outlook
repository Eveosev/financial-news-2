CEZ AS will maintain its 2013
earnings forecast as falling prices for electricity and carbon
allowances neutralize gains from the sale of its Chvaletice
coal-fired plant.  Lower returns have forced the Prague-based utility to
create reserves and provisions for long-term assets, Chief
Financial Officer Martin Novak said today in an online interview
on the Patria.cz financial website. CEZ will continue to pay
dividends of 50 percent to 60 percent of net income, he said.  “We’ve decided not to increase our full-year earnings
target at this point,” Novak said. “Many of our competitors
have already been forced to write down assets in reaction to the
developments on the European market.”  CEZ said in March the sale of Chvaletice to Litvinovska
Uhelna AS for 4.12 billion koruna ($212 million) could add as
much as 2 billion koruna to full-year profit. The company now
maintains its original 2013 forecast for net income of 37.5
billion koruna and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization of 81 billion koruna.  The utility will limit operations at the new 841-megawatt
natural gas-fired station in Pocerady, Novak said. The 17
billion-koruna plant, unprofitable at current gas prices, may
affect full-year earnings, according to the executive.  CEZ aims to maintain its A-  credit rating  and expects to
have a debt-to-Ebitda  ratio  of 2.0 by the end of the year, Novak
said. Power prices will probably remain stable in the next few
years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
