Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  sold
$49 billion of bonds in eight parts in the biggest company debt
offering ever.  The second-biggest U.S. telephone  carrier  issued fixed-rate
debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years as well as
two portions of floating-rate securities, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Verizon paid a premium for the size of
its sale, selling a 10-year portion with a relative yield of 47
basis points more than investors demand to own bonds with
similar maturities and BBB ratings, according to Bloomberg data.  The deal, which is about the size of all outstanding
obligations of the  Slovak Republic , is helping to fund New York-based Verizon’s buyout of partner  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD) ’s 45
percent stake in the largest and most profitable U.S. wireless
carrier,  Verizon Wireless . The sale is more than double the
previous issuance record of $17 billion from Apple Inc. sold in
April.  Verizon sold $4.25 billion of 2.5 percent, three-year
fixed-rate notes to yield 165 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries; $4.75 billion of 3.65 percent, five-year
debt that pays a spread of 190 basis points and $4 billion of
4.5 percent, seven-year securities yielding 215 basis points
more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  The company also issued $11 billion of 5.15 percent, 10-year debt at a 225 basis-point spread; $6 billion of 6.4
percent, 20-year notes paying 250 basis points; and $15 billion
of 6.55 percent, 30-year bonds at 265, the data show.  Floating Notes  Verizon sold $2.25 billion of three-year floating-rate
notes at a spread of 153 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate and $1.75 billion of five-year
floaters at 175 basis points more than Libor, Bloomberg data
show.  The 30-year securities, the biggest corporate bond ever
issued, traded as high as 107.6 cents on the dollar as of 1:12
p.m. in  New York  from an issue price of 99.883 cents, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  The sale was managed by Barclays Plc, Bank of America
Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, Verizon said in
regulatory filings.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from
each other, was set today at 25.44 basis points. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
