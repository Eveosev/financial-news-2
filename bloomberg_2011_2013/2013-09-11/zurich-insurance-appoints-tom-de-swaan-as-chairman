Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  named Tom de Swaan chairman, replacing Josef Ackermann, who stepped down
after the suicide of Chief Financial Officer Pierre Wauthier.  Fred Kindle, 54, chairman of Exova Holdings Ltd. and former
chief executive officer of  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , was appointed vice
chairman, the Zurich-based company said in a statement today. De
Swaan, 67, took over as interim chairman after Ackermann, 65,
left Switzerland’s largest insurer on Aug. 29.  “Given they still need to find a new CFO, it’s certainly
helpful to have some continuity in the chairman’s role,” said
 Peter Eliot , a London-based analyst at Berenberg Bank with a buy
rating on Zurich Insurance’s shares.  Wauthier, who was found dead on Aug. 26 at his home near
Zug, Switzerland, mentioned Ackermann in a suicide note. The
former CEO of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  called the allegations from the
family that he bore some responsibility for the suicide
“unfounded. Zurich Insurance has since said it’s looking into
whether undue pressure was placed on the CFO.  Zurich Insurance needs to use the lessons learned ‘‘to
build a stronger future,’’ de Swaan said on Sept. 6 at a
memorial service in Zurich for the married father of two.  Ackermann is also preparing to step down as vice chairman
of the supervisory board of  Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest
engineering company, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported in
a preview of an article to be published tomorrow, without saying
where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
