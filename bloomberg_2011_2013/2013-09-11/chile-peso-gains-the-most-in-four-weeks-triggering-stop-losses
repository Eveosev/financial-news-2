Chile ’s peso gained the most in
four weeks as forecasts for a recovery in Chinese growth
bolstered the outlook for copper exports.  The currency advanced 0.8 percent to 501.88 per dollar
today, the strongest close since July 18.  China ’s  benchmark stock index  reached a three-month high
today after Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG raised their growth
forecasts for the world’s second-largest economy. China is the
biggest buyer of Chile’s main import, copper. President  Barack
Obama  asked Congress late yesterday to delay a vote on the use
of force in  Syria , helping boost demand for higher-yielding
riskier assets such as emerging-market currencies.  “There was a strong support level at 506 where we closed
yesterday, but markets opened a bit better today and that has
meant offshore accounts have been selling dollars,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “As we broke through 506, that set off stop-losses
from accounts that were long dollars.”  The peso has gained for nine of the past 11 trading
sessions. International investors cut their net short position
in the currency to a four-month low of $10.2 billion on Sept. 9,
according to central bank data published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
