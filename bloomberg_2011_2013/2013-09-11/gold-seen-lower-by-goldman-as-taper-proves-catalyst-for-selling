Gold will extend a drop into 2014
as the U.S. Federal Reserve tapers stimulus, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said, forecasting that a decision by the central bank to
start reducing bond-buying next week may spur renewed selling.  The reduction of asset purchases may be the catalyst that
pushes gold prices lower, analysts including  Jeffrey Currie  and
Damien Courvalin wrote in a report today. Goldman’s economists
expect that policy makers will curb quantitative easing at the
Sept. 17-18 meeting as the economy improves, the report said.  Gold slumped 19 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12 years
as investors sold the metal at record pace from  exchange-traded
products  on prospects for a global recovery. The Fed will pare
the $85 billion monthly bond-buying at the meeting, according to
a Bloomberg survey on Sept. 6, backing away from the stimulus
program used by the central bank to revive the largest economy.  “Gold prices will decline into 2014 on the back of an
acceleration in U.S. activity and a less accommodative monetary-policy stance,” the analysts wrote. “The September FOMC
meeting, where our economists expect a tapering of QE3, could
prove the catalyst to push  gold prices  lower.”  Gold futures on the Comex, which touched a record $1,923.70
an ounce two years ago, traded at $1,362.10 by 9:27 a.m. in  New
York . Goldman kept its three- and six-month targets at $1,300 an
ounce, while saying that the approach of the U.S. debt ceiling
may limit declines until the borrowing threshold is raised by
October. The bank’s 12-month target is $1,175.  Lower Prices  Societe Generale  SA, Citigroup Inc., ABN Amro Group NV and
Macquarie Group Ltd. are among banks predicting lower prices in
2014 as the global economy recovers and inflation fails to
accelerate. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. say
bullion may be bottoming as the rout boosts demand.  Investors sold 683.3 metric tons of gold from ETPs this
year, reducing holdings by more than $56 billion to 1,948.6
tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The assets have
dropped every month this year after peaking at 2,632.5 tons in
December.  Gold should drop to $1,200 by about the end of the year on
sales from ETPs and a reduced likelihood of a U.S. military
action against  Syria , Societe Generale said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. President  Barack Obama  said yesterday that he has
asked Congress to delay a vote authorizing a strike.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will reduce Treasury
purchases to $35 billion a month from $45 billion, while
maintaining mortgage-bond buying at $40 billion, according to
the median of 34 responses in the Bloomberg survey. That pace
was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
the program will end in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
