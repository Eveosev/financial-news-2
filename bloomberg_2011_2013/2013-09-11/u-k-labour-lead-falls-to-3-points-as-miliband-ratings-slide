The U.K. opposition  Labour Party ’s
lead over Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservatives has
narrowed to 3 percentage points from 10 points, according to an
Ipsos MORI poll published today.  Labour is on 37 percent among those “absolutely certain to
vote” versus 40 percent a month ago, while the Conservatives
are on 34 percent compared with 30 percent, the  survey  of 1,000
adults found.  When asked if they were satisfied with the way Labour
leader Ed Miliband is “doing his job as leader of the Labour
Party,” 24 percent said they were and 60 percent said they were
dissatisfied. When asked how Cameron is doing as prime minister,
56 percent were dissatisfied and 36 percent were satisfied.  “ Ed Miliband ’s satisfaction ratings have fallen from 40
percent at the end of last year,” Ipsos MORI’s head of
political research, Gideon Skinner, said in an  analysis  posted
on the polling company’s website. “David Cameron maintains his
lead on key prime ministerial qualities on being capable and
good in a crisis, although remains vulnerable on being seen as
out of touch.”  The poll found that 70 percent think Cameron is “out of
touch with ordinary people,” compared with 49 percent for
Miliband. Cameron was rated “good in a crisis” by 47 percent.
Only 20 percent said the same of Miliband.  The poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 7-9. No margin of
error was given.  A  YouGov Plc (YOU)   poll  of 1,579 voters for the Sun newspaper on
Sept. 9 and Sept. 10 published today had Labour on 39 percent,
the Conservatives on 33 percent and the Liberal Democrats on 9
percent. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
