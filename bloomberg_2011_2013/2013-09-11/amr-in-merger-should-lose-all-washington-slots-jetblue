AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines
should have to cede the equivalent of all its flights at
Washington’s Reagan National Airport if the planned merger with
 US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  goes forward,  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) ’s
chief executive officer said.  US Airways has 55 percent of flights at the airport near
the city’s downtown, and no carrier should be allowed to exceed
that figure, Dave Barger said today in an interview in
Washington.  “That should be the ceiling,” Barger said. “We feel very
strongly.”  The U.S.  Justice Department  has sued to block the merger as
anti-competitive, saying a combined carrier would control 69
percent of flights at the airport, where capacity is restricted
by U.S. regulators.  US Airways  and American executives have said that there is
enough competition in the region because travelers can use two
other airports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
