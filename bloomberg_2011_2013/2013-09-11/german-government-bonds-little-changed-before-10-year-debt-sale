French and Belgian bonds led gains
in European  government securities  amid speculation the four-month slide in the region’s fixed-income markets is almost over.  Yields on  France ’s 10-year securities fell from the highest
in more than a year as President  Francois Hollande ’s minsters
pledged less spending in 2014 as deficit cuts slow.  Germany ’s
 five-year  note yield dropped after rising to the highest since
December 2011 last week. Italy’s 10-year bonds fluctuated
between gains and losses as the nation sold 11.5 billion euros
($15.3 billion) of bills today, while similar-maturity Spanish
 debt  advanced for a second day.  “It’s a day for consolidation with slightly higher
levels,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy
at Societe General SA in Paris. “We see the overall trend
continuing. The trend is risk-on, backed by geopolitics, better
growth data and politicians in  Europe  keeping a steady ship.”  France’s 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.59 percent at 5 p.m.  London  time after
reaching 2.65 percent yesterday, the  most  since July 2012. The
1.75 percent bond maturing in May 2023 rose 0.36, or 3.60 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 92.90.  The rate on  Belgium ’s 10-year debt slid five basis points
to 2.86 percent, while Austria’s dropped five basis points to
2.42 percent.  Even as the pace of France’s deficit-reduction slows, 15
billion euros of the 18 billion-euro narrowing of the budget gap
will come from spending cuts, ministers told journalists in
Paris today.  Budget Deficit  France’s budget shortfall will be 4.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 3.6 percent in 2014, Finance
Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said. The plans rely on gross domestic
product growth of 0.1 percent this year and 0.9 percent in 2014,
he added.  Germany sold 4.08 billion euros of 2 percent bunds due in
August 2023 at an average yield of 2.06 percent, the  highest 
since October 2011, compared with 1.8 percent at the previous
sale on Aug. 14. Investors bid for 1.29 times the amount of
securities allotted, down from 1.33 times last month and the
 lowest  since February.  The yield on Germany’s 1.5 percent bund maturing in May
2023 fell two basis points to 2 percent. The rate reached 2.05
percent on Sept. 6, the highest for a 10-year benchmark since
March 21, 2012.  Germany’s five-year note yield fell three basis points to
1.05 percent after climbing to 1.12 percent on Sept. 5, the most
since Dec. 7, 2011.  ‘Psychological Levels’  “As we look around some key psychological levels, the
markets may not be ready to push away from these levels such as
2 percent in the bund and 1 percent in the five-year,” said
 Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “There may be a
reluctance to move away into a new trading range at this moment.
There are event risks ahead.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yields rose above those of  Spain  for
the first time in 18 months yesterday amid speculation a vote on
whether to expel  Silvio Berlusconi  from Italy’s Senate will
destabilize the coalition government. The delayed vote may occur
on Oct. 15, an Italian Senator told reporters in  Rome  today.  Italy auctioned 8.5 billion euros of one-year bills at an
average yield of 1.34 percent versus 1.05 percent at a previous
sale on Aug. 12. The nation also sold 3 billion euros of three-month bills.  “We saw the impact of political instability on today’s
auction,” Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said today at the
Senate in Rome.  Italian Auctions  Italy  returns to the market tomorrow with the sale of as
much as 5.5 billion euros of bonds due in 2016 and 2028, as well
as floating-rate notes maturing in 2018.  Italy’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.53 percent.
The rate on Spain’s 10-year bond dropped three basis points to
4.49 percent.  The additional yield, or  spread , investors demand to hold
Spanish five-year notes instead of similar-maturity German
securities was at 236 basis points, the least since July 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on closing prices.  Volatility on French bonds was the highest in the euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Austria and Belgium,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  French bonds lost 2.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
dropped 3 percent, while Italy’s returned 3 percent and Spain’s
earned 7.8 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
