Stanley Druckenmiller , who boasts
one of the hedge-fund industry’s best long-term track records of
the past three decades, says the government must address
entitlement spending.  “This is the first generation where a 30-year-old’s net
worth is less than his parents’,” Druckenmiller said today on
Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” with  Erik Schatzker  and
Stephanie Ruhle. “If you look at the older people, their net
worth has doubled.”  The increase in senior’s wealth over the past 30 years has
come from an increase in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid
spending that has grown from 28 percent of government outlays to
72 percent today.  Druckenmiller decided to stop managing client money in 2010
after three decades in the business, including more than 10
years as chief strategist for billionaire  George Soros . From
1986 through 2010, he produced average annual returns of 30
percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
