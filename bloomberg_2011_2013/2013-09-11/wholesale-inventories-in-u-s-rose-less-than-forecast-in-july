Inventories at U.S. wholesalers
rose less than forecast in July as demand cooled.  The 0.1 percent increase in  the value  of unsold goods was
the first in four months and followed a 0.2 percent drop in
June, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. The
 median forecast  in a Bloomberg survey of 26 economists called
for a 0.3 percent gain. Sales also rose 0.1 percent after a 0.4
percent advance.  Wholesalers had enough goods on hand to last 1.17 months at
the current sales pace, matching June as the least since April
2012. With leaner inventories, a pickup in demand would
encourage factories to boost production.  Estimates for wholesale inventories in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from a 0.6 percent decrease to a 0.5 percent advance. The
gain broke a series of three straight declines, the longest such
stretch since the 13 months ended in September 2009.
Distributors’ sales were projected to rise 0.5 percent, the
survey median showed.  Wholesalers’ stockpiles of durable goods -- those meant to
last three years or more -- increased in July as sales dropped.
Inventories of imported automobiles increased 0.4 percent as
purchases fell 3.1 percent.  Stockpiles of furniture, lumber, machinery, petroleum
products and clothing also increased.  The value of unsold non-durable goods fell 0.8 percent and
purchases rose 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
