Treasuries have mostly priced in
the slowing of Federal Reserve asset purchases and 10-year
 yields  will end the year near 3 percent, according to
 AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) , which oversees $475 billion.  The Fed is forecast to slow monthly buying to $75 billion
from the current $85 billion pace at its Sept. 17-18 meeting,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
10-year yield increased 48 basis points since June 30 to 2.97
percent today after touching a two-year high of 3.01 percent on
Sept. 6.  “A U.S. 10-year around 3 percent, which is kind of where
we are right now and close to nominal growth in the States, we
think that’s probably where we should be,” said Alison Martier,
a senior  money manager  at AllianceBernstein, at a briefing in
Sydney. “In no way, shape or form do we think we’re in a
rapidly-rising interest-rate cycle due to inflation pressures.”  Treasury 10-year yields will end this year at about 3
percent and end next year between 3.5 percent to 4 percent,
Martier said. The rate will be at 2.79 percent by Dec. 31 and
3.21 percent by the end of 2014, according Bloomberg surveys of
banks and securities companies, with the most recent predictions
given the heaviest weightings.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues will reduce
monthly Treasury purchases to $35 billion from $45 billion at
next week’s meeting and maintain mortgage-bond buying at $40
billion, according to the median forecast in a Sept. 6 Bloomberg
survey. The  Federal Open Market Committee  has pledged to keep
the benchmark rate near zero at least as long as unemployment
exceeds 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is no more
than 2.5 percent.  The central bank won’t get to the point where they
“outright sell” their  assets holdings  and its benchmark rate
will probably remain close to zero through most of 2015, Martier
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
