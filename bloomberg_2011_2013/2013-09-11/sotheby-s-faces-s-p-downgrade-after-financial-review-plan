Sotheby’s (BID)  had its debt put on
review for a possible downgrade by  Standard & Poor’s  after the
auction house said it’s reassessing its capital allocation and
financial policies.  That Sotheby’s is considering using “incremental debt” to
fund some operations or that it may sell real estate “may cause
us to revise our assessment of the company’s financial or
business risk profile,” S&P said in a release.  S&P’s current rating for Sotheby’s senior unsecured notes
is BB+, which is below investment grade but the highest level of
speculative grade.  The auction house, under pressure from investor  Daniel Loeb 
to improve its returns, said in an e-mailed release today that
its review of financial policies will be ready early next year.  The company continues to consider buying back shares and
increasing dividends, it said.  Loeb’s Third Point LLC took a 5.7 percent stake, according
to an Aug. 26 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The hedge-fund company “intends to engage in a
dialogue with members of the board or management” that may
relate “to potential changes of strategy and leadership,” the
filing said.  The shares are up 44 percent this year, and closed up 94
cents to $48.34 in  New York . They remain below their high of
$57.64, set in October 2007.  Other activists with an eye on Sotheby’s include Trian Fund
Management LP, the firm run by activist investor  Nelson Peltz ,
with a 3 percent stake, and Marcato Capital Management LLC, with
more than a 6 percent stake accumulated in options and shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
