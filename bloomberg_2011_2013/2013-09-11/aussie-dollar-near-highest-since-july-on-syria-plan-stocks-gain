Australia ’s dollar traded 0.2
percent from its highest level since July as optimism that  Syria 
may avoid U.S. air strikes and gains in global stocks boosted
risk appetite.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said a Russian proposal for
Syria to turn over its chemical weapons to international
supervision was a “potentially positive development,” saying
that if such plan were to come true, the U.S. would hold off on
attacking Syria. Australian bonds fell, sending the benchmark
10-year yield to the highest since March 2012.  “If the possibility of strikes against Syria continues to
ease, that’s going to be positive for risk appetite and positive
for the Australian dollar and kiwi dollar,” said Janu Chan, an
economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “But beyond this
week, it would be limited on how much the Aussie could rise from
here.”  Australia’s dollar slid 0.1 percent to 92.99 U.S. cents at
10:05 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it reached 93.19, a
level unseen since July 24. The currency was little changed at
93.26 yen from 93.48 yesterday, when it jumped 1.7 percent. It
fetched NZ$1.1544.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 80.56 U.S. cents
from yesterday, when it touched 80.76, the strongest since Aug.
19. The kiwi dollar declined 0.2 percent to 80.87 yen.  The  yield  on Australia’s benchmark 10-year bond gained four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.17 percent, after
reaching 4.18 percent, the most since March 2012.  The MSCI World Index of shares rose 0.9 percent yesterday.  Consumer Sentiment  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute will release
their gauge of Australian  consumer confidence  for September at
10:30 a.m. in Sydney today. The gauge rose 3.5 percent last
month to 105.7, the highest since March.  National Australia Bank Ltd.’s index of business confidence
jumped to a reading of 6 in August from minus 3 the previous
month, the highest since May 2011, the bank said yesterday,
based on a survey of more than 600 companies taken Aug. 20 to
Sept. 3.  “Yesterday’s business confidence data was encouraging,”
said St. George’s Chan. “If consumer confidence surprises on
the upside today, there’s a possibility that the Aussie could
track higher, but in the medium term we see more downside risk
for the currency.”  The  Reserve Bank  of  New Zealand  meets tomorrow, and all 15
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News   expect  policy makers to
keep rates unchanged at 2.5 percent. The nation’s two-year swap
rate, a fixed payment made to receive a floating rate, was
unchanged at 3.51 percent.  -- Editors: Naoto Hosoda, Jonathan Annells  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
