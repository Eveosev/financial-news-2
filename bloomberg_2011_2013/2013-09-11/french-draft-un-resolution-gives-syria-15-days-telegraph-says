France has proposed a draft United
Nations resolution giving Syria 15 days to produce a complete
declaration of its chemical weapons, the Telegraph said, without
saying where it got the information.  The draft demands the destruction of the weapons under
international supervision, the Telegraph said. It blames the
Syrian authorities for carrying out the poison gas attack of
Aug. 21, and refers Syrian authorities to the  International
Criminal Court .  To contact the reporter on this story:
