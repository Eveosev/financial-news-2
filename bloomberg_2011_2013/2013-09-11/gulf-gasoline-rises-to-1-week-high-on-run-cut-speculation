U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened to a one-week high on speculation refiners may
begin to cut back on processing amid declining profit margins.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf
gained 4.75 cents to a discount of 16.75 cents a gallon versus
 New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 11:49 a.m., the
strongest level since Sept. 3. Conventional, 87-octane fuel
added 4.37 cents to 11.88 cents below futures.  Refiners along the U.S. Gulf Coast, known as PADD 3, may
reduce runs after margins, as represented by the premium of spot
gasoline and diesel over crude, sank to the lowest level since
March. Some plants are also preparing to shut for seasonal
maintenance.  “There’s talk about run cuts,” said Carl Larry, president
of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Area refiners processed  8.24 million barrels a day of crude
oil in the week ended Sept. 6, a U.S. Energy Information
Administration report showed today.  That may drop in coming weeks as Citgo Petroleum Corp. and
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  plan to carry out maintenance at refineries in
Corpus Christi,  Texas , and Baton Rouge in Louisiana. The two
plants have a combined capacity of 668,500 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , advanced $1.01 to $6.64 a
barrel, snapping an eight-day decline, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The same spread based on  Light Louisiana
Sweet oil  added $1.11 to $4.99 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
