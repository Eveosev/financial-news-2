Australian  consumer confidence  rose
to the highest level since December 2010 as the prospect of a
change of government and lower interest rates boosted sentiment
among households, a private survey showed.  The sentiment index for September climbed 4.7 percent to
110.6, a  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey
taken Sept. 2-8 of 1,200 adults showed today in Sydney. A figure
above 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  Tony Abbott ’s coalition, which ousted the Labor government
of  Kevin Rudd  on Sept. 7, is pledging to cut red tape and lower
taxes to boost the $1.5 trillion economy as a China-led mining
investment boom crests. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn
Stevens  and his board cut the benchmark rate to a fresh record
of 2.5 percent last month to help revive non-resource
industries.  The improvement, if sustained, “indicates that the Reserve
Bank’s series of rate cuts which began in November 2011 are
finally gaining strong traction with households,” said  Bill Evans , Westpac’s chief economist. “It is reasonable to conclude
that the election result played an important if not leading role
in this strong boost.”  The sub-index tracking assessments of whether now is a good
time to buy a dwelling jumped 6.5 percent to the highest level
since August 2009, the report showed.  Home prices rose 5.3 percent across Australia’s eight major
cities in the year to Aug. 31, according to an RP Data-Rismark
home value index. Sydney home prices recorded the biggest
quarterly rise since April 2009, it showed.  “The result is comparable with the boost to the index in
March 1996 when the coalition was returned after 13 years in
opposition,” Evans said. He predicts the central bank will keep
rates on hold at the Oct. 1 meeting.  Traders are pricing in a 66 percent chance the central bank
will keep rates unchanged this year, according to  interest-rate
swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg. The RBA has eased borrowing
costs by 2.25 percentage points since November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
