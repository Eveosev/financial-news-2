Ethanol gained against gasoline on
concern that inventories will be near record-lows until the corn
harvest brings more of the feedstock and allows manufacturers to
boost production.  The spread, or discount, narrowed 0.95 cent to 83.12 cents
a gallon at 11:50 a.m.  New York  time after the Energy
Information Administration said supplies in the  Padd 2 region ,
which covers the Midwest, rose 0.9 percent to 4.91 million
barrels last week from an all-time low the previous week.  “Once new-crop ethanol starts pumping, supply will go up
over time,” said Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels desk at
Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New York. “Everyone knows  Chicago 
is empty, so it’s no surprise.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery gained 0.1 cent to
$1.896 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
dropped 13 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery slipped 0.85 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.7272 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  rose 3.5 percent to 848,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Sept. 6, the most in four weeks, data from
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, show.  Output is down 12 percent from the record 963,000 barrels a
day in December 2011, according to EIA data.  Stockpiles increased 0.3 percent to 16.3 million barrels
last week, it said. That’s record low for this time of year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Corn for December delivery slid 0.75 cent to $4.6825 a
bushel in Chicago. September corn decreased 0.75 cent to $4.74.  Ethanol  imports  last week sank 59 percent to 15,000 barrels
a day, today’s EIA report showed.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  rose 2 percent last week to
$2.06 a gallon, the highest since the week ended Aug. 2, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
