Australia ’s dollar slid versus all
its major counterparts after data showed the nation’s payrolls
unexpectedly fell and unemployment climbed to a four-year high.  The Aussie declined for the first time in a week against
the greenback, retreating from the strongest level in more than
two months, as investors added to bets the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will cut  interest rates  this year. The  New Zealand
dollar  climbed for a fifth day, reaching the highest in more
than three weeks, after the nation’s central bank signaled it
may raise its key rate from a record low earlier than previously
expected.  “The  unemployment rate  would be key to determining whether
the RBA does cut rates again, so today’s number reinforces our
view that there will at least one more cut in the cycle,” said
Ray Attrill, the global co-head of currency strategy at National
Australia Bank Ltd. “The fall back in the Aussie is
justified.”  Australia’s currency lost 0.9 percent to 92.46 U.S. cents
as of 4:41 p.m. in Sydney, after earlier reaching 93.54 cents,
the strongest since June 19. It dropped 1.4 percent to 91.88
yen. The Aussie sank to NZ$1.1371, the lowest since Aug. 21,
before trading at NZ$1.1373, 1.5 percent below yesterday’s
close.  New Zealand ’s kiwi dollar touched 81.51 U.S. cents, the
highest since Aug. 19, before trading at 81.33 cents for a 0.6
percent gain. It added 0.1 percent to 80.78 yen.  The  number  of people employed in Australia decreased by
10,800 last month, after a revised 11,400 decline in July,
according to a statistics bureau report today. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists was for a
10,000 gain. The  jobless  rate rose to 5.8 percent, the highest
since June 2009.  RBA Odds  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 40 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark rate
from 2.5 percent by the end of the year. That compares with a 33
percent chance indicated yesterday. NAB’s Attrill expects a rate
cut in November from the central bank, which next meets on Oct.
1.  Australian  government bonds  rose, with the  yield  on 10-year
note falling 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 4.04
percent from yesterday, when it touched 4.20 percent, the most
since March 2012. The three-year rate declined 11 basis points
to 2.87 percent.  The kiwi rose against all of its 16 major counterparts
after the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  forecast that bank bill
rates will be higher than previously estimated in the first half
of 2014, indicating the central bank may raise benchmark
borrowing costs within that period.  RBNZ Statement  “With the inflation pressures that have the potential to
build up, given the capacity constraints in the economy, we will
need to raise interest rates,” RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler
said in Wellington today after leaving the official cash rate at
2.5 percent, a record low.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate, rose two basis points to 3.52 percent,
after touching 3.56 percent, the most since August 2011.  “The kiwi is rising because the RBNZ has brought forward
timing for the first rate increase,” said  Mike Jones , a
currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington.
