The yen may fall to the weakest
versus the dollar in almost four months if a support level fails
to hold, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  “With a triangle-continuation pattern in place, we stay
bullish” on the dollar against the yen, David Sneddon, global
head of technical analysis in  London  at Credit Suisse, wrote
today in a note to clients.  If the Japanese currency falls beyond 100.88 per dollar it
will test support in the area from 101.54 to 101.61, the
Fibonacci 78.6 percent retracement of the yen’s gain in May and
June, Sneddon said. A move beyond that zone may result in the
yen testing long-term support at 103.74, its weakest level since
May 22, when it touched an almost five-year low.  The dollar-yen pair “should be allowed to cap at first,
ahead of an eventual re-test of long-term resistance at 103.10
to 103.74.” Sneddon wrote.  The yen increased 0.4 percent to 99.96 per dollar in New
York, after touching 100.61, its weakest level since July 22.  Japan ’s currency has slipped 11 percent this year, making
it the worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has
added the most, increasing 4.9 percent, while the dollar’s 3.9
percent gain makes it the second-best performer.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
