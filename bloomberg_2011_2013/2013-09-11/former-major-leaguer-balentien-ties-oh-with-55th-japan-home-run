Wladimir Balentien hit his 55th
home run this season in Japanese baseball, tying the mark shared
by three others including all-time leader Sadaharu Oh.  Balentien, a former Major League Baseball player now on the
Yakult Swallows, hit the solo home run in the sixth inning of a
6-2 home loss to the Hiroshima Carp in  Tokyo . The team’s
Facebook page published a photo of Balentien waving to fans
after being given a bouquet of flowers following the record-tying homer.  Oh hit 55 home runs in 1964, a mark matched by former
major-leaguers Tuffy Rhodes (2001) and Alex Cabrera (2002),
according to the  Associated Press .  Balentien, a 29-year-old from Curacao, has 21 games left to
surpass the mark.  He played in the major leagues from 2007 to 2009. In 170
games for the  Seattle Mariners  and  Cincinnati Reds , he hit 15
home runs and batted .221.  Oh is considered a national hero in  Japan , having hit a
record 868 career home runs. He also was criticized in the three
previous cases when foreign-born players tried to break his
season mark against clubs Oh was managing. Randy Bass, who hit
54 homers in 1985, Rhodes and Cabrera all had late-season series
against Oh’s teams -- the Yomiuri Giants in 1985, and the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in 2001 and 2002. The record stood as
opposing pitchers threw ball after ball in all three cases.
Rhodes faced just two strikes in 18 pitches in the finale
against Hawks pitcher Keizaburo Tanoue, AP reported at the time.  Oh denied any involvement in the pitching decisions. The
Japanese baseball commissioner at the time of the Rhodes’s case,
Hiromori Kawashima, declared the actions “completely divorced
from the essence of baseball, which values the supremacy of fair
play,” AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
