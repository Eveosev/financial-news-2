Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , under
pressure from its largest shareholder, doubled its dividend and
will make directors stand for election every year.  The world’s second-largest cruise-line operator after
 Carnival Corp. (CCL)  also elected William L. Kimsey as its lead
director. Kimsey is the former chief executive officer of
accountants Ernst & Young Global Ltd.  “I am pleased by the steps our board has taken to further
enhance our corporate governance, and I look forward to working
with my fellow directors and management to improve  shareholder
value ,” Kimsey said yesterday in a statement.  The board of the Miami-based company increased its
quarterly dividend to 25 cents from 12 cents, payable Oct. 8.  A. Wilhelmsen AS, the Oslo-based owner of a 19 percent
stake in the cruise line, said in May that it was supporting a
shareholder proposal to make directors stand for election every
year. The proposal passed.  Staggered terms for boards are a hurdle to activist
investors because they require a multiyear effort to make
changes. Directors at the company previously served three-year
terms, with no more than four standing for election at a time.  Royal Caribbean rose 1.3 percent to $38.72 yesterday at the
New York close. The shares were little changed in extended
trading after the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
