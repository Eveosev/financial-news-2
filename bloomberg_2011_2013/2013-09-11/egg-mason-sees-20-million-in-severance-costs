Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the money manager
seeking to reverse more than five years of net redemptions, will
incur a combined $20 million in severance and other costs in the
current and next quarter.  Expenses tied to closing and reorganizing businesses will
lead to costs of about $10 million each in the quarters ending
Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, the Baltimore-based company said today in
a regulatory  filing . Following the changes, Legg Mason expects
to see about $2.5 million in net increases in quarterly pretax
earnings, beginning in the three months ending March 31.  The reorganization includes closing Legg Mason’s emerging-markets equity unit, Esemplia Emerging Markets, and
transitioning the client-services business in Canada to the
firm’s affiliates, said  Mary Athridge , a spokeswoman for Legg
Mason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
