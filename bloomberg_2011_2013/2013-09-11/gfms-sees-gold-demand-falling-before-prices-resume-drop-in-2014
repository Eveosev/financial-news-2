Gold demand will fall in the second
half as bar buying slips from a record and central banks add
less to reserves, while prices may climb toward $1,500 an ounce
by early next year before dropping, Thomson Reuters GFMS said.  Total demand will slide to 2,237 metric tons this half from
2,309 tons a year earlier and 2,533 tons in the first six months
of 2013, the London-based  researcher  said today in a report.
Jewelry demand that reached a six-year high in the first half on
record buying in  China  will ease in the six months through
December, it said.  Bullion rallied 15 percent from a 34-month low in June as
lower prices boosted demand for jewelry, bars and coins in  India 
and China. India’s government increased gold-import restrictions
this year to combat a record current-account deficit. The metal
is set for the first annual drop in 13 years as some investors
lost faith in gold and on speculation an improving economy will
prompt the  Federal Reserve  to begin curbing stimulus.  “Although an improving outlook for the  U.S. economy  has
raised the probability that the Fed will start to scale back its
stimuli after its September meeting, the majority of the
negative factors have already been priced in,” GFMS said.
“Demand in India is forecast to be some way short of the
elevated level in the second quarter. Turning to China, the
prospect for local demand is more promising, but growth is
expected to cool down.”  Price Forecast  Gold for immediate delivery slid 19 percent this year to
$1,362.36 an ounce by 4:32 p.m. in London yesterday. It
rebounded from $1,180.50 in June. Prices could reach as high as
$1,526 in the first quarter if the Fed delays stimulus cuts and
will average $1,350 next year, GFMS said. Gold set a record
$1,921.15 in September 2011.  Holdings in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  dropped
26 percent this year, wiping $56.4 billion from the value of the
funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets gained 1.7 tons
since reaching a three-year low of 1,946.9 tons on Aug. 8. Fed
policy makers will cut monthly debt purchases by $10 billion at
the Sept. 17-18 meeting, a Sept. 6 Bloomberg News survey showed.  Jewelry usage jumped 23 percent to 1,137 tons in the first
half from a year earlier, the most since 2007, as demand in
China surged 41 percent to a record 345 tons, GFMS said. The
global figure will total 1,000 tons this half. Bar purchases
rose 52 percent to 725 tons in the first half and will ease to
441 tons in the six months through December, it said.  Central Banks  Central banks added 191 tons to reserves in the first half,
32 percent less than a year earlier, and buying will slow to 170
tons in the second half, GFMS predicts. That would take full-year additions to 361 tons, above the London-based World Gold
Council’s forecast of as much as 350 tons.  Scrap supply fell 14 percent to 662 tons in the first half,
the researcher said. While that will gain to 736 tons this half,
it will be 10 percent less than a year earlier. Mine production
will be little changed from a year earlier at 1,501 tons this
half, compared with 1,416 tons in the first six months, said
GFMS, which was once owned by bullion producer Gold Fields of
South Africa Ltd.  Mining companies reduced gold hedges by 26 tons in the
first six months and will cut another 14 tons from forward sales
in this half, 54 percent less than a year earlier, GFMS said.
Producers’ average total cash costs increased 7 percent to a
record $782 an ounce in the first half, while all-in production
costs climbed to $1,250 an ounce, the researcher said. Prices
traded below that level in June and July.  “We have only seen a modest number of producers elect to
cease operations,” Rhona O’Connell, head of metals research and
forecasting at the company, said in an accompanying statement.
“With the recent price recovery, we expect this to remain the
case in the short to medium term, limited to smaller, cash-strapped producers at the top end of the cost curve.”  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters Corp. in selling
