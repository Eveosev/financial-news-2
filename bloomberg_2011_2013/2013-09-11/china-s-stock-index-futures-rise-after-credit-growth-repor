China’s benchmark stock index  rose
to a three-month high after credit growth rebounded and
brokerages from Deutsche Bank AG to UBS AG boosted their
forecasts for the nation’s economic expansion.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , also known as Chalco, surged
9.9 percent, driving a gauge of material stocks to the biggest
gain among industry groups.  China  Shipping Container Lines Co.
advanced to a two-year high as a benchmark of commodity shipping
rates surged to the highest since January 2012. Suzhou Anjie
Technology Co., a supplier to Apple Inc., paced declines for
technology shares and smaller companies.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,241.27
at the close, the highest level since June 6. China’s broadest
measure of  new  credit almost doubled in August from the previous
month, while M2  money supply  growth accelerated to 14.7 percent,
the fastest in three months. UBS and Deutsche Bank raised their
growth estimates after yesterday’s industrial production data.  “The recent economic data are pretty strong and that
reinforces investors’ expectations that the economic recovery is
well on track,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief
investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co., which
manages $120 million. “That’ll boost demand for risk assets
such as stocks.”  The CSI 300 Index climbed 0.3 percent to 2,482.89. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index slipped 0.4 percent after entering
a  bull market  yesterday with a 21 percent rebound from the June
25 low. The ChiNext index of start-up companies fell 3.4
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index added 1.7 percent
in  New York  yesterday.  Material Shares  The  Shanghai  index has risen 15 percent since reaching this
year’s low on June 27 amid data showing growth is accelerating
and as shippers and port operators rallied after the State
Council approved Shanghai’s Free-Trade Zone. Trading volumes
were 97 percent above the 30-day average today.  Shanghai stocks will follow their  Hong Kong  peers into a
bull market by next month as the world’s second-biggest economy
rebounds and the government eases restrictions on capital flows,
said Bank of Communications Co.  “The free-trade zone and preference shares trial, coupled
with the economic recovery, will get us there,” said Hao Hong,
Hong Kong-based strategist at BoCom, referring to speculation
the government will allow lenders to sell preferred shares to
boost capital. “It will most likely be before mid-October.”  A measure of material stocks in the CSI 300 advanced 1.9
percent today, the most among the 10 industry groups.  Chalco, the listed unit of nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal, surged 9.9 percent to 3.98  yuan .  Yunnan
Copper Industry Co. (000878) , the fourth-biggest producer of the metal,
added 6.9 percent to 10.59 yuan. Hebei Iron & Steel Co. rose 4.9
percent to 2.14 yuan.  Economic Indicators  Premier  Li Keqiang  said yesterday at a meeting in the
northern city of Dalian that August indicators have shown a
trend of recovery. Monetary easing, adjusting macroeconomic
policies and increasing the deficit may have an impact in the
short run yet won’t necessarily be beneficial in future, he
said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  China’s broadest measure of  new  credit almost doubled in
August from the previous month. Aggregate financing was 1.57
trillion yuan ($257 billion), the People’s Bank of China said
yesterday after the market closed, topping the 950 billion yuan
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Data
released yesterday also showed industrial production and fixed-asset investment beat economists’ estimates last month.  Stock Valuations  UBS raised its estimate for China’s gross domestic product
growth in 2013 to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent, while Deutsche
Bank boosted its forecast for growth in the third quarter to 7.9
percent from the previous 7.7 percent. Deutsche Bank also
increased its estimates for the fourth quarter and 2014.  China Shipping Container, the country’s second-largest
carrier of sea-cargo boxes, jumped 10 percent to 3.30 yuan, the
highest close since August 2011.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (601919) , the
biggest shipping company, rose 5 percent to 3.80 yuan. The
Baltic Dry Index gained 4.3 percent yesterday to the highest
since January 2012.  Suzhou Anjie slumped 10 percent to 41.41 yuan.  GoerTek
Inc. (002241) , which also supplies to Apple, tumbled 10 percent to 37.18
yuan. Apple introduced two new iPhones, including a cheaper $99
version in bright colors and an updated high-end device.  The Shanghai Composite is  valued  at 9 times its projected
12-month earnings, the highest since June 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength measure,
measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped during a
specified time period, was at 79.6 today. Readings above 70
indicate a price may be poised to fall.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
