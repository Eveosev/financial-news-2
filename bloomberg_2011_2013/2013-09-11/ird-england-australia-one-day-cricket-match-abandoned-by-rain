The third one-day cricket match
between  England  and Australia was abandoned after 15 overs
because of rain.  Australia reduced England to 59-3 before play was halted at
Edgbaston, Birmingham. Opener Michael Carberry was run out for
one in the first over before Mitchell Johnson had Kevin Pietersen caught at square leg for six.  After Jonathan Trott successfully reviewed a leg-before-wicket dismissal, Joe Root went for 12, caught and bowled by
spinner Adam Voges.  Trott remained unbeaten on 28 and captain Eoin Morgan was
five not out when the umpires took the players off at 3:30 p.m.
because of the weather. After a delay of more than 3 1/2 hours,
play was officially called off at 7:05 p.m.  Australia  leads the five-match series 1-0, with the opener
also rained out. The fourth game is scheduled to be played in
Cardiff on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
