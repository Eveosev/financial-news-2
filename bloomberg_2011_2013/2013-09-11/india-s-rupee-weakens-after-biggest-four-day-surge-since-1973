India ’s rupee fell, snapping the
biggest four-day surge in 40 years, on concern slowing growth
will deter inflows needed to reduce the current-account deficit.  The currency strengthened 6.1 percent in the four days
through yesterday after Raghuram Rajan, who took charge as
governor of the  Reserve Bank  of India on Sept. 4, announced
steps to boost the supply of dollars. The relative strength
index had risen to 83 before the rally, surpassing the 70 level
that indicates a rupee rebound. Gross domestic product  grew  4.4
percent last quarter, the slowest pace since the three months
ended March 2009, official data show.  “I am still concerned about the growth outlook and the RBI
has to walk hand-in-hand with the government to announce
necessary reforms,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. “Technicals
had been poised for a rupee rebound and all that was needed was
a small sprinkle of relative good news that came in the form of
the governor’s speech.”  The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 64.08 per dollar as of
10:17 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The four-day gain was the biggest in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1973 after the rupee touched
a record low of 68.845 on Aug. 28  Global funds have cut  holdings  of rupee-denominated debt by
$10.3 billion since May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  flagged a potential paring of stimulus. The Fed meets
to review its bond-buying policy on Sept. 17-18.  Oil Prices  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 17.85 percent.  The rupee’s losses will be limited on optimism lower oil
prices will help the government achieve its aim of narrowing the
current-account gap to $70 billion in the year through March
2014 from an unprecedented $87.8 billion in the previous period,
Cavenagh said.  Brent crude  fell the most since June 20 yesterday as U.S.
President  Barack Obama  called for a pause in authorizing
military strikes on  Syria . Any positive news flow may push the
rupee as high as 62.7 in the coming days before it resumes its
fall toward 70 per dollar, Cavenagh forecast, adding he would
not buy the Indian currency.  Rajan last week announced a plan to provide concessional
swaps for banks’ foreign-currency deposits to boost the supply
of dollars. This will add $10 billion to the nation’s reserves,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.5 percent to
65.61 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts declined 0.2 percent to 66.09. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
