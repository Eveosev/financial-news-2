Mexico  peso swings dropped to a
one-month low amid rising demand for higher-yielding assets as
concern eased that the U.S. will start to reduce monetary
stimulus this month and that an attack on Syria was imminent.  Three-month historical volatility, a measure of the
magnitude of the peso’s fluctuations during the period, fell to
13.57 percent at 10:22 a.m. in Mexico City, the lowest level on
a closing basis since Aug. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The peso was little changed at 13.0942 per dollar,
snapping three days of gains.  Fluctuations in the peso surged to an 18-month high in
August as concern mounted that the  Federal Reserve  would reduce
its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. The Fed’s program to
bolster U.S. employment helped drive foreign demand for peso
bonds, pushing holdings to a record high in May.  “People think tapering is less likely” in September,
Claudio Irigoyen, Bank of America Corp.’s head of Latin America
fixed-income and foreign-exchange strategy, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “People now think that there will be no
attack on  Syria  for the moment.”  Citigroup Inc. recommended Mexico’s local-currency bonds
yesterday in part on the prospect that policy makers will reduce
borrowing costs to jumpstart growth as currency volatility
subsides.  Yields on benchmark peso bonds maturing in 2024 climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.34 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
