President  Francois Hollande  plans
to narrow  France ’s budget gap next year mostly by shrinking
spending.  Even as the pace of deficit-reduction slows, 15 billion
euros ($19.9 billion) out of the 18 billion-euro narrowing of
the budget gap will come from spending cuts, his ministers told
journalists in Paris today. The cuts include a 9 billion-euro
reduction in state expenditure and a 6 billion-euro drop in
social-services spending. New taxes will raise 3 billion euros.  France’s  budget shortfall  will be 4.1 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 3.6 percent in 2014, Finance
Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said. The plans rely on gross domestic
product growth of 0.1 percent this year and 0.9 percent in 2014,
he added.  “We have one, single ambition: achieving sustainable
recovery in 2014,” Moscovici said. “These are prudent
forecasts.”  Hollande’s decision to slow the pace of deficit reduction
from what was planned earlier this year is in line with an
International Monetary Fund call for euro-area nations to shift
their focus on growth. Moscovici said they’re in line with the
government’s commitment to cut the “structural” shortfall, or
the deficit excluding the impact of economic growth. He added
that he discussed the plans with European Union Economic Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  last week in  St. Petersburg .  The government plans to shift the taxation of businesses
from production to profits, Budget Minister Bernard Cazeneuve
said. Full details of the budget plans will be published Sept.
