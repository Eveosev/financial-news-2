Ibovespa  futures  fluctuated between
gains and losses as higher metals prices boosted the outlook for
raw-material producers and consumer inflation in Brazil’s
biggest city unexpectedly slowed.  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder controlled by  Eike Batista ,
may move after Citigroup Inc. cut its recommendation to the
equivalent of hold. Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA 
may be active after saying in a regulatory filing it’s seeking
“significant” spending cuts to safeguard its financial
stability throughout 2014.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October were little
changed at 53,020 at 9:18 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The Bloomberg Base
Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index added 0.3 percent. The real
was little changed at 2.2820 per dollar.  Consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose 0.21 percent in the four
weeks ended on Sept. 7, according to the IPC-Fipe  price index .
That compares with a median estimate of 0.25 percent among
economists surveyed by Bloomberg and a previous reading of 0.23
percent.  The Ibovespa entered a  bull market  on Sept. 9 after rising
20 percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 21 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 5.9 percent for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  yesterday was 8.87
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.73 billion
reais this year through Sept. 6, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
