Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan fired nine ministers in his first major cabinet change
since 2011.  Minister of National Planning Shamsudeen Usman, Foreign
Affairs Minister Olugbenga Ashiru and Hadiza Mailafia, the
minister of Environment, were among those who were removed from
their positions, Information Minister Labaran Maku said in
Abuja, the capital, today. He didn’t give reasons for the
dismissals or say who would replace them.  The changes were made as  Nigeria ’s ruling party, the
People’s  Democratic Party , faces its biggest internal crisis
since it came to power 14 years ago. Dissatisfied party members
walked out of a party convention on Aug. 31. The group formed
the New PDP and appointed their own leaders.  Minister of Education Ruqqayat Rufai, Minister of Land and
Urban Development Ama Pepple and Minister of Science and
Technology Ita Ewa were also fired, Maku said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
