South African  manufacturing  growth
accelerated to 5.4 percent in July, as the decline in the rand
boosted revenue for exporters.  Factory output rose from a revised 0.5 percent a month
earlier, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its
website today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12
economists was 1.6 percent.  Production (SFPMMOM)  increased 5 percent in
the month.  “Some exporters have noted the benefits of the weaker rand
on export growth,” Kamilla Kaplan, an economist at Investec
Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments before the
release of the data.  The rand has declined 15 percent against the dollar this
year, the worst performer among the 16 major currencies tracked
by Bloomberg, increasing export revenue. The expansion in
factory output, signaled by the nation’s purchasing managers’
index rising to a six-year high in August, may be limited by
recent strikes by autoworkers and miners.  The South African Reserve Bank has kept its benchmark
repurchase rate unchanged for a year at 5 percent as inflation
pressures from the rand prevent it from cutting borrowing costs
to stimulate the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
