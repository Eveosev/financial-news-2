Banco Sabadell SA (SAB)  wants to sell its
Solvia real estate unit as Spanish lenders step up efforts to
divest property assets, two people with knowledge of the plan
said.  Sabadell may hire advisers in the fourth quarter to help it
sell  Solvia , said one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public. A spokesman for
the bank, based in Sabadell, Spain, wasn’t immediately available
to comment.  Sabadell, which this week announced a plan to raise 1.38
billion euros ($1.8 billion) of capital, is among Spanish
lenders trying to offload real estate assets that were added to
their balance sheets when loans to developers went bad during
Spain’s six-year property slump. Investors have begun to buy
assets linked to real estate in Spain. The country’s bad bank
agreed to sell a majority stake in a portfolio of almost 1,000
homes in August and Bankia agreed earlier this month to cede
management of its real estate business to a unit of Cerberus
Capital Management LP.  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) , Spain’s sixth-biggest bank, hired
KPMG to seek potential buyers for its real estate business,
known as Aliseda, a person with knowledge of the sale process
said. Banco Santander SA, Spain’s biggest bank, is also seeking
a buyer for its property division, El Confidencial news website
reported today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
