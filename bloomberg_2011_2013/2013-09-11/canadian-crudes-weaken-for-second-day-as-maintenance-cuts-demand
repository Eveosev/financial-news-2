Canadian crudes weakened for a
second day on the spot market as refinery maintenance in  Canada 
and the U.S. Midwest reduced demand.  Western Canadian Select, a blend of heavy oil-sands
bitumen, weakened by 10 cents to a $25.25 discount to U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil, according to Calgary oil
broker Net Energy Inc. Syncrude, a Canadian light crude
processed from oil-sands bitumen, weakened by 30 cents to a
$1.80-a-barrel discount.  WCS has been trending lower since reaching $9.25 below WTI
June 12 amid supply disruptions in  Alberta . The discount
increased to $25.75 on Sept. 4, the widest in six months.  Plants shutting units for work include  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting,
Indiana, and Toledo, Ohio, refineries.  Whiting yesterday shut a fluid catalytic cracker and a
66,000-barrel-a-day reformer unit for planned maintenance, and
the 160,000-barrel-a-day Toledo  refinery  brought down a coker, a
person familiar with the matter said, who asked not to be named
because the information isn’t public.  Suncor Energy Inc. said Aug. 1 that it’s planning four to
five weeks of maintenance on the 110,000-barrel-a-day Unit 2 at
the Fort McMurray  upgrader .  Royal Dutch Shell Plc said last week on a community hot
line that it shut its Scotford  refinery , which can process
97,870 barrels a day, for scheduled work.  Husky Energy Inc. is shutting the 82,000-barrel-a-day
Lloydminster  upgrader , which processes heavy crude into lighter
grades, for 45 days starting in early September, executives said
on an earnings call last month.  Northern Tier Energy LP’s 74,000-barrel-a-day St. Paul Park
 refinery  in Minnesota plans to halt a fluid catalytic cracker
during October, the company said during its earnings conference
call in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
