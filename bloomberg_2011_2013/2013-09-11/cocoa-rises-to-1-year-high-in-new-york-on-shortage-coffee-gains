Cocoa rose to the highest level in
almost a year in  New York  on speculation supplies won’t be
enough to keep up with demand. Arabica coffee gained.  Global cocoa demand will exceed supply by 209,000 metric
tons in the season ending Sept. 30 and 188,000 tons next season,
estimates KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis
in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . Cocoa grind advanced 6.1 percent in
Europe in the second quarter and 12 percent in  North America ,
according to the European Cocoa Association in Brussels and
 National Confectioners Association  in  Washington .  “With cocoa grind posting strong growth across regions,
2013-14 will likely feature a second consecutive draw on global
inventories and support cocoa prices,” Damien Courvalin, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a
report e-mailed today.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to $2,577 a

world’s leading producer as output in second-ranking  Ghana  may
be lower due to a cut to fertilizer subsidies,  Laurent Pipitone ,
the head of statistics at the International Cocoa Organization,
said last week.  Cocoa Liquor  Exports of cocoa liquor from the Port of San Pedro, Ivory
