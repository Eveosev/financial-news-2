Spain ’s  bad bank  is seeking
investors for a portfolio of seven office buildings in Madrid, a
person with knowledge of the plan said.  The properties that make up the Corona portfolio have
65,000 square meters (700,000 square feet) of office space and
an occupancy rate of 80 percent, said the person, who asked not
to identified because the information isn’t public. The closing
date for non-binding bids is Oct. 4, the person said. Binding
bids must be submitted by the last week of November.  Spain set up the bad bank, known as Sareb, last year to
absorb 50 billion euros ($66 billion) in real estate assets from
lenders including the Bankia group that took state aid. Sareb
last month agreed to sell a majority stake in a group of almost
1,000 homes known as Project Bull to private-equity firm H.I.G.
Capital LLC as it began the process of offloading assets.  Sareb will probably package the office assets in a fund
structure and sell a minority stake, the person said. The
portfolio, composed of buildings in the Calle Velazquez,
Montecarmelo and Campo de las Naciones areas of the city, also
comes with 1,200 parking spaces, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
