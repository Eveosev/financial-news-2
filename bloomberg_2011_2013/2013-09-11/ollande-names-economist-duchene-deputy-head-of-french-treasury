President  Francois Hollande  named
economist Sandrine Duchene, previously in charge of the
forecasting unit at national statistics office Insee, deputy
head of the French Treasury.  Duchene, 44, will also be the Treasuryâ€™s chief economist,
the finance ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. She
replaces Claire Waysand, who left the Treasury to become deputy
chief of staff for Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.  France traditionally uses the top civil service jobs at the
Treasury as a training ground for its future central bankers.
Former European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet , as
well as former  International Monetary Fund  chief Michel Camdessus, had top roles their before moving on to the Bank of
France. Current Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  is also
a former head of Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
