Syria  still feels threatened by a possible attack even after U.S. President  Barack Obama  delayed a vote on military action, according to Minister for National Reconciliation Ali Haidar.  “We consider that the atmosphere of war persists until we go to a comprehensive political process that will solve the Syrian crisis fully,” Haidar said in a phone interview from Damascus today. Asked what new steps Syria will take, Haidar said his country had done all it could and it’s now up to the U.S. to get out of its “predicament.”  Haidar spoke a day after Obama asked Congress to delay a vote authorizing U.S. military action against Syria following a Russian-backed plan for Damascus to place its arsenal of chemical weapons to international control.  The U.S.,  France  and other nations accuse President Bashar al-Assad’s forces of using chemical weapons last month and have threatened military action in response. Syria says rebels fighting to remove Assad were responsible. More than 100,000 people have died during the 2 1/2 year uprising.  Haidar said Syria has accepted the Russian-backed proposal to remove any pretext for outside intervention.  “Syria continues to lead life normally and deal with its internal affairs,” he said. “The problem is with the other side. Let it solve its problem with its people and institutions.”  “The ball has always been in the U.S. court,” he said.
