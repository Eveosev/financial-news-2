European Union carbon permits
dropped a second day as  Poland  prepared to auction allowances
for the first time and German power prices fell.  December permits fell as much as 3.7 percent to 4.96 euros
($6.58) a metric ton and were trading at 5 euros at 9:22 a.m. on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . Carbon jumped to as
high as 5.56 euros on Sept. 9, the highest since January, as the
EU regulator cut the free permits handed out to industry.  Poland, the European Union’s third-biggest emitter after
 Germany  and the U.K., will auction 51 million tons of permits
this year in weekly sales starting Sept. 16, according to the
European Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig, Germany. The auctions
will boost the amount of allowances sold this month to 80.3
million tons from 33.6 million in August, EEX and ICE data show.  The German front-year electricity contract declined for the
third day, dropping as much as 0.7 percent to 38.25 euros a
megawatt hour, according to data from brokers. Power is linked
to the price of emissions, which affects production costs.  “We expect the price of EU allowances to react primarily
to signals from the power market in the upcoming weeks,”
Kathrin Goretzki, an analyst at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Munich, said in
note yesterday. “As we do not anticipate a sustainable increase
in power prices any time soon, we think that the carbon price
will also likely give up some of its recent gains.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
