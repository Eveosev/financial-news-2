United Co. Rusal, owner of a 28
percent stake in OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , expects the nickel
producer to maintain its approach to dividend payments, said
billionaire Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska .  “Norilsk will keep its policy,” Deripaska, who runs the
world’s largest aluminum producer, said in an interview with
 Mark Barton  on Bloomberg Television from the  World Economic
Forum  in Dalian, China.  Norilsk shareholders are discussing potential changes to
dividend payments after declines in nickel and palladium prices,
three people with knowledge of the talks said last month. The
dividends help Moscow-based Rusal to service  its debt , which was
$10.45 billion at the end of June.  While Norilsk is reviewing strategy and needs a disciplined
approach to planning in response to market events, Deripaska
said he doesn’t expect “much change” in its payout policy.  Norilsk, the world’s biggest producer of nickel, last year
agreed to pay as much as $9 billion in dividends for 2012
through 2014 as part of an accord to end a four-year dispute
between shareholders Rusal, Roman Abramovich’s Millhouse Capital
and billionaire  Vladimir Potanin . The company declared about $2
billion of dividends for last year.  Norilsk management has made proposals including linking
payments to the dividend yield and guaranteeing the distribution
from profits left over once investment needs are fulfilled, the
people said last month.  Norilsk’s press-service declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
