American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest
U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases, has enough investment
capacity even while keeping expense growth below 3 percent,
Steve Squeri, president of global corporate services, said.  “When you say something like you’re going to hold your
operating expenses under 3 percent, one of the concerns that
immediately comes up is, are you going to have enough investment
capacity,” Squeri said today at the Barclays Global Financial
Services Conference in New York. “We believe we do.”  Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer
of New York-based American Express, has targeted expense growth
of less than 3 percent for the next two years, a goal the
company is “very confident we’ll hit,” Squeri said. In the
first half of 2013, costs have been little changed from the
year-earlier period, he said.  “We’re also very confident that it leaves us with enough
flexibility and enough degrees of freedom to not only deal with
any compliance issues that may come up but to also deal with
investment opportunities that will arise as well,” Squeri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
