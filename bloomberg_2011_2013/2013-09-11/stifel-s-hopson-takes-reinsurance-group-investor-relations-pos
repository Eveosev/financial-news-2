Reinsurance Group of America Inc. ,
the reinsurer formerly owned by MetLife Inc., hired Jeff Hopson
of  Stifel Financial Corp. (SF)  to head investor relations, replacing
John Hayden.  Hopson, 53, will report to Chief Financial Officer Jack Lay, according to a statement today from Chesterfield, Missouri-based RGA. Hayden will take on a “broader role” in the
company’s finances after leading investor relations since 2004.  Chief Executive Officer Greig Woodring has told investors
he plans to scale back from disability coverage in  Australia (RGA) 
after higher-than-expected costs in the nation. Hopson, who
covered companies including Invesco Ltd. and Legg Mason Inc. as
an analyst and managing director at Stifel, will work for the
reinsurer in dealing with analysts and investors and in
developing financial presentations.  “RGA’s growing global presence and diversification, along
with increasing interest in the company by the investing sector,
have led to a need to have a senior executive dedicated to
overseeing this specific function,” Woodring said in the
statement.  The reinsurer has gained 25 percent from Dec. 31 through
yesterday in  New York  trading. The last time it gained that much
in a year was 2004.  Stifel has been cutting staff after agreeing last year to
buy KBW Inc. and said last month it was closing its Canadian
operations. Sarah Anderson, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis-based brokerage, didn’t immediately return a message seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
