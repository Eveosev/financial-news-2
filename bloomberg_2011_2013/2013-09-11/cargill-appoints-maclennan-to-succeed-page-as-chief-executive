Cargill Inc., the commodities

Operating Officer David W. MacLennan will succeed Gregory R. Page as chief executive officer in December.  MacLennan, 54, joined Cargill in 1991 and has worked in its
financial, risk management, energy and animal-protein businesses
in the U.S. and  Europe , the Minneapolis-based company said today
in a statement. He was appointed Cargill’s chief financial
officer and elected to the board in 2008 before taking over as
president and COO in 2011.  Before Cargill, MacLennan was a senior vice president at
LIT America in Chicago and president of Fixed Income Capital
Markets at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, according
to Cargill. He has a bachelor’s degree from  Amherst College  and
a master of business administration from the University of
Chicago.  Page, who joined Cargill in 1974 as a trainee in its feed
division and has held various leadership positions in Asia and
 North America , was appointed CEO and chairman in 2007. He will
stay on as executive chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
