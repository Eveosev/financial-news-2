International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , whose $186.60 share price and 2.6 percent loss in 2013
combined to restrain the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than
any other stock, is about to have its influence diluted.  The world’s biggest seller of computer services will see
its proportion in the gauge cut to 7.9 percent from 9.4 percent
when  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Visa Inc. (V)  and  Nike Inc. (NKE)  are added
this month. Goldman and Visa, at $165.14 and $184.59, become the
second- and third-most influential members of the Dow, which is
weighted according to stock price rather than market value.  Reducing IBM’s influence was part of the rationale for
picking Goldman, the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, and
Visa, the largest payment network, according to  David Blitzer ,
chairman of the S&P Dow Jones index committee, which announced
the actions yesterday. Had they been in the gauge all year, the
Dow would be up 17.3 percent instead of 15.9 percent, data based
on yesterday’s prices compiled by Bloomberg show.  IBM’s sway over the Dow has been “reason enough not to
consider it a good reflection of the stock market,” according
to Mark Luschini, the Philadelphia-based chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees $58
billion. “On certain days I’ll walk out, and I’ll know to the
right of the decimal where the  S&P 500  index closed. But I won’t
know if the Dow Jones industrial average is above 15,000.”  Three Removals  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
will exit the Dow on Sept. 20, making it the biggest reshuffling
in almost a decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which
administers the average. The changes may tighten its correlation
with the S&P 500 and make the gauge more relevant to
professionals, Luschini said in a phone interview.  Moves announced yesterday by a committee that includes
editors of the Wall Street Journal will also boost the influence
of banking and computer companies in the 30-member  gauge  as
Goldman and Visa join JPMorgan Chase & Co., Cisco Systems Inc.
and five other financial and technology firms. Bank of America
is being removed even after rising  109 percent  in 2012 for the
Dow’s largest gain.  In Bank of America, Alcoa and Hewlett-Packard, the Dow is
losing its three lowest-price shares and replacing them with
members that have as much as seven times the influence. The
addition of higher-priced stocks to balance IBM means the Dow
will be less susceptible to swings in the computer company,
which was first added to the 117-year-old index in 1932 and has
been a member continuously since 1979.  ‘Major Weight’  “You have three stocks that are hardly weighted at all and
you’re adding three that are coming in with major weight -- it’s
a pretty big change,” Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory
Forecasts newsletter who manages $180 million at Hammond,
Indiana-based Horizon Investment Services, said in a phone
interview. “Does it make it more representative? Yes.”  IBM has more than  doubled  since the  bull market  in U.S.
equities began in March 2009, a period in which it has always
been the highest-price stock in the Dow. Because of the
weighting, IBM’s performance has sometimes meant the difference
between a gain or loss for the whole average.  On April 19, when IBM shares tumbled 8.3 percent after
profits fell short of analyst estimates, the Dow trailed the S&P
500 by 0.8 percentage point, the most since December 2008. IBM’s
loss cut 132 points from the Dow that day, erasing almost all
the gains from other members. When the S&P 500 ended 2011
virtually unchanged, IBM’s 25 percent rally contributed almost
half of the Dow’s gain for the year, driving the 30-member gauge
up 5.5 percent.  Apple, Google  While Visa and Goldman will help limit IBM’s influence,
some of the most heavily traded technology stocks in the country
are effectively ineligible for the Dow because of prices so high
they would distort the gauge, Blitzer said.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , whose shares closed yesterday at $494.64, has
the biggest weighting in the S&P 500 because its market value is
$449.4 billion, the largest in the world.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , whose
stock trades at $888.67, has a capitalization of $296.1 billion
and is the sixth-biggest weighting in the S&P 500, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P.  “Clearly, Google and Apple are huge companies, very big
and very well known, and there’s no question that they’re very
important to the U.S. and the global economy,” Blitzer said in
a conference call with reporters. “The prices of their stocks
are so high that putting Google in would completely distort the
index and it wouldn’t work.”  Priced Out  More U.S. companies may be priced out of the Dow as stock
splits have become less common and the number of shares trading
above $100 reached a record. Eleven companies in the S&P 500
have split their stock this year, compared with 42 annually
since 1996, data from S&P show. That helped send the average
share price to $65.96 last quarter, the highest on record.  Goldman Sachs climbed 3.5 percent to $165.14 yesterday.
Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike jumped 2.2 percent to $66.82 and
Visa in Foster City, California, increased 3.4 percent to
$184.59.  Palo Alto , California-based Hewlett-Packard lost 0.4
percent to $22.27 and Alcoa in New York slipped 0.3 percent to
$8.06. Bank of America in Charlotte,  North Carolina , added 0.9
percent to $14.61.  The Dow average climbed 35.14 points, or 0.2 percent, to
15,226.20 as of 10:23 a.m. today in New York.  The gauge was devised in 1896 by Charles H. Dow, co-founder
of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. It originally
included General Electric Co., American Tobacco and 10 other
companies before expanding to 20 companies in 1916 and 30 in
1928.  UnitedHealth, Kraft  The average was last reshuffled in September 2012, when
UnitedHealth Group Inc. replaced Kraft Foods Inc., which spun
off its North American grocery business.  Goldman Sachs shares have more than tripled since their
2008 low though they remain down more than 30 percent since
hitting $247.92 in October 2007. Second-quarter earnings doubled
as overall revenue rose 30 percent, helped by record fees for
debt underwriting. It held the top spot among arrangers of
global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings in the first
half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are pleased to join this historic and significant
market benchmark, and remain dedicated to delivering value for
our shareholders as a member of the Dow 30,”  Michael DuVally , a
spokesman, wrote in an e-mail.  Visa, which is categorized as an information technology
company by S&P and financial services by Russell Investments and
Bloomberg, sets interchange fees and collects money for credit
card-issuing banks. The stock is up 22 percent in 2013 after
rising three of the last four years and at more than $180 would
vie with IBM for the Dow’s biggest weighting.  Nike, Alcoa  Shares of Nike have climbed every year since 2008. The
world’s largest maker of sporting goods reported net income in
the quarter ended May 31 of $668 million, up 22 percent from a
year ago, as demand surged for running and basketball gear in
its largest market,  North America .  Alcoa, the largest American aluminum producer, is being
removed after plunging more than 80 percent since its 2007 high
and seeing its debt-rating cut to speculative grade this year --
making it the second junk-rated  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
company in at least three decades. Trading around $8, it has the
smallest influence on the average.  The company said in a statement that the move has no effect
on Alcoa’s business strategy.  Autonomy Writedown  Hewlett-Packard, which took an $8.8 billion writedown
related to its acquisition of Autonomy Corp. in November 2012,
has declined for three straight years, and at about $22 is the
average’s third-smallest stock. Its trailing 12-month revenue
plummeted the most in more than a decade last fiscal quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “HP remains confident that we are making progress in our
turnaround,” Michael Thacker, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.
“We have delivered financial performance in line with or better
than our expectations throughout this fiscal year, and remain
focused on delivering  shareholder value .”  Even with its 2012 gain and a 25 percent advance this year,
Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender, remains more
than 70 percent below its high of $54.90 in November 2006. Two
people with direct knowledge of its plans said yesterday the
company will eliminate about 2,100 jobs and shutter 16 mortgage
offices as rising interest rates weaken loan demand.  The index change “has no impact on our business or our
strategy for providing solid returns to shareholders,”  Jerry Dubrowski , a Bank of America spokesman, said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
