Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
telephone company seeking $14 billion in loans to back its
purchase of a stake in its wireless unit from  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD) , set the fees it will pay to banks signing on to the
financing.  Lenders committing $125 million or more will receive 35
basis points, 30 basis points for pledges less than that amount,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who wasnâ€™t
authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. The
fees will be calculated based on the final amount the banks lend
to Verizon upon closing of the transaction.  Verizon is seeking a $6 billion  term loan  due in three
years that will pay interest at 1.375 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate, and a five-year loan of
similar size with a rate of 1.5 percentage points more than
Libor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The financing is being arranged JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Barclays Plc, and it
also includes a $2 billion revolving  credit line  that will pay
interest at 1.25 percentage points more than the benchmark
borrowing rate. The banks met with lenders today to discuss the
deal.  The loans, along with an unprecedented $49 billion bond
sale, back the buyout of partner Vodafone percent stake in
Verizon Wirless. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
