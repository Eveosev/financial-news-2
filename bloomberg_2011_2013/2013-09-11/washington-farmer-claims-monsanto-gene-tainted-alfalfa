Washington State agriculture
officials are examining a farmer’s claim that his alfalfa was
rejected for export because it was contaminated with  Monsanto
Co.’s (MON)  gene for herbicide tolerance.  The state is analyzing the farmer’s alfalfa seeds at a
laboratory in Yakima after being contacted by the grower, Mike
Louisell, a spokesman with the Washington State Department of
Agriculture, said by phone today. The farmer claims his crop was
rejected because a test found the plants were genetically
modified to tolerate Roundup herbicide, Louisell said.  The trait was developed by St. Louis-based Monsanto and
marketed as Roundup Ready. Louisell declined to identify the
farmer or the location of his land. He couldn’t say who
conducted the original test that led to the export rejection.  Monsanto hasn’t been contacted by Washington officials or
the grower, Tom Helscher, a company spokesman, said by phone
today. Monsanto licenses its genetic traits to other seed
companies and has no reason to believe the farmer planted
Monsanto seeds, he said.  Conventional alfalfa is permitted to contain low levels of
the Roundup Ready variety, with exact levels often negotiated
between the farmer and the exporter, Helscher said.  Reuters reported the state’s alfalfa investigation earlier
today.  The probe comes as the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
continues to investigate how an unapproved variety of Roundup
Ready wheat was found on a farm in  Oregon . After the USDA’s May
29 announcement,  Japan ,  South Korea  and Taiwan temporarily
suspended some U.S. wheat purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
