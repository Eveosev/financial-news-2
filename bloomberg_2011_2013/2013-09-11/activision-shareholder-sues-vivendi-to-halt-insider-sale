A shareholder of  Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)  sued the company’s co-chairman, chief executive
officer and majority stockholder,  Vivendi SA (VIV) , to halt a stock
sale that would give officers control of the biggest U.S. video-game maker.  Shareholder Douglas M. Hayes wants a court in  Delaware  to
halt the proposed private stock sale and to force the company to
give non-Vivendi shareholders a chance to vote on the proposed
deal. The sale would give control of the company to CEO Bobby Kotick and Co-Chairman Brian Kelly, according to the lawsuit.  The sale would “unjustly enrich Kelly, Kotick and the
other participants,” Hayes claimed in the lawsuit filed today
in Delaware’s Chancery Court.  In July, Activision announced it would buy back $5.83
billion of its shares, while a group including Kotick, Kelly and
Shenzhen, China-based game maker  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , will pay
$2.34 billion to bring down Vivendi’s stake in the world’s
biggest video-game publisher from 61 percent to 12 percent.  Kotick’s investor group will emerge as the biggest
shareholder with a 25 percent stake. Activision has jumped to
$17.19 from $15.18 on the Nasdaq Stock Market since the deal was
announced July 25.  Activision spokeswoman Maryanne Lataif didn’t immediately
return a request for a comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Hayes v. Activision, CA8885, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
