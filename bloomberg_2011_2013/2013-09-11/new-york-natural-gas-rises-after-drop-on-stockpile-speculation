Natural gas futures gained in New
York after declining yesterday on speculation that government
data will show a larger-than-normal increase in stockpiles of
the power-plant fuel.  Futures for October delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$3.602 per million British thermal units in electronic trading
today on the New York Mercantile Exchange and was at $3.585 at
2:39 p.m. in  Singapore . The contract declined 0.6 percent
yesterday.  An Energy Information Administration report scheduled for
release tomorrow may show inventories grew by 65 billion cubic
feet in the week ended Sept. 6, according to the median of six
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
gain for the week is 62 billion.  “The storage injection possibly coming in above average is
putting pressure on the market,” Phil Flynn, a senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago  said yesterday. “We
had a little bit of a drop in demand last week and inventories
are starting to catch up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
