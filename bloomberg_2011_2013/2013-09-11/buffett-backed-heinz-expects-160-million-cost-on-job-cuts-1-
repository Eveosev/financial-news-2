HJ Heinz Co., the ketchup maker
taken private by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and
 Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital, expects about $160 million in
severance-related expenses tied to job cuts.  About 1,200 employees are affected as part a plan to
eliminate corporate and field positions worldwide, Pittsburgh-based Heinz said today in a regulatory filing. The company
 employed  about 31,900 as of April 28, the end of its fiscal year.  Managers appointed by 3G, including new Chief Executive
Officer Bernardo Hees, are cutting costs as the company faces
payments tied to the financing of the deal. Heinz also shut a
factory in China and reduced manufacturing at a U.K. facility,
according to today’s filing.  “The company is investing in productivity initiatives
designed to increase manufacturing effectiveness and
efficiency,” according to today’s filing.  Buffett, 83, took an $8 billion preferred stake with a 9
percent dividend, meaning Heinz has to pay his Omaha, Nebraska-based company $720 million a year on those securities. The $23.3
billion takeover was completed in June.  Hees that month announced the departure of 11 top
executives. The company said in August that it was eliminating
600 office jobs in the U.S. and  Canada , with more than half the
cuts in Pittsburgh. Heinz also said it was weighing the
elimination of about 250 positions in the U.K. and Ireland.  Heinz posted a net loss of $75.9 million in the period from
Feb. 8 through July 28 as the company incurred merger-related
costs, according to today’s filing. Feb. 8 is the date a merger
subsidiary was created for the deal. 6  To contact the reporter on this story:
