Fatih Birol, the International
Energy Agency’s chief economist, comments on price of oil. He
spoke in an interview today in the Chinese city of Dalian, where
he’s attending the  World Economic Forum ’s Annual Meeting of the
New Champions.  “Oil prices are still very high for the fragile economic
recovery. It’s high for Europe and also too high for developing
Asian countries. It is more than welcome that prices are going
down a bit” and providing room for an economic recovery.  “We need to see the economy grow strong in the next
quarter to come, otherwise, together with Europe, several Asian
countries including China will face difficulties.”  “Oil demand growth is mainly driven by Asia, about two
thirds of the global oil demand is coming from Asia. China is
leading, followed by  India  and other Asean countries, mainly
driven by increasing car ownership levels in the region.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
