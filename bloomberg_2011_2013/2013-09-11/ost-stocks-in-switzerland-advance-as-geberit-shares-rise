Most  Swiss stocks  advanced, after
the Swiss Market Index rose to its highest level in almost four
weeks yesterday, as U.S. President  Barack Obama  postponed a
decision on whether to take military action against Syria.  Schaffner Holding AG (SAHN)  gained 1.9 percent after the maker of
electric components said that sales will grow at a faster pace
in its fiscal second half than they did in the first half.
Kudelski SA, a digital-security company, climbed 1.6 percent.
 Geberit AG (GEBN)  added 1.1 percent as Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded
its recommendation for the maker of toilets and bathroom piping.  The  SMI (SMI)  advanced 0.1 percent to 8,049.83 at 9:43 a.m. in
Zurich as five stocks climbed for every one that dropped. The
equity benchmark has still  fallen 4.2 percent  from this yearâ€™s
high on May 22 as the  Federal Reserve  said it may reduce its
monthly bond purchases if the economy improves in line with its
forecasts. The broader Swiss Performance Index also added 0.1
percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 19 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Swiss stock gauge jumped 1.3 percent yesterday as
reports showed that Chinese industrial production and retail
sales grew at a faster-than-expected pace in August. The SMI has
surged 18 percent this year as central banks around the world
pledged to leave interest rates low for a prolonged period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
