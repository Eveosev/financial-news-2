An outbreak of a virulent strain of
avian influenza reported last month in  Italy  spread in the
provinces of Bologna and Ferrara, according to data released by
the European Commission, the European Unionâ€™s executive arm.  Three more farms confirmed cases of the H7N7 strain of
highly pathogenic avian influenza since Aug. 28, bringing the
total number of outbreaks to six, according to a  presentation 
the commission posted online today from Istituto Zooprofilattico
Sperimentale delle Venezie, a public research institute in
Legnaro, Italy.  Two of the new cases were at industrial farms owned by a
poultry company affected by a previous outbreak, while the third
involved a rural backyard flock, according to the report. Almost
220,000 birds were slaughtered in the three locations to stem
the spread of the disease. More than 730,000 were killed in the
prior three outbreaks, the report showed.  Highly pathogenic  strains  of avian flu can spread rapidly
and be fatal for both domesticated and wild birds, according to
the Paris-based World Organization for  Animal Health , known as
OIE. The most recent highly pathogenic outbreaks in the EU were
in 2010 in Romania and  Bulgaria , according to the OIE. While
Italy has had multiple  cases  of low-pathogenic bird flu since
1997, this is the first highly pathogenic outbreak since 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
