The cost of insuring Australian
company bonds from non-payment decreased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1 basis point to 110
basis points as of 10:41 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The measure is on course for its lowest close
since May 29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 135 basis points
as of 8:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark has fallen 28.7 basis
points this month, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was also little changed at 85
as of 9:49 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge
has declined 5.4 basis points this week, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
