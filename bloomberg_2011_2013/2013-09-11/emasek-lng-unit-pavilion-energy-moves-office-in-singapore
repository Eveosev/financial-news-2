Pavilion Energy, a liquefied
natural gas subsidiary of  Singapore ’s state-owned investment
company, is set to move tomorrow to a new office in the
country’s business center.  The company is relocating to the 26th floor of Marina Bay
Financial Center Tower 3 to be closer to the LNG and financial
communities in Singapore, it said in an e-mailed statement.
Pavilion Energy plans to hire more staff as its business grows,
according to the company.  Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s investment company, set
up Pavilion Energy in April to tap growing demand for liquefied
natural gas in Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
