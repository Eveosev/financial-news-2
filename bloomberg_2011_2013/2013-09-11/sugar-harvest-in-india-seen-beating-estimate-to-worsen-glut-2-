Sugar production in India, the
world’s second-biggest grower, may be more than estimated as the
highest monsoon rainfall in 19 years boosts yields hurt by a
drought a year earlier, a growers’ group said.  The harvest will total 24.5 million tons in the 12 months
starting Oct. 1, compared with 23 million tons predicted in
March, Vinay Kumar, managing director of  National Federation
Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd. , said in a phone interview.
That compares with a crop of 25 million tons this year and more
than the 23.5 million needed to meet domestic demand, he said.
Output may total 23.7 million tons in 2013-2014, the  Indian
Sugar Mills Association  estimates.  Futures are headed for a third-year of losses, the longest
slump since 1992, as the world heads for a fourth year of
surplus in 2013-2014. Worldwide supplies will outpace demand by
4.5 million tons in the season that starts in October, following
a 10.3 million-ton surplus this season, the International Sugar
Organization said Aug. 22. A bigger than estimated crop and
five-year high stockpiles may increase exports from  India .  “Good rainfall in drought-affected Maharashtra and
Karnataka this year has improved prospects for a better
production,” Kumar said today. “The country may make more raw
sugar if there is demand for exports next year.”  Rupee Loss  Monsoon rainfall is 6 percent above a 50-year average since
June 1, according to India Meteorological Department. The
precipitation in the three months ended August 31 was the
highest since 1994, data from the agency showed. Parts of
Maharashtra and Karnataka, which together account for 45 percent
of the country’s sugar output, faced drought because of below-average monsoon rains in the past two years.  Shipments from India may exceed 1 million tons in the year
beginning Oct. 1 as a surplus and a weakening rupee spur demand
among importers, according to Narendra Murkumbi, managing
director of Mumbai-based  Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. (SHRS) , the nation’s
biggest refiner. Exports from the local crop may total 300,000
tons this season, Kumar estimates.  The rupee is the worst performer among 24 major emerging
economies in the past six months on concern that foreign capital
outflows will accelerate as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to
trim stimulus. The currency weakened 14 percent against the
dollar this year, reaching a record low of 68.845 on Aug. 28.  Raw sugar for delivery in October was little changed at
17.19 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 12:13 p.m. in Mumbai
today, while white sugar for December delivery climbed 1.1
percent to $490.90 a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  yesterday.  Rising Stockpiles  Sugar inventories in India may expand 11 percent to about
10 million tons on Oct. 1, 2014, compared with an estimated 9
million tons at the start of 2013-2014 season, Kumar said.  Farmers planted 4.87 million hectares (12 million acres) to
sugar cane as of Sept. 6, compared with 5 million hectares a
year earlier, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Output may
total 24 million tons due to good rains, said Prerana Desai,
vice president for research at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd.  “The yield and recovery would be better because of the
good monsoon,” Desai said by phone from Mumbai. “This is what
has resulted in overall improvement in the production prospects.
Earlier it was expected that because of drought in Maharashtra
and Karnataka last year, we will have dramatically lower
production. But that is not happening, because of improvement in
weather.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
