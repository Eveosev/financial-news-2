Travelers Cos. (TRV) , the only property
insurer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) , spent a record
amount on share repurchases this quarter as it benefits from
lower costs tied to the most severe natural disasters.  The insurer bought back $633 million in stock from July 1
through yesterday, bringing the total this year to about $1.2
billion, Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman, 60, said today at
a Barclays Plc conference. Catastrophe costs this quarter have
been about $30 million after tax, he said.  Travelers and other U.S. property insurers are benefiting
this year from calmer weather after tornadoes and other natural
disasters caused claims costs to spike in recent years. Humberto
became the first hurricane of the Atlantic season today, missing
by three hours the record for the tardiest such storm.  “The third quarter as everyone knows has been benign and
quiet from a windstorm perspective,” Fishman said at the
conference. The New York-based insurer has bought back more than
half its stock since the middle of 2006, he said.  Travelers typically limited repurchases in the third
quarter, during the peak of the  Atlantic hurricane season . The
last time the insurer bought back more than $600 million in
shares in a third quarter was in 2010.  The total this period is the most in any quarter since the
last three months of 2011, when Travelers bought back $1.2
billion in stock. The company was formed by the 2004 merger of
Travelers Property Casualty Corp. and St. Paul Cos.  Catastrophe costs at the insurer were $59 million in last
year’s third quarter and $394 million in the period in 2011. The
Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.  Travelers rose 0.6 percent to $83.01 at 10:20 a.m. in New
York, extending its  gain  to 16 percent this year. That matches
the advance for the 30-company Dow average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
