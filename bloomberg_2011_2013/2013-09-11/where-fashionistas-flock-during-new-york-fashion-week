In town for New York Fashion Week and want to hang with the cool kids?  Cond√© Nast Traveler  Style Director Mark Connolly reveals the fashion flock's favorite places to stay, eat, and shop.   The Hotel:   Standard High Line Who Stays There:  L.A. hipsters, DJs, and modelizers. The Look:  Voyeuristic, with floor- to-ceiling windows meant to unleash your inner exhibitionist. It's also fashion central. There are always post-show parties at the rooftop clubs and lunch at the  Standard Grill  [848 Washington St; 212-645-4646].   The Hangout:   Barbuto , just blocks away, is the best Italian place in the city. Get the pan-fried gnocchi [775 Washington St; 212-924- 9700]. The Shop:   Jeffrey  is where I go if I have a fashion emergency and need a sweater right away. I also love its beauty products [449 W. 14th St]. The Showstopper:  A look from Donna Karan's fall/winter 2013 collection (pictured), as seen in New York. More From  Conde Nast Traveler :
