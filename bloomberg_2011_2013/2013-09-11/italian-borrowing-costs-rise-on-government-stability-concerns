Italian borrowing costs rose at an
auction of one-year bills from the previous sale on concern that
political instability may bring down the government.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros ($11.3
billion) of 364-day bills at 1.34 percent, up from 1.053 percent
at the previous auction on Aug. 12. Investors bid for 1.36 times
the amount offered, from 1.49 at the previous sale. Italy also
sold 3 billion euros of 101-day bills at 0.509 percent, with
investors bidding for 2.29 times the amount offered.  An Italian Senate panel will discuss this week whether to
expel former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  from the
Senate following his conviction for  tax fraud . Berlusconi
threatened on Aug. 30 to withdraw his party’s support for the
current coalition government if he is pushed out, leading to
political instability and possible early elections.  Italy returns to the market tomorrow with the sale of as
much as 7.5 billion euros in longer-maturing bonds. The
country’s 10-year bond yield was 4.52 percent at 11:15 a.m. in
 Rome , leaving the difference with comparable German bunds at 245
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
