Tablet-computer shipments will top
personal computers for the first time in the fourth quarter,
according to a new report by researcher IDC, as consumers
continue to favor mobile devices over laptops and desktops.  Tablet shipments will hit 84.1 million units in the fourth
quarter, compared with 83.1 million for PCs, according to data
published by IDC today. The total market for Internet-connected
devices of desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets will rise
28 percent to $622.4 billion in 2013 and hit $735.1 billion by
the end of 2015, the research group said.  The growth of smartphones and tablets is making up for a
projected 10 percent decline in PC sales this year. The shift to
mobile devices is creating new winners and losers in the
technology industry. While  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  have benefited, stalwarts of the PC business
such as  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Intel Corp. (INTC) 
have seen stagnating sales.  As the market for smartphones and tablets matures, lower
price models are becoming more popular, according to Framingham,
Massachusetts-based IDC. Smartphones and tablets costing less
than $350 will account for 68 percent of all connected-device
shipments, the group said. The average selling price for the
gadgets will shrink to $323 by 2017 from $462 last year, IDC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
