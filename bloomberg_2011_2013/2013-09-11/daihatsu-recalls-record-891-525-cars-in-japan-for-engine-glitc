Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262) ,  Japan ’s biggest
minicar maker, recalled a record number of vehicles totaling
more than it sold in Japan last year because of an engine fault
that may hinder starting.  The carmaker, about 51 percent owned by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
will call back 891,525 minicars in Japan, according to a
statement from Daihatsu. No accidents or injuries have been
reported, according to the statement on the transport ministry’s
website. Minicars are those with engine displacement of no more
than 0.6 liters.  The recall comes amid rising competition from carmakers in
Japan including  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which is focusing on minicar
sales as stagnating wage growth prompts consumers to cut
spending. Daihatsu sold 1.06 million vehicles last year,
including about 677,000 in Japan.  The Osaka-based carmaker rose 3.2 percent to 2,012 yen at
the close in Tokyo trading. The shares have increased 60 percent
over the past 12 months, compared with the 64 percent gain for
the benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average.  Today’s recall covers 11 types of cars made between 2005
and 2010, Daihatsu spokesman Fumihiko Kondou said. Among the
cars recalled, 36 units were exported, he said. Kondou declined
to comment on expected costs related to the recall.  -- Editors: Dave McCombs, Subramaniam Sharma  To contact the reporter on this story:
