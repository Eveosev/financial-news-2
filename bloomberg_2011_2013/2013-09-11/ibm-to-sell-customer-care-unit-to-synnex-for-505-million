International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
sell its customer-care outsourcing business to  Synnex Corp. (SNX)  for
$505 million to focus on more profitable investments.  Synnex will pay $430 million in cash and $75 million in
stock, giving IBM a stake in Synnex, the companies said in
statements yesterday. The unit had $1.3 billion in 2012 sales,
accounting for more than 1 percent of IBM’s revenue. Synnex
shares jumped to a record intraday price.  IBM is getting rid of businesses with lower profit margins
to reach a goal of $20 a share in earnings by 2015, up from
$15.25 last year. The company last year sold its retail-store
systems unit to  Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588)  for $850 million. IBM has had
talks with  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  about selling its division that
makes standard X86 servers, which have become a commodity item
amid increasing competition, people familiar with the matter
said earlier this year.  “As you look at our strategy, we continue to move our
business and transform our business to the higher-value
spaces,” said Lori Steele, general manager of IBM Global
Process Services, in an interview. “We’re trying to focus on
software and analytics.”  The company, based in Armonk,  New York , said earlier this
year that it would sell assets to make up for a $1 billion
charge to cut jobs. IBM excluded the charge from its 2013
earnings forecast, saying future divestitures would make up for
the expense.  Lower Margins  The customer service unit had a gross profit margin of
about 20 percent, IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said in a  presentation  to investors earlier this year. That
compares with margins of about 60 percent for newer businesses
like analytics and cloud computing.  Synnex, based in Fremont,  California , said the transaction
will add 55 cents in earnings per share in the first 12 months
after it closes the deal. Its shares jumped more than 20 percent
to $57.59 at the close in New York, an all-time high. IBM rose
2.2 percent to $190.70.  To contact the reporters on this story:
