Brazil’s real extended its decline
from a one-month high as economic growth concern overshadowed
the central bank’s efforts to buoy the currency.  The real depreciated 0.6 percent to 2.2970 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:26 a.m. in Sao Paulo even after the central bank sold
currency swaps for $497 million under a $60 billion intervention
program. Swap rates on contracts due in January 2015 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.35 percent.  Brazil economic activity contracted 0.9 percent in July
from a month earlier, according to the median forecast of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the central bank’s Sept.
13 report.  “The real’s headwinds dominate,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin
America currency strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia , wrote in an
e-mailed research note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
