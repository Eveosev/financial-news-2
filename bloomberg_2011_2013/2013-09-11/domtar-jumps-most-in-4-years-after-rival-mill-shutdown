Domtar Corp. (UFS) , Canada’s largest
paper producer by market value, jumped the most in four years
after  International Paper Co. (IP)  said it will close an Alabama
mill, reducing output of so-called white paper.  Domtar gained 16 percent to C$79 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest increase for the Montreal-based company  since  August
2009. The plant closing, which removes about 7 to 8 percent of
North American capacity, may be the single largest in the
industry’s history, Mark Wilde, an analyst with Deutsche Bank AG
in New York, wrote in a note to clients today.  International Paper’s announcement comes after Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific LLC and Idaho-based  Boise Inc. (BZ)  cut output.
Electronic commerce and the rise of the Internet have reduced
office paper demand, which is shrinking about 4 percent a year,
said Daryl Swetlishoff, an analyst with Raymond James Ltd. in
 Vancouver .  “The reason the stock’s up so hard is the removal of this
kind of capacity is so significant,” he said in a phone
interview today. “It goes a long way to balancing the market
going forward.”  The plant closing will cut production of uncoated freesheet
by 765,000 tons, Memphis, Tennessee-based International Paper
said in a statement. Uncoated freesheet is used in forms,
envelopes, copiers and printers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
