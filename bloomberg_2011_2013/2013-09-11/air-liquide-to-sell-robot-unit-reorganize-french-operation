Air Liquide SA (SU) , the French maker of
industrial gases, is in talks to sell a welding-robot unit to
 Groupe Gorge (GOE)  and will unveil a reorganization of its domestic
operations to unions tomorrow.  The robot unit, which is part of Air Liquide Welding
 France , has annual sales of about 7 million euros ($9.3 million)
and employs 53 people, said Anne Bardot, vice president of group
communications at Air Liquide. She declined to provide details
of the reorganization at Air Liquide France Industrie ahead of
tomorrow’s meeting with union representatives.  Chief Executive Officer Benoit Potier has said he will
unveil a strategy this December to manage the challenges of
 Europe ’s economic woes, growing industrial capacity in  emerging
markets , cheaper U.S. gas, and rising demand for health-care
services and electronic goods such as tablets. In February, the
group raised its savings target for the period from 2011 to 2015
by 30 percent to 1.3 billion euros.  The group’s net income declined to 752 million euros in the
first half from 784 million euros a year earlier amid a 50-million euro restructuring charge linked to job cuts in Europe,
the Paris-based company said on July 30.  Challenges magazine first reported the planned sale of the
robot unit and reorganization at Air Liquide France Industrie.
Air Liquide denied that the entire Welding France unit is being
sold, as reported by the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
