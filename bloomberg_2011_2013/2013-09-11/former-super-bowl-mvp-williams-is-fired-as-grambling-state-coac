Former Super Bowl Most Valuable
Player Doug Williams was fired as Grambling State University’s
football coach after 12 losses in the last 13 games.  Williams, 58, returned to the school where he played
college football in 2011 after less than a year as general
manager of the  United Football League ’s franchise in  Virginia .
Williams previously coached Grambling State from 1998 through
2003 following Eddie Robinson’s retirement.  The Tigers started 0-2 this season after going 1-10 last 
year.  “We recognize Doug Williams’s many contributions to our
football legacy,” Frank Pogue, president of the Grambling, 
Louisiana-based school, said in a  statement . “We wish him well 
in the future.”  Williams was voted the 1988 Super Bowl MVP for the
 Washington Redskins  after becoming the first black quarterback
to play in the NFL’s championship game. He worked in the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers’ front office from 2004 through 2010.  Grambling State running backs coach George Ragsdale, who
played in the NFL with the Buccaneers from 1977-79, primarily as
a kick returner, was named interim coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
