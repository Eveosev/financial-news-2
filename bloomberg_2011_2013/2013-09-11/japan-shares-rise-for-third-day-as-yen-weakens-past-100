Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index climbing a third day, after the yen weakened past
100 per dollar as the  U.S. Senate  backed away from a vote
authorizing a military strike against Syria.  The Topix gained 0.8 percent to 1,199.11 as of 9:01 a.m. in
Tokyo. The yen traded at 100.31 per dollar. The U.S. Senate
stepped back from a vote to permit air strikes as Russia brokers
a plan for the Middle Eastern country to surrender its chemical
weapons. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.6 percent to
14,504.89.  “Investors are taking on more risk amid a global stock
rally as concern recedes over military intervention,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , a Tokyo-based equities manager at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest lender.
“That’s pushing the yen downward, which is raising expectations
for higher earnings at Japanese exporters.”  The Topix surged 38 percent this year through yesterday,
with Japanese equities performing the best among developed
markets tracked by Bloomberg, amid optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  can lead the country out of
deflation through unprecedented monetary easing.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The measure climbed yesterday in New York, extending the
longest winning streak since July, as data showed  China’s
economy  is improving and tension over Syria receded.  The Topix traded at 1.24 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.47 times for the  S&P 500 Index  and 1.74 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Japanese gauge’s  historic volatility  was at 24.15 yesterday,
compared with its five-year median of 19.42.  To contact the reporters on this story:
