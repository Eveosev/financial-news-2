California lawmakers moved closer
to sending Governor  Jerry Brown  a bill to overhaul standardized
testing of school children, even as federal officials say they
may withhold funding if the measure becomes law.  The bill, which passed the Senate yesterday 25-7, would
have the most populous U.S. state scrap the multiple-choice
printed test students have taken for more than two decades, to
be replaced by computerized math and language exams tied to new
national curriculum standards adopted by 45 states.  Senate approval came even after U.S. Education Secretary
Arne Duncan warned California that the state may lose federal
education funds if it switches systems. The state would be left
without required test scores while the new exams are brought
online, he said.  “This vote brings us a step closer to trading our outdated
fill-in-the-bubble paper tests for new, computerized assessments
that model the skills today’s students need,” state
Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson said in a
statement. “If we want our education system to inspire students
to learn to think critically and solve problems, we need tests
to match those lofty goals.”  The bill heads back to the Assembly for a final vote on
amendments before going to Brown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
