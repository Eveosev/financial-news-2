(Correct names in second paragraph under Classified Briefing subhead. See EXTRA for more on the Syria conflict.)  The  U.S. Senate  is putting off consideration of a resolution authorizing strikes against Syria to give President  Barack Obama  the “time and space” to pursue diplomacy with  Russia , Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said.  Obama has postponed a decision on military action against Syria, sparing himself a possible political defeat at home and plunging the U.S. into potentially protracted negotiations with a global rival.  After telling the nation 10 days ago he would ask Congress to authorize the use of military force, Obama reversed course last night in a nationally televised address and said he would pursue a proposal by Russia to have Syria surrender its stockpiles of chemical arms to international authorities.  The diplomatic initiative prompted Senate leaders to put on hold consideration of a use-of-force resolution, which lawmakers said would be a difficult vote with an uncertain outcome in a chamber where more than a third of the members were against authorization or leaning toward opposition before the president’s speech.  “Leaders in Damascus and Moscow should understand that Congress will be watching these negotiations very closely,” Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said today. If there was a sign it may be a “ploy,” the Senate would resume plans to authorize military strikes, he said.  Geneva Talks  Secretary of State  John Kerry  will meet with Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  tomorrow in Geneva, and Obama said he will continue talking with President  Vladimir Putin . The U.S., U.K. and France will work together at the  United Nations , where there already is discord over how tough language would be in a council resolution.  The five permanent members of the UN Security Council will meet today to discuss a draft resolution offered by France, according a diplomat at the world body who asked not to be identified in advance of the session.  Russia has given the U.S. a chemical weapons proposal for discussion by Kerry and Lavrov, according to a Russian official who asked not to be identified discussing internal developments.  In pursuing the Russian initiative, Obama is casting his lot with Putin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s primary patron, who has emerged as Obama’s chief international antagonist in his second term.  “It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,” Obama said in remarks from the East Room of the White House last night. The initiative “has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad’s strongest allies.”  Russian Prestige  Putin’s involvement, after Russia has consistently blocked action against its ally Assad, “is significant,” White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said today. “Russia is now putting its prestige on the line.”  Carney refused to estimate how long it would take for negotiations, logistical arrangements and technical matters. “This is a process that will take a certain amount of time but it needs to be credible, it needs to be verifiable,” he told reporters in Washington.  Democratic Senator  Bob Casey  of Pennsylvania, co-chairman of the Senate Caucus on Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism, said the Russian proposal has “some potential,” though his initial reaction was to doubt it given the “lack of credibility on the part of the Russians and the Syrian regime.”  “But let’s not kid ourselves -- the chances of this happening are a lot less than 50 percent,” he said today on CNN.  ‘Stalling Tactic’  Republican Senator  John McCain  of Arizona, the most prominent advocate for aiding the Syrian rebels and using U.S. strikes to help their fight, said the Russian initiative seems to be a “stalling tactic.”  “I worry we have a kind of a game of rope-a-dope for awhile and the slaughter goes on” during diplomatic negotiations over Russia’s proposal, McCain told reporters at a Wall Street Journal breakfast.  A failure to reach a disarmament agreement in the next few days “would strengthen the president’s hand to go back to Congress and say, ‘Look, I tried this avenue and it’s been rejected,’” McCain said.  House Democratic leaders also aren’t pressing for an immediate resolution, Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview after a classified briefing today on Syria. House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi  of California said yesterday before Obama’s speech that “leverage” with the Russian would be “diminished” without support from Congress.  Classified Briefing  In a classified briefing for House members, administration officials said that there will be “a new series of assessments next week” after Kerry’s Geneva talks and following a report from UN weapons inspectors, according to Representative Steve Israel, a  New York  Democrat.  Representative Jim Moran, a Virginia Democrat, said a use-of-force resolution would fail in the House if there were a vote today. Representative  Chris Van Hollen , a Maryland Democrat, said he’s working on a revised resolution that would be ready if Obama again asks for authorization.  Over the past week, a majority of members in the  House of Representatives  came out in opposition to the president’s request for authorization for military strikes against Syria. A variety of polls show the public is opposed.  “I would be very surprised if we do take action or that a vote is ever required on this,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the House Republican leadership. “I don’t think opinion in Congress would change.”  World’s Policeman  Obama’s speech, on the eve of today’s anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., underscores how conflict in the region continues to dominate his foreign policy even as the president has said he wants the nation to move on from years of armed conflict.  The president spent much of his 16-minute address repeating his arguments justifying the use of force to deter any future use of chemical weapons, even as he said the U.S. can’t be “the world’s policeman.”  “When, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act,” he said.  Obama emphasized his skepticism about whether Syria would comply and said he has instructed U.S. military commanders to be ready to strike at a moment’s notice.  Oil Supplies  Obama’s strategy won the endorsement of France, the principal U.S. ally in any military venture against Assad. French President  Francois Hollande  voiced “determination” to work through the UN Security Council while “remaining mobilized” to punish Syria for using chemical weapons, according to an e-mailed statement.  Optimism that the U.S. would avoid a new military conflict in a region that pumps about a third of global oil supplies helped send stocks higher. West Texas Intermediate rose for the first time in three days, due to supply influences. WTI for October delivery rose 40 cents to $107.79 a barrel at 1:15 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The first complications along the diplomatic path emerged yesterday. Putin set as a condition for pushing Syria to comply that the U.S. and other nations renounce using force against Assad’s regime. Putin has consistently blocked United Nations efforts to punish Assad over conduct of the two-and-a-half-year civil war as well as the alleged Aug. 21 chemical attacks near Damascus that the U.S. estimates killed more than 1,400 civilians.  War Crimes  Separately, a report by the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for  Human Rights  found that Assad’s forces and the rebel fighters both are guilty of committing  war crimes  as they carry out attacks directed against civilians, shelling villages, arson, sniper attacks and systematic executions. The report is the sixth in a series by the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, and draws on interviews with 259 people conducted between May and July 15.  At least eight “massacres” have been committed by the Assad regime and one by the opposition in the past year and a half, and the commission is investigating nine more suspected mass killings since March, the report said.  A separate UN team of 13 chemical weapons experts and scientists is expected to complete its report by the middle of next week on its investigation of the Aug. 21 attack.
