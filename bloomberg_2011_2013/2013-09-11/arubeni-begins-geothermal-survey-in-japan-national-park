Marubeni Corp. (8002)  began a geothermal
survey of Daisetsuzan National Park on the northern island of
Hokkaido that will continue through February in the hopes  Japan 
will discover more clean-energy sources.  The Tokyo-based trading company will study the geology of
the area with more tests to follow once officials find enough
evidence of geothermal resources, Marubeni said today in a
 statement .  Last year, Japan revised rules for geothermal power
projects in national parks where more than 80 percent of the
countryâ€™s resources are to try to increase energy supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
