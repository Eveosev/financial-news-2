Wilmington Trust Co., a unit of  M&T
Bank Corp. (MTB) , was sued by heirs to Mennen Co., maker of Speed
Stick deodorant, seeking more than $100 million in damages for
investment losses.  Mennen, based in Morristown,  New Jersey , and sold to New
York-based  Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL)  in 1992 for $670 million, was
founded in 1878. A descendant, George S. Mennen, set up a trust
in 1970, according to formerly sealed court papers in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington.  The heirs, including Kathryn Mennen, a granddaughter of
George S. Mennen, contend in a redacted complaint that
Wilmington Trust took no restorative action as George Jeffrey
Mennen, a co-trustee and her uncle, “wrongly dissipated” trust
assets through investments in failing businesses.  The case is in the document-discovery stage, with the heirs
alleging in papers made public today that the bank produced as
evidence “only self-serving legal advice favorable to
Wilmington Trust while withholding other legal advice that
undercut its position.”  Lawyers  Thomas W. Briggs Jr. , representing Wilmington
Trust, and  Jeffrey S. Cianciulli  representing the Mennen
defendant, didn’t immediately reply to e-mail requests for
comment on the suit.  The case is Mennen v. Wilmington Trust Co., CA8432,
 Delaware  Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
