An Indian judge said four men
convicted of the fatal gang rape of a student aboard a moving
bus in New Delhi in a case that shocked the country will be
sentenced on Sept. 13.  The judge heard arguments today by the prosecution and
defense lawyers in the nation’s capital after finding the
accused guilty yesterday of offenses including kidnapping,
murder, robbery and destruction of evidence. The victim’s
parents and prosecutors have demanded the death penalty saying
it was the only acceptable punishment for what the men did to
their daughter.  “The sentence, which is appropriate, is nothing short of
death,” special public prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told the court
as the four convicts stood at the back of the room, displaying
no outward emotion during today’s hearing. “There can be
nothing more diabolical. There is no element of sympathy in the
way in which the hapless woman was tortured.”  The attack on the medical student in December spurred weeks
of nationwide protests, triggered an unprecedented debate about
sexual violence in the world’s largest democracy and prompted
the government to impose stricter punishments. Tougher laws have
failed to deter criminals even as a photographer at a magazine
in Mumbai and a female police constable in the eastern state of
Jharkhand were gang raped last month.  Vivek Sharma, a defense lawyer for one of the men, argued
for life imprisonment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
