Former Formula One champion Kimi Raikkonen is rejoining the Ferrari team that dropped him four
years ago.  Raikkonen, who won the 2007 title with the Italian team,
will drive alongside two-time champion Fernando Alonso for the
2014 and 2015 seasons, Ferrari said today in an e-mailed
statement. Raikkonen will replace Felipe Massa.  It will be the first time Ferrari paired two champions
since 1953 when Giuseppe Farina and Alberto Ascari raced
together.  Raikkonen, a 33-year-old Finn, left Formula One to compete
in the World Rally Championship for Citroen after being dropped
by Ferrari in 2009 and replaced by Alonso.  He returned to the series with Lotus in 2012, winning two
races and taking 11 more podium places since then. He’s had 20
career wins, and is fourth in the standings after 12 of 19 races
this season.  Brazil ’s Massa, 32, has raced for Ferrari since 2006. He
took the last of his 11 race wins in 2008, and is seventh in the
2013 championship.  Raikkonen was the last Ferrari driver to win the title.
Alonso is second overall this year, 53 points behind Red Bull’s
Sebastian Vettel, who’s seeking a fourth consecutive
championship.  The next race is in  Singapore  on Sept. 22, and the season
ends in Sao Paulo on Nov. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
