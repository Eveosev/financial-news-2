Total SA (FP)  failed to sell Russian
Urals blend in the Mediterranean at a lower differential than
yesterday. BP Plc withdrew its bid for  North Sea  Forties crude.  Ghana ’s Jubilee oil field will be shut for 21 days from
Sept. 20, Tullow Oil Plc, the operator, said today in an e-mailed statement.  North Sea  BP earlier bid Forties for Sept. 22 to Sept. 25 loading at
80 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. The company bought two cargoes yesterday at
premiums of 65 cents and $1.09 respectively.  Brent for October settlement traded at $111.78 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $111.25 from the previous session. The November
contract was at $110.55, a discount of $1.23 to October.  Corrosion was discovered at ConocoPhillips’s Ekofisk field,
 Norway ’s Petroleum Safety Authority commented in an e-mail
response to questions from  Bloomberg News .  PSA has no information regarding Ekofisk production or of
any shutdown, said Oyvind Midttun, a spokesman for the agency.  The Ekofisk field is producing as normal, Stig Kvendseth, a
Conoco spokesman, said earlier today by e-mail. He didn’t
comment on corrosion.  Urals/Mediterranean  Total failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for Sept.
26 to Sept. 30 loading at 10 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.
This compares with a trade yesterday at a 5-cent discount.  OAO Lukoil was unable to sell 100,000 tons for Sept. 23 to
Sept. 27 at 95 cents a barrels less than Dated Brent delivered
to Rotterdam, according to the survey. The grade was last bid at
a discount of 90 cents on Sept. 9.  Libya ’s oil production is at 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a
day, Prime Minister Ali Zaidan said at a press conference in
Tripoli.  Pumping of Iraqi Kirkuk crude to the Turkish port of Ceyhan
started at 8 p.m. local time yesterday and stopped at 7 a.m.
this morning, according to Boutros Maritime & Transport SA. This
isn’t unusual because crude flows normally occur during
evenings.  West Africa  BP offered 600,000 barrels of Nigerian Qua Iboe for loading
on Sept. 11 to Sept. 12 at $6 a barrel more than Dated Brent
delivered to Rotterdam, or at a premium of $5.85 for delivery to
Lavera,  France , according to the survey. The price was unchanged
from yesterday, while the volume dropped from 950,000 barrels.  Jubilee Partners will undertake planned, routine
maintenance of the floating production, storage and offloading
vessel Kwame Nkrumah, Tullow said. “During the 21 day period of
maintenance, FPSO will be shut down and there will be no
production.”  This is the first planned maintenance since the FPSO
started operations in end-2010, according to the company.  PT Pertamina will re-issue a tender to buy crude for
November delivery to its Cilacap and Balikpapan refineries,
according to a company official who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  Indonesia ’s
state-owned oil company failed to award a previous tender that
closed Sept. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
