Alfonso Soriano  hit his second
homer of the game in a four-run eighth inning as the New York
Yankees rallied to a 7-5 win at the  Baltimore Orioles .  The Yankees (77-68) are two games behind the Tampa Bay Rays
in the race for the second of two wild-card spots in the
American League. The Cleveland Indians and Orioles (77-67) are 1
1/2 games behind the Rays. Tampa Bay lost 2-0 to the Boston Red
Sox last night and the Texas Rangers, who hold the first wild-card slot, lost for the fifth time in six games, 5-4 against the
Pittsburgh Pirates.  Alex Rodriguez  gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the third
inning with a run-scoring double at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.  Chris Davis hit his Major League Baseball-leading 49th home
run in the fifth to give the Orioles a 4-1 advantage before
Soriano and  Mark Reynolds  started the sixth inning with a home
run each.  In the eighth,  Robinson Cano  tied the game 4-4 with a
single, Soriano had a two-run homer and Reynolds drove in Curtis Granderson on a double that put the Yankees ahead 7-4.  Adam Warren (2-2) struck out one in a perfect seventh
inning for the win and Mariano Rivera recorded his 42nd save.
Kevin Gausman (2-5) allowed three runs on three hits for the
loss.  The Yankees and Orioles have split the first two games of
their four-game series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
