Sweden ’s central bank will raise
its main lending  rate  to 1.2 percent over the next year,
according to a survey of labor market groups, purchasing
managers and money market participants commissioned by the
central bank.  Consumer prices  will rise 1 percent in the next 12 months
compared with 0.9 percent in the previous survey published in
June, and 1.5 percent the following year, the TNS Sifo Prospera
survey showed.  Sweden’s central bank last week kept its benchmark repo
rate unchanged at 1 percent for a fourth consecutive meeting and
predicted it won’t raise it until late next year to aid a
recovery and bring  inflation  closer to its 2 percent target.  The Riksbank will raise its key rate to 1.7 percent in the
next two years as the $540 billion  economy  will grow 1.4 percent
in the next 12 months and 1.9 percent the following year,
according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
