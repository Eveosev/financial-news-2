South African yellow-corn futures
rose the most in more than two weeks on speculation that this
season’s shipments, already more than double the amount exported
last year, are crimping stocks.  “There is not a lot more available for exports,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed
response to questions today. “ South Africa  remains tight on
maize stocks,” he said, using another term for corn.  The nation has exported 940,504 tons of yellow corn since
the season started on April 27, according to data from the South
African Grain Information Service. That compares with the
cumulative total of 53,370 tons in the same period a year
earlier and 413,152 tons for all of the previous season.  Japan 
is the biggest buyer, purchasing 577,707 tons since April.  South Africa, which is also the continent’s largest corn
grower, uses yellow corn mainly as  animal feed , while meal made
from the white variety is one of South Africa’s staple foods.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 1.7 percent to 2,188 rand ($221) a metric ton,
the most since Aug. 26, by the close in Johannesburg. The white
variety for delivery in the same period, gained 0.8 percent to
2,349 rand a ton.  Wheat for delivery in December dropped 0.3 percent to 3,377
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
