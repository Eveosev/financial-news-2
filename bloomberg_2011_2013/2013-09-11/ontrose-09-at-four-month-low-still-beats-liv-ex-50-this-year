A case of 2009 Chateau Montrose, an
estate in  Bordeaux ’s Saint-Estephe district, sold for 2,225
pounds ($3,490) on Liv-ex this week, touching its lowest level
since May while still outpacing the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index.  The transaction Sept. 9 came after six cases of the vintage
sold for 2,250 pounds each between Sept. 3 and Sept. 6, near the
level of similar deals in the second half of August that brought
some stability after price swings in the past six months.  Montrose ’09 has risen 11 percent since the end of last
year, compared with a 4 percent gain for the Liv-ex 50 tracking
top Bordeaux wines. The 2009 and 2010 vintages from premium
Bordeaux growers were among the highest priced of the past two
decades following favorable growing conditions.  “The ’09s and ’10s exist in a bit of a market of their
own,” said  Chris Smith , an investment manager at The Wine
Investment Fund in  London . “They were so expensive up-front
that they’re only being bought for investment.” The fund,
invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  Montrose 2009 fetched 1,305 pounds in June 2010, soon after
it went on sale, and is now trading 70 percent above that level.
Recent declines have taken it 5 percent down from the record
reached in July.  The 2009 Montrose is the estate’s highest-priced vintage
since 1990, according to merchant data collated by Liv-ex.  ‘Mulberry Fruit’  It scored a perfect 100 points from U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , who described it in an online tasting note last year as
having “massive blackberry, black currant and mulberry fruit
intermixed with forest floor, damp earth, crushed rocks and a
hint of spring flowers.” He estimated it would be drinkable
until 2050 or beyond.  Chateau Montrose has been owned since 2006 by Martin and
Olivier Bouygues, who run Paris-based construction and media
company  Bouygues SA. (EN)  The estate is ranked as a second-growth
vineyard in the Bordeaux classification drawn up for Napoleon
III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition. That puts it among the top 20
producers in the Medoc region to the north of the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
