Vietnam ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the five-year yield to the highest level since March, on
speculation a pickup in lending means banks have less funds to
invest in the securities. The dong declined.  The value of outstanding loans increased 5.6 percent in the
first eight months of this year, Thoi Bao Kinh Te Vietnam
newspaper reported last week. Reaching the full-year credit-growth target of 12 percent is “very feasible,” State Bank of
Vietnam Deputy Governor Nguyen Dong Tien said in June.  “When credit growth was very slow, banks had abundant
liquidity so they boosted bond purchases,” Ha Thi Thu Hang and
Dang Mai Trang, Hanoi-based analysts at Bao Viet Securities Co.,
wrote in a research note e-mailed yesterday. Now that loan
growth is speeding up, bond trading has dropped, they wrote.  The  five-year  yield rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 8.8 percent, according to a daily fixing
from lenders compiled by Bloomberg. That is the highest level
since March 28.  The dong declined 0.1 percent to 21,125 per dollar as of
4:25 p.m. in Hanoi, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  State
Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 21,036, unchanged
since June 28, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
