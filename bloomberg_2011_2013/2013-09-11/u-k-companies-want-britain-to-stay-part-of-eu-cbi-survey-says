Almost eighty percent of U.K.
business leaders say Britain should remain a member of the
European Union, according to a survey by the  Confederation of
British Industry .  Only 10 percent said it was in Britain’s interests to leave
the bloc, the U.K.’s biggest business lobby said in a report
published in London today.  “Firms want what is best for jobs and growth, and there is
genuine concern that an exit would hit business investment and
access to the world’s largest trading bloc,” CBI Director-General  John Cridland  said. “Businesses do have some serious
concerns about the EU, but ultimately they want the U.K. inside
the tent winning the argument for reform.”  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  has promised a referendum
on EU membership by the end of 2017 if a Conservative government
is elected in the 2015 general election. The opposition  Labour
Party  has yet to say whether it would hold a referendum if it
wins.  The CBI survey found there is frustration among business
leaders with Britain’s current relationship with the EU and the
burden of regulation. The benefits of membership outweigh
drawbacks, respondents said, with 71 percent saying it has a
positive or very positive impact on their businesses.  The poll covered 415 companies and trade associations that
between them employ more than 1.5 million people. The survey,
conducted by  YouGov Plc (YOU)  between June 13 and July 30, had a
response rate of 27.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
