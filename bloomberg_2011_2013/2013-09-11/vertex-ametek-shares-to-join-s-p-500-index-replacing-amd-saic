Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX)  and
 Ametek Inc. (AME)  will join the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, replacing
 Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  and SAIC Inc.  AMD, the second-biggest maker of personal-computer
processors, is being removed because its market value is too
small for the U.S. equity benchmark, S&P Dow Jones Indices said
today in a statement. SAIC, a government contractor, plans to
split into two companies in a transaction due to be completed
this month, according to the statement from the index provider.  The revisions in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  may prompt money managers to
shift holdings to match the adjustments. About $5.1 trillion was
benchmarked to the index, according to the company’s website.
The changes will take place after the close of trading on Sept.
20, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.  Vertex, a maker of drugs for hepatitis C, climbed 3.4
percent to $82.49 in trading after the close of U.S. exchanges.
Ametek, which makes electrical equipment, added 1.1 percent to
$45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
