A government agency in  Canada , the
world’s second-largest wheat exporter, may use satellite images
to estimate production for a harvest-season report rather than
surveying thousands of farmers by telephone.  Statistics Canada , which releases eight crop reports
annually based on farmer surveys, will evaluate the accuracy of
satellite images to estimate yields and production,  Jeffrey
Smith , the director of the agriculture division, said by
telephone from Ottawa. The results will be compared with this
month’s government survey of farmers.  The agency, which is seeking C$33.9 million ($32.8 million)
in budget cuts by next year, will decide by March 31 whether the
images are sufficient to make its annual September forecast,
which will be released this year on Oct. 4, Smith said. The
primary motivation for considering the switch was to decrease
the amount of time that farmers spend responding to surveys
during the harvest, he said.  “We’re not trying to reduce the information or make big
cost reductions,” Smith said.“We’re looking for ways to do our
work better. Satellite technology is interesting, and it’s
innovative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
