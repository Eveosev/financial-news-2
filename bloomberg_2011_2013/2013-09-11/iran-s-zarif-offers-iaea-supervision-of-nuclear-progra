  Iran ’s nuclear program must remain
peaceful and be conducted under International Atomic Energy
Agency supervision, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said
in an interview with state-controlled PressTV.  Zarif’s comment comes a day after President Hassan Rohani
said Iran plans to restart nuclear talks with world powers in
 New York  when he attends the  United Nations General Assembly 
this month. On Sept. 9, Zarif said he was ready to meet with
China, France, Germany, Russia, the U.K. and U.S. to resolve the
nuclear issue.  “The U.S. can play a key role in the success of the talks
or their failure,” said Zarif, who last week replaced Saeed Jalili as Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator. “The Islamic
Republic seeks negotiations to find a solution and therefore it
is important for us that talks begin properly.”  Joseph Macmanus, the U.S. envoy to the IAEA said Washington
was ready to work with Rohani’s government to “reach a
diplomatic solution that will fully address the international
community’s concerns about  Iran’s nuclear program .”  Iran has continued to expand its nuclear enrichment
capability by installing advanced centrifuges, the agency said.
The UN’s atomic watchdog said Sept. 9 that Iran wasn’t
cooperating with IAEA inspectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
