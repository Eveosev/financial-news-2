African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG) , the
producer that has slumped 73 percent since it listed in London,
said Chief Operating Officer Marco Zolezzi departed three weeks
after the company’s chief executive officer left the company.  Zolezzi has resigned with immediate effect, African Barrick
said in a statement today. Brad Gordon, who succeeded Greg
Hawkins as CEO last month, will take direct responsibility for
operations while a search for a replacement is underway.  African Barrick has been dogged by operational setbacks
since it was spun off from Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. in
2010, and has struggled to meet production targets. The company
is reviewing its operations to cut costs that have ballooned by
71 percent since 2010.  “This move is not a huge surprise, as this will allow Mr
Gordon to place an immediate stamp on the business as he takes
over the interim COO role before he finds his own choice,”
Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a note to investors today.  African Barrick  fell  5.7 percent to 157 pence by 9:30 a.m.
in  London  extending its loss this year to 64 percent.  When African Barrick listed in London the company said it
was targeting annual production of 1 million ounces in 2014.
Instead, it has posted output declines for three consecutive
years and has been surpassed by rivals Randgold Resources Ltd.
and Petropavlovsk Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
