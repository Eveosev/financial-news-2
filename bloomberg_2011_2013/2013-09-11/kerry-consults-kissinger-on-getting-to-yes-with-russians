Secretary of State  John Kerry  consulted with  Henry Kissinger , the 90-year-old embodiment of Cold War foreign policy, before heading off to negotiate with his Russian counterpart over Syria’s chemical weapons.  After meeting yesterday with former Secretary Kissinger at the State Department, Kerry brought other U.S.-Russia specialists on his plane that left for Geneva for two days of meetings starting today with Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov , according to a U.S. official who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to comment.  Kerry and Lavrov will seek common ground on Syria turning over its chemical weapons to international control to avoid a U.S. military strike intended to punish what the Obama administration says was President Bashar al-Assad’s gassing of 1,400 Syrians on Aug. 21. Russia seized on a passing remark by Kerry earlier this week about a weapons turnover in proposing just that.  Though the meeting with Kissinger was planned before the latest developments in Syria, Kerry was eager to draw on the older man’s experience in communicating effectively with Russian diplomats, the U.S. official said. Kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the  Soviet Union  and served as secretary of State and national security adviser to Republican President  Richard Nixon . The U.S. official described Kerry as a fan of Kissinger’s 1994 book, “Diplomacy.”  Kerry consulted all the living former secretaries of State before taking his post early this year and checks back with them regularly, including twice in the last two days with  Madeleine Albright , who held the post under Democratic President Bill Clinton, the official said.  Kissinger-Putin Meetings  U.S. officials -- and the companies that pay Kissinger Associates Inc., the consulting firm he founded -- aren’t alone in tapping Kissinger’s thoughts on great-power politics.  Early last year, Kissinger met in Moscow to discuss world affairs with Russian leader  Vladimir Putin , whose press secretary described the men as “old friends” and said that they had previously met eight to 10 times, including over dinner at Kissinger’s home in  New York .  Putin values everyone’s point of view, “especially such a wise man as Henry Kissinger,” Dmitri S. Peskov told the New York Times in January 2012.  In Putin’s book “First Person,” he recounted a conversation with Kissinger in the early 1990s when Putin, then an aide to the mayor of  St. Petersburg , picked up the German-born U.S. diplomat at the airport.  Putin’s Praise  Kissinger impressed Putin by saying that he too got his start as an intelligence specialist, and that former Soviet leader  Mikhail Gorbachev  withdrew his nation’s forces from Eastern Europe too quickly.  “I told him what I thought and I will repeat it now: Kissinger was right,” Putin wrote.  Kerry yesterday addressed a meeting of his bipartisan 25-member Foreign Affairs Policy Board and hosted a dinner for the group before boarding his plane. The chairman of the advisory board, created by Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  in 2011, is Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of State under President  Bill Clinton  and a U.S.-Russia and arms control specialist.
