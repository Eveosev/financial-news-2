Former  New York  Rangers captain
Mark Messier was named the chief executive officer of the
Kingsbridge National Ice Center in New York, which is planned to
be the largest indoor skating complex in the world.  Messier, 52, stepped down as a special assistant to team
President Glen Sather in June to help develop the center, which
is scheduled to open in 2017. As CEO, he will oversee its
operation as well as development, according to a statement.  Former Deutsche Bank AG asset manager  Kevin Parker  is
investing $275 million to turn the vacant Kingsbridge Armory in
the Bronx borough of New York into a 750,000-square-foot skating
center with nine regulation-size rinks.  Messier won six Stanley Cups as a player, including 1994,
when he led the Rangers to the National Hockey League title that
ended the franchiseâ€™s 54-year championship drought.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
