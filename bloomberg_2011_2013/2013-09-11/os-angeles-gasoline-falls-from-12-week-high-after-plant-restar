Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  fell
from a 12-week high against futures after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  began
restarting a fluid catalytic cracker at a Southern California
refinery and gasoline supplies on the West Coast increased.  California-blend gasoline in Los Angeles weakened by 6
cents to a premium of 36.5 cents a gallon more than futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:20 p.m. East Coast time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell from a premium
that was the highest since June 20.  Phillips 66 began restarting the FCC at its refinery near
Los Angeles yesterday after a transformer failed over the
weekend. The refinery flared gases as it was starting the unit,
which upgrades vacuum gasoil into higher-value products such as
gasoline, according to a filing with the California Governor’s
Office of  Emergency Services .  Gasoline supplies  on the West Coast increased by 244,000
barrels to 28.8 million last week, according to data released by
the Energy Information Administration.  State-blend gasoline in  San Francisco  weakened by 2 cents
to a premium of 49 cents a gallon to New York futures. That was
the highest level since Oct. 5.  State-blend diesel in San Francisco weakened 0.5 cent to a
7-cent premium to ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Nymex. The fuel
in Los Angeles was unchanged at a premium of 3.25 cents.  West Coast  diesel stockpiles  grew by 955,000 barrels, the
largest jump in two months, to 12.3 million.  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline  in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
strengthened by 2.5 cents to a premium of 24 cents a gallon
above  New York  futures. It’s now at the highest level since July
11.  Low-sulfur diesel  in the city strengthened by 0.25 cent to a
premium of 1.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
