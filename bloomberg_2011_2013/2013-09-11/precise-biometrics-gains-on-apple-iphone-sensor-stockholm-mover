Precise Biometrics AB (PREC) , a Swedish
maker of fingerprint identification technology, advanced the
most in almost two weeks in Stockholm trading after  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
said its latest iPhone 5S model has a fingerprint sensor.  The shares jumped  as much as  14 percent to 5.1 kronor,
their steepest intraday advance since Aug. 29 and highest price
since Sept. 5. The stock rose 6.7 percent to 4.77 kronor as of
12:32 p.m. local time, with trading volume at 262 percent of the
daily average in the past three months.  Apple, which has long been the pacesetter in the smartphone
market, said yesterday that its iPhone 5S will have fingerprint-sensor technology located on the phone’s home button, which
people can use to unlock their device and confirm purchases from
iTunes and Apple’s app store.  Precise Biometrics has risen more than seven-fold this
year, advancing along with other makers of biometric security
devices as investors bet more phone makers will replace
conventional passwords and signatures with physical identifiers.  “The launch of fingerprint recognition on Apple’s iPhone
5S is a key milestone in the fingerprint biometric industry,”
the company said in a statement today. “Our products present
strong competitive advantages as the mobile industry move
towards making fingerprint sensor standard on smart devices.”  Sales at the Lund, Sweden-based company, which counts the
U.S. Department of State and Nordic gym chain Fitness24Seven to
its customers, jumped 31 percent to 28.3 million kronor ($4.3
million) last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
