Libyan crude output losses and the
possible escalation of unrest in Syria provide an option to buy
front-month futures, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Protests at  oil fields  and ports in  Libya  have reduced
supply from the country to the lowest since October 2011,
prompting Goldman to halve its forecast for production this
month to 500,000 barrels a day, the bank said in a report today.
With Iraq’s output forecast also revised down by 100,000 barrels
a day, this will cause a shortage in spare capacity from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this month,
according to the bank.  The premium of front-month Brent to the second, or
backwardation, widened to $1.90 a barrel on Sept. 3, the most
since November 2012. This structure, allied to the lack of
supply, gives investors with an opportunity to double their
returns by buying prompt futures and holding on to them, said
 Jeffrey Currie , a New York-based analyst at the bank.  “With currently high levels of backwardation in oil,
investors can earn returns even when prices are expected to be
flat, or even fall slightly, by buying deferred oil contracts
and waiting as they approach expiry,” Currie said. “Rolling
the front-end over the course of one year would generate nearly
twice the return of buying one year out and holding to
maturity.”  The risk to oil output remains greater in Libya than in
Syria, with the loss to OPEC’s spare capacity occurring at the
same time as petroleum inventories in members of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development are set
to fall to their lowest levels since 2004, the bank said.  This shortage is driving Goldman’s forecast for Brent to
trade at $115 a barrel in the near-term. The October contract
was at $112.31 as of 10:07 a.m. London time on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Longer-term the tightness in supply will
probably ease with the bank predicting crude to drop to $105 a
barrel, barring any spillover of hostilities in  Syria  to
neighboring countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
