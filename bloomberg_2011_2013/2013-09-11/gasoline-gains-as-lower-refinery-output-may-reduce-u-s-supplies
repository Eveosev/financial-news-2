Gasoline climbed from a 10-week low
on speculation that lower margins may spur refiners to reduce
output even as plant breakdowns and seasonal maintenance may
reduce supplies of the motor fuel.  Futures rose as the Energy Information Administration will
probably report today that inventories fell 1 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg. BP Plc shut a fluid catalytic cracker
yesterday for unplanned repairs at its Whiting, Indiana,
refinery. Gasoline’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate crude is
down 70 percent since July 16 and its  crack spread  versus  Brent
crude  was down 84 percent.  “Products are reacting to a number of refining problems,
including issues at BP Whiting and refiners on the West Coast,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “Several refiners on the  Gulf Coast  are considering
run cuts in light of deteriorating margins.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 1.19 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.7476 a gallon at 9:43 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 1.1 percent below the
100-day average.  Futures fell 4.1 percent the prior two days as crude
retreated on lessening concern that the U.S. would launch a
military strike against  Syria  over its alleged use of chemical
weapons against its own people. President  Barack Obama  said last
night in an address from  Washington  that he will pursue a
proposal by  Russia  for Syria to surrender its stockpiles of
chemical weapons to international authorities.  “The market will await the outcome of diplomatic action
over the next couple of weeks,” Lipow said.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 12 cents to $7.63 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent slipped 20 cents to $3.45.  Planned maintenance at Gulf Coast, Midwest and East Coast
refineries will reduce daily capacity by 1.42 million barrels in
September, 795,000 barrels in October and 170,000 barrels in
November, said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at
Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in London.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.558 a
gallon, 28.5 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that gasoline stockpiles rose 195,000 barrels last
week and supplies of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel increased 807,000 barrels. The survey projected that the
EIA will report that distillate inventories gained 600,000
barrels.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery gained 1.71
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.0839 a gallon, after settling
yesterday at the lowest level since Aug. 14. Trading volume was
12 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 35 cents to $21.77 a
barrel while the  premium  over Brent increased 1 cent to $17.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
