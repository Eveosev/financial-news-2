Kingfisher Plc (KGF) ,  Europe ’s largest
home-improvement retailer, said first-half earnings fell as a
cold spring across Europe and weak  consumer confidence  in major
markets damped sales.  Adjusted profit before tax in the 26 weeks ended Aug. 3
fell 1.6 percent to 365 million pounds ($574 million), the
London-based owner of the B&Q and Castorama chains said today in
a statement. The median estimate compiled by Bloomberg from
eight analysts’ estimates was 367 million pounds.  Still, Britain’s longest heat wave in 18 years boosted
sales in the second quarter at stores open at least a year as
customers stocked up on garden furniture and barbecues,
Kingfisher said July 24. This followed a 4.2 percent drop in
first-quarter revenue as the unseasonally cool weather deterred
shoppers from outdoor projects.  “After a difficult first quarter, in which sales and
profits were affected by record bad weather, we were able to
capitalize on the better weather in the second quarter
particularly in the U.K., to grow quarterly profits and so
deliver a broadly flat result across the half,” Chief Executive
Officer Ian Cheshire said in the statement.  “Looking ahead, we remain ready to capitalize on any
improvement in conditions or opportunities as they arise,
including the potential pick up in the U.K. housing market.”  Kingfisher’s shares have gained 48 percent this year and
closed at 420 pence yesterday in  London  for a market value of 10
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
