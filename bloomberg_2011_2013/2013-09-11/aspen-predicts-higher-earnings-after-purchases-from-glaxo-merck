Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) ,
 Africa ’s largest generic-drugs maker, said it expects the
purchase of manufacturing sites from GlaxoSmithKline Plc and
Merck & Co. to boost earnings this year.  Growth will be “strongly supplemented by contributions to
the international and Asia Pacific territories” from the
completion of the transactions, particularly in the second half
of the current fiscal year, which began in July, the Durban,
South Africa-based company said today in a statement.  Net income climbed 25 percent to 3.52 billion rand ($354
million) in the year through June as sales from international
businesses rose, Aspen said. Revenue increased 27 percent to
19.3 billion rand, beating the 19.21 billion-rand estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Aspen, which supplies medicines in more than 150 countries,
agreed to a $1 billion deal in June to buy pharmaceutical assets
from Merck. It has offered to buy heart medicines Arixtra and
Fraxiparine from  Glaxo (GSK) , as well as a related manufacturing site
in  France , for about 700 million pounds ($1.1 billion).  Debt levels will “initially be close to Aspen’s self-imposed limits, but this gearing is expected to reduce quite
rapidly through strong operational cash flows,” the company
said today.  The  shares  rose for a fifth day, adding 2.8 percent to
250.80 rand as of 1:48 p.m. in Johannesburg. The stock has
gained 48 percent this year and is trading at the highest price
since at least 1990.  Aspen maintained its  dividend  at 157 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
