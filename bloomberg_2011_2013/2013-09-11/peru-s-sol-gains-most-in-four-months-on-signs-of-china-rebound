Peru ’s sol posted its biggest rally
in four months on evidence of stronger growth in China, the
largest buyer of the Andean country’s metals and fishmeal.  The currency surged 0.7 percent to 2.7730 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Lima, the most since May 3, according to prices
from Datatec. The sol touched a three-year low on Aug. 19.  The improved outlook for China and intervention by Peru’s
central bank to support the currency may have spurred a foreign
investor to make a large sol purchase today, according to
Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at the local unit of Banco
Santander SA.  “The latest data from China encouraged someone to take a
bet on  emerging markets  including Peru,” Navarro said in an e-mailed response to questions. The central bank will probably
resume dollar sales if the sol depreciates to 2.80, he said.  China’s economy  will expand 7.6 percent this year, up from
a forecast of 7.5 percent, UBS AG said today. Peru’s exports to
China fell 28 percent in July, the Andean country’s statistics
agency said yesterday.  The central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  today. It has
sold $3.3 billion in the local market since July 2.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond
due in August 2020 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 5.66 percent at 2:58 p.m. in  Lima , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
