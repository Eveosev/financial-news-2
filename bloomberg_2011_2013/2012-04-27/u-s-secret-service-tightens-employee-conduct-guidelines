The U.S. Secret Service tightened
restrictions on employees’ conduct in response to the scandal of
agents consorting with prostitutes overseas while preparing
security for presidential trips.  Under the rules announced today, agency workers will be
prohibited from having non-U.S. nationals other than hotel staff
or law-enforcement colleagues in their hotel rooms, said Ed Donovan, a Secret Service spokesman. Going to “non-reputable
establishments” also is banned, he said.  “Consider your conduct through the lens of the past
several weeks,” Secret Service Director  Mark Sullivan  said in a
message sent to employees today.  The agency has come under scrutiny after 12 employees were
accused of misconduct in Cartagena, Colombia, before a visit by
President  Barack Obama  earlier this month. Nine of those
employees are leaving the agency or are being forced out.  An agency official said yesterday the Secret Service is
investigating the accuracy of a news report by KIRO television
in  Seattle  saying agents paid for “sexual favors” in an El
Salvador strip club and brought escorts to their hotel rooms
prior to a visit there by Obama last year.  The new regulations require “intensified” briefings about
personal safety issues and the country being visited, Donovan
said. Employees will be allowed to drink alcohol only in
“moderate” amounts in their off hours and not within 10 hours
of reporting for duty, he said.  Agency employees will be expected to follow U.S. laws while
overseas, Donovan said. The scandal in  Colombia  took place in a
zone where prostitution is legal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
