French Socialist presidential
candidate  Francois Hollande ’s proposals to stimulate economic
growth in  Europe  are “right” and in line with demands by
Germany’s Social Democrats, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the leader
of the SPD in Germany’s parliament, told  Hamburger Abendblatt .  Europe needs a growth pact to complement its fiscal pact on
budget discipline, Steinmeier said, according to the newspaper.
If all nations in Europe cut spending at the same time, economic
growth suffers and jobs are lost, the newspaper cited him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
