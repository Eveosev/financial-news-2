Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN) , the
world’s second-biggest dental implant maker, rose the most in
seven weeks after first-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates,
helped by currency effects in  North America  and  Asia .  Nobel Biocare rose as much as 9.2 percent, the most in
seven weeks, and was trading up 4.3 percent at 11.16 francs at
12:09 p.m. in Zurich trading.  Earnings before interest and tax climbed to 20.8 million
euros ($27.4 million) from 19 million euros excluding one-time
items a year earlier, the Glattbrugg, Switzerland based-company
said in a statement today. Analysts had expected Ebit of 17.5
million euros, according to the average of 12  estimates  in a
Bloomberg survey.  “It’s one of the quarters where Nobel Biocare exceeded
expectations for profit, which they used to miss regularly,”
said Khon Quang, an analyst with Jefferies International Ltd.
Nobel Biocare’s margin was 2.5 percentage points above his
estimate. “We believe the stock is trading on the positive
margin beat relative to expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
