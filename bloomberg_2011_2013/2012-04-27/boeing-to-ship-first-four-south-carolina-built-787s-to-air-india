Boeing Co. (BA)  will ship all four 787
composite-plastic Dreamliners assembled this year in its new
 South Carolina  plant to Air India Ltd., the carrier that
demanded $1 billion in compensation after production delays.  The first of the jets rolled out yesterday from a 1.24
million-square-foot (115,000-square meter) hangar near
Charleston, South Carolina. It will start flying in three to
four weeks, and Air India will take delivery at midyear, said
Jack Jones, Boeing South Carolina vice president.  “I know we’re a little late delivering this airplane, but
when they get it, they’re going to say it was worth it,”  Jim Albaugh , head of Boeing’s commercial airplane division, told
employees and South Carolina politicians including Governor
Nikki Haley and U.S.  Senator Lindsey Graham .  After ending more than three years of delays in delivering
the Dreamliner in September, Boeing is seeking to accelerate
production of the twin-aisle jets to 10 a month by the end of
2013. Japan Airlines Co. and All Nippon Airways Co. have
received 11 787s, said  Marc Birtel , a spokesman. The planes list
for $193.5 million.  The South Carolina facility, which cost $750 million and
opened last year, will build 3.5 planes a month by the end of
2013 or early 2014, Jones told reporters.  Retaliation Complaint  The plant is Boeing’s first new commercial-jet factory
outside  Washington ’s Puget Sound region, where the company was
founded. Boeing’s decision to build in the state, which forbids
requiring union membership as a condition of employment,
prompted an accusation from the Machinists union of illegal
retaliation for strikes.  The  National Labor Relations Board  subsequently filed a
complaint against Boeing, then withdrew it after Boeing and the
union reached a new contract promising that the upgraded narrow-
body 737, the MAX, would be built in the Seattle area.  Albaugh declined to comment about any compensation for  Air
India . Last month, he disputed the Indian government’s statement
that the planemaker agreed to pay $500 million in compensation
because of delays to the jet, originally scheduled for first
delivery in May 2008.  Air India demanded $1 billion in February, after saying in
August 2010 that it would seek $840 million. Airlines sign up
for delivery slots when they place orders, and Boeing faces
penalties for late planes such as the 787.  K. Swaminathan, a spokesman for Air India in Mumbai,
declined to comment today before a formal announcement regarding
taking delivery of the new planes.  Production Increase  Assembly of the first 787-9 variant is scheduled to begin
in South Carolina in the fourth quarter with work on the aft and
mid-body, Patrick Shanahan, a senior vice president and general
manager for airplane programs, said in an interview. The  787-9 
is a longer version of the current 787-8 and can seat 40 more
people at maximum capacity, according to Boeing’s website.  The 787-8 can carry 210 to 250 passengers, depending on the
cabin configuration, and is intended allow airlines to serve
long-haul routes with a fuel-efficient twin-engine plane instead
of a four-engine jumbo jet like the 747.  Deliveries of five Dreamliners in the quarter through March
helped push Boeing’s commercial-jet shipments ahead of rival
Airbus SAS’s 131 as the Chicago-based planemaker works to retake
the global commercial-sales title it lost in 2003.  Boeing is boosting production by more than 60 percent in
the four years through 2014 to pare a record order backlog. The
company reiterated its plan this week to deliver 70 to 85 of its
787s and 747s this year, with the composite-plastic Dreamliner
accounting for “approximately half” of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
