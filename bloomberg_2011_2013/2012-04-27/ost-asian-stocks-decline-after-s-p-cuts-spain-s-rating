Asian stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index snapping a two-day gain, as a cut in
Spain’s credit rating overshadowed Japan’s move to expand
economic stimulus and corporate earnings that beat estimates.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co., which gets 39 percent of sales from
 Europe , dropped 1.9 percent in  Tokyo .  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s No. 1 lender, slid 0.3 percent, erasing
gains of as much as 3.1 percent after the central bank statement
was released. Samsung Electronics Co., which became the world’s
biggest mobile-phone vendor last quarter, climbed 2.5 percent in
Seoul after profit beat analysts’ estimates.  “Europe isn’t getting any healthier,” said  Pauline Dan ,
Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Samsung Asset
Management Co., which manages $100 billion. “Market volatility
may increase in the short term if the situation in Europe
remains unclear. Earnings may not be sustainable given that
we’re seeing sub-par economic growth globally.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.2 percent to 124.05
as of 5:18 p.m. in Tokyo, with two shares falling for each that
rose. The gauge earlier jumped as much as 0.4 percent as the
Bank of Japan expanded its asset-purchase fund to 40 trillion
yen ($494 billion) from 30 trillion yen to boost the economy.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  declined 0.4 percent,
erasing gains of as much as 1.4 percent. A report that showed
the nation’s industrial production rose less than estimated in
March underscored views of some lawmakers that the central
bank’s stimulus measures are insufficient to beat deflation.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index and Australia’s S&P/200 ASX 200 slipped
0.3 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 0.6 percent.  Europe Concerns  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is headed for a 0.1 percent
loss this week on speculation Europe will struggle to contain
its sovereign-debt crisis amid political uncertainties. Spain’s
credit rating was cut by  Standard & Poor’s  on concern the nation
may have to bail out its banking sector.  Stocks of companies that do business in Europe fell. Nippon
Sheet Glass slipped 1.9 percent to 104 yen in Tokyo.  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. (13) , which operates ports in Germany and Spain, dropped
1.1 percent to HK$74 in Hong Kong.  Shares of Japanese lenders gave up earlier gains as
investors were disappointed with a central bank stimulus program
that expanded long-term government bond purchases and cut a
short-term lending facility for banks by 5 trillion yen.  “It cited weak demand, but this simply underlines the fact
that there is little evidence that Japan’s recovery is being
held back by problems with the cost or availability of credit,”
 Julian Jessop , London-based chief global economist at Capital
Economics Ltd., wrote in a note after the BOJ announcement.  Nintendo, Foxconn  Mitsubishi UFJ slid 0.3 percent to 387 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender, fell 0.4
percent to 2,584 yen after rising as much as 2 percent.  Nintendo Co. sank 5.6 percent to 10,900 yen in Tokyo after
the maker of Wii game consoles forecast profit this fiscal year
that missed analysts’ estimates. Foxconn International Holdings
Ltd. slumped 16 percent to HK$3.78 in Hong Kong after the
handset maker said first-half losses will widen.  Profit surpassed expectations at 134 of 271 MSCI Asia
Pacific Index companies that posted quarterly earnings since
April 10, while 108 fell short, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg News.  Samsung, PetroChina  Samsung Electronics gained 2.5 percent to 1.347 million won
in Seoul after reporting first-quarter net income jumped 81
percent from a year earlier to 5.05 trillion won ($4.4 billion).
PetroChina Co. climbed 3 percent to HK$11.64 in Hong Kong after
posting an unexpected increase in profits.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 9.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 11.3 percent by the
 S&P 500  and 5.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are  valued  at 12.8 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with multiples of 13.3 for the S&P 500 and
10.8 for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
