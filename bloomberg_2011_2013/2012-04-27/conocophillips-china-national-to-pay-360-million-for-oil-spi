China National Offshore Oil Corp. (883) 
and ConocoPhillips agreed to pay 2.28 billion yuan ($360
million) to resolve claims and pay for environmental programs in
China’s  Bohai Bay  after spilling 3,000 barrels of oil and
drilling mud in the area last year.  Under an agreement with the State Oceanic Administration,
the two companies will pay 1.683 billion yuan for “possible
impacts” on the bay’s marine environment, Houston-based
ConocoPhillips said in an e-mailed statement today. Conoco, the
operator of the well in the Penglai oilfield, will pay 1.09
billion yuan of that as well as 113 million yuan to “support
environmental initiatives.”  China National Offshore, the nation’s largest offshore oil
producer, will pay 480 million yuan for programs designed to
protect the Bohai Bay, according to a  statement  from the State
Oceanic Administration. State-owned China National Offshore,
based in Beijing, owns 51 percent of the well, according to
 ConocoPhillips. (COP)   The Penglai field, located off the coast of northeast
China, produced an average of 60,000 barrels a day in 2011,
according to ConocoPhillips.  ConocoPhillips  dropped  0.3 percent to $71.98 at the close
in  New York . Cnooc Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of
China National Offshore, fell 0.1 percent to HK$16.28 at the
close.  The companies previously agreed to pay $160 million to
compensate Chinese fishermen for losses from oil leaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
