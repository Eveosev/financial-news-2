The decision by President Cristina Kirchner of  Argentina  to  seize a majority stake  in the oil and gas company YPF SA from  Spain 's Repsol YPF SA shocked analysts and investors around the world, worsening confidence in Argentina's energy market. Global leaders were quick to condemn it. Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said : “This seriously damages Argentina's international reputation.” Mexico ’s president,  Felipe Calderon ,  warned : “We all need investment, and nobody in their right mind invests in a country that expropriates investments." The April 16 move also had its critics in Argentina. Joaquin Morales Sola, a prominent political columnist for Argentina’s La Nacion newspaper, wrote an April 17 column headlined: “The president slammed the door on the world.” In it, he raised a big question: Who would now pay to exploit Argentina’s huge reserves of unconventional shale gas, potentially the third-biggest in the world?  Sola wrote : On April 22, the Brazilian O Globo newspaper published an interview with Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri, one of Kirchner’s most outspoken critics,  who argued  that the YPF seizure would decrease confidence in Argentina: The prevailing mood in Argentina was more positive: Six out of 10 Argentines  supported the YPF seizure . But the move has unnerved other companies -- and led many to wonder if it's part of a trend as Argentina pressures energy companies to increase output. Weeks earlier, Argentina's Neuquen provincial government had unexpectedly revoked a license granted to the Brazilian energy corporation Petroleo Brasileiro SA to explore there, saying the company had failed to boost investment sufficiently. That was the same rationale used to justify the YPF seizure. Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster said the revocation happened without warning. On April 20, Foster and Edison Lobao,  Brazil 's mines and energy minister, met with Argentina's minister of planning and public investment, Julio de Vido. They made  reassuring comments  afterward, suggesting that Petrobras still had an interest in investing in Argentina. But as journalist  Ilimar Franco argued  in his April 24 O Globo column, Argentina and Brazil were already quarrelling over trade, and Petrobras wouldn’t be the only Brazilian company to come under Kirchner’s pressure: Franco said companies such as agricultural-machine manufacturers Deere & Co., AGCO Corp. and CNH Global NV were coming under pressure in Argentina -- just like Petrobras. “Kirchner is sucking industries and jobs out of Brazil,” Franco concluded. But in the wake of YPF, the confidence of many companies will be further shaken. Following an Argentine request for Petrobras to increase its investment in the country from 8 percent to 15 percent, O Globo  reported  April 20 that Lobao said Petrobras investments would probably remain the same as last year. Days later, at a public hearing at the Mines and Energy Commission, Foster stated: “We mustn’t put all our eggs in one basket." Kirchner may have done a lot for her government’s popularity in Argentina by nationalizing YPF. The consequences for investment, on the other hand, may be a very different story.
