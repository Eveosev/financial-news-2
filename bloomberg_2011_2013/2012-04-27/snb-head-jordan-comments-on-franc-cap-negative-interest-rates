Swiss central bank president Thomas Jordan comments on whether the SNB should introduce negative
 interest rates  to prevent the franc from appreciating against
the euro. He spoke at the SNB annual shareholder meeting in Bern
today, responding to a shareholder question.  On negative interest rates:  “We haven’t introduced negative interest rates because the
minimum  exchange rate  has worked very well so far and because it
wasn’t necessary.  ‘‘The SNB is examining all reasonable measures that could
make sense in the current situation. Still, you have to say that
there is no magic option, and all the measures have side effects
and you cannot get them for free.”  Jordan declined to elaborate on possible further measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
