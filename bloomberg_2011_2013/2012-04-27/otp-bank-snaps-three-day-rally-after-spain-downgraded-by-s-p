OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell for the first time in four days after Standard &
Poor’s cut  Spain ’s sovereign credit rating, adding to concern
that the debt crisis will worsen as Hungary works to obtain aid.  The shares dropped 1 percent to 3,803 forint by 10:01 a.m.
in Budapest. The stock jumped 14 percent in the previous three
days as Hungary received approval from the European Commission
to start bailout negotiations after five months of disputes on
laws threatening the independence of the central bank and other
institutions.  The  International Monetary Fund  is ready to start
negotiations with Hungary “as soon as adequate steps are taken
to ensure central bank independence,” the Washington-based
lender said in a statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
