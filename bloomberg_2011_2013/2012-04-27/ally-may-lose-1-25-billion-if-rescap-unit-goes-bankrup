Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the bailed-out
auto and home lender, confirmed that its Residential Capital
unit is considering bankruptcy and estimated its own loss from
the filing could range from $400 million to $1.25 billion.  “Market deterioration has led to fewer sources of, and
significantly reduced levels of, liquidity available to finance
ResCap’s operations,” Detroit-based Ally said today in its
quarterly  filing  with securities regulators. The parent company
and its money-losing mortgage unit are discussing a range of
options for ResCap, which “may include a reorganization under
bankruptcy laws, which ResCap is actively considering.”  Speculation has swirled that ResCap would seek  court
protection  from creditors to advance Ally Chief Executive
Officer Michael Carpenter’s plan to repay more than $17 billion
in U.S. bailout funds. Carpenter, who once predicted that a
pending initial public offering could value Ally at $30 billion,
later said the sale won’t happen without progress on resolving
the mortgage unit.  The bailout left the U.S. Treasury Department holding a 74
percent stake in Ally. The company reported this week that
first-quarter profit more than doubled to $310 million as
mortgage operations improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
