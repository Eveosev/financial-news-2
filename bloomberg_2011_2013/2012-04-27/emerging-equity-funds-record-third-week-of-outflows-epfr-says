Emerging-market stock funds posted
their third consecutive week of outflows as investors withdrew a
net $377.6 million in the week ended April 25 on concern the
European debt crisis may worsen, according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $23.7 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $12.5
billion for the same period of 2011,  Cameron Brandt , director of
research at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data provider,
said by e-mail today.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded net outflow for the week of $273 million, the data
show. Asian funds excluding  Japan  recorded a net inflow of $87
million, benefiting from expectations that Chinese authorities
will ease monetary policy in the middle of the second quarter of
2012, Brandt said.  Russian equity funds recorded net redemptions of $32
million while Brazil-dedicated funds posted an inflow of $1.5
million.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio had a 0.9
percent loss for the week, cutting the 2012 advance to 11.2
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $540
million, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
