New York  City Comptroller  John Liu ’s campaign treasurer, Jia “Jenny” Hou, already accused of
fraud and obstruction, was named in an indictment with Liu
fundraiser Xing Wu “Oliver” Pan.  Hou and Pan had previously been charged separately. Both
are charged with conspiracy to commit  wire fraud  and attempted
wire fraud. The indictment includes a charge of obstruction
against Hou and adds a charge of making false statements to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation against her.  “Pan, Hou and others engaged in a scheme to defraud the
city by using straw donors, and by taking steps to conceal the
use of straw donors, to attempt to obtain campaign matching
funds,” according to the indictment.  Liu, a Queens Democrat, was raising money for a potential
run for mayor of  New York City . His campaign has faced setbacks
as a result of the government’s investigation into its finances
and the charges against Pan and Hou.  Gregory Ryan and Irwin Rochman, lawyers for Pan, declined
to comment on the new indictment. Hou’s lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt,
didn’t immediately return a phone message.  The case is U.S. v. Pan, 11-Mag.-2922, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
