Pakistan ’s economy will probably
expand 3.2 percent in the fiscal year through June 2012, lower
than a previous forecast of 4 percent, the nation’s statistics
office said in a preliminary estimate.  Gross domestic product increased 3 percent in the 2010-2011
financial year, more than an earlier report of 2.4 percent,
following a change in the base year for calculating the pace of
expansion, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics also said in a
statement released yesterday.  Pakistan’s $200 billion economy has been hampered by
blackouts from its worst energy crisis, an insurgency on the
Afghan border, elevated inflation and diminished aid flows. The
nation’s  Supreme Court  yesterday convicted Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  of contempt of court, adding to political tensions
ahead of general elections due by February.  “Growth will remain subdued this fiscal year,” said
Khalid Iqbal Siddiqui, the head of research at Karachi-based
United Bank Ltd. “Manufacturing industries are suffering from
power and gas shortages, while there are signs that the urban
economy dominated by the service sector is performing poorly as
well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
