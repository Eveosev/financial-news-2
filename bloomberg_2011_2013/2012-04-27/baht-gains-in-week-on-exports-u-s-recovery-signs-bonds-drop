Thailand ’s baht completed a weekly
advance as the government said exports are improving this
quarter and data showed the U.S. economic recovery is gaining
momentum. Government bonds fell, halting a three-week rally.  The local currency strengthened for a fourth day today,
erasing a monthly loss, even after Standard & Poor’s cut  Spain ’s
credit rating by two levels yesterday. An official report
yesterday showed Thai exports to the U.S. and  China  rose in
March. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week
he’s prepared to add more stimulus if needed as the monetary
authority upgraded its outlook for the world’s largest economy.  “It’s still risk-on with the Fed view and the U.S.
recovery signs,” said Amonthep Chawla, a market analyst at
 Kasikornbank Pcl (KBANK)  in Bangkok. “The U.S. and Chinese economies
are still growing despite the ongoing euro-area debt crisis.”  The baht appreciated 0.3 percent this week to 30.82 per
dollar as of 3:39 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has rebounded 0.8 percent since reaching
31.07, the lowest level in almost three weeks, on April 24.
Chawla forecast the baht will rise to 29.50 by year-end.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was 4.52 percent, compared with
4.54 percent yesterday. That matched the lowest level since July
2011.  Thailand’s exports fell  6.5 percent  in March from a year
earlier, after a 0.9 percent gain in February. Overseas sales
are faring better in the second quarter and the government is
keeping to its forecast for 15 percent export growth in 2012,
Deputy Commerce Minister Poom Sarapol said in Bangkok yesterday.  ‘V-Shape Recovery’  “The Thai economy continues to cruise along the path of a
V-shape recovery,” HSBC Holdings Plc said in a research note
yesterday. The bank is bullish on the growth outlook as data
since March have showed private consumption and investment have
surpassed pre-flood levels, economists Frederic Neumann and
Tushar Arora wrote.  Five-year  government bonds  dropped this week. The yield on
the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, since April 20 to 3.59 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield retreated two basis
points today.  The Bank of Thailand auctioned 50 billion baht ($1.6
billion) of two-year notes yesterday at 3.52 percent, compared
with 3.24 percent at the previous sale of similar-maturity
securities on Feb. 16. The  finance ministry  sold 8 billion baht
of 2027 bonds on April 25, paying 4.07 percent versus 3.7745
percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
