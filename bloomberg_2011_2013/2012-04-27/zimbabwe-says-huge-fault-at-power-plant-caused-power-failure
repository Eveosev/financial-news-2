Zimbabwe ’s state-owned utility
company, Zesa Holdings (Pvt) Ltd., says a “huge fault” at its
Hwange thermal power plant won’t be repaired before tomorrow,
leaving homes and businesses without power.  “We can’t draw power from Hwange at the moment,” Zesa
spokesman Fullard Gwasira said in a telephone interview from
Harare. Technicians and engineers are “working flat out” to
fix the problem, he said.  Production at the coal-fired plant, Zimbabwe’s biggest,
slumped to 81 megawatts yesterday, from 501 megawatts on April
24. While the facility has a 900-megawatt capacity, it rarely
generates more than 500 megawatts because of aging equipment.
Most of the 771 megawatts Zesa supplied yesterday came from its
Kariba South hydroelectric plant.  Zimbabweans face daily electricity rationing because Zesa
hasn’t met national demand of 2,200 megawatts since 2007. Power
cuts are routine in the southern African nation because a 10-
year recession that ended in 2009 resulted in underinvestment in
equipment at plants including Hwange. Zimbabwe also imports
power.  “We’ve been without power since early yesterday morning
and still nothing,” Josh Dambadza, a furniture maker in
Harare’s Mbare suburb, said today in a phone interview. “Since
May 1 is a public holiday, I’m closing down until May 2.”  Imports of electricity, mainly from neighboring  Mozambique ,
depend on Zimbabwe keeping its debt to that country’s
 Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa SA  below $40 million, Energy
Minister Elton Mangoma said April 12. Zesa consumers owe the
utility more than $140 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
