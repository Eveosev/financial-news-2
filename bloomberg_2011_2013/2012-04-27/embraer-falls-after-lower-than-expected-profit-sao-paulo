Embraer SA (ERJ) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, fell for a third day as first-quarter profit
dropped 36 percent and missed analysts’ estimates.  Shares  fell  0.4 percent to 16.20 reais at 11:12 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, after earlier dropping as much as 2.7 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index declined 0.4 percent.  Embraer reported net income attributed to shareholders of
111.2 million reais ($59 million) in the first quarter, below
the average estimate for an adjusted profit of 139.2 million
reais in a Bloomberg survey of  nine  analysts.  The company “released poor 1Q12 results, in our view,
worse than both 1Q11’s figures and our estimates,” analysts
Edigimar Maximiliano Jr and Luiz Pecanha at Banco Bradesco BBI
wrote in a report today.  Net revenue rose 17 percent to 2.05 billion reais as the
company increased deliveries, while costs advanced 16 percent to
1.57 billion reais.  Embraer delivered 34 aircraft in the quarter, up from 28 a
year earlier, the company said on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
