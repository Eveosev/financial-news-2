French  consumer spending  fell in
March as demand for energy declined and households reduced food
purchases.  Spending declined 2.9 percent from February, when it rose a
revised 2.9 percent, national statistics office Insee said today
in an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a drop of 1.9
percent, according to the median of 15 estimates gathered by
Bloomberg news.  “After a month of February with a marked increase because
of heating expenses linked to a cold spell, household energy
consumption plunged in March,” Insee said. “Food spending fell
back after two consecutive months of increase.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
