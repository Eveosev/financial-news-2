Treasury 10-year yields touched a
12-week low after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered Spain’s credit
rating, renewing concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening and
boosting demand for safer assets.  Benchmark notes were set to complete a six-week  advance ,
the longest series of gains since June, before a government
report economists say will show growth in the U.S. slowed last
quarter. The  two-year  note yield fell to the lowest level in 11
weeks. Treasury 10-year futures reached a record high before
Spain auctions securities next week. U.S. bonds pared their
advance after Italy held a debt auction.  “Treasuries benefited from safe-haven demand after the
Spanish downgrade,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “Concerns over the euro-region debt crisis continue to
dominate sentiment. Treasuries will remain supported by external
factors, as well as some softening in the macro situation.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes were little changed at
1.93 percent at 7:51 a.m.  New York  time, after reaching 1.88
percent, the lowest since Feb. 3, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 2 percent note maturing in February 2022
added 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face value, to 100 19/32.
Ten-year rates have fallen four basis points since April 20.  Two-year  rates  fell to as low as 0.25 percent today, a
level unseen since Feb. 10, while the 30-year yield dropped to
3.06 percent, matching the lowest since Feb. 29.  Spanish Debt  The 10-year note futures contract expiring in June climbed
as much as 0.4 percent to a record 132 17/32, before trading
little changed at 132 4/32.  “There is a move toward  risk aversion , resulting in the
buying of Treasuries,” said Akira Takei, head of the
international fixed-income department at Mizuho Asset Management
Co. in  Tokyo , which oversees about $41 billion. “Europe’s debt
crisis will probably enter a second round.”  Ten-year yields may drop to 1.5 percent in the next six
months, Takei said. He is increasing holdings of Treasuries with
longer maturities than 10 years, he said.  S&P lowered Spain’s long-term sovereign credit rating by
two levels to BBB+ from A, with a negative outlook. The nation’s
budget trajectory is likely to worsen and the country may need
to provide more fiscal support to banks, the ratings company
said in a statement yesterday.  Spanish, Italian Auctions  Spain , the fourth-biggest economy in the euro region, is
scheduled to auction notes maturing in 2015 and 2017 on May 3.
The nation’s 10-year bond  yields  climbed to 6.16 percent last
week, the highest this year, and were at 5.95 percent today.  Treasuries pared gains as Italy sold 5.95 billion euros
($7.87 billion) of debt due between 2016 and 2022 today. The
nation auctioned 2.5 billion euros of 10-year benchmark bond at
a rate of 5.84 percent, up from 5.24 percent at the previous
auction on March 29. Investors bid for 1.48 times the amount
offered, down from 1.65 times last month.  Ten-year Treasuries were set to rise for the first month
since January. A report today will show the  U.S. economy 
expanded at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the first
quarter from 3 percent in the previous three-month period,
economists surveyed by Bloomberg said.  The  Federal Reserve  bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of so-called quantitative easing from December 2008 to
June 2011.  The central bank is also replacing $400 billion of shorter-
term debt in its holdings with longer maturities to hold down
borrowing costs. It plans to sell as much as $8.75 billion of
Treasuries maturing in June 2014 to April 2015 as part of the
program, according to the Fed Bank of New York’s  website .  U.S. bonds have returned 9 percent over the past 12 months,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch gauge. The  S&P 500 (SPX) 
Index of U.S. shares has handed investors a 6.2 percent gain
over the same period, including reinvested dividends.  To contact the reporters on this story:
