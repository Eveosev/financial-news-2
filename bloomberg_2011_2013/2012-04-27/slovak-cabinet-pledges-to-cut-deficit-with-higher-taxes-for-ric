Slovakia’s new government, led by
 Robert Fico , approved its program for the four-year term that
seeks to cut budget  deficit  by taxing the rich while improving
the living standards of the country’s poorest citizens.  The administration, which assumed power three weeks ago,
will stick to the target of reducing the budget gap below the
European Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in
2013, according to the program approved by ministers today in
the capital Bratislava, and posted on its website. The
government will use fiscal measures that won’t hurt economic
 growth , the document said.  Fico’s Smer party won a majority in March 10 elections
after pledging to reduce the effects of an economic slowdown on
the poor at a time when the country faces a need for austerity
to insulate itself from the  Europe ’s debt crisis. The 2012
budget target of 4.6 percent of GDP is at risk as Slovakia will
be hurt by vanning demand from western Europe, Fico has said.  His single-party Cabinet, which will ask for parliament’s
confidence at a May 2 session, also pledged to dismantle a
current system of a flat 19 percent income tax by imposing
higher rates for most profitable companies and top earners.  The administration will also review a possibility of
increasing the special tax on banks and implementing a levy on
financial transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
