Japan  refrained from selling yen in
the foreign-exchange market this month, the Ministry of Finance
said on its  website  today.  The nation didn’t sell any of its currency from March 29 to
April 25, the ministry’s regular month-end data showed. The yen
slid in February and March and is poised for a 2.9 percent
advance against the dollar this month.  The last time Japan intervened in the  currency market  to
stem the yen’s appreciation was on Nov. 4. The nation sold 1.02
trillion yen ($12.7 billion) during the first four days of
November, following a record daily sale of 8.07 trillion yen on
Oct. 31, according to ministry data. Its intervention totaled
14.3 trillion yen last year, the third-largest yearly  amount 
after 20.43 trillion yen in 2003 and 14.83 trillion yen in 2004,
ministry data showed.  The Japanese currency tends to strengthen during economic
and financial turmoil because the nation’s current-account
surplus makes it less reliant on foreign capital. A stronger
domestic currency, which reached a postwar record of 75.35 per
dollar on Oct. 31, hurts the overseas competitiveness of
exporters and reduces the value of their repatriated income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
