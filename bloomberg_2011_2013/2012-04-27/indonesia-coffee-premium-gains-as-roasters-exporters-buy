The premium buyers are prepared to
pay to obtain coffee from  Indonesia , the world’s third-largest
producer of robusta beans, rose 25 percent this week on demand
from local roasters and exporters, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Indonesian beans for shipment in May and June were trading
at a premium of $100 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London, the unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today. That compares
with a premium of $80 a ton last week, data from the trader
showed.  The premium has “firmed up as local roasters and exporters
keep on battling to pick up the coffee available,” Volcafe,
based in Winterthur,  Switzerland , said in the report.  Beans were at a higher premium even as the flow of coffee
in Indonesia improved this week, with port arrivals estimated at
about 4,500 tons, Volcafe said.  In  Vietnam , the biggest robusta producer, bean sales by
farmers slowed “considerably” after “some heavy farmer
selling” over the weekend, the trader said. Shipments continue
to be “of high volume,” according to the report.  Coffee exports from Vietnam totaled 21 million bags in the
year ending in April, up 1.6 million bags from the same period a
year earlier, Volcafe estimates.  Vietnamese coffee for May and June shipment was trading at
a discount of $10 a ton to the exchange price, unchanged from
the previous week, Volcafe data show.  Robusta coffee for July delivery was down 0.4 percent at
$2,003 a ton by 3:35 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
