The yen rose against most of its
major counterparts after the  U.S. economy  grew less than
forecast and Standard & Poor’s cut Spain’s credit rating, adding
to concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  The yen also gained amid concern new  Bank of Japan  stimulus
won’t be enough to boost the nation’s growth. Higher-yielding
currencies including those of  New Zealand  and Canada climbed
versus the  U.S. dollar  after slower growth in first-quarter
gross domestic product revived bets the  Federal Reserve  won’t be
quick to abandon efforts to support the economy.  “Some investors had prepositioned for a more aggressive
BOJ, and the BOJ did the minimum in terms of meeting
expectations,” said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at
in New York. “The market has taken back some of those yen
shorts.” A short is a bet a currency will fall.  The yen strengthened 0.9 percent to 80.27 per dollar at 5
p.m. in New York, extending its weekly rally to 1.6 percent. It
touched 80.22, the strongest level since Feb. 28. The Japanese
currency advanced 0.6 percent to 106.40 per euro and touched
106.16, the strongest since April 18. The euro rose 0.3 percent
to $1.3255, gaining 0.3 percent for the week.  Canada ’s dollar added 0.4 percent to 98.04 cents per U.S.
dollar, boosting its advance this week to 1.2 percent, the most
this year. America is Canada’s biggest trade partner. New
Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, appreciated 1 percent to
82.25 U.S. cents in its third daily gain.  “We do think the Canadian dollar, from a medium-term
perspective, is attractive because we believe in the U.S.
economic-growth story,” Chatterjee said.  Volatility Slides  Implied volatility  on three-month options on Group of Seven
nations’ currencies closed today at 8.87 percent, the lowest
level since 2007, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index. The
average over the past 10 years is 10.6 percent.  Lower volatility tends to make investments in currencies of
nations with higher benchmark rates more attractive because the
risk in such trades is that market moves will erase profits.  The Japanese central bank increased the total size of its
stimulus programs by 5 trillion yen ($62 billion). It’s boosting
its asset-purchase fund to 40 trillion yen by June 2013, versus
the previous target of 30 trillion yen by year-end, while paring
by 5 trillion yen a separate program that provides funds to
banks. Economists had forecast a boost ranging from 5 trillion
yen to 10 trillion yen, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Fairly Disappointing’  The BOJ move was “was fairly disappointing, so the
temptation to sell the yen was weakened,” said  Sebastien Galy ,
a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in
New York.  The yen rose the most over the past month among 10
developed-nation currencies monitored by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, adding 3.5 percent. The dollar dropped 0.5
percent, and the euro lost 1 percent.  The 17-nation currency fell earlier against the dollar
after S&P cut  Spain ’s long-term credit rating yesterday by two
steps to BBB+ from A. It said the nation’s outlook is negative
as the recession undermines efforts to trim its  budget deficit .  The Spanish  unemployment rate  increased to an 18-year high
of 24.4 percent in the first quarter, from 22.9 percent in the
previous three months, the National Statistics Institute said in
 Madrid .  “Spain is the main story in Europe now,” said  Geoff Kendrick , head of European currency strategy at Nomura
International Plc in London.  U.S. GDP  The dollar extended a loss versus the euro after Commerce
Department data showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded in
the first quarter at a 2.2 percent annual rate. That followed a
3 percent pace from October through December and compared with
the 2.5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  “We’re seeing a little bit more risk appetite,” said
 Kathy Lien , director of currency research with online trading
firm GFT Forex in  New York . “There’s still a little bit of
nervousness in the market. Overnight we had the Spanish
downgrade and as a result of that you’re only seeing very, very
modest gains in euro-dollar.”  While the Fed refrained this week from new actions to boost
the economy, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said after a two-day
meeting the central bank is “prepared to do more” if
necessary. Policy makers repeated a plan to keep borrowing costs
“exceptionally low” until at least late 2014. The key  interest
rate  has been at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Operation Twist  The Fed kept intact its program to exchange $400 billion in
shorter-term holdings for longer-term debt to cap borrowing
costs, dubbed Operation Twist and scheduled to expire in June.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators decreased bets the
euro will fall against the dollar.  Net short positions  in the
shared currency fell to 113,367 contracts in the week ended
April 24, from 118,125 the previous week, according to Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  The dollar is losing momentum against the yen after it
repeatedly failed to breach the 81.78 level, UBS AG said.  The 81.78 level is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the greenback’s drop from a high of 84.18 yen reached on
March 15 to a low of 80.30 yen on April 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It last touched 81.78 on April 20.  The failure of the dollar to break through that level “is
now turning momentum lower within what is still a bearish
trending condition,”  Richard Adcock , London-based head of
fixed-income technical strategy at UBS in  London , wrote in a
report yesterday. Resistance is an area on a chart where orders
may be clustered.  The pound rose for a 10th day against the dollar, its
longest winning streak since June 1992, and climbed to the
strongest level against the euro in almost 22 months.  The U.K. currency gained 0.5 percent to $1.6265 and touched
$1.6281, the highest since Aug. 31. The pound appreciated 0.2
percent to 81.49 pence per euro. It reached 81.34 pence, the
highest since June 30, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
