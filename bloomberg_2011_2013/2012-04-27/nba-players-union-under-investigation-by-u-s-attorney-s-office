The  National Basketball Players
Association , already in turmoil after President  Derek Fisher 
asked for independent reviews of its finances and business
practices, is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office
in Manhattan, the union said in a statement.  Union Executive Director Billy Hunter was notified of the
investigation by subpoena for documents on April 25, according
to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. The people
were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to
discuss the investigation.  “The NBPA will cooperate fully with the government’s
investigation,” the union statement said.  The union has appointed a six-member special committee that
consists of players representatives and executive committee
members to oversee an internal inquiry that will include a
financial audit.  The committee has retained Theodore V. Wells Jr. and the
 New York  law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to
conduct the inquiry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
