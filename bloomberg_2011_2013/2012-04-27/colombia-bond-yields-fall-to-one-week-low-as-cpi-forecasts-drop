Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds
held at a one-week low as investors lowered inflation forecasts,
buoying demand for the fixed-rate debt.  “Inflation expectations have been dropping in the last few
weeks,” said Javier Dorich, senior analyst in Bogota at Banco
de Bogota SA, the nation’s second-biggest bank. “Recent data
points to growth that isn’t as strong. That is leading investors
not only to cut inflation bets but also to see rates remaining
stable for the rest of the year.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 was little changed at 7.10 percent, matching
the lowest level on a closing basis since April 20 that was
touched yesterday.  Annual inflation will end the year at 3.3 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Citigroup Inc. survey of
27 economists published April 25. That’s down from 3.5 percent
in the previous survey. Annual inflation unexpectedly slowed to
3.40 percent in March and is within the central bank’s 2 percent
to 4 percent target.  The central bank will leave the  overnight lending rate  at
5.25 percent on April 30, according to all 27 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Banco de la Republica has raised the
benchmark rate nine times since February 2011, bringing it up
from a record low 3 percent.  While an extra leap-year day this February helped retail
sales rise 9.4 percent from a year earlier and industrial output
increase 4.5 percent, activity in “industry isn’t improving and
continues to moderate in retail,” Banco de Bogota said in an
April 23 report.  Colombia’s peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,764.40 per dollar,
from 1,762.07 yesterday. The currency gained 0.4 percent this
week and is up 9.9 percent this year in the second-best
performance after the Hungarian forint among all currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
