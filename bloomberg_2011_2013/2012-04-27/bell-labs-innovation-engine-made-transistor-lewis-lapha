It was nearing Christmas in the
 Murray Hill ,  New Jersey , building of Bell Labs. Smoke from
tobacco and soldering irons filled Walter Brattain’s room,
1E455, as engineers bent over calibration equipment. Their goal:
to figure out how to pass a current through a tiny piece of
silicon and move the electrons and holes within.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  John Bardeen walked in and suggested a “geometry,”
involving electrolyte fluid and a wire piercing the slice of
silicon, which gave a tiny gain in power. After experimenting
with various types of wire, gold, electrolyte solutions, silicon
and germanium, on Dec. 16, 1947, they finally got a powerful
effect.  This was more than a switch, an amplifier or a replacement
for the vacuum tube. After a demonstration, vice president of
research Ralph Bown said it was “a basically new thing in the
world.”  A ballot was circulated to name the device, including
“Surface States Triode” and “Iotatron.” The winner was
“Transistor.”  I spoke with Jon Gertner, author of “The Idea Factory:
Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation,” on the
following topics:  1. Deep Thinking  2. Incubator of Creativity  3. Crucial Inventions  4. Information Theory  5. Loss of the Long-Term  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
