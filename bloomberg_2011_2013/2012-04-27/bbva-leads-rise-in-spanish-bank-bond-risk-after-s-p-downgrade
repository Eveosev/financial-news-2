Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
led a rise in the cost of insuring against default on Spanish
banks after the nation’s credit rating was cut for the second
time this year by  Standard & Poor’s .  Credit-default swaps insuring  Spain ’s second-biggest bank
climbed 10 basis points to 429 at 11:40 a.m. in London while
swaps on  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , the largest lender, rose nine to
412, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Contracts on Spain
added eight basis points to 480. An increase signals
deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  The country will have to provide further fiscal support to
banks as the economy contracts, S&P said. Spanish Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos said European officials haven’t asked
the country to seek a bailout and its banking sector can cope
without another round of three-year loans from the  European
Central Bank .  “Spanish banks’ close ties with governments have increased
with the heavy buying of government debt this year,” said Ben Bennett, head of credit strategy at London-based  Legal & General
Group Plc. (LGEN)  “Even the strongest Spanish banks like BBVA and
Santander aren’t safe”  S&P lowered Spain two levels to BBB+ from A. The nation’s
10-year bond yield increased 13 basis points to 5.94 percent.
The 427 basis-point difference over German debt implies a non-
investment grade, or junk, rating for the nation’s bonds,
according to ING Bank NV.  Yield spreads on Santander’s 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
of 2015 senior bonds rose 9 basis points to 309 basis points
above the asset swap rate, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
Prices, approaching the highest level in more than three months.  Iberdrola Spreads  Yield spreads investors demand to hold  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s 750
million euros of 2015 bonds jumped 80 basis points to 203 above
the swap rate, the highest gap since January, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. Spain’s largest utility is among
Spanish companies relying on the government to attract investors
for a 22 billion-euro bond program backed by power bills to
reduce the gap between the cost of energy and prices to
consumers.  Italy sold 5.95 billion euros of bonds today, less than the
maximum for the auction, as the country paid 60 basis points
more than a month ago to sell 10-year debt. The Treasury sold
the 10-year benchmark at a rate of 5.84 percent, up from 5.24
percent at the previous auction on March 29.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose two basis points to 276.  Corporate Swaps  The cost of insuring company debt was little changed ahead
of U.S. data on economic growth and consumer sentiment in the
first quarter. The Commerce Department will release the first
estimate of first quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked to 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 2.4 basis
points to 663.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings climbed 0.6 to 143.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 0.4 basis points to 247.5 and the
subordinated index also rose 0.4 to 412.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
