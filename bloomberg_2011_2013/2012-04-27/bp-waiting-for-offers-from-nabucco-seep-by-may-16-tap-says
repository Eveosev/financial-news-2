The BP Plc-led group behind the
Caspian Sea Shah Deniz gas field thatâ€™s planning an export route
to  Europe  is awaiting formal submissions from Nabucco and the
South East Europe Pipeline, or SEEP, by May 16.  The group, which also includes  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Total SA (FP)  and
 State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of  Azerbaijan , intends to choose between SEEP and
Nabucco West, a revised version of the European Union-backed
project, in June, BP Vice President for Shah Deniz Al Cook said
in an interview on the TAP  website.   The winner of the Central European route will then compete
with TAP, or the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline developed by EGL AG,
Statoil ad E.ON Ruhrgas. The Shah Deniz partners will make a
final route selection by mid-2013, Cook said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
