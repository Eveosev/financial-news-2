Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (2330)  climbed the most in three years in Taipei after forecasting
record revenue and spending on demand for chips used in mobile
devices.  The chipmaker  gained  as much as 6.9 percent, the biggest
jump since April 2009, to NT$89.80, before trading at NT$87.80
as of 10:14 a.m. in Taipei. There shares were headed for the
highest close since listing in 1994. The benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index
fell 0.3 percent  TSMC, whose  clients  include Qualcomm Inc. and  Broadcom
Corp. (BRCM) , forecast second-quarter sales of NT$126 billion ($4.3
billion) to NT$128 billion, surpassing the NT$118 billion
average of analyst estimates, amid rising orders for its most-
advanced technology. That demand prompted Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Morris Chang  to raise his spending plan as
much as 42 percent to as high as $8.5 billion to boost capacity.  “TSMC will accelerate market-share gains by its broader
technology and effective capacity gap for 28 nanometer and
beyond,” said Ricky Liu, an analyst at KGI Securities. Liu
estimates TSMC may expand its foundry market share to 52 percent
this year from 49 percent in 2011, and to 54 percent in 2013. He
has an outperform rating on the stock with a 12-month target
price of NT$95.  The chipmaker yesterday reported first-quarter net income
of NT$33.5 billion, surpassing the NT$29.9 billion average of 16
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Gross margin and
operating margin also exceeded estimates.  Higher spending will increase costs and reduce the
company’s gross margins this year, while allowing the company to
boost sales and profitability from next year, Chief Financial
Officer Lora Ho said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
