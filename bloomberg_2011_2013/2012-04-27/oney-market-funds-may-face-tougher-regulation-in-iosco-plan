Global regulators are weighing
tougher rules for  money market funds  over concerns that they may
amplify future financial crises.  “Confidence shocks” in such funds can “quickly have a
broader macroeconomic impact,” the International Organization
of Securities Commissions said in a document  published  today on
its website.  Options being considered by regulators include imposing
stricter liquidity requirements on money market funds, and
reducing their reliance on credit ratings, IOSCO said.  IOSCO, based in  Madrid , is seeking views on the plans until
May 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
