The yen fell versus all of its
most-traded counterparts, paring a monthly advance, after the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  added monetary stimulus for a second time in three
months.  The yen dropped against the dollar and euro after BOJ
officials increased the bank’s asset-purchase fund by 10
trillion yen ($123 billion) to 40 trillion yen, according to a
statement released in Tokyo today. The euro weakened versus most
of its major peers this month after Standard & Poor’s cut
 Spain ’s sovereign debt rating, adding to concern the region’s
financial woes are spreading.  “The BOJ’s easing stance is fairly aggressive,” said
Kengo Suzuki, a foreign-exchange strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market
value. “The yen is being sold in a knee-jerk reaction.”  The yen lost 0.4 percent to 81.31 per dollar at 1:03 p.m.
in  Tokyo . It declined 0.3 percent to 107.36 per euro. The 17-
nation currency fell 0.1 percent to $1.3201.  All 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted
additional easing with most expecting an increase in asset
buying ranging from 5 trillion yen to 10 trillion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
