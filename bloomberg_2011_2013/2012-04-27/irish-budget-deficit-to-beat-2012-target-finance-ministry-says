Ireland’s government will beat its
budget deficit target for a second straight year in 2012, the
 Finance Ministry  said.  The deficit will narrow to 8.3 percent of gross domestic
product from an underlying 9.4 percent last year and a target of
8.6 percent, in part because of lower than anticipated debt-
servicing costs, the Dublin-based ministry said in an update to
its December forecasts. The target was set as part of the
nation’s bailout program.  Following its sixth review of Ireland’s 67.5 billion-euro
($89.5 billion) program, European and international authorities
said yesterday that while the country is on track to reach its
deficit target, “considerable challenges” remain. The economy
will grow 0.7 percent in 2012, the ministry said today, cutting
its December forecast of 1.3 percent.  “Prospects for domestic demand have weakened in the past
few months, while external headwinds remain significant,” the
ministry said. “The nascent recovery is expected to both
broaden and gain ground in 2013.”  The economy will grow 2.2 percent next year, the ministry
said, cutting its December forecast of 2.4 percent.  Ireland, which sought a bailout in 2010 after it was locked
out of international markets, may start a “gradual” return to
the market this summer, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said
yesterday. The National Treasury Management Agency said in
January it is looking at the possibility of selling short-term
debt in June or July.  “The NTMA remains in regular contact with a broad range of
market participants, and conditions permitting, is seeking to
gradually extend its presence in the short-term  debt market 
before seeking to raise longer-term debt later this year,” the
ministry said today.  Ireland’s October 2020 bonds, regarded as the benchmark,
yielded 6.86 percent, down from 9.1 percent at the start of
December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
