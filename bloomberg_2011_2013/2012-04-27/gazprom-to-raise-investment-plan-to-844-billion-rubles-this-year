OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, is raising its investment plan for this
year to 844 billion rubles from an earlier 777 billion rubles,
First Deputy Chief Financial Officer Alexander Ivannikov said.  Gazprom is planning group capital expenditures, including
spending on power and oil units, of 1.1 trillion rubles ($37.5
billion) this year. That would be a 32 percent decline from
capital expenditures of 1.63 trillion rubles in 2011, according
to a presentation on the state-run Russian producer and
exporter’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
