Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , Japan’s largest
steelmaker, returned to profit last quarter as the yen weakened
and a stock-market recovery boosted the value of its holdings,
including merger partner  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405)   Net income  was 59.7 billion yen ($735 million) in the three
months ended March 31, compared with a loss of 11.2 billion yen
a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said today in a
statement. That beat the 16.2 billion-yen median estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales fell 6 percent to
1.02 trillion yen.  The weakening of the yen from a record-high in October
helped restore the competitiveness of Japanese steelmakers
against South Korean and Chinese rivals.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) ,
 Japan ’s second-largest steel producer, posted a quarterly profit
even after forecasting a loss.  “The market has hit the bottom,” Executive Vice President
Shinichi Taniguchi told reporters in Tokyo today. “The pace of
recovery will be moderate, though.”  Nippon Steel shares closed unchanged at 201 in Tokyo after
earlier rising as much as 2 percent. That pared this year’s
gains for the stock to 4.7 percent. Sumitomo Metal was unchanged
at 145 yen.  Japanese steel producers are set to boost sales this year
as carmakers expand output and post-earthquake reconstruction
drives demand, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said in an April 16
report. Japan’s key stock index posted its biggest first-quarter
gain since 1988, fueled by the central bank’s Feb. 14 decision
to increase note purchases by 10 trillion yen.  The Japanese currency traded at 80.7 yen a dollar as of
4:57 p.m. in  Tokyo , after reaching 84.18 on March 15, the lowest
level this year. The yen rose to a postwar high of 75.35 on Oct.
31.  “The current level is still a bit tough” for steelmakers,
Taniguchi said. The ideal level for the yen for manufacturers is
85, or lower.  Nippon Steel didn’t provide a profit outlook for the year
that began April 1, citing the unsettled price of raw materials
and negotiations with customers. Net income may reach 96 billion
yen this year, according to the median estimate of 22 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company will increase crude steel output to as much as
7.6 million metric tons in the three months to June 30 from 7.39
million tons in the previous quarter, Taniguchi said. The
company won’t give a first-half outlook until July, he said.  Merger Partner  Sumitomo Metal Industries, Japan’s third-largest
steelmaker, posted a quarterly loss of 16.1 billion yen today,
narrowing from the 42.1 billion yen loss a year earlier.
Operating profit increased 15 percent to 19 billion yen.  The company, also the top producer of seamless steel pipes
used in oil and gas production, expects output of the alloy will
exceed 1 million tons in the current year as demand for high-end
pipes increase, Executive Vice President Fumio Honbe said today
at a press conference in Tokyo, without elaborating. The
steelmaker produced 990,000 tons of seamless pipes.  Sumitomo Metal, Nippon Steel’s biggest investment, advanced
19 percent in Tokyo trading in the last quarter, in line with
the gain in the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index. Nippon Steel
said April 2 it reversed 80.7 billion yen of losses in the
fourth quarter.  The two steelmakers plan to merge on Oct. 1, creating a
bigger company to compete against rivals including
 ArcelorMittal (MT) , South Korea’s Posco and China’s Baoshan Iron &
Steel Co.  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) , Japan’s fourth-largest mill, today posted
a loss of 26.8 billion yen in the fourth quarter, compared with
a profit of 5.7 billion yen a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
