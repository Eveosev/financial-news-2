Expedia Inc. (EXPE) , an online-travel
company, rose to the highest level since at least 2005 after
first-quarter profit and revenue topped analysts’ estimates,
driven by growth in the Hotels.com unit.  Expedia soared 24 percent to $40.31 in New York, the
highest closing price since at least July 2005. The Bellevue,
Washington-based company’s stock was the best  performer  in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Hotels.com, which markets hotel rooms online, helped drive
a 24 percent jump in global room-nights for Expedia during the
period, said Dara Khosrowshahi, the parent company’s chief
executive officer.  “We expect more progress going forward,” Khosrowshahi
said on a conference call yesterday. “We’re certainly not
counting on Hotels.com-like results, although we would be
pleased as punch if we got them.”  First-quarter profit excluding certain items was 26 cents a
share, the company said yesterday in a statement. That topped
the average estimate of 14 cents from analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Adjusted profit, which excludes the TripAdvisor business
spun off in December, rose 61 percent to $36.9 million.  Revenue climbed 12 percent to $816.5 million, topping
analysts’ average estimate of $790.1 million.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 24 percent to $102 million, the company said.  Expedia had a net loss of $3.3 million, or 2 cents a share,
compared with net income of $52 million, or 37 cents, a year
earlier.  “We had previously assumed the hotel improvements at
Expedia would not impact results meaningfully until the second
half and investment spending would continue to weigh on adjusted
EBITDA growth,” said Lloyd Walmsley, an analyst with Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., in a note to clients today. “Clearly
things are improving faster than we anticipated on the booking
side.” Walmsley  rates  the shares hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
