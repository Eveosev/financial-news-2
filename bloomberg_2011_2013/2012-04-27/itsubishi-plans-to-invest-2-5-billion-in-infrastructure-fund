Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest
trading house, said it plans to invest as much as $2.5 billion
in infrastructure projects in  North America  and  Europe  as part
of a fund alliance.  The trader, which owns assets ranging from coal mines to
wind farms, will join the Global Strategic Investment Alliance,
a group that seeks to raise $20 billion, Mitsubishi said in a
statement. The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, a
Canadian  pension plan , is leading the alliance, Mitsubishi said.  The investment will be made with  Mizuho Corporate Bank , a
unit of Japan’s third-largest lender, Japan Bank for
International Cooperation and the Pension Fund Association,
according to the statement.  “This will be the first time the Japanese public pension
fund has committed such a large-scale investment in
infrastructure assets,” Mitsubishi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
