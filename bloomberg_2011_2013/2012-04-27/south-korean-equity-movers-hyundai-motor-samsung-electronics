Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  South Korea trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Seoul.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 0.6 percent to 1,975.35. The gauge
advanced less than 0.1 percent this week.  Doosan Infracore Co. (042670)  (042670 KS), which bought Bobcat, a
maker of small- to medium-sized construction equipment in the
U.S., and other units from Ingersoll-Rand Co. in 2007, added 6.2
percent to 21,300 won, the highest level since April 3. Signed
contracts to buy U.S. homes rose more than forecast in March as
low  interest rates  drew buyers back into the market.  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  (000270 KS), South Korea’s second-largest
carmaker, climbed 1.4 percent to 80,700 won, the highest level
since April 5.  Net income  rose 26 percent to 1.2 trillion won
($1.1 billion) in the three months ended March, according to a
regulatory filing. That compares with the 948.4 billion won
average of 26  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. (009150)  (009150 KS), a South Korean
electronic components maker, rose 1.4 percent to 108,000 won,
advancing for a third day. Hyundai Securities Co. raised its
share-price estimate to 145,000 won from 131,000 won, citing
stronger-than-expected earnings.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  (005930 KS), Asia’s largest
consumer-electronics maker, climbed 2.5 percent to a record 1.37
million won. The company posted first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as surging sales of Galaxy smartphones
helped mask slumping earnings at its computer-chip business. Net
income was 5.05 trillion won, the company said in a statement.
The  average  of 29  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was
for profit of 4.24 trillion won.  Samsung SDI Co. (006400)  (006400 KS) rallied 7.5 percent to 151,000
won, the steepest gain since Oct. 6. The company reported first-
quarter operating profit of 67 billion won, an 11 percent
increase from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
