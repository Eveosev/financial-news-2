Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $3
billion loan has attracted a commitment of at least $100 million
from Chinatrust Commercial Bank as funds raised in senior
syndication total about $2 billion, said three people with
knowledge of the matter.  Alibaba, with enough commitments to avoid further
syndication, expects to complete the facility by the end of the
month, the people said, asking not to be identified because the
details are private.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Credit Suisse
Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. have already signed and
underwritten the facility, the people said.  Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank Co. committed $130 million to
the loan this week, while Barclays Plc and Morgan Stanley
committed $300 million each to the facility earlier this month,
said another person familiar with the matter yesterday. Bank of
East Asia Ltd., Natixis and Taishin International Bank also
joined the loan earlier this month, that person said.  The deadline for banks to respond with commitments is April
30, the people said. John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman
for Alibaba, declined to comment on the financing.  Alibaba Group, run by billionaire Jack Ma, offered HK$13.50
($1.74) a share for the 27 percent it doesn’t already own in
Alibaba.com Ltd., according to a Feb. 21 regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
