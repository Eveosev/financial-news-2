The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index jumped four basis points to
183 basis points as of 9:40 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. The gauge is set for its highest close since Jan.
18 and its sixth consecutive daily rise, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed five basis points
to 160.5 basis points as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The measure is headed for its sixth
straight weekly rise with a 1.1 basis point increase, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased three basis points to 167 as
of 8:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark has traded in a 132.5 to 209 range
this year, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
