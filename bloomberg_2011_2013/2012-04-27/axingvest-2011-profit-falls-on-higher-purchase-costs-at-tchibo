Maxingvest AG, which owns the
Tchibo GmbH coffee retail chain and a majority of  Beiersdorf
AG (BEI) ’s shares, said operating profit fell 41 percent in 2011 as
Tchibo faced higher purchase prices and profitability at
Beiersdorf’s consumer unit dwindled.  Earnings before interest and taxes and declined to 540
million euros ($711.3 million) from 908 million euros in the
year-earlier period, Hamburg-based Maxingvest said today in an
e-mailed statement. Ebit before one-time items dropped to 810
million euros from 1.04 billion euros, the  investment company 
said.  Ebit at Tchibo, which sells coffee and clothes, fell to
202 million euros from 288 million euros as cotton and raw
coffee prices surged. Ebit at Beiersdorf dropped 26 percent to
431 million euros as margins at the consumer-products unit
shrank in 2011.  Maxingvest expects a “slight improvement of sales and
earnings” in 2012, it said in its statement.  Tchibo Sales Growth  Sales climbed 2.5 percent to 9.17 billion euros from 8.95
billion euros. Tchibo and Beiersdorf, the maker of Nivea cream,
contributed 39 percent and 61 percent of revenue, respectively,
Maxingvest said. Maxingvest has a 50.9 percent stake in
Beiersdorf,  Bloomberg data  shows. Beiersdorf will report first-
quarter earnings on May 3.  Tchibo posted two-digit sales growth for single-serve
coffee, online retail and eastern  Europe , which Maxingvest
defines as “strategic growth areas.” Overall, sales grew about
5 percent at Tchibo last year, Maxingvest said.  Maxingvest, which in 2007 changed its name from Tchibo
Holding GmbH, was founded in 1949 by Max Herz and Carl
Tchilling-Hiryan as a mail-order company for coffee.  -- Editor: Mariajose Vera  To contact the reporter on this story:
