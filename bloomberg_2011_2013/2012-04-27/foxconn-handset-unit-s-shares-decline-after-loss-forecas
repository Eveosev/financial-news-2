Foxconn International Holdings
Ltd. (2038) , the phone unit of the world’s biggest contract maker of
electronics, fell the most in 3 1/2 years in  Hong Kong  trading
after forecasting its first-half loss will widen.  The  handset manufacturer  tumbled 16 percent to close at
HK$3.78, the biggest drop since October 2008. The stock has
declined 25 percent this year, compared with the 13 percent gain
in Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Weaker demand from major  customers  and higher costs are
expected to cause first-half loss to widen “significantly,”
Foxconn International said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday. The unit, controlled by Taiwan billionaire Terry Gou’s  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , is a supplier to  Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V) , which last week reported lower first-quarter handset sales.  Foxconn and other suppliers face “a difficult pricing
environment,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts Robert Yen and
Iris Wu wrote in a report today. Nokia’s business is being
affected by the growth of rivals including  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , according to the report.  Foxconn reported a $17.7 million net loss for the first
 half  of 2011. Last year, the Hong Kong-listed company had annual
net income of $72.8 million.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
