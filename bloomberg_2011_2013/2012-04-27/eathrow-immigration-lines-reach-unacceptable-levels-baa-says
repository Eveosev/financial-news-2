London Heathrow airport owner BAA
Ltd. says the time taken to clear immigration checks at the top
European hub has reached unacceptable levels in the past week.  Passengers have had to line up for hours even after the 11-
airline British Air Transport Association wrote to the U.K.
government last month saying stricter enforcement of passport
controls had the potential to cause chaos, BAA said today.  “Immigration waiting times during peak periods at Heathrow
recently have been unacceptable and we have called on the Border
Force to address the problem as a matter of urgency,” BAA, a
unit of  Ferrovial SA (FER) , said in a statement.  The U.K. Border Force was split from the Border Agency on
March 1 with a brief to impose more rigorous checks after a
report showed they’d been inconsistent since 2007. A probe was
ordered after Brodie Clark quit last year as the agency’s head
over allegations that immigration controls had been relaxed to
ease congestion at peak periods without ministerial permission.  The Border Force said in an e-emailed statement that a
backlog at Heathrow yesterday was prompted by weather disruption
which caused several flights to arrive at one time, and that it
makes every effort to lessen the impact of any holdups.  “We will not compromise border security but we always aim
to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to
meet demand,” it said. “Carrying out full checks can mean queues
at peak times while we ensure that only people entitled to enter
the U.K. can do so.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
