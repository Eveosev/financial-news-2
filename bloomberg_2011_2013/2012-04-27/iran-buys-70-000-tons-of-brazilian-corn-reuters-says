Iran ’s  State Livestock Affairs
Logistics , the state feed grain buyer, has bought 70,000 metric
tons of Brazilian corn in a tender that closed earlier this
week, according to a Reuters report, citing European traders.  The tender, for up to 150,000 tons, sought shipment between
May to June, Reuters said in a report yesterday.  A boost in the Iranian state grains agency’s purchases on
the international markets came as a result of private buyers
having problems buying the commodity amid western sanctions,
according to the report.  The U.S. and European Union have trade and financial
sanctions against Iran, aimed at pressuring the Persian Gulf
country to curb its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
