Colonial Pipeline Co. froze
nominations on Line 2, which carries distillates, for cycle 25,
according to a bulletin sent to shippers.  The notice applies to deliveries on the pipeline segment
north of Collins,  Mississippi , according to the notice. No new
nominations that increase the total amount of shipments will be
accepted.  Colonial delivers more than 2 million barrels a day of
gasoline, diesel, home heating oil and other refined products
through 5,500 miles (8,850 kilometers) of pipeline from Texas
and Louisiana refiners to the East Coast.  When the pipeline is full, refiners may have to sell excess
supply into the U.S. Gulf Coast market, which may push prices
lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
