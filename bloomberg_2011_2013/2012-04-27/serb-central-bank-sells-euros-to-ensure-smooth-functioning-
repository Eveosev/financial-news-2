The Serbian central bank sold euros
to banks for a fifth consecutive day to ease pressure on the
dinar ahead of May 6 general elections.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 20 million
euros ($27 million) today to “ensure smooth functioning” of
the market, it said in a statement on its website.  The central bank has spent a total 698.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which has fallen
10 percent against the euro compared with the same period last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
