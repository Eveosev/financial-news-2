Total SA (FP)  sold its 51 percent stake
in U.S. composites distributor Composites One to joint venture
partner GLS Composites Distribution Corp. as part of an
“assertive” reshuffling of its refining and chemical assets.  The sale by Total affiliate CCP Composites will allow it to
focus on composites resins, the Paris-based company said today
in a statement, without giving a sales price. The business
includes production of unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl
esters and gel coats.  “The transaction is aligned with Total’s assertive
management of its asset portfolio, especially in the refining
and chemicals sector,” according to Total.  Europe’s third-biggest energy producer earlier reported a
77 percent slump in first-quarter earnings from refining and
chemicals due to a “strong deterioration” in European
petrochemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
