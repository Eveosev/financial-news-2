     (Corrects to show natural gas is priced per thousand
cubic feet, not per million cubic feet.)  When Rod MacGregor launched GlassPoint Solar in
Fremont, California, in 2009, he tried to sell its solar
technology to domestic oil companies. His pitch: By harnessing
the sun to power their pumping equipment, they wouldn’t have
to pay for the natural gas they typically used to extract
heavy crude. Few deals resulted, but MacGregor persisted.  Now with natural gas prices at less than $2 per thousand
cubic feet, a 10-year low in the U.S., the Scottish-born
serial entrepreneur is packing on the frequent flier
miles, focusing on Middle Eastern countries with abundant
sunlight and hard-to-reach heavy crude, where many oil
companies pay $10 or more per thousand cubic feet for the
liquid natural gas that powers their extraction machinery.  The alternative MacGregor is selling is a massive
greenhouse packed with 20-foot-tall rectangular mirrors that
direct magnified sunlight at water-filled pipes to create
steam. The idea is to pipe the 600-degree steam deep into the
ground to heat rock where thick, gunky heavy crude sits in
holes and crevices. As the hot rock liquefies the oil, the
high-pressure steam creates a bubble that forces the oil up.
"Imagine you're blowing in a straw and there's a bubble
forming underground," says MacGregor, 51.  This technology, known as solar thermal generation, is
new in the oil industry, with a handful of companies trying to
sell the technology. Over the past few years, BrightSource
Energy in Oakland, California, Paris-based Areva, and Lotus
Solar Technologies in Cairo have all added oil extraction
capabilities to the solar equipment they sell that drives
steam-powered turbines. With increasingly cheap solar panel
technology available as well, the road is shaky. BrightSource
withdrew its planned initial public offering in early
April, citing too much volatility in the green energy market.  Besides those challenges, there are two big hurdles to
oil companies' adoption of solar thermal plants: They can only
produce steam during the day, switching to natural gas at
night, and they have to be massive to generate enough steam to
pump heavy oil from an average-size field. MacGregor says for
GlassPoint to generate enough steam, a customer would have to
install more than 100 of its 13-acre greenhouses. He won’t say
what he charges.  For now, GlassPoint is hoping its two pilot projects will
convince would-be customers to invest. It opened the nascent
industry’s first commercial facility in the Mojave Desert in
early 2011 as a proof-of-concept test for Berry Petroleum. In
February, Petroleum Development Oman began construction of a
GlassPoint test facility near Oman’s capital, which produces
27 times more steam and is scheduled to be completed in
December.  The state oil company accounted for most of GlassPoint's
$6 million in revenue last year. This year, MacGregor expects
$30 million to $50 million, through two or three deals of
"substantial scale." Despite rock-bottom natural gas prices in
the U.S., MacGregor also believes California will be a strong
market because of tightening regulations to reduce carbon
dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels.  By 2014 natural gas prices in the U.S. are expected to
reach $4 per thousand cubic feet, making solar thermal
technology a competitive option, says Pavel Molchanov, an
analyst for financial services firm Raymond James & Associates
in St. Petersburg, Florida. That year, oil companies will
spend just more than $16 billion globally on so-called
enhanced oil recovery technologies like GlassPoint used to
extract heavy crude, according to Wellesley
(Massachusetts)-based market analysts BCC Research.  GlassPoint and its competitors won't have full-size
operations in oil fields until 2015, Molchanov predicts. Even
then, solar thermal's share of the enhanced oil recovery
market will be very small. So over the next three
years, GlassPoint and its rivals won't be fighting over market
share. Instead, they will be proving return on investment.
"This is classic market-seeding mode right now," Molchanov
says. "There is clearly tremendous opportunity for adoption of
solar [enhanced oil recovery] in the long run.”  MacGregor says GlassPoint holds a “significant” number of
patents on the design of its greenhouses, which contain curved
mirrors made of anodized aluminum to magnify sunlight, along
with the pipes, valves, solar receivers, and pumps used to
make and move the steam. The enclosure makes GlassPoint's
design different from its rivals, which construct fields of
sunlight-directing mirrors. GlassPoint claims its greenhouses
take up less space and cut maintenance costs by protecting
mirrors from dust- and sand-carrying winds that can reach as
high as 85 mph in desert oil fields.  Without a full-scale operation, GlassPoint has yet to
prove its design is better. MacGregor has stumbled once before
with the technology. His original idea was to sell the
greenhouses to Sheetrock factories as a cheaper, eco-friendly
alternative to the natural gas used to heat ovens. When it
became clear his product was too expensive for the market, he
switched gears and aimed his sales efforts at the oil
industry.  This time around, MacGregor isn't touting the
environmental benefits of solar energy. Instead, he's focused
on reducing customers' costs. "Oil companies are not out there
to save the planet, they're out there to hit economic
objectives," he says.  To contact the reporter on this story: Antone Gonsalves
