Grob-Werke GmbH & Co KG, a German
manufacturer of metal cutting  machine tools , increased the size
of a loan facility signed last July to 550 million euros ($726
million) from 290 million euros.  The facility includes an increased 200 million-euro
revolving credit, a larger 300 million-euro guarantee facility
and an unchanged 50 million-euro term loan, according to an e-
mailed statement from coordinator  UniCredit SpA. (UCG)  The five-year
debtâ€™s maturity remains July 2016 and the pricing is the same,
lenders said.  The loans will be used for general corporate purposes, the
Mindelheim-based company said last year, and to issue letters of
credit which are typically used to ensure payments in
international trade finance.  UniCredit was joined in syndication by 10 banks, including
Deutsche Bank AG as bookrunner, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
