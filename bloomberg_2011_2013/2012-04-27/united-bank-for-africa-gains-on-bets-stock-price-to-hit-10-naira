United Bank for Africa Plc , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 19 countries, gained the most
since Feb. 17 as investors expect the stock price to reach about
10 naira on the profit target for 2012, Kundila Finance said.  The stock rose by the daily limit of 5 percent to close in
Lagos at 3.57 naira, the highest since Oct. 14  UBA, as the lender is known, expects a full-year profit of
50 billion naira ($317 million), Raheem Mohammed, chief
operating officer of Kundila, said today, citing Phillips Oduoza, the bank’s managing director, who spoke to stockbrokers
in Lagos. “That will put it in the same bracket with other
banks with prices of about 10 naira,” Mohammed said.  First-quarter profit after tax more than tripled to 13.8
billion naira from 3.9 billion naira a year earlier, the lender
said on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
