Merck & Co. (MRK) , the second-largest
U.S. drugmaker, reported first-quarter profit that beat analyst
 estimates  on higher sales of diabetes treatments.  Net income  rose 67 percent to $1.74 billion, or 56 cents a
share, from a year earlier, the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-
based company said today in a statement. Earnings per share
excluding one-time items beat by 1 cent the 98-cent average of
18 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue climbed 1.3 percent to $11.7 billion, boosted by
higher sales of the Januvia and Janumet diabetes drugs. Merck
has been cutting thousands of jobs and trying to boost demand of
existing products to prepare for when asthma treatment Singulair
faces cheaper copies in August. Analysts say the focus now turns
to the company’s medicines in development after research
setbacks in recent years.  “Merck is emerging from a challenging 2011,” said  Tony Butler , an analyst with Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, in a
April 16 research report. “The stock has been on a path of
recovery since last November, but this has been more correlated
with the dividend increase and flow into the pharma sector as a
whole than a restoration of sentiment around Merck’s innovation
core.”  Merck boosted its dividend by 11 percent in November, the
first increase since 2004. First-quarter net income in 2011 was
$1.04 billion, or 34 cents, when Merck took a $500 million
charge to settle a dispute with  Johnson & Johnson. (JNJ)   Merck Shares  Merck fell 1 cent to $38.46 at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The
shares have gained 7.9 percent in the past 12 months.  Merck reiterated its 2012 forecast for  earnings  excluding
one-time items of $3.75 to $3.85 a share, with net income
projected to be $2.04 to $2.30. Revenue this year will be at or
near 2011 levels on a constant currency basis, Merck said. At
current exchange rates, sales would be hurt by 2 to 3 percent,
according to the company.  Sales of Januvia jumped 24 percent to $919 million, while
revenue from Janumet surged 29 percent to $392 million. The
company’s human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil increased 33
percent to $284 million.  Merck has five major products in development that the
company is focusing on over the next two years. Investors are
concerned about Merck’s research operations after the company
halted a study of its experimental blood thinner vorapaxar, said
Butler.  “Investor reactions toward these five candidates can be
described as lukewarm if not cynical,” Butler said in the
report. “Operational results in the quarter are unlikely to
change sentiment, and we believe that Merck needs to deliver on
pipelines to restore enthusiasm towards the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Shannon Pettypiece in  New
