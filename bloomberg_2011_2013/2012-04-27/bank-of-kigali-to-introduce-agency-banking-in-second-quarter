Bank of Kigali Ltd. ,  Rwanda ’s
biggest lender by assets, plans to introduce agency banking in
the second quarter to expand its share of retail banking in the
East African nation, said Chairman Lado Gurgenidze.  The move will enable the bank to tap potential customers
who currently don’t have access to a bank account and offset
increased competition, Gurgenidze told investors today in
Kigali, the capital. Under the agency-banking system, agents at
locations including supermarkets and gas stations are able to
dispense cash and take deposits.  The “recruitment of 400 existing businesses, as agents, is
underway and the service will help the bank compete and position
itself as the leading lender, while reaching the unbanked,”
Gurgenidze said.  Rwanda plans to increase the number of people with a bank
account to 80 percent of the population by 2020 from 21 percent
now. Bank of Kigali will become the third lender to introduce
agency banking, after  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  of Kenya and  Kenya
National Bank Ltd. (KNCB) ’s Rwandan unit introduced the service in the
East African country.  The Rwandan lender also plans to open 12 more branches by
the end of this year, bringing the total to 56, Gurgenidze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
