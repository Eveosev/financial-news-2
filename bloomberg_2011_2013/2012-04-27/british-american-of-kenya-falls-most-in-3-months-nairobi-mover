British-American Investments Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan company which owns money managers and insurance
businesses, dropped the most since January after a technical
signal indicated the stock was poised to fall.  The stock declined 6.8 percent, the most since Jan. 4, to
4.80 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital.  An eight-day rally between April 16 and 25 pushed the stock
20 percent higher, leaving the 14-day relative strength index at
83.19 on April 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
reading above 70 means a security is overvalued and will
probably fall. British American’s RSI has been above 70 since
April 18.  “It is coming off because if you look at the counters
that have gained of late, we are seeing some profit taking,”
Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
