Andrea Enria,  Europe ’s top banking
regulator, called for powers to create a legally-binding list of
financial instruments that banks can count as part of their
loss-bearing reserves.  The  European Banking Authority  should keep a strict list of
authorized capital structures to make sure that no European
Union state diverges from the region’s standards for so-called
core tier one capital, Enria, chairman of the EBA, said in a
speech in Dublin at a conference organized by Ireland’s central
bank.  “Strong mechanisms should be put in place to make sure
that there is no room for watering down the requirements,”
Enria said.  The EBA, set up last year to harmonize banking rules across
the European Union, has told banks to raise 114.7 billion euros
($186 billion) in fresh capital by the end of June as part of
measures introduced to respond to the euro area’s sovereign-debt
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
