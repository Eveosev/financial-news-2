Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  overtook
 Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  as the world’s biggest vendor of mobile phones for the
first time, ending the Finnish company’s 14-year run as the
global leader, according to an industry study.  Samsung shipped 93.5 million handsets in the first quarter,
36 percent more than a year earlier, compared with 82.7 million
for second-ranked Nokia, researcher  Strategy Analytics  said in a
statement today. Demand for Galaxy smartphones helped Suwon,
South Korea-based Samsung post first-quarter net income today of
5.05 trillion won ($4.5 billion), beating  analysts’ estimates .  Nokia had been the biggest mobile-phone maker by shipments
since 1998, when the Espoo, Finland-based company took over the
spot from  Motorola Inc. (MMI)  Nokia  reported  a 1.34 billion-euro ($1.8
billion) first-quarter operating loss after handset sales
slumped. Both smartphones and low-end handsets declined as
Nokia’s aging portfolio was outpaced by handsets running  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android. Its handset shipments in China  fell  62 percent.  “Last year Samsung became No. 1 in Europe while Nokia
retained the No. 1 position in most  emerging markets ,” Tom
Kang, a Seoul-based research analyst at Strategy Analytics, said
in a phone interview today. “In the first quarter, we expect
Samsung took a lot of market share from Nokia in Asia. China and
India were the two biggest markets where Samsung gained.”  Nokia Stock Drops  Nokia  dropped  as much as 2.5 percent to 2.69 euros, the
lowest price in more than 15 years based on closing prices, and
was trading down 0.6 percent as of 11:31 a.m. in Helsinki.
Samsung gained  2.5 percent  to a record 1,374,000 won at the
close in Seoul.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is the world’s third-biggest maker of mobile-
phones after shipments rose 89 percent to 35.1 million last
quarter, according to Strategy Analytics.  “Samsung will probably still be No. 1 in the second
quarter, but the full year will be a close call because the
third and fourth quarters are traditionally Nokia’s best,” Kang
said.  Samsung also regained the lead from Apple as the world’s
biggest vendor of smartphones in the first quarter. Smartphone
shipments surged 41 percent in the quarter, the analysts said.  The South Korean electronics maker shipped 44.5 million
smartphones in the first three months of the year, giving it
about 31 percent of the market, Strategy Analytics said. Apple
shipped 35.1 million units, accounting for about 24 percent of
the market, it said. Nokia ranked third in the segment.  Windows Phone Sales  Nokia said this month that its new smartphone line using
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone platform sold more than 2
million units in the first quarter out of 11.9 million
smartphones that Strategy Analytics said the Finnish company had
shipped.  Samsung accounted for about 25 percent of the global
handset market by shipments, while Nokia’s market share was
almost 23 percent, according to Strategy Analytics. Apple’s
market share was 9.5 percent, it said.  Global mobile-phone shipments rose 3.3 percent to 368
million last quarter, according to Strategy Analytics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
