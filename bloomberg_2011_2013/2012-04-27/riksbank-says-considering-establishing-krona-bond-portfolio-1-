Sweden’s Riksbank is considering
building a portfolio of krona bonds that would help it enact
crisis measures faster, officials at the bank’s monetary and
financial stability departments said in a commentary.  While the bank’s systems have worked well both in normal
times and during the financial crisis, that doesn’t guarantee
future success, Heidi Elmer, Peter Sellin and Per Aasberg Sommar
said in a commentary on the bank’s website today.  “The Riksbank is therefore now reviewing how to further
improve preparedness in the framework in order to be able to
deal with future crises that may require different measures,”
they wrote. “Acquiring a bond portfolio in Swedish kronor once
again could ensure that the Riksbank has the systems, routines
and knowledge needed to be able to take extraordinary measures
at short notice in the future.”  The Swedish central bank has cut  interest rates  twice since
December to prevent the largest Nordic economy from falling into
a recession after output shrank at the end of 2011. The bank
left the benchmark repo rate at 1.5 percent at this month’s
meeting.  Riksbank crisis measures during the financial turmoil that
started in 2007 helped the country achieve the biggest economic
rebound in the European Union in 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
