Treasury 10-year note yields rose
from a 12-week low as a report showing first-quarter growth
increased tempered a rally triggered in Europe by concern that
the region’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen.  The term premium, a model created by economists at the
Federal Reserve, show that Treasuries were at almost the most
expensive levels in seven weeks. Pacific Investment Management
Co.’s Mohamed El-Erian said the lower-than-forecast growth
figures suggests additional monetary stimulus remains on option
for the Fed even though there is no immediate need for action.  “People are not clamoring for the securities at these
levels,” said James Combias, New York-based head of Treasury
trading at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., one of 21 primary dealers
that trade Treasuries with the Federal Reserve. “The  bond
market  will need a new catalyst to propel yields a lot lower.
They are low enough.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.93 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
after reaching 1.88 percent, the lowest since Feb. 3, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note maturing in
February 2022 rose 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face value, to
100 18/32. Ten-year rates have fallen six basis points since
touching 1.99 percent on April 20.  Two-year  rates  fell to as low as 0.25 percent today, a
level unseen since Feb. 10, while the 30-year yield dropped to
3.06 percent, matching the lowest since Feb. 29.  “We’re seeing prices improve,” said  David Ader , head of
U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “You’re not seeing follow-through with
momentum. It’s indicative of a market that’s getting tired.”  Term Premium  The term premium touched negative 0.66 percent. It reached
negative 0.67 percent on April 23, the most expensive on a
closing basis since March 6. A negative reading indicates
investors are willing to accept yields below what’s considered
fair value.  Ten-year notes completed a six-week  advance , the longest
series of gains since June, on concern Europe’s debt crisis was
widening. U.S. bonds have returned 1.4 percent since March 31,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch gauge. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index of U.S. shares has handed investors a 3.4
percent loss over the same period, including reinvested
dividends.  A rally in 10-year Treasuries next week would match the
seven-consecutive-week rise ended in December 2008.  ‘Below 2 Percent’  “As long as  Europe  continues to give us positive reasons
to stay below 2 percent, then we’ll be below it,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist in New York at primary dealer Mizuho
Securities USA, Inc. “I don’t think there’s anything in the
domestic data to upset that.”  The  U.S. economy  expanded at an annualized rate of 2.2
percent in the first quarter, from 3 percent in the previous
three-month period, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a rise
of 2.5 percent.  “If we continue this weakening trend, the Fed will come
back in and try to sustain this market and this economy,” El-
Erian, the chief executive officer of the world’s largest
manager of bond funds, said during an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “I don’t think
there is an immediate need now.”  The  Federal Reserve  bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of so-called quantitative easing from December 2008 to
June to boost the economy.  The U.S. sold $8.63 billion in notes maturing from July
2014 to April 2015 as part of the central bank’s plan to replace
$400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer
maturities to hold down borrowing costs.  Volume, Volatility  Trading  volume  dropped to $195.5 billion, from $246.6
billion yesterday, according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker. The average in 2012 is $249 billion. Volume
reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest since August.  Volatility dropped yesterday to the lowest since June 2007.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
Treasury price swings based on options, dropped to 65.2 basis
points. It reached 93.3 basis points on March 20, the highest
level this year. It has averaged 112.56 basis points for the
past five years.  S&P lowered  Spain ’s long-term sovereign-credit rating
yesterday by two levels to BBB+ from A, with a negative outlook.
The nation’s budget trajectory is likely to worsen and the
country may need to provide more fiscal support to banks, the
ratings company said in a statement yesterday.  ‘Negative Growth’  Spain, the fourth-biggest economy in the euro region, is
scheduled to auction notes maturing in 2015 and 2017 on May 3.
The nation’s 10-year bond  yields  climbed to 6.16 percent last
week, the highest this year, and were at 5.90 percent today.  “If you already have negative growth in lots of the
economies, and it’s a situation where they will go with
austerity measures to reduce debt burdens, it’s more of a
negative impact as those measures start to take hold,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in  New
York  at CIBC World Markets Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
