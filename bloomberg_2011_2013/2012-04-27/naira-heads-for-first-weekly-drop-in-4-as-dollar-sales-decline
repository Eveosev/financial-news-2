Nigeria ’s naira fell for a second
day, heading for its first weekly drop in four, after declining
dollar sales from the  central bank  and energy companies.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent to 157.6 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of 11:57
a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, poised for a weekly
decline of 0.2 percent.  The Central Bank of Nigeria this week  sold  $230.5 million
at its regular foreign-exchange auctions, the least since
November. The Abuja-based regulator sells foreign currency on
Mondays and Wednesdays to stabilize the naira. The oil industry
is the second major supplier of dollars to the market.  The central bank “is not selling as much as it did,” Jide Solanke, an analyst at Lagos-based First Securities Discount
House Ltd., said by phone today.  Oil companies  have also not
sold as much as the previous week, he said.  Nigerian  inflation  accelerated to 12.1 percent in March as
food prices increased, the National Bureau of Statistics said
April 25, adding to expectations the central bank will keep
 interest rates  at a record high of 12 percent.  Governor Lamido Sanusi said the inflation data were in line
with estimates, with the bank still expecting a peak of 14.5
percent in the third quarter and a gradual slowdown to below 10
percent by the end of 2013.  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 was little changed at 5.451 percent. Borrowing costs of
domestic bonds due 2015 declined one basis point to 15.01
percent, according to the April 26 data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.855 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
