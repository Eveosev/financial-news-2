OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel climbed for
the first time in five days after Russian billionaire Alisher
Usmanov said he’s increasing the stake he controls in the
country’s biggest mining company.  The stock added as much as 1.2 percent and traded up 0.7
percent at 5,120 rubles as of 11:50 a.m. in Moscow. The
benchmark Micex Index increased 0.2 percent to 1,449.91.  “We are increasing our stake now,” Usmanov said in an
interview with Rossiya-24 state television, without providing
more details. Usmanov’s Metalloinvest holding company had 4
percent of Norilsk before the company’s latest buyback offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
