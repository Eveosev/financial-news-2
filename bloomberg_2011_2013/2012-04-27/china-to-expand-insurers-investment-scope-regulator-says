China will broaden the investment
scope of insurers and simplify approval procedures to boost the
industry’s support to the nation’s economic growth, the
insurance regulator said.  The China Insurance Regulatory Commission will gradually
increase the types of unsecured corporate bonds that insurers
can buy, Chairman  Xiang Junbo  said during a trip to Wenzhou in
eastern Zhejiang province, according to a  statement  posted on
the watchdog’s website today.  The regulator will also “appropriately” adjust the
percentage ceilings on different asset classes in insurance
companies’ portfolios, Xiang said without being specific. The
agency will tighten supervision on the companies’ ability to
settle claims as it loosens restrictions on their investment
behavior, he added.  The new measures may be tested in Wenzhou, Xiang said,
adding that his agency will support qualified private investors
in the city to set up regional insurance companies.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
