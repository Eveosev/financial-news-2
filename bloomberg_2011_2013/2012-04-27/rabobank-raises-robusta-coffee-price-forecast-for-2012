Rabobank International raised price
forecasts for robusta coffee traded in  London  for the rest of
this year on falling European stockpiles and steady demand.  The beans, used in instant coffee and espresso, will
average $1,950 a metric ton in the second quarter and $1,850 a
ton in the following three months, up from respective prior
forecasts of $1,750 and $1,650, the bank said in a monthly
report e-mailed today. Rabobank raised its estimate for the
fourth-quarter average to $1,800 a ton from $1,600.  “The Liffe price forecast was increased as falling
European stocks and strong demand for robusta globally have
moderated the impacts of a record 2011-12 Vietnamese crop,”
London-based analyst Keith Flury said in the report.  Robusta stockpiles with valid certificates in warehouses
monitored by NYSE Liffe came to 181,730 tons as of April 16,
down 3.6 percent from two weeks earlier, exchange figures show.
Inventories have been falling since reaching a record 417,420
tons on July 11.  Vietnam  will produce a record 22.1 million bags
of coffee in 2011-12, according to Volcafe, a unit of
commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Vietnam’s Crop  “Roasters and end-users in  Europe  have likely run-down
robusta coverage on expectations of lower prices after the 2011-
12 Vietnamese harvest,” Flury said. “The unsupplied demand
remains the bullish force that has supported the London
market.”  Robusta coffee has risen 10 percent this year on NSYE Liffe
in London as farmers in Vietnam held back beans after prices
fell 14 percent in 2011. Farmer selling in Vietnam is likely to
climb as supplies gain with the start of harvests in Brazil,
 Indonesia  and  Africa , Flury said.  Brazil  is the second-largest
robusta producer and Indonesia ranks third.  Raw sugar traded in  New York  will average 22 cents a pound
in the second quarter, down from a previous estimate of 23
cents, as supplies outpace demand, according to the report. The
global sugar surplus will be 6.9 million tons, the biggest in
six seasons, Rabobank estimated.  Millers in  India , the world’s second-largest producer after
Brazil, owed farmers almost $2 billion in cane repayments as of
mid-April, the bank said. The arrears are unlikely to reduce the
planted area next season, it said.  Cocoa Surplus  Global cocoa supplies will outpace demand by 14,000 tons in
the 2011-12 season started in October, Rabobank said, reversing
a previous forecast for a shortage of 40,000 tons.  Cocoa will average 1,575 pounds ($2,558) a ton in London in
the second quarter and 1,650 pounds in the following three
months, below respective prior forecasts of 1,650 pounds and
1,700 pounds, according to the report. The beans will average
1,750 pounds in the fourth quarter, up from 1,650 pounds
previously, the bank said.  “The global cocoa market is undervalued along the curve
through 2012-13 in our view as demand growth is strong,” Flury
said. “ Ivory Coast ’s forward selling scheme has increased the
likelihood of disruptions and could result in lower-quality
beans and a delay in shipments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
