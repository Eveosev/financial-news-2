Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) , the
Japanese maker of air-conditioners and satellites, fell the most
in almost three months after predicting lower-than-expected
profit and saying refunds for overcharging may hit earnings.  The  company  dropped as much as 5.5 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Jan. 30. It was down 4.2 percent at 703
yen of as 2:18 p.m. in  Tokyo .  Melco, based in Tokyo, predicted net income of 120 billion
yen ($1.5 billion) this fiscal year, trailing the 136.5 billion
yen average of 17  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
forecast excluded costs from excess charging on government
contracts, which has also caused Melco to be barred from bidding
on some state orders.  Refunds may have a “material effects on the Group’s future
financial results,” the company said in a  statement . The size
of the impact is not yet clear, it said.  The overcharging issue arose in January, centered on the
company’s electronic-systems business. The unit was subsequently
blocked from bidding on contracts offered by the Ministry of
Defense and other agencies. Four affiliates were also halted
from bidding on defense ministry contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
