Poland’s zloty headed for a second
monthly retreat on concern the euro area debt crisis will
escalate, driving investors from assets perceived to be riskier.  The zloty was little changed at 4.1775 per euro by 12:29
p.m. in Warsaw, taking its April losses to 0.6 percent. Yields
on  10-year government  bonds  were also little changed at 5.389
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spain ’s credit rating was cut yesterday for the second time
this year by  Standard & Poor’s  on concern the nation will have
to provide further support to the banking industry. Emerging-
market stocks headed for a second month of declines.  “Anyone who had doubted that the debt crisis would raise
its head again is likely to have abandoned that hope now,”  Lutz Karpowitz , a Frankfurt-based strategist at Commerzbank AG, wrote
in a research report today, citing the Spanish downgrade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
