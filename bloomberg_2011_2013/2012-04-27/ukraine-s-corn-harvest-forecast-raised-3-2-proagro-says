Ukraine’s corn harvest is seen at
22 million metric tons, agriculture researcher ProAgro said,
raising it’s previous forecast by 3.2 percent, as farmers are
expected to plant more.  Farmers may increase corn plantings by 14 percent to 4.2
million hectares (10.4 million acres) from 3.67 million hectares
last year, the Kiev-based researcher said in a statement on its
website today.  Average corn yields will decline to 5.5 tons per a hectare
from 6 million hectares last year, the researcher said.  Ukraine harvested 22.8 million tons of corn last year,
which was 90 percent more than in 2010, according to the state
statistics office web site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
