Banco BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11)  forecasts
Brazil’s benchmark interest rate at 8.5 percent in May and sees
room for an additional cut of 25 basis points in July, according
to a report sent today by e-mail.  “One distinct possibility within that range of alternative
scenarios would be for the committee to cut its  base rate  by 50
basis points in May, replicate at that point the 2005-07
rhetorical escalation with mention to even greater parsimony,
and then close the cycle with a 25 basis-point cut in July,”
economists Eduardo Loyo and Claudio Ferraz wrote in the report
dated yesterday.  The central bank’s first use of the term ’parsimony’ was in
the minutes of its April 2006 meeting, which, as it turned out,
“telegraphed the return, in May, to the  earlier 50  basis-point
pace”, the economists wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
