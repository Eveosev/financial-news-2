(Corrects combined tanker capacity and relative share to
each destination in story published April 27.)  Oil tankers able to haul a combined
9.4 million barrels a day went to the Saudi Arabian crude-export
terminal at  Ras Tanura  in the latest week, ship-tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Vessels with a combined capacity of 8.98 million deadweight
tons arrived at the port in the week to April 21, compared with
11.3 million tons a week earlier, the data show. To estimate
that tonnage in terms of barrels a day, the figure was
multiplied by 7.33 to calculate the total barrels and then
divided by seven, the number of days in the period.  Some of the ships may not have loaded all their cargoes at
Ras Tanura, the data show.  South Korea  will be the largest
recipient, followed by  China . The Ras Tanura complex, including
Ras al-Ju’aymah, is the world’s biggest crude terminal,
according to the website of state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co.,
known as  Saudi Aramco .  The first of the following tables lists by country the
combined deadweight tonnage of tankers that called at Ras Tanura
in the latest week, based on signals from the ships’ captains.
The second gives weekly total tonnage for tankers calling at the
terminal this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
