Germany ’s Christian Social Union,
the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
Christian Democrats, won’t support aid to distressed banks from
the euro area’s rescue fund,  Augsburger Allgemeine  said, citing
Bavaria’s Finance Minister Markus Soeder.  “We very clearly reject that the European Stability
