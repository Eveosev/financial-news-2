The  European Central Bank  said
small and medium-sized companies in the euro region predict
access to bank funding will worsen in the next six months.  The companies expect access will deteriorate a net 7
percent for bank loans and a net 8 percent for bank overdrafts
between April and September, according to a survey of 7,511
firms conducted between Feb. 29 and March 29. Small- and medium-
sized companies, or SMEs, perceived a net worsening of 20
percent in the supply of bank loans between October 2011 and
March 2012, the ECB said in an e-mailed report today.  The ECB has flooded financial markets with more than 1
trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) in cheap three-year loans to
unlock credit in the 17-member economy. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on April 4 the tenders were designed in a way to
allow banks that are close to SMEs to access the funds.  Companies reported a net increase in their need for bank
loans, possibly reflecting lower profits, the ECB said. Rising
demand may also reflect “high uncertainty with respect to
available bank funding sources,” it said.  Demand for bank loans increased “broadly” across euro-
region countries, most strongly in  Greece  and  Italy  and, to a
lesser extent, in  Portugal , the ECB said. Dutch and Austrian
SMEs reported a net decline in demand, the ECB said.  About 93 percent of the companies surveyed have less than
250 employees, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
