Latvian banks allocated loan-loss
provisions of 10.2 percent of total credit portfolios in March,
down from 11.7 percent the previous month, after Parex Banka had
its banking license withdrawn, the banking regulator said.  Provisions were 1.25 billion lati ($2.37 billion) at the
end of last month, the regulator said in an e-mailed statement.
Provisions in February without Parex would have lowered the
figure to 10.1 percent, according to the statement. Loans late
by more than 90 days were 13.7 percent of the total, compared to
17.4 percent at the end of February, the regulator said.
Adjusted for Parex, loans late by more than 90 days would have
been 13.7 percent in February, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
