The Romanian leu weakened the most
in more than six weeks against the euro and stocks fell after
the government was toppled in a no-confidence vote.  The leu depreciated 0.4 percent to 4.3962 per euro by 3:58
p.m. in Bucharest, the biggest intraday slump since March 15 and
compared with a record low of 4.4012 in June 2010. The country’s
benchmark  BET index  slid 0.6 percent to 5,317.58 as  Fondul
Proprietatea SA (FP)  retreated 1.6 percent.  The opposition Social Democrats and Liberals were backed by
235 legislators in the 460-seat Parliament in the vote on the
government. The ouster may complicate the International Monetary
Fund’s review of a precautionary accord with the country as
 Romania  tries to reassure investors it will keep fiscal
discipline.  “From a market perspective the positive is that all the
main political parties have expressed support for the IMF
programme,” Timothy Ash, a London-based strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mail today. “Albeit
clearly the flux in Romanian politics reflects the strains of
forcing through fiscal adjustment and structural reform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
