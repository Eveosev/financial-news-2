Boeing Co. (BA)  reached an agreement to
sell 20 long-range 777 jets, the planemaker’s most-profitable
model, to  China Eastern  Airlines Corp. in a deal with a list
value of about $6 billion.  China Eastern’s board approved the purchase along with the
sale of five Airbus SAS A340 four-engine planes, according to a
filing today with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Both
transactions are subject to ratification by shareholders, said
China Eastern, the country’s second-biggest airline.  Chinese airlines have become large customers for Boeing and
Airbus as the nation’s economic growth spurs  travel demand . The
country will probably order 5,000 planes in the 20 years ending
2030, according to a  forecast  from Chicago-based Boeing.  The 777 deal requires approval from the Chinese government,
and the planemaker won’t post it as an order until regulators
act, said Miles Kotay, a Boeing spokesman. China Eastern didn’t
release terms on the acquisition of the 20 twin-engine planes,
and airlines typically buy at a discount to  list prices .  Boeing rose 0.4 percent to $77.27 at 4 p.m. in New York
trading. The shares have advanced 5.3 percent  this year ,
trailing a 12 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  A340 Production Ended  China Eastern’s fleet number 377 planes at the end of 2011,
split mostly between Boeing and Airbus jets, according to the
carrier’s annual report.  The airline is planning to sell the five A340s after Airbus
said in November it ended production of the model. The aircraft,
which started service in 1993, was the shortest-lived program
for the world’s largest maker of commercial aircraft as
customers preferred Boeing’s twin-engine 777.  Rising fuel prices have reduced the attractiveness of four-
engine aircraft, such as the A340 and Boeing’s 747 jumbo jets.  The twin-aisle 777 carries 400 passengers in a typical two-
class setup and can seat as many as 440, Boeing said on its
website, and has the range to nonstop routes such as  London  to
 Los Angeles . Last year’s net orders for the 777 totaled 200, up
from 76 in 2010 and the most since at least 2003.  The 777 entered service in 1995, and was the company’s most
advanced aircraft until last year’s commercial debut of the 787
Dreamliner. The 777-300ER variant has become the most popular
type and is powered solely by General Electric Co.’s GE90
engines.  Boeing’s biggest customers, including Emirates Airline and
British Airways Plc, are pushing the planemaker to announce a
successor to the 777-300 as they plan for the replacement of
older planes by the end of this decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
