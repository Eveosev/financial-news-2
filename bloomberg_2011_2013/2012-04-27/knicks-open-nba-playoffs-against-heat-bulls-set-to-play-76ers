J.R. Smith had 22 points as the  New
York Knicks  captured the No. 7 seed in the National Basketball
Association’s Eastern Conference to earn a matchup with the
 Miami Heat  in the first round of the playoffs.  The Knicks, who beat the Charlotte Bobcats 104-84 last
night, will open their best-of-seven playoff series tomorrow
against the No. 2 Heat, who lost 104-70 to the  Washington
Wizards . The Knicks are 0-3 against the Heat this season.  The Heat have 2-1 odds to win the NBA title, according to
R.J. Bell of Pregame.com. The Chicago Bulls are 4-1, followed by
the Oklahoma City Thunder at 9-2 and San Antonio Spurs at 5-1.
The Knicks are rated a 40-1 chance.  “We’ve just got to come mentally and physically ready to
play 48 minutes,” Knicks interim coach  Mike Woodson  said. “We
haven’t put 48-minute ballgames together against the Miami
team.”  The top-seeded Bulls, who defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers
107-75 last night, will play the No. 8 seed Philadelphia 76ers,
who fell 108-86 to the Detroit Pistons.  In the other Eastern Conference playoff game tomorrow, the
third-seeded  Indiana Pacers  will host the sixth-seeded Orlando
Magic. The seventh-seeded  Dallas Mavericks  will travel to No. 2
Oklahoma City in tomorrow’s Western Conference game.  At Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina,
Amar’e Stoudemire scored 21 points and Josh Harrellson added 18
for the Knicks (36-30), who handed the Bobcats their 23rd
consecutive loss.  Worst Record  The Bobcats (7-59), owned by five-time Most Valuable PlayerMichael Jordan, finished the season with a winning percentage of
.106, the worst in NBA history.  Charlotte  eclipsed the record
set by the 1972-73 76ers, who ended that season with a 9-73
(.110) record.  The Knicks played without Carmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler
and Baron Davis, who were rested ahead of tomorrow’s contest
against the Heat’s LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.  “Three superstars, I call them,” Woodson said. “They
have a nice supporting cast that has learned how to play with
those guys. However you cut it, you have great teams you’re
going to have to deal with and you’re going to have to win a
game to flip the series and get it back in your favor.”  The fourth-seeded  Boston Celtics  begin their Eastern
Conference series against the  Atlanta Hawks  on April 29. In the
Western Conference, the top-seeded Spurs host No. 8 the Utah
Jazz, the No. 3 Los Angeles Lakers are home against the sixth-
seeded Denver Nuggets and the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers
travel to the fourth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
