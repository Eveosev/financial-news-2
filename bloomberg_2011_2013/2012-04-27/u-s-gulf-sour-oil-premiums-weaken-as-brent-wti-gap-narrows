U.S. Gulf Coast sour crudes
premiums weakened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent narrowed.  Brent crude’s premium over WTI, based on June futures
prices, narrowed 53 cents to $14.84 a barrel at 1:41 p.m. in  New
York . When Brent falls versus WTI, it typically weakens the
value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African
oil priced against the European benchmark.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 15 cents to $10.60 at 2:04
p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Poseidon’s premium weakened 40 cents to $9.85, while Southern
Green Canyon’s lost 25 cents to $9.50. The three grades are used
in the Argus Sour Crude Index.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with
lower sulfur content than the other three grades, fell 50 cents
against WTI to a premium of $13.50.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI was unchanged at
$16.60 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 5 cents
to a premium of $16.70.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed 15 cents
to $15.85 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount strengthened 25 cents to
$1.25 and Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $6.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
