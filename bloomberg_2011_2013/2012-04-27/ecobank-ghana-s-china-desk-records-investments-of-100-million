Ecobank Ghana Ltd. (EBG) ’s  China  desk,
which it set up last year, has generated $100 million worth of
investment from the Asian nation in  Ghana .  Ecobank Ghana’s parent company, Lome, Togo-based  Ecobank
Transnational Inc. (ETI) , entered into an alliance with Bank of China
to boost the flow of money and trade between China and Africa.
The desk was opened in Accra, Ghana’s capital, in April last
year.  “The desk is capable of attracting Chinese trade inflows
and investments into the local economy, which hitherto would not
have been because the means was not created,” Managing Director
Samuel Ashitey Adjei said at a the lender’s annual meeting today
in Accra. “We are very encouraged by this and plan to build
upon it this year.”  Two senior staff of the Bank of China are based in  Accra 
and facilitate communication with traders and Chinese investors,
Adjei said. It has also made doing business easier for Ghanaian
traders with operations in China, he said.  Ghana has been increasing its economic links with China in
recent years. The world’s second-biggest cocoa producer has an
arrangement with China Development Bank Corp. to borrow $3
billion for oil and gas infrastructure, ports, railways and road
projects, the biggest loan in Ghana’s history.  The bank’s net income rose 21 percent to 23 million cedis
($12 million) in the first-quarter through March. Net interest
income climbed to 35.6 million cedis from 28.9 million cedis a
year earlier, it said yesterday.  Ecobank Ghana’s shares traded unchanged at 3.05 cedis by
the close in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
