Bill “Moose” Skowron, a first
baseman who played on four New York Yankees world championship
teams, died today at the age of 81, the team said.  Skowron, an eight-time All-Star, died of congestive heart
failure at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights,
 Illinois , the Yankees said in an e-mailed statement.  Skowron had a 14-season Major League Baseball career that
also included stints with the  Los Angeles Dodgers , Washington
Senators,  Chicago  White Sox and California Angels. He won World
Series titles with the Yankees in 1956, 1958, 1961 and 1962, and
a fifth championship with the Dodgers when they defeated the
Yankees for the title in 1963.  “There weren’t many better guys than Moose,” former
teammate Yogi Berra said in the statement released by the
Yankees. “He was a dear friend and a great team man. A darn
good ballplayer, too. I’m going to miss him.”  Skowron had a career batting average of .282 with 211 home
runs and 888 runs batted in.  “As a Milwaukee Braves fan, I will always remember his
two-out, three-run homer in the eighth inning of Game Seven of
the 1958  World Series ,” MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said in a
statement. “He was a wonderful storyteller and an important
link to a great era in baseball history.”  Visitation at the Colonial-Wojciechowski Funeral Home in
Niles, Illinois, will be from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. on April 30. A
Mass will be held at Queen of All Saints Basilica in Chicago at
10 a.m. on May 1.  In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorials be sent
