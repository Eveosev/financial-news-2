PGM Holdings K.K. (2466)  is resuming a
plan to merge with  Accordia Golf Co. (2131) , a rival golf operator
that’s conducting an internal probe for possible compliance
breaches, according to PGM President Arihiro Kanda.  PGM will pursue its plan after Accordia assured it will
reshuffle its management to improve internal controls, Kanda
said in an interview. PGM withdrew its bid in March when it
discovered Accordia’s top management had possibly breached
compliance. The two golf operators are based in Tokyo.  Shares of Accordia rose the most in more than a year,
climbing 11 percent to 61,500 yen at the close of trading in
Tokyo. PGM slipped 0.2 percent to 62,100 yen. The benchmark
Topix index fell 0.7 percent.  Accordia President Michihiro Chikubu may have misused about
50 million yen ($618,000) of company funds, according to Ichiro
Akimoto, a senior managing executive officer at Accordia. PGM
owns 127 golf courses in  Japan  and reported 70.8 billion yen in
sales for the year ended Dec. 31, while Accordia posted 69.9
billion yen in sales from its 133 courses.  “The merger between PGM and Accordia would help us boost
profit by seeking scale,” Kanda said. “We can cut costs by
eliminating duplication for headquarters and systems.”  Kenichiro Nose, the head of  investor relations  at Accordia
in Tokyo, declined to comment.  Accordia formed a panel to investigate four executives,
including Chikubu and Akimoto, for possible rule breaches,
according to a company statement on April 17. The committee
consists of three outside board members, including a lawyer.  PGM hired  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  as an adviser for the
merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
