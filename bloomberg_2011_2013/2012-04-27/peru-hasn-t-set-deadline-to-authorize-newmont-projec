Peru hasn’t set a deadline for the
authorization of  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s suspended $4.8 billion
Minas Conga gold and copper project, Energy & Mines Minister
Jorge Merino said.  A government-commissioned review recommends “permanent”
environmental monitoring of the project, halted by protests last
year, Merino said today at a news conference in  Lima .  “We hope to put in black and white as soon as possible an
agreement with the company to comply with these technical
recommendations,” Merino said. “But there is no timeline.”  Peru suspended the project and commissioned an
environmental review after Andean farmers, concerned that the
project would dry up water supplies, blocked roads and destroyed
Newmont installations in November.  The company has “other options” if the report’s
recommendations make Conga too expensive to build, Chief
Executive Officer Richard O’Brien said today on a conference
call.  Newmont rose 0.3 percent to $47.86 at the close in  New
York . The stock has dropped 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
