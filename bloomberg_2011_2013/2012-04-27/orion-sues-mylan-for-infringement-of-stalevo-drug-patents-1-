Orion Oyj, (ORNAV)  a Finnish drug maker,
accused rival  Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MYL)  of infringing three
U.S. patents for Stalevo with plans to market copies of the
drug, used to treat  Parkinson’s disease .  In a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware, Orion contends the unit of Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania-based Mylan Inc. is wrongly preparing to sell
generic  Stalevo  before the patents expire.  “Orion will be substantially and irreparably damaged and
harmed” unless the copies are prohibited by a judge, lawyers
for Orion said in court papers, which seek legal fees.  Orion, based in Espoo, Finland, said in a statement that
“generic competition is not imminent” based on Mylan’s new
application to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  for
approval of the copies.  In 2009, Orion settled lawsuits against Indian generic drug
maker Wockhardt Ltd. over Stalevo and another drug, allowing
some generic sales by this September.  Nina Devlin, a Mylan spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Orion Corp. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
12cv523, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
