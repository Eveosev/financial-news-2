Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. bank, and other lenders were sued by Watertown
Savings Bank over $130 million in investments.  Watertown Savings is asking for unspecified damages in
connection with its investment in the AMF Ultra Short Fund and
the AMF Ultra Short Mortgage Funds, according to a document
filed today in  New York  State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  The savings bank is also seeking a redemption of
residential mortgage-backed securities securitized by the
defendants, according to the filing. It invested about
$130 million in the funds from 2004 until it elected to take a
“pro rata share” of the underlying investments, lawyers for
Watertown Savings Bank said in the filing.  Bank of America declined to comment on the case, Lawrence Grayson, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. Adam Gana, an
attorney representing Watertown Savings Bank, declined to
comment on the case in a telephone interview.  The case is Watertown Savings Bank v.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) , 651399/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
