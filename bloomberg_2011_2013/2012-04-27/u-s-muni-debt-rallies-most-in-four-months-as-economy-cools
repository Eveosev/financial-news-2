U.S. 10-year municipal yields are
set to drop for the third-straight week, the longest rally since
December, as signs of slowing U.S. economic growth bolster
demand for fixed-income assets.  Yields on benchmark 10-year tax-exempt debt are down 0.07
percentage point this week to  1.895 percent  at 11:15 a.m. today
in  New York . That’s the lowest since February, according to
Bloomberg BVAL data. It’s the bonds’ longest streak of gains
since December. The index, which began in January 2009, set a
record low of 1.74 percent on Feb. 2.  Tax-free debt is following U.S. Treasuries on reports
showing a more moderate U.S. economic rebound and amid concern
about  Europe ’s debt crisis, said Hardy Manges, head of municipal
trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in New York.  “All those issues affect Treasury rates, and munis follow
from there,” Manges said in an interview.  Federal debt due in 10 years yielded 1.95 percent at 11:08
a.m. in New York after reaching 1.88 percent, the lowest since
Feb. 3, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  States and cities have borrowed $7.1 billion of bonds this
week, the  least  since March, Bloomberg data show. That drop also
helped depress local-government  interest rates , Manges said.  U.S. jobless claims fell to 388,000 in the past week from
389,000 the prior period, the highest since January, Labor
Department figures showed.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced in the U.S., rose at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, after a 3 percent increase the prior period and
below the median forecast in a survey by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
