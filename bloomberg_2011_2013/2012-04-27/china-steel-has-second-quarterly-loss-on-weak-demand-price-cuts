China Steel Corp. (2002) ,  Taiwan ’s largest
producer of the alloy, posted its second consecutive quarterly
loss after cutting prices because of waning demand.  The net loss was NT$712 million ($24 million) in the three
months ended March 31, compared with a profit of NT$6.68 billion
a year earlier, the Kaohsiung-based company said in a statement
to the Taiwan stock exchange today. The average of seven  analyst 
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of NT$2.56 billion.  The Taiwanese mill and Asian peers, including Posco, the
world’s third-biggest steelmaker by output, reported losses or
lower earnings as Europe’s debt crisis curbed demand for the
metal used in cars, ships and buildings.  China Steel  said Nov.
24 it would lower domestic prices for January and February by an
average 7.08 percent.  Unconsolidated first-quarter sales fell 5.1 percent from a
year earlier to NT$53.6 billion, China Steel said this month.  China Steel closed unchanged at NT$29 as of 1:30 p.m. in
Taipei trading after the announcement. The  stock  has climbed 0.7
percent this year, compared with a 5.8 percent increase in the
benchmark Taiex index.  Posco (005490) ’s net income fell 42 percent to 538.6 billion won
($475 million) in the three months ended March 31 on a parent
basis, the Pohang, South Korea-based company said April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
