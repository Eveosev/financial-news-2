Western Digital Corp. (WDC) , a maker of
disk drives and networking products, plunged the most in more
than seven years after saying prices are lower in the current
quarter than they were at the beginning of the year.  Shares of the Irvine, California-based company tumbled 14
percent to $37.93 at the close in  New York , for the biggest
decline since July 2004. The  stock  was the worst performer in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Chief Executive Officer John Coyne said on a conference
call yesterday that “prices are lower in the June quarter than
they were in the March quarter, based on the total package
offered.” The reductions may have surprised investors because
rival  Seagate Technology Plc. (STX)  last week said prices were stable,
said Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “The company is signaling that the price declines are
integral to  Western Digital  scaling to its volume its recovered
operations,” Moskowitz said in a note to clients today,
referring to efforts to rebound from supply constraints caused
by last year’s floods in Thailand. He has a neutral rating on
the shares and recommends “investors take advantage of any
near-term weakness.”  Seagate Chief Executive Officer Stephen Luczo said
“pricing has remained fairly stable,” on an April 17
conference call with investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
