A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a U.S. maker of
 lithium-ion batteries  for electric cars, rose the most in more
than three months after the U.S. Army introduced a prototype
vehicle that uses its products.  A123, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, rose 17 percent to
$1.12 at the close in  New York , the biggest gain since Jan. 3.  The company provided a battery for a hybrid light tactical
vehicle developed by the Army’s Tank Automotive Research,
Development and Engineering Center, the Army said yesterday in a
 statement .  A123 is working with several defense contractors and
expects sales for military vehicles to increase as the Army
makes a “big effort to decrease its energy consumption and roll
out more efficiency technologies,” Dan Borgasano, a company
spokesman, said today in an interview.  The FED Bravo, or Fuel Efficient ground vehicle
Demonstrator, was displayed this week at the Society of
Automotive Engineers World Congress in  Detroit . Truck Trend
reported yesterday that it uses a battery from A123.  Fisker Automotive Inc. and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG use
A123 batteries in electric cars. A123’s shares had fallen 36
percent through yesterday since it recalled on March 26
batteries that made a Fisker car shut down in a Consumer Reports
test.  To contact the reporter on this story:
