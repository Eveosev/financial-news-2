The New York Rangers’ victory
against the  Ottawa Senators  last night in the decisive seventh
game of their first-round playoff series was the team’s highest-
rated game on an MSG Network in 18 years.  The 2-1 victory, which earned New York a spot in the second
round of the National Hockey League playoffs, was seen on MSG by
424,000 households, roughly 5.7 percent of the New York
television market, the network said today in an e-mailed release
citing  Nielsen Media Research . It’s the most-watched Rangers
game on MSG since the team’s defeat of the  Vancouver Canucks  in
Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup finals, New York’s most recent
league title, which drew a 16.18 rating.  The  New Jersey Devils , who clinched a spot in the
postseason’s second round with a Game 7 victory against the
 Florida Panthers  last night on MSG+, drew their highest rating
on an MSG network in more than a decade, the release said. The
Devils’ 3-2 double-overtime victory was watched by 1.7 percent
of the New York television market (126,000 households), most
since the team drew a 2.39 rating during Game 6 of the Eastern
Conference semifinals in 2001.  The seven-game series between the Rangers and Senators
averaged a 3.84 rating, up 59 percent from the first round of
the 2009 playoffs, when the Washington Capitals eliminated the
Rangers in seven games, according to the statement.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporter on this story:
