Tokyu Corp. (9005) , developer of Japan’s
largest privately built town, expects to start earning a profit
as early as 2014 from a 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) city it’s
helping to build in  Vietnam .  Tokyu’s venture with Vietnam-based Investment & Industrial
Development Corp. will make an operating profit of about 4
billion yen in the fiscal year starting April 2014, Toshiyuki Hoshino, president of the unit, said in an interview in  Tokyo  on
April 25. The company will start selling as many as 1,000
residences that year, he said.  Becamex Tokyu Co., which is in charge of the project, may
construct as many as eight tower blocks over the next two years
as part of a plan to eventually build 7,500 residences and
commercial facilities near  Ho Chi Minh City , Hoshino said. Tokyu,
based in Tokyo, is returning to overseas property markets after
attempts in the 1970s and 1980s to tap demand in  North America .  The venture intends to complete the development in Binh
Duong New City, 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of Ho Chi Minh
City, by 2022, according to Tokyu. Becamex Tokyu, 65 percent
owned by the Japanese company and 35 percent by Investment &
Industrial Development, was set up with a capital of 8.6
trillion dong ($412 million).  Next Growth Area  “We had to start looking around for the next growth
area,” Hoshino said. “The area we chose already has roads and
is attracting industries. We hope to draw people from the north
of Ho Chi Minh, if we’re successful.”  The venture aims to target the 1.6 million people living in
the Binh Duong area and multinational companies that have set up
operations there, Hoshino said. It has already held talks with
Japanese supermarket chains about opening stores, he said. Tokyu,
which also operates trains and buses in  Japan , has no plans to
build a railway line for the city as it may not able to recover
the costs, he said.  The company  fell  1.1 percent to 373 yen as of 10:32 a.m. in
Tokyo trading today. It has lost 1.6 percent this year, compared
with an 11 percent gain in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Tokyu built a new city on the edge of Tokyo in the 1950s
that currently has about 600,000 residents over 5,000 hectares,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
