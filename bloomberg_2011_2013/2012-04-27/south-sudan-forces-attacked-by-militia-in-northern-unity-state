(Corrects name of state in headline.)  South Sudan  said its forces were
attacked by a militia group outside the capital of the oil-rich
Upper Nile state today.  Clashes broke out at 3 p.m. in an area west of Malakal, 523
kilometers (325 miles) north of Juba, the nation’s capital,
military spokesman Philip Aguer said in a phone interview. The
attackers were driven back by the south’s military, the  Sudan 
People’s Liberation Army, he said.  “They are still being pursued by the SPLA,” he said.  Sudan and South Sudan have accused each other of supporting
armed anti-government groups on either side of their border.
South Sudan declared independence from Sudan in July, assuming
control over about three-quarters of the formerly unified
nation’s daily oil output of 490,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
