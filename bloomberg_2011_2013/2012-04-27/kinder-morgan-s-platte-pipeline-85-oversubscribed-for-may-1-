Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) 
said shipments for May on the Platte pipeline system between
Guernsey, Wyoming, and Wood River, Illinois, are oversubscribed
by 85 percent because demand exceeds capacity.  The capacity for the Guernsey to Wood River portion of the
line next month will be 162,000 barrels a day, according to an
e-mail from the company.  The company’s Express pipeline isn’t oversubscribed and
will ship 182,400 barrels a day next month, according to the e-
mail. Ten hours of maintenance is planned in the shipping period
on both the Platte and Express systems.  The Express pipeline delivers light, medium and heavy oil
produced in western  Canada  to markets in Montana, Wyoming, Utah
and  Colorado  and connects to the Platte system in Casper,
Wyoming, according to the company’s  website .  The Platte pipeline transports crude from Casper, Wyoming,
to Wood River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
