The Turkish province of Afyon has
banned the sale and consumption of alcohol in public places,
 Hurriyet  reported, citing a directive from Governor Irfan
Balkanlioglu.  The measure was taken after Health Minister Recep Akdag
said  Turkey  needed to fight alcohol as it does cigarettes, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said.  The measure is intended to prevent traffic accidents and
crimes, keep public order and prevent alcohol consumers from
occupying certain areas of the city and causing unrest, Hurriyet
quoted the directive as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
