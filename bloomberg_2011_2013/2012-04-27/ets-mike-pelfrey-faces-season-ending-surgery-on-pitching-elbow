New York Mets right-handed pitcher
 Mike Pelfrey  said he’s facing season-ending surgery to repair a
tear in an elbow ligament.  Pelfrey, 28, said yesterday that the alternative to surgery,
which requires 12 months of rehabilitation, carries a 10 percent
to 20 percent chance of recovery.  “There was an 80 percent chance I was still going to have
surgery,” he told reporters. “I thought it was the best case
for me to just go ahead and do it. I think surgery is about 99
percent.”  Pelfrey has a 50-54 career record, all with the Mets, with
a 4.36 earned run average. He was 0-0 this year in three starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
