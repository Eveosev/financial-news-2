SK Innovation Co. (096770) ,  South Korea ’s
biggest oil refiner by market value, posted a smaller-than-
expected 28 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it sold more
products overseas.  Net income totaled 658.4 billion won ($581 million) in the
three months ended March 31 from 909 billion won a year earlier,
the Seoul-based company said in a filing today. That compares
with the 609 billion won mean  estimate  from 16 analysts in a
survey compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 10 percent to a record
18.9 trillion won in the quarter, helping offset a narrowing of
processing margins from oil products.  Korea ’s exports of oil products rose 28 percent in the
first three months from the same period a year ago, driven by
higher margins, according to  government data . Export prices of
oil products stood at $131.3 per barrel in March, compared with
$113.7 per barrel a year earlier.  SK Innovation kept 78 percent of its oil refinery capacity
busy and ran chemical plants at full capacity in the first
quarter, according to presentation materials released today.  “Refining margins on oil products by Korean refiners may
begin rising from the bottom starting in March while margins are
still lower than the fourth quarter of last year,” Park Yeon
Ju, an analyst at Daewoo Securities Co., said by phone before
today’s announcement.  SK Innovation rose 2.5 percent to 166,000 won in Seoul
trading as of 10:13 a.m. local time, heading for the biggest
gain in two weeks. The benchmark Kospi stock index gained 0.3
percent.  Margins  Cracking margins of diesel from high sulfur fuel oil
dropped to $16.8 per barrel in the first quarter from $28.5 in
the first quarter and $22.4 in the fourth quarter of last year,
according to the company. The processing margin for gasoline
fell to $21.4 per barrel in the first quarter from $22.2 in the
first quarter and compared with $12.3 in the fourth quarter of
2011.  Processing margins for oil products “may be weak in the
second quarter from the previous quarter,” Jo Eun Kee, head of
the corporate planning office at SK Innovation, told investors
in a conference call today. It’s expected a recovery in margins
“may be visible starting in the second half,” driven by solid
demand in  Asia  and driving demand in the U.S., he said.  First-quarter operating profit fell 22 percent to 925.7
billion won, SK Innovation said.  Iran Purchases  SK Innovation’s refining unit, SK Energy, had sales of 14.4
trillion won in the first quarter and 574.8 billion won of
operating profit. Operating profit at the company’s
petrochemicals unit, SK Global Chemical Co., totaled 181.9
billion won with sales of 3.4 trillion won. SK Lubricants
reported operating profit of 100 billion won and sales of 737.4
billion won.  SK Innovation is consulting with the South Korean
government on the reduction of Iranian crude purchases, Jo told
investors during today’s call.  “We are in talks with the government, but for the moment,
it hasn’t been determined how much is to be cut,” Jo said.
“Separately, we are preparing for a contingency plan” in the
event purchases are reduced, he said.  Iranian crude purchases account for 10 percent to 15
percent of the company’s overall monthly purchasing volumes, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
