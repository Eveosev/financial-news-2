A proposal to strengthen the
tracking of U.S. cattle has been sent to the White House for a
fast-track review after a case of mad cow disease was
discovered in  California  and spurred calls for a more
stringent system.  “We have a lot of confidence in a rule we think will
work,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters today
in Washington. He said he hopes the Office of Management and
Budget will approve the new animal-identification plan quickly.  Critics including Representative  Rosa DeLauro , Democrat of
 Connecticut , have said the discovery of the first U.S. case of
mad cow disease since 2006, announced by the government on April
24, points to the need for a more effective livestock-tracking
system.  A nationwide animal-identification plan that would allow
officials to quickly trace sick livestock back to their farms of
origin -- and help identify other infected animals -- has been
promised by the USDA since just after the country’s first case
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, surfaced in late
2003. The latest infection was the fourth confirmed in U.S.
herds.  A voluntary animal ID plan  was abandoned in 2010 after some
ranchers refused to participate, citing cost and concerns that
the proposed registry would give competitors proprietary
information.  The rule Vilsack referred to, which the USDA proposed in
August, would require registration and tagging of livestock
moved between states, with guidelines tailored to different
species. It would be put in place gradually, applying first to
older animals in the U.S. cattle herd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
