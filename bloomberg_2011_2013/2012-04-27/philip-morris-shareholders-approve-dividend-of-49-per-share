Shareholders of  Philip Morris CR
AS (TABAK) , the Czech unit of the world’s largest publicly traded
tobacco company, approved a dividend of 920 koruna a share
($49), the company said.  The company’s market share was hurt by lower demand for
local brands in 2011, the Kutna Hora-based cigarette maker said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Sales of cheaper brands remained “encouraging,” the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
