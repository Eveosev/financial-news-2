Police arrested a man after
a siege in a central London office building disrupted traffic
and forced the evacuation of one of the city’s busiest areas.  The suspect was arrested after a three-hour standoff and a
search of the building is underway, said Eddie Townsend, a
spokesman for the  Metropolitan Police , in a phone interview
today. The police are unaware of any hostages, he said.  Police were called at 11:59 a.m. U.K. time to an office
building on Tottenham Court Road where a man believed to be 49
years old was causing a disturbance, Townsend said. Items
including electrical equipment were thrown from a fifth-floor
window.  Traffic through the neighborhood was disrupted and as many
as two subway stations near the building were closed, the city’s
transportation office said on its website.  Snipers and bomb experts were called to the scene around
the office complex which houses a heavy goods vehicle company.
The suspect, identified as  Michael Green , was “angry” he
wasn’t issued a license, Sky News TV said, without saying where
it got the information.  Students taking exams at nearby colleges and universities
were forced to stop for the day and sent home as police in
bullet-proof vests and riot gear moved into the area.  The suspect was described by eyewitnesses as having objects
strapped to his body that he had identified as gasoline
cannisters, Sky said. The British Broadcasting Corp. reported
witnesses at the scene said the man had threatened to blow
himself up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
