AT&T Inc. (T)  investors defeated
proposals to separate the chairman and chief executive officer
roles and honor so-called net-neutrality guidelines on the phone
company’s wireless network.  The vote on splitting chairman and CEO duties was decided
by a margin of about 56 percent to 44 percent, showing
dissatisfaction among a large block of shareholders at AT&T’s
annual meeting in Salt Lake City. The net-neutrality proposal,
which sought to ensure that  Internet traffic  is treated equally
on wireless networks, was defeated by a larger margin, 94-6.  Backers of the measure for an independent chairman sought
to increase the board’s ability to rein in CEO  Randall Stephenson . They cited his “excessive” compensation, which
amounted to $28 million in total realized pay in 2011, according
to the Corporate Library. AT&T’s board recommended voting
against the proposal, saying that the company had a lead
independent director and that the CEO-chairman link helped
bridge the gap between the board and management.  An initiative asking AT&T to issue a semiannual report on
political contributions also was defeated, by a margin of about
61-39. AT&T’s executive pay passed 93-7, the Dallas-based
company said in a  statement .  Supporters of the net-neutrality proposal said the vote was
still high enough to assure that it would be placed on the
ballot again next year. Similar initiatives are planned for the
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  shareholder
meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
