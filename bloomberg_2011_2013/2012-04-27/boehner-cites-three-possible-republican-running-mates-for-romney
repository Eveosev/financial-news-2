U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner 
cited three Republicans he thinks have the qualities needed to
make a good running mate for Mitt Romney, the party’s presumed
presidential nominee.  During an interview to be aired Sunday on CNN’s “State of
the Union,” Boehner was pressed on prospects for the vice
presidential slot. He said U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida,
U.S. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels would all be “capable of being president in the case of
an emergency.”  “There are a lot of people that I like,” Boehner said,
according to an advance transcript of the interview. “But this
is personal choice for  Governor Romney .  And I’m confident he’ll
have a running mate that will be helpful to the ticket.  Boehner, an  Ohio  Republican, said that while he hasn’t
talked with Romney about the election, he expects to communicate
“soon” with the former Massachusetts governor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
