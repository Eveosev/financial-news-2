More than half of Icelanders don’t
want the country to join the European Union, a poll by the
University of Iceland’s Social Science Research Institute
 published  by RUV showed.  Opposition to joining the 27-nation bloc stood at 54
percent, according to the poll, compared with 56.2 opposition in
the February survey commissioned by the Federation of Icelandic
Industries. Support for joining the EU rose to 27.5 percent,
according to the poll, compared with 26.3 percent in a February
poll. About 18.7 percent were undecided.  Iceland started EU-entry talks in July 2010 and will
probably vote on accession in late 2013. Of a total of 35
negotiating chapters for EU membership, Iceland has opened 13
and completed 10, the EU said in March. The primary challenges
relate to agriculture, the environment and fisheries, according
to EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule.  The  institute  polled 1,900 people and had 67 percent
response rate. No margin of error was provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
