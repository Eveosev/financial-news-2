Want to know why  Japan 's two-decade-long funk has stretched into a third? This week's focus on the  Bank of Japan  offers timely clues. The central bank  expanded its plan  for government-bond purchases by 10 trillion yen ($124 billion) after growth slowed and lawmakers pressed for more aggressive steps. The BOJ is under increasing pressure as the yen rises, growth underwhelms and the next leg of Europe's debt crisis gets underway. And that's exactly the problem: All eyes are on the BOJ, not the politicians in  Tokyo  who are doing nothing to stimulate the world's third-biggest economy. This pattern has been playing out since Japan's asset bubble burst in the 1980s, and it's holding the nation back. If printing yen alone were the key to revival, Japan might be growing faster than  China . The BOJ has held  interest rates  near zero for more than a decade now. It's gone even further into uncharted monetary territory with a variety of quantitative easing and asset-purchase programs. In February,  it announced  a 1 percent inflation target. Yet Japan's credit system is broken. The problem isn't the supply of yen, but uses for it. Banks are reluctant to lend; companies and households aren't borrowing. The multiplier effect that makes monetary policy so potent is eluding Japan. The missing ingredient is confidence. Until corporate executives and consumers believe the next 10 years will be more prosperous than the last, deflation will deepen. The government must do its job to create incentives to add jobs and raise incomes. Unfortunately, Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda 's team is focused elsewhere: raising taxes. A hike in the  consumption tax  to 10 percent over the next three years is meant to help pay down a public debt that's more than twice the size of the economy. It will slam consumption, though, worsening Japan's woes. Japan needs to raise productivity, increase immigration, get serious about signing free-trade agreements, improve corporate governance, better utilize its female workforce, stimulate ground-up entrepreneurship and up the national birthrate. What are politicians doing instead? Leaning on the BOJ -- again. Nice try, but it won't restore vibrant growth anytime soon. (William Pesek is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
