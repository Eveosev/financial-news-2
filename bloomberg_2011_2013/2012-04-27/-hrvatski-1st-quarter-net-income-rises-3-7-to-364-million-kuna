  T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d. , the
Croatian unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said profit rose 3.7
percent in the first quarter as the company battles recession
and special tax with cost-control measures.  Net income increased to 364 million kuna ($64 million) from
351 million kuna a year earlier, the Zagreb-based company said
today in a Regulatory News Service statement. Revenue declined
4.7 percent to 1.8 billion kuna, while earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization fell to 762 million kuna
from 767 million kuna.  “Economic climate, regulatory framework and competitive
landscape are getting tougher,” the company said, adding that
“rigorous cost-cutting measures continue to protect margins.”  Croatia’s economy is struggling to exit a two-year
recession, while the government in January reintroduced a 6
percent tax on mobile phone services after a brief respite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
