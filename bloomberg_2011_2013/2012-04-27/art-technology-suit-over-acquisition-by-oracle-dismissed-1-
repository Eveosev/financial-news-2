Art Technology Group Inc., a maker
of software for online marketing, won dismissal of a 2010
shareholder lawsuit challenging fairness of a buyout offer from
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , the largest maker of  database software .  Investors sued in Delaware Chancery Court seeking more
money than Oracle’s $1 billion, $6-a-share offer for Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Art Technology, a 46 percent premium at the
time. The buyout was completed in January 2011.  “The complaint does not allege any reasonably conceivable
set of facts under which the sole interested director dominated
or controlled the outside directors,” Judge J. Travis Laster
wrote in an order today throwing out the case. “Any attack on
the directors’ good faith fails to state a claim.”  In the complaint, plaintiffs’ lawyers noted that to
facilitate the buyout, Art Technology’s directors amended the
company’s “poison-pill” takeover defense to exclude Oracle and
the proposed transaction.  Oracle, based in  Redwood City , California, said last month
that fiscal third-quarter profit topped analysts’ predictions,
with new software license sales gaining 7 percent.  “We are gratified that the court dismissed plaintiffs’
meritless claims,“ said Oracle spokeswoman  Deborah Hellinger  in
an e-mailed statement on the ruling.  The case is Cronenwett v. Art Technology Group Inc.,
CA5955, Delaware Court of Chancery (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
