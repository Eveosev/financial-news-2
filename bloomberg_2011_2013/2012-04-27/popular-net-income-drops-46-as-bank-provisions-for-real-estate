Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) ,  Spain ’s
fifth-biggest bank, said first-quarter profit fell 46 percent as
it booked provisions to cover real estate losses and costs rose.  Net income  dropped to 100.2 million euros ($132 million)
from 185.7 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based bank
said in a filing to regulators today. Earnings were higher than
the 63.7 million-euro average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of
12 analysts.  Spanish banks, including Popular, are responding to an
order handed down by the government in February to book more
losses on real estate as  unemployment  at an 18-year high also
threatens to drive up loan defaults. While bad loans continued
to mount at Popular, the bank said it boosted revenue by raising
lending margins as the cost of deposits fell, helped in part by
the impact of three-year cheap funding provided by the  European
Central Bank .  Bad loans as a proportion of total loans rose to 6.35
percent from 5.99 percent in December and 5.44 percent in the
same period a year earlier, Popular said.  Loans newly classified as in default rose to 623 million
euros from 570 million euros in the fourth quarter and 515
million euros a year earlier, the bank said. Costs for covering
impaired assets fell 24 percent to 310.3 million euros from
408.6 million euros.  Net  interest income  jumped 34 percent to 692.9 million
euros. Excluding the impact of Popular’s acquisition of Banco
Pastor SA, which was partly consolidated into the earnings, the
increase would have been 25 percent, the bank said.  Administrative costs jumped to 365.5 million euros from
297.7 million euros a year earlier. Earnings a year ago were
boosted by almost 500 million euros of one-time gains from deals
including a joint venture with  Allianz SE (ALV)  that weren’t repeated
this year.  Popular  shares  fell 1.4 percent to 2.30 euros at 9:20 a.m.
in  Madrid , extending declines this year to 34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
