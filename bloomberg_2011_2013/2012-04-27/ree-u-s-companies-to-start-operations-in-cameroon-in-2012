Three U.S. companies plan to start
operations in  Cameroon  this year, while the U.S. Agency for
International Development will return to the country after an
18-year absence, U.S. Ambassador Robert Jackson said.  USAID, as the agency is known, is planning a Food for
Education Project in northern Cameroon, Jackson told reporters
yesterday in Yaounde, the capital. He didnâ€™t provide further
details about which companies will begin operating in the
country.  USAID closed its Cameroonian office in 1994 for budgetary
reasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
