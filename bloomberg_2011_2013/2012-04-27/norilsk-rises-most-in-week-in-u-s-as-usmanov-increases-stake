OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY)  headed to
the highest closing price in a week in U.S. trading after
billionaire Alisher Usmanov said he is buying shares in the
company, world’s largest producer of nickel and palladium.  Norilsk rose 2.2 percent to $17.73 at 1:39 p.m. in  New
York , gaining the most since April 19 and heading to the highest
price since April 20 on a closing basis. It was the second-
biggest gainer on the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 index  of Russian
companies listed in the U.S. today, after  Yandex NV. (YNDX)   Usmanov, who controls  Metalloinvest (METIN) , said in an interview
with  Rossiya-24  state television today that he is increasing the
iron-ore producer’s stake in  Norilsk Nickel (MNOD) ,  Russia ’s largest
mining company.  “The news on Usmanov is definitely a positive as
accumulation of stock by existing shareholders and potential
further buybacks are two strong supporting factors for the
stock,” Yan Gloukhovski, a trader at Alfa Capital Markets in
 London , said by e-mail today.  Alfa, Russia’s biggest private lender, recommends investors
hold Norilsk shares traded on Moscow’s Micex Index. Norilsk rose
2 percent to 5,189 rubles, or the equivalent of $177, in Moscow
today, rising for the first time this week and settling at the
highest level since April 20. Ten ADRs equal one ordinary share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
