The U.K.’s state and private
pension obligations reached 7.1 trillion pounds ($11.5 trillion)
in 2010, almost five times the country’s gross domestic product,
according to the  Office for National Statistics .  The total amount, which includes funded and unfunded
pension plans, is made up of 5 trillion pounds of government
obligations and 2.1 trillion pounds from private employers, the
ONS said in a  statement  today. The study is the first time gross
pension liabilities have been presented this way, the ONS said.  Longer life expectancies coupled with the financial crisis,
which caused two recessions and record low interest rates in the
U.K., have hindered pension funds’ ability to meet their
liabilities over the past five years. As most  FTSE 100 (UKX)  firms
have stopped offering employees final salary pension plans, the
government this year will push more people to save by setting up
an automatic enrollment pension plan, which requires employees
to opt out rather than opt in to saving for retirement.  Obligations for unfunded public pension plans were about
900 billion pounds at the end of 2010, or 58 percent of GDP,
according to the ONS. That compares with about 52 percent of GDP
in 2007, the ONS said, citing a European Union estimate.  Life expectancy for 65-year-olds grew to 18 years from 17
years for men from 2006 to 2010 and rose to 20.6 years from 19.8
years for women in that time frame, according to separate ONS
data. Underestimating  life expectancy  by just one year can push
up a pension fund’s liabilities by 5 percent, according to Swiss
Reinsurance Co. Ltd.  The statistics include both funded pension plans, which are
backed by a pool of assets, and unfunded plans, which are paid
for by the taxpayer. The U.K. government’s national accounting
only shows funded pensions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
