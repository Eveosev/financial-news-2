U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses as investors weighed improving earnings and consumer
confidence with lower-than-forecast economic growth and a
downgrade of Spain’s credit rating.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,398.5 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York  after rising as much as 0.3
percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
