Ukraine’s winter crops loss is 20
percent as a result of adverse weather, Interfax reported,
citing Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agro-meteorology department
at the national weather center in  Kiev .  Forty percent of the remaining winter crops are in good
condition, 30 percent are in satisfactory shape and 30 percent
are weak, Adamenko said, according to Interfax.  Interfax didn’t say whether the figures related only to
grains or included other crops. The weather now is favorable for
plant growth, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
