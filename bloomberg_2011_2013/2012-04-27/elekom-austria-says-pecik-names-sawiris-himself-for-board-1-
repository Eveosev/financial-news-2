Ronny Pecik, the investor who’s
bought more than 20 percent of  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , named himself
and his Egyptian billionaire backer Naguib Sawiris as candidates
for the company’s supervisory board.  Pecik’s Marathon Zwei Beteiligungs GmbH has requested that
 Telekom Austria ’s annual general meeting, scheduled for May 23,
votes to add himself and Sawiris to the board, Telekom Austria
said in a statement today. Supervisory boards are non-executive
and responsible for appointing managers and making strategic
decisions.  Pecik’s application was filed “timely and in due form,”
Telekom Austria said in the statement. The Austrian government
is the former monopoly’s biggest shareholder with a 28.4 percent
stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
