President  Barack Obama  is using the
weekend for a series of Washington-area fundraisers, including
one event geared to Democratic women and another featuring
former President  Bill Clinton .  Obama denounced Republican opposition to a provision in the
health-care law requiring insurance coverage to include
contraception services as “like being in a time machine” at an
evening fundraiser hosted by the Women’s Leadership Forum and
Women for Obama.  Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  has supported
legislation that would allow employers to opt out of providing
contraception coverage. The former Massachusetts governor was
campaigning today in the swing state of  Ohio , where he focused
on the economy. He said Obama’s policies have led to greater
national debt and slow growth.  Following the event at the  Washington  Convention Center,
Obama was heading to a fundraising dinner with 40 people at a
private residence in the Washington-area, according to a
campaign official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the event on
the record. Tickets to the event cost $40,000, the official
said.  Clinton will be a featured guest along with Obama at a
dinner and reception April 29 at the McLean, Virginia, home of
Terry McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Commmittee
chairman and fundraiser for Clinton.  Tickets for the dinner, which will include 80 people, are
$20,000 per person. The reception, which will include 500
people, requires a $1,000 donation, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
