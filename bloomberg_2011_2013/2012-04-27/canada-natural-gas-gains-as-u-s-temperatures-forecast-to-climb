Canadian natural gas rose amid
speculation that warmer-than-normal U.S. weather will boost
demand for gas-fueled electricity to power air conditioners.  Alberta  gas advanced 3.9 percent. Highs in  Chicago  on May 3
may reach 78 degrees Fahrenheit (26 Celsius), 12 above normal,
AccuWeather Inc. said. Demand for heat in the U.S. Midwest’s
largest city will fall to zero May 1, signaling the start of
cooling season, said  David Salmon  of Weather Derivatives.  “There’s a large swath of above-average temperature
expectations that includes the Midwest,” said Eric Bickel, a
natural-gas analyst with Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
Kentucky. The Midwest is the primary market for Canadian gas.  Alberta gas for May delivery rose 6 cents to C$1.62 a
gigajoule ($1.55 per million British thermal units) as of 3:40
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. June gas
gained 7.25 cents, or 4.5 percent, to C$1.68 per gigajoule.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is up 12 percent this week.  Natural gas for June delivery became the front month on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  today. The futures rose 6 cents, or
2.8 percent, to settle at $2.186 per million Btu for the first
weekly gain since mid-March.  Spot Prices  Gas for prompt delivery slipped in anticipation of lower
weekend demand. Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near
Chicago fell 6.78 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.1513 per million
Btu on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express
line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western
Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 6.92 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $1.8662 per
million Btu. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices declined 7.08 cents, or 3.5 percent,
to $1.9377.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet, 521 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.06 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.19 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 999 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.65 billion cubic feet today, or 62 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
