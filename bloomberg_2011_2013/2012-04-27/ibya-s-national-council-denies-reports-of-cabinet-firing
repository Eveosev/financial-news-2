Libya ’s National Transitional
Council denied it had fired the country’s premier and five other
ministers, the council’s spokesman Mohamed al-Harizi was quoted
as saying by the official  Libya News Agency , following earlier
reports of the Cabinet’s dismissal.  The reports, which cited incompetence as the reason behind
the officials’ firing, are “completely devoid of truth,” al-
Harizi told the news agency late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
