Mexico â€™s central bank plans to sell
as much as 60.5 billion pesos ($4.7 billion) of Treasury bills
next week as part of its effort to manage the amount of cash in
the financial system.  The auction of the government bills, known as Cetes, is
scheduled for May 2, the central bank said today on  its website .
The bills will have a maturity of 336 days, it said.  The bank has been auctioning Cetes once per quarter to help
control the  money supply  since December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
