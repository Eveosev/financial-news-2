Montana ’s Democratic governor,
Brian Schweitzer said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital With Al Hunt,” airing this weekend, that
President  Barack Obama  has the advantage for re-election and
should campaign on his economic record, not as a populist.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Montana Governor Brian
Schweitzer. Thank you for being here, Governor. I’m envious of
your tie. We’ll get to Montana specifics in a minute, but,
first, let me ask you this. Presidential race this year: Who has
the upper hand, Obama or Romney?  GOVERNOR BRIAN SCHWEITZER: If you went to Vegas today, it’d
be 60-40 for Obama. The economy’s on the mend. That’s the -
that’s probably the most important thing. It’s 25 consecutive
months of positive job increases. And energy, my gosh, you know,
we’ve gone from 60 percent of our energy being imported back
down to 45 percent. People are feeling more confident. A lot of
the polls are showing that. So -  HUNT: Suppose you asked that fundamental question that
Reagan once asked, are you better off than you were four years
ago, what would Montanans say?  SCHWEITZER: They’d say yes. I think it’s been pretty -  HUNT: Even though unemployment’s not quite what it was four
years - employment, rather, is not quite what it was four years
ago?  SCHWEITZER: We’re at 6.2 percent unemployment. You know,
our - our tax revenues are up. People are doing OK in Montana.  HUNT: OK. The - the Obama camp vacillates between saying
Romney is a chameleon and a flip-flopper with no core principles
and then they say he’s a right-wing ideologue. Now, it can’t be
both. He’s got to be one or the other. Which would you advise
them? Which tack do you think is the more effective and more
credible?  SCHWEITZER: Well, it’s above my pay grade. It’s above my
pay grade. But let’s just talk about the  Mitt Romney  who has
been running in this Republican primary. That’s a Mitt Romney
that is pretty far to the right, I mean, well far right of
center, further right on immigration than  Newt Gingrich . On
almost all the issues with his competitors, he was on the far-
right side of it. So I guess you would take Mitt Romney at his
word.  HUNT: But you’ve known him for a long time. Do you think
that’s the real Mitt? Do you really think he’s a right-wing
ideologue?  SCHWEITZER: I don’t know what he is. I can tell you he’s a
nice man. And we traveled together for a week in Iraq and
 Afghanistan  while the war was going on, and we talked about
family, we talked about business, we talked about energy, we
talk about a lot of things. I like him. I think he’s a good man.
I think he’s an honest man.  But, of course, he’s a leader of a party. And the
 Republican Party  is far right of the Reagan Republican Party.
And I don’t think Goldwater would even recognize this Republican
Party.  HUNT: Can Obama run as an economic populist - you know
economic populism - given his record and relative friendliness
with the financial industry?  SCHWEITZER: Probably not. But, you know, there’s a heck of
a lot more people living in the big cities and - than there is
out in farm country. And so he knows - he knows his base. And I
think that he has demonstrated that he can work with banks. And,
frankly, without the actions of Obama, we wouldn’t be making
cars, and now General Motors is the No. 1 car manufacturer.  HUNT: So that should be his stress, rather than, you know,
I’m a populist who -  SCHWEITZER: I think so, yeah, absolutely. You shouldn’t run
from that kind of a record.  HUNT: Right.  SCHWEITZER: If he wouldn’t have taken that risk - and it
wasn’t popular. It was about as popular as a toothache.  HUNT: You’re talking about the banks and cars?  SCHWEITZER: Cars especially.  HUNT: Yeah.  SCHWEITZER: General Motors, people said, look, if they’re -
if they can’t make a car that sells in the market - remember
those days - they ought to go out of business. He said, no, wait
a minute here. We’ve got to make cars in this country. And now
General Motors is back.  HUNT: Do you think they made a mistake with the health-care
law? Should they not have pushed that as a priority?  SCHWEITZER: I probably would have pushed a little harder.  HUNT: You would have?  SCHWEITZER: Well, look, here’s - here’s what I believe. The
problem we have with health care in this country is we pay too
much and we - we do too many procedures, because it’s fee for
profit. And so if you’re a provider, and somebody walks in, you
want to make sure you give them all the tests that you can
possibly sell. And so you give them a lot of tests, and you
charge them a lot of money.  Well, this bill didn’t really challenge the costs. I guess
we can do that down the road, but it did a couple of things.
Folks that had pre-existing conditions, no fault of their own -
my gosh, they lost the genetic -  HUNT: That’s the good part of the bill.  SCHWEITZER:  -  yeah, and you can stay on your parents’
health insurance until you’re 26. Those are two good parts of
the bill.  HUNT: Right. But you don’t think it goes far enough. Does
it - suppose the court overturns it.  SCHWEITZER: Well, we’ve already started in Montana.  HUNT: To do your own state?  SCHWEITZER: I - I signed a bill in Montana that says we
wouldn’t enforce the mandate, because I don’t believe that it’s
constitutional to have a mandate if you don’t have a public
option.  HUNT: Well, you would have preferred him to go the public
option route rather than the mandate.  SCHWEITZER: Give people a choice.  HUNT: Right.  SCHWEITZER: And then it would have been - I don’t think
there would have been a constitutional problem. Here’s the
problem. When you say to a citizen, because you’re a citizen of
the  United States , you have to reach into your pocket, use your
own money, and give it to a private insurance company, that’s
where it gets unconstitutional. If they would have said you can
give it to a private insurance company or to Medicare or
Medicaid or whatever the public option is, then it would be
constitutional.  HUNT: Governor, guns are sacred in Montana. But - and I
understand that, and the right to have arms and to hunt and
everything else. But you have a Stand Your Ground law like they
had in  Florida , with that terrible case, with Trayvon Martin.
That’s not about gun rights. That’s not about hunters’ rights,
is it?  SCHWEITZER: But standing your ground is not chasing
somebody down the street and shooting them.  HUNT: But that’s the way it’s used in some defenses.  SCHWEITZER: Well, Stand Your Ground is if somebody
threatens you, then you can defend yourself. Listen, you know,
guns - guns is not just about hunting. The framers of our
Constitution understood that every individual ought to have a
right to - to carry a weapon, to defend themselves, not just
from some other individual, but against tyranny.  HUNT: Keystone pipeline. Republicans say it’s going to hurt
Obama because he vacillated. Is that right? And is there
anything he can do over the next six months that you think would
be helpful on that?  SCHWEITZER: Let’s just clear the air on it. Pipelines are
permitted state by state by state. It’s not the federal
government that permits them. The only reason there would be
even any involvement of the federal government is because it
crosses the border from - from  Alberta  into Montana.  HUNT: Right.  SCHWEITZER: So it becomes an international pipeline. Well,
Montana’s given them a permit. I negotiated with TransCanada
over the last three years, and I am the biggest supporter in all
of America for this conflict-free oil. Plus, they’re going to
build $100 million onramp in Montana and put Montana oil on that
pipeline, as well. A lot of people don’t know that.  South Dakota ’s given the permit, Oklahoma,  Kansas , Texas -  HUNT: Everywhere but  Nebraska .  SCHWEITZER: Nebraska - Nebraska didn’t give them a permit.
As soon as there’s an actual route, then TransCanada is going to
be able to apply to the State Department, and then they can -  HUNT: Is there anything Obama can do in the next six
months?  SCHWEITZER: Well, he could talk about it like Congress
does, but -  HUNT: But - but - but you don’t see it as an issue that’s
going to hurt him?  SCHWEITZER: No, because what they’ve made up here - they’ve
fabricated an issue in  Washington , D.C., because Congress has
nothing to do with this, and TransCanada doesn’t even have an
active application before the State Department until they have a
route across Kansas - across Nebraska.  HUNT: Chinese companies have started joint ventures with
some  oil companies  in  Canada . If they wanted to buy U.S.
companies that are drilling in Montana, is that OK with you?  SCHWEITZER: If - we have a Russian company that’s the owned
the only platinum and palladium in the Western Hemisphere
working in Montana, and they employ Montanans. If - if foreign
companies want to invest their money in Montana and hire
Montanans to work there, I’m all - I’m good with it.  HUNT: OK. Obama lost Montana by 11,000 votes last time. No
Democrat has carried it since  Bill Clinton , and no Democrat’s
gotten 50 percent - you told me earlier - since  Lyndon Johnson .
Does Obama have any shot in Big Sky Country? And if he loses,
will he take Jon Tester down with him?  SCHWEITZER: Here’s the deal. You tell me. If he wins 46
states, Montana will be one of them. If he - if he only wins 42
states, then Montana won’t be one of them. And Jon Tester will
run on his own merits. People in Montana are vote-splitters. We
got more independents than we do either Republicans or
Democrats. They’re very likely - I mean, my gosh, when I got
elected,  George Bush  won by 22 points and I won the election. So
-  HUNT: You’re basically predicting that it’s going to be
very hard for Obama to win. Do you think Tester will win?  SCHWEITZER: Tester will win. It’s a flip of the coin right
now. It’s - all the polls show it’s tied. But people like Jon
Tester.  HUNT: Right, OK. Governor Schweitzer, thank you so much for
being with us. I hope we can visit with you again.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
