Taiwan ’s government bonds rose,
sending yields to the lowest level this month, after policy
makers signaled they won’t raise borrowing costs to tame
inflation. The island’s currency advanced to a seven-month high.  Monetary policy  has its limits in controlling price
pressures, the central bank said in a statement yesterday.
Consumer prices rose 1.21 percent in March from a year earlier
after climbing 0.23 percent in February, official data showed
this month.  “The central bank’s words have shattered speculation on
rate rises,” said Stanford Chen, a Taipei-based fixed-income
manager at KGI Securities Co. “Taiwan bond yields could tread
even lower because of that.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 dropped two basis points today and four basis points this
week to 0.998 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.3 percent today and 0.6 percent
this week to NT$29.332 against its U.S. counterpart, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.24 earlier, the strongest
level since Sept. 9.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, rose 30 basis
points, or 0.3 percentage point, to 3.71 percent. The gauge
climbed 21 basis points this week.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.502 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.505 percent
yesterday, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
