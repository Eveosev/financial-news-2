(Corrects net income estimate in second paragraph,
operating profit estimate in sixth paragraph.)  Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) ,  South Korea ’s
second-biggest steelmaker, posted a lower-than-estimated 39
percent drop in first-quarter profit after waning demand for the
metal used in cars, ships and houses dragged prices lower.  Net income was 157.5 billion won ($138.7 million) in the
three months ended March 31, compared with 258.3 billion won a
year earlier, the Incheon-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. That missed the 188.4 billion won average of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were little
changed at 3.55 trillion won.  Hyundai and other steelmakers including Posco and Baoshan
Iron & Steel Co. are reporting lower profit after the European
debt crisis curbed global economic growth and demand for the
metal. Earnings may improve this quarter as raw material costs
decline and construction steel demand increases, Lee Won Jae, an
analyst at SK Securities Co., said in an April 16 report.  Sales may gain 7 percent to 3.8 trillion won this quarter
from the previous quarter as orders from builders rise and new
car models spur demand from the  auto industry , Hyundai said.  Hyundai Steel, an affiliate of the Hyundai Motor Group,
rose 1.3 percent to 99,200 won in Seoul. The earnings were
announced after the stock market closed. The stock has gained
3.7 percent this year, underperforming an 8.2 percent increase
in the local benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  stock index.  Operating profit fell 49 percent to 156.6 billion won in
the quarter from a year earlier, missing the 223.8 billion
average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Hyundai’s selling prices for its hot-rolled coils probably
dropped about 3 percent to 811,000 won in the quarter from a
year ago, while those for steel plates, used mostly in
shipbuilding, fell 6 percent to 911,000 won, SK’s Lee said.  The biggest maker of construction steel in South Korea
produced 3.94 million metric tons of steel products in the
quarter, up 1.4 percent from year earlier, Hyundai Steel said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
