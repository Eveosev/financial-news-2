Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, raised its quarterly dividend
and full-year profit forecast after funds from operations
increased more than analysts estimated.  The payout was raised to $1 a share from 95 cents, Simon
said today in a statement. FFO, a measure of a property
company’s ability to generate cash, will total $7.50 to $7.60 a
share in 2012, the company predicted. That’s up from an estimate
last month of $7.35 to $7.50.  Simon has increased rents as tenant revenue rises at the
company’s outlet centers and regional malls. U.S. same-store
sales excluding  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  rose 4.1 percent in March
from a year earlier, according to the  International Council of
Shopping Centers . Simon, an Indianapolis-based real estate
investment trust, is also expanding overseas to increase growth.
It bought a 28.7 percent stake in European shopping-center
operator Klepierre SA for about $2 billion last month.  “This quarter, the clear kind of take-away is its
international ambitions,” Craig Guttenplan, an analyst at New
York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a telephone interview
before earnings were announced. “The company is largely
saturated in the U.S.”  First-quarter FFO climbed to $648.7 million, or $1.82 a
share, from $570.6 million, or $1.61, a year earlier. That
exceeds $1.68 a share, the average of 20 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 9.7 percent to $1.12
billion.  Brazil, China  Simon and  BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) , based in  Rio de
Janeiro , said on April 9 that they formed a joint venture to
develop outlet centers in  Brazil . In March, the company agreed
to develop an outlet mall in the Pudong area of  Shanghai  with
Bailian Group, a retail-property operator in  China . The Bailian
partnership also allows the companies to build more projects in
the country.  U.S. occupancy increased to 93.6 percent in the first
quarter from 93 percent a year ago. Average rent per square foot
rose 4.4 percent to $39.87 from $38.18. Tenant sales per square
foot in the quarter rose 11 percent to $546 from $491.  The results were released before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Simon fell 0.3 percent to $152.19 yesterday in New York
trading. Its shares have advanced 36 percent in the past year,
compared with a 6.2 percent gain in the Bloomberg REIT Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
