Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K. oil
explorer active in Asia, plans to raise about 124 million pounds
($201 million) for drilling in Thailand and Indonesia.  About $100 million will be used for exploratory drilling in
the Gulf of Thailand and to cut costs, Chief Executive Officer
James Menzies said in a telephone interview. The remainder will
be spent on Indonesian exploration.  Salamander sold assets last year to focus on development
and exploration in Indonesia and Thailand. Production may fall
to as low as 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day this year
from 18,600 barrels a day in 2011. Output may rise to about
20,000 barrels a day in 2014 as the London-based company taps
 Indonesia ’s North Kutei and Greater Kerendan regions and the
Greater Bualuang area in the Gulf of Thailand.  The rights issue “will knock off $25 million in operating
costs” at the company’s Bualuang oil field in Thailand, Menzies
said. In North Kutei, Salamander is “looking for a four-well
program to begin at the back end of this year, by the end of
2013 we’ll have four wells there,” he said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Oriel Securities Ltd. and  RBC
Capital Markets  fully underwrote the issue, the company said in
a statement. Rothschild acted as sole financial adviser to the
company. Salamander shares have risen 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
