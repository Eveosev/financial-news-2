U.S. stock-index futures trimmed
gains after government data showed economic growth trailed
forecasts in the first quarter.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
rose less than 0.1 percent at 8:21 a.m. in  New York  after
climbing as much as 0.3 percent earlier.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced in the U.S., rose at a 2.2 percent annual rate,
Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. That
followed a 3 percent pace in the prior quarter and compared with
the 2.5 percent median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Household purchases, which account for about 70
percent of the economy, increased 2.9 percent, exceeding
projections.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 1.6 percent this week after Apple
Inc. posted earnings that almost doubled, joining about three-
quarters of companies to beat the average analyst earnings
estimate about halfway through the reporting season. The index
is down 0.6 percent in April and poised to snap a four-month
streak of gains, its longest since 2009.   Investors are “getting spooked by uncertainty”
surrounding the  U.S. budget deficit  and reemergence of  Europe ’s
debt crisis, mirroring concerns at this time of year in 2011 and
2010, according to  Thomas Lee , chief U.S. equity strategist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. The S&P 500 tumbled 19 percent
from its 2011 high in April to its low in October. In 2010, it
slid 16 percent from an April peak to its July low. This year,
it has slipped 1.3 percent from an almost four-year high on
April 2.  While the parallels of 2012 to 2011 “are striking, the
downside risks, in our view, are lower,” Lee wrote in a note to
clients, saying that the U.S. budget standoff and  Japan ’s
tsunami and nuclear disaster aggravated concerns last year. “In
a nutshell, same frequency, different amplitude,” he wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
