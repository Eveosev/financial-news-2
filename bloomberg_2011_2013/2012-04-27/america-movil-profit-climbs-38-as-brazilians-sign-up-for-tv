America Movil SAB (AMXL) , the biggest
mobile-phone carrier in the Americas, said first-quarter profit
rose 37 percent as more Brazilian customers signed up for
satellite and cable television service.  Net income climbed to 32.6 billion pesos ($2.5 billion), or
42 centavos a share, from 23.7 billion pesos, or 30 centavos, a
year earlier, the Mexico City-based company said yesterday.
Sales increased 12 percent to 192.5 billion pesos, beating the
182 billion-peso average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , is
combining its Brazilian divisions to offer packages of TV,
wireless service, home-phone and Internet to lure customers from
 Telefonica SA. (TEF)  Slim’s company spent $2.7 billion last year to
boost its stake in  Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA (NETC4) , Brazil’s
biggest cable-TV carrier, to more than 90 percent.  “It’s a fairly low-penetrated business that has long-term
growth potential,”  Christopher King , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said of pay TV in  Latin America .
“It shows the initial impact they’ve had with their bundling
effort there.” He rates America Movil shares hold.  Net Servicos shareholders voted this month to delist the
company’s stock, and America Movil Chief Executive Officer
Daniel Hajj said in October the company would begin
consolidating the cable carrier into its financial statements.  Subscriber Gains  America Movil added 4.2 million mobile-phone subscribers
since December, compared with the 3.93 million estimate of Vera Rossi, a Barclays Plc analyst in  New York , who  rates  the shares
the equivalent of buy. Satellite and cable TV subscriptions
increased 33 percent from a year earlier to 14 million,
including 10.6 million in Brazil.  The  shares  rose 0.1 percent to 16.61 pesos yesterday in
Mexico City. They have gained 5 percent this year.  An appreciation in Latin American currencies, including
the Mexican peso, gave America Movil a foreign-exchange gain of
19.3 billion pesos, more than quadruple the year-earlier result.  Leaving out that item, along with interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, the profit measure known as
Ebitda rose 6.3 percent to 67.5 billion pesos. America Movil’s
profit margin, leaving out those items, fell to 35.1 percent
from 37.1 percent on wireless competition in  Brazil  and handset
subsidies in Mexico.  (America Movil plans to hold a conference call at 10 a.m.
