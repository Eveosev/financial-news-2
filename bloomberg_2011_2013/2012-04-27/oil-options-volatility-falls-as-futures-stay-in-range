Oil options volatility declined to
the lowest level in more than a year as the underlying futures
gained.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.63 percent at 2:55 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 22.19 percent yesterday. It
was the seventh straight decline and lowest level since at least
March 4, 2011.  “The market has been in a $5 trading range for weeks,”
said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in
Tampa,  Florida . “This is a boring market. Volatility comes in
as the  price range  continues to tighten.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 38 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $104.93 on the Nymex. Crude, which has gained 6.2
percent this year, has traded in a range of $100.68 to $105.07
since April 4.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $110 calls, which fell 5 cents to 41 cents a barrel at
2:59 p.m. with 2,410 lots trading. June $97.50 puts were the
second-most active with 2,128 lots changing hands. They lost 10
cents to 31 cents.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Calls accounted for 57 percent of the 117,487 trades in the
previous session. June $115 calls were the most actively traded,
with 7,825 lots changing hands. They were down 2 cents to 12
cents a barrel. The next-most active options, June $100 puts,
