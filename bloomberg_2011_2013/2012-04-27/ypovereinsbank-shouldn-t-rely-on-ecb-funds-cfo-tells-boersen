UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s HypoVereinsbank
unit won’t rely solely on assistance from the European Central
Bank to finance buying sovereign debt,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported,
citing the division’s Chief Financial Officer Peter Hofbauer.  The ECB has the right to change interest rates and rules
for underlying securities for their three-year refinancing
operations, meaning accepting such funds runs the risk of
becoming more costly than initially though, the newspaper cited
Hofbauer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
