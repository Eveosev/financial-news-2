German labor union Ver.di said
warning strikes linked to pay disputes with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) 
units will continue today.  Ver.di will call on as many as 12,000 Telekom Deutschland
GmbH and T-Systems employees to stop work after about 11,000
joined the protests yesterday, the union said in an e-mailed
statement.  The walkouts are to take place after an “absolutely
unacceptable offer,” in the fourth round of wage talks, said
Helmut Doser, the strike leader at Ver.di’s Bavarian division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
