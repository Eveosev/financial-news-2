Yuan deposits in  Hong Kong  dropped
for the fourth straight month to the lowest level since June as
expectations of currency appreciation weakened.  Savings denominated in the Chinese currency fell 2.1
percent from the previous month to 554.3 billion yuan ($88
billion) at the end of March, according to Hong Kong Monetary
Authority Chief Executive  Norman Chan , who made the comments in
a  statement  on the authority’s website today.  Expectations of yuan appreciation have dwindled as  Europe ’s
debt crisis sapped demand for Chinese exports. The yuan
completed its first quarterly decline since December 2009 after
Premier Wen Jiabao set the nation’s annual economic growth
target at the lowest level in seven years.  The currency declined 0.07 percent to close at 6.3120 per
dollar today in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, 12-month non-deliverable
yuan forwards traded at 6.3490, a 0.6 percent discount to the
onshore  exchange rate , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  average yield  on Dim Sum bonds rose 10 basis points to 5.13
percent in April, according to a Bank of China Ltd. index.  Hong Kong’s banks handled 227 billion yuan of trade
denominated in the currency in March, according to Chan. In the
first quarter, the city’s lenders handled 571 billion yuan, and
for all of 2011 the total was 1.91 billion yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
