Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to keep Bonga crude exports in June unchanged at
five cargoes of 950,000 barrels each, according to a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship five cargoes of Brass River,
four Antan, four Erha and one Abo, separate plans showed. The
size of each lot ranges from 250,000 to 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
