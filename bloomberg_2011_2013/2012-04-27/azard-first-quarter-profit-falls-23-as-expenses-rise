Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest
independent merger adviser, reported first-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as financial advisory fees climbed and
operating revenue reached a record.  Net income fell 23 percent to $44.8 million, or 33 cents a
share, from $58.5 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today in a statement. The
 average estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
earnings of 24 cents. Operating revenue rose 9.2 percent to a
record $498.7 million.  Lazard, run by Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth Jacobs , is
advising some of this year’s biggest deals, including GDF Suez’s
$10.2 billion announced purchase of International Power Plc and
TNT Express NV’s $6.85 billion proposed sale to United Parcel
Service Inc. Jacobs, 53, has said the “seeds” for a mergers-
and-acquisitions recovery, including available financing, are in
place.  “The macroeconomic environment has improved since last
summer but remains uncertain,” Jacobs said in the statement.
“If this improvement continues, strategic advisory activity
will likely increase.”  Lazard rose 3.1 percent to close at $27.60 in  New York  and
has gained 5.7 percent this year.  Revenue from the firm’s financial-advisory business climbed
21 percent to $277.2 million in the first quarter from a year
earlier. Asset-management revenue fell to $210.1 million from
$224 million.  Advisory Fees Rise  “The environment feels better than last autumn, CEO
confidence needs to continue to build up,” Chief Financial
Officer Matthieu Bucaille said in a phone interview following
results. “If this improvement continues, I think we should see
the benefits over time in our top and bottom line.”  Lazard is among firms coping with a dip in M&A volume as
concern about the European sovereign-debt crisis and slow
economic growth in the U.S. stalled transaction closings. The
firm earned $192.6 million in fees from advising M&A and
strategic transactions, up from $163.8 million last year.
Revenue from advising  capital markets  fell 51 percent to $14.4
million, while restructuring advisory revenue almost doubled to
$70.2 million.  Lazard set aside $312.7 million for compensation expense in
the quarter, up from $268.9 million last year. Bucaille said the
firm is focused on maintaining “strong discipline” with regard
to expenses  The firm said it increased its quarterly dividend 25
percent to 20 cents per share, a move that was previously
announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
