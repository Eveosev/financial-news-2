U.S. stocks rallied, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its best weekly gain since March,
as earnings from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  to  AT&T Inc. (T) 
beat forecasts and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
he’s ready to do more to stimulate the economy if needed.  Gauges for phone stocks, consumer discretionary and
technology companies advanced the most among 10 groups in the
S&P 500, jumping at least 2.4 percent. An index tracking
homebuilders surged 10 percent to the highest level since 2008
amid better-than-estimated housing data and  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) ’s
narrower loss. Apple rallied 5.2 percent after profit almost
doubled while Amazon.com surged 19 percent.  The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent to 1,403.36 for the biggest
weekly advance since March 16. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
gained 199.05 points, or 1.5 percent, to 13,228.31.  Earnings “look really strong, but that is definitely a
management of expectations by companies,” Gary Flam, who helps
oversee $6.7 billion for Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC in  Los
Angeles , said in a telephone interview. “If economic data
weakens, QE3 or some type of response from the Fed can be
expected. That’s also giving investors some confidence,” he
said, referring to a third round of stimulus measures known as
quantitative easing.  The Fed on April 25 upgraded its estimates for growth and
unemployment this year while repeating its view that borrowing
costs are likely to remain “exceptionally low” at least
through late 2014. Signed contracts to buy U.S. homes increased
more than forecast in March, a sign that the housing market may
be reaching bottom after a six-year price slump.  13th Quarter  Equities rallied for a second week, extending the benchmark
index’s 2012 gain to 12 percent, as  S&P 500  companies are on
pace to beat analysts’ profit estimates for a 13th straight
quarter. About  75 percent  of the 271 companies in the S&P 500
that reported results since April 10 have topped analysts’
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Per-share profits are forecast to have grown 5.3 percent in
the first quarter, Bloomberg data show. That’s up from the 0.8
percent growth projection before the earnings season started.  “We came into the quarter with this very negative
expectation from a macro perspective about what’s going on
globally and what’s going on in the economy,” David Spika, who
helps oversee $14 billion as an investment strategist at
Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in Dallas, said in an April 24
telephone interview. “We see the economy doing much better than
expected and that resulted in better earnings. As long as the
positive trend stays in place, you will see a positive trend in
earnings growth.”  Apple, Amazon.com  Apple rose 5.2 percent to $603. Demand from Chinese
consumers helped Apple sell a higher-than-predicted 35.1 million
iPhones last quarter. The results eased concerns that had cut
the company’s shares 12 percent in two weeks.  The S&P 500  Consumer Discretionary Index (S5COND)  gained 2.8 percent
to a record level. Amazon.com jumped 19 percent to $226.85. The
world’s largest Internet retailer beat analysts’ first-quarter
revenue and earnings estimates, led by demand for Kindle devices
and e-commerce services for outside vendors.  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  soared 26 percent to $40.31 for the biggest
increase in the S&P 500. The online travel agency reported
first-quarter earnings excluding some items of 26 cents a share,
beating the average analyst estimate by 90 percent, the most
since at least 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Homebuilders Rally  PulteGroup advanced 20 percent to $10.07. The largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue reported a narrower first-quarter loss as
it reduced costs and sold houses at higher prices. D.R. Horton
Inc., the biggest by volume, climbed 7.4 percent to $16.51 after
second-quarter profit beat analyst estimates.  A gauge of phone companies in the S&P 500 surged 4.4
percent to its highest level since July. AT&T rallied 5.9
percent to $32.67 as earnings beat estimates on lower smartphone
upgrade costs and an increase in wireless data sales related to
Apple’s iPad.  Boeing Co. (BA)  jumped 5.1 percent to $77.27. Earnings beat
estimates after the company delivered more commercial jets while
pushing production to record levels.  A group of companies that sell necessities were the  only
loser  among the 10 S&P 500 industry groups, falling 0.2 percent.
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world’s largest consumer-products
company, dropped 4.6 percent, the most since September, to
$64.44 after reducing its earnings forecast, hurt by regulations
in Venezuela and slowing sales shipments in some developed
markets.  Wal-Mart Under Probe  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  slid 5.5 percent to $59.03 for the
biggest retreat in the Dow. Mexico started a preliminary
criminal investigation of Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB executives
following allegations they bribed local officials to speed up
the awarding of permits for new stores, the Attorney General’s
Office said.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the biggest package-delivery
company package considered a proxy for the economy, declined 2.3
percent to $78.44, after first-quarter profit trailed analysts’
estimates amid slowing growth in overseas shipping.  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest maker of construction, fell 2.9
percent to $104.56, as revenue missed projections after sales
fell in  China  and Brazil.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  plunged 21 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $83.74. The world’s largest video-subscription service
projected slower growth in the number of U.S. streaming
customers.  -- Editors:  Jeff Sutherland , Stephen Kleege  To contact the reporter on this story:
