Ethanol futures rose to the highest
level in more than a week in  Chicago  as corn gained after a
report showed higher export demand.  The biofuel surged 2 percent after the Agriculture
Department said U.S. exporters sold 1.44 million metric tons to
unknown destinations for delivery in the marketing year that
starts Sept. 1, signaling higher costs for ethanol production.  “Volumes for ethanol were higher today, as bullish news
drove the product out of its monthlong slumber,” SCB &
Associates LLC in Chicago said in a note today.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 4.3 cents to settle
at $2.197 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
price since April 16. Prices have dropped 0.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  climbed 3.5
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.27 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive gained 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.17, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$2.23 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.315.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 18 cents, or 3 percent,
to $6.255 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
