European stocks advanced, led by
construction companies, as investors awaited a U.S. report on
first-quarter economic growth. U.S. index futures and Asian
shares retreated.  Vinci SA led construction shares higher. Nobel Biocare
Holding AG, the world’s second-biggest dental implant maker,
rose after first-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.3 percent to 257.90 at 10:18 a.m.
in  London . The gauge has rallied 5.5 percent this year as the
 European Central Bank  boosted long-term loans to the region’s
financial institutions and U.S. economic reports exceeded
forecasts. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1
percent today, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index also slipped
0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
