European Union regulators
threatened to file a lawsuit against the U.K. over safety at the
 Milford Haven  liquefied natural-gas terminal.  The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, said
British authorities failed to heed requirements under the bloc’s
rules on environmental impact assessments at the LNG site in
Wales. The commission sent the U.K. government an initial
warning letter and set a two-month deadline for a reply.  “They didn’t properly assess what the impact might be of
LNG tankers going in and out of the Milford Haven facility,”
Joe Hennon, environment spokesman of the Brussels-based
commission, said today by telephone.  In enforcing EU legislation on member nations, the
commission begins the lawsuit process by sending an initial
warning known as a letter of formal notice. The next step would
be a final warning in the form of a “reasoned opinion” and
then a complaint to the EU court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
