WPP Plc (WPP) , the biggest advertising
agency, said first-quarter sales rose 7.6 percent, ahead of its
own budget, after the acquisition of agencies in faster-growing
markets such as Indonesia and Russia.  Revenue climbed to 2.39 billion pounds ($3.86 billion) from
2.08 billion pounds a year earlier, the Dublin-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
estimated sales of 2.35 billion pounds.  WPP has been offsetting slower growth in markets hit by the
European debt crisis by acquiring digital advertising technology
and companies in faster-growing markets such as China and
 Brazil . Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  announced more
than a dozen deals in the quarter, scooping up assets in
Indonesia, Pakistan and  Russia .  Revenue growth excluding acquisitions and currency
fluctuations was 4 percent and sales growth for the year will be
more than 4 percent as the market improves in the second half of
the year, the company said.  WPP shares fell 1 percent to 838 pence in London trading
yesterday. The stock gained 24 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
