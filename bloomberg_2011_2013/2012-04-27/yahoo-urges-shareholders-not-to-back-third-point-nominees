Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, said it doesn’t support the board nominees put
forward by shareholder Third Point LLC.  The company has received notice that Third Point and its
affiliates intend to nominate four directors, Sunnyvale,
California-based Yahoo said today in a  filing  with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders should approve
its own 10 board nominees instead, Yahoo said.  “The Third Point nominees are not endorsed by our board of
directors,” Yahoo said. “We urge shareholders not to vote any
proxy card or voting instruction form that you may receive from
or on behalf of the Third Point Entities.”  Yahoo, which has come under investor scrutiny as it has
lost ground to rivals  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB) , is facing a
proxy fight with Third Point, which owns about 5.8 percent of
the company and wants to get the four nominees, including its
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Loeb, onto the board. New CEO
 Scott Thompson , who joined in January, is trying to drive a
turnaround by focusing on growth and shrinking costs.  Former CEO Carol Bartz, who was ousted in September,
received a compensation package of $16.4 million in 2011, an
increase from $11.9 million in 2010, according to the filing.
Bartz received a $3 million severance payment as part of the
package.  Yahoo rose less than 1 percent to $15.57 at the close in
New York. The shares have fallen 3.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
