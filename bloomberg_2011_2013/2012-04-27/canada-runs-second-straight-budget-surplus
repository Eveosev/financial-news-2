Canada â€™s federal government ran a
budget surplus in February for a second consecutive month on
increased revenue from corporate income taxes and employment
insurance premiums.  Canada recorded a surplus of C$1.48 billion ($1.51 billion)
during the month, reversing a C$592 million deficit in February
2011, the department said in its monthly budget report from
Ottawa today. The deficit in the first 11 months of the fiscal
year, which begins April 1, narrowed to C$14.5 billion from
C$28.3 billion.  Revenue rose 5.2 percent to C$22.6 billion in February from
a year earlier, led by an 8.8 percent increase in corporate
income taxes and a 6.8 percent rise in employment insurance
premiums. The Canadian government raised employment insurance
premium rates by 5 cents on Jan. 1. Revenue for the 11-month
period was up 4.7 percent.  Program spending fell 3.6 percent in February and was down
1.9 percent over the first 11 months of the fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
