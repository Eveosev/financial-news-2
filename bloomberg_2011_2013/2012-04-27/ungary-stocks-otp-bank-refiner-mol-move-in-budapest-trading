Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index rose
0.3 percent to 18,235.03 by the close in Budapest, increasing
the gain this week to 4.1 percent and paring the loss this month
to 2.2 percent.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, fell for
the first time in four days after Standard & Poor’s cut Spain’s
sovereign credit rating, adding to concern the debt crisis will
worsen as Hungary works to obtain aid. The shares dropped 0.8
percent to 3,810 forint.  Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt.  (FHB HB) fell 0.4 percent
to 572 forint.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, declined as
much as 1.5 percent on an intraday basis and closed 0.2 percent
higher at 17,900 forint. Oil fell as the  U.S. economy  expanded
less than forecast in the first quarter and a cut in Spain’s
credit rating renewed concern Europe’s faltering economy may
curb fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
