Telephone companies led by  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  AT&T Inc. (T)  must tell subscribers how to
block third-party charges under rules approved today by the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission.  Monthly bills must display information on how to block
improper charges placed on bills, a practice known as cramming,
under rules passed by a 3-0 vote at the agencyâ€™s monthly meeting
in Washington today. The regulations apply to traditional
landline phones.  Consumer groups had asked for more. Anti-cramming
protections should be extended to customers of mobile phones and
voice-over-Internet services, policy groups including Consumers
Union and the Consumer Federation of America said in an April 18
letter to FCC commissioners.  The agency also was to consider requiring television
broadcasters to disclose details of political advertising for
posting on an FCC website. The files are now maintained on paper
at broadcast station offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
