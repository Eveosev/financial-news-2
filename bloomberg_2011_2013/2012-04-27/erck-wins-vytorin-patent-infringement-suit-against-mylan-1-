Merck & Co. (MRK) ’s patent for the
cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin is valid and enforceable, a
federal judge ruled today in a case against  Mylan Inc. (MYL) , which
sought to sell generic versions of the drugs before the patent
expires.  Mylan, the biggest U.S. maker of generic drugs, was sued in
2009 and 2010 over applications to sell the copies before the
2017 expiration date. The patent at issue is RE 42,461 which
covers ezetimibe, an active ingredient in both Zetia and
Vytorin, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck said in an
e-mailed stetement.  A federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, issued a court order
today blocking approval of Mylan’s generics before expiration of
the patent, Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, said. The
injunction couldn’t be confirmed in court filings.  Michael Laffin, a spokesman for Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-
based Mylan, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message
after regular business hours seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Schering v. Mylan, 09-6383, U.S. District
Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
