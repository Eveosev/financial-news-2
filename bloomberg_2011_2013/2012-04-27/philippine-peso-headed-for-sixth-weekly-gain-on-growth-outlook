The Philippine peso completed a
sixth weekly gain, the longest winning streak since April 2010,
on speculation  government spending  and remittances will boost
economic growth. Bonds advanced.  The Philippines reported a  budget deficit  in March,
reversing a surplus the previous month, after the government
stepped up spending to bolster the economy. Money sent home by
Filipinos living abroad increased 5.8 percent in February from a
year earlier to $1.6 billion, after gaining 5.4 percent in
January, the central bank reported on April 16.  “It’s largely positive sentiment on the outlook for the
Philippine economy,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING
Groep NV in Manila. “The March government spending assured that
we’re going to see stimulus come into play. The remittances
continue to be quite resilient.”  The peso strengthened 0.6 percent this week to 42.368 per
dollar at the close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency rose 0.4 percent today, the biggest gain since
April 2. One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-
rate swings used to price options, fell 100 basis points this
week to 4.30 percent and reached 4.08 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since November 2002. It was little changed today.  The budget shortfall was 28.6 billion pesos ($674 million),
compared with a previously reported 10.66 billion peso surplus
for February, the government said on April 25.  The  World Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  have
forecast expansion will accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2012, aided
by government spending. Growth in the $200 billion economy
slowed to 3.7 percent last year from 7.6 percent in 2010.  The yield on the  Philippines ’ 8 percent bonds due July 2031
fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, this week to
5.94 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services. The rate was six basis points lower today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
