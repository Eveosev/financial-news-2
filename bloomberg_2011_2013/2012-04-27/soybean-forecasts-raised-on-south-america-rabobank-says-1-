Soybean prices will average $14.75
a bushel in the second quarter, higher than projected last
month, as prospects decline for crops in  South America , Rabobank
International said in a report.  The forecast, up from a March estimate of $14 a bushel,
would be a record for quarterly average prices, Rabobank
analysts including Erin Fitzpatrick and Nick Higgins said today
in an e-mailed report. Soybeans may average $14 a bushel in the
third quarter and $13.50 a bushel in the fourth, up from March
projections of $13.25 a bushel and $12.50 a bushel,
respectively, the bank said.  Argentina, which has suffered from drought and frost this
year, may harvest 43 million metric tons of soybeans, 2 million
less than previously estimated, Rabobank said.  Brazil ’s  crop  may
be 65.3 million tons, compared with a March forecast of 66.5
million. Last year, the two countries harvested 49 million tons
and 75 million tons of soybeans, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show.  “South America’s production is now likely to show the
largest year-over-year decline on record,” Rabobank said.
“Higher prices are needed to encourage U.S. farmers to increase
soybean plantings for the 2012-2013 marketing year.”  Rabobank’s estimates are below the USDA’s projection for
 Argentina  at 45 million tons, and its forecast for Brazil of 66
million.  China , the world’s biggest buyer of soybeans, may
import 1.5 million tons more than the 55 million projected by
the USDA, the bank said.  Corn, Wheat  Rabobank said corn may average $6.45 a bushel in the second
quarter while Chicago wheat may be $6.30 a bushel, unchanged
from last month’s forecasts. The bank raised its forecast for
milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris to 195 euros
($258.39) per ton, compared with 175 euros last month, because
of production risks in  Europe , where crops suffered from dry
weather and a cold spell in February.  Rising corn exports may cut U.S. inventories to 636 million
bushels by the end of the crop year Aug. 31, 165 million bushels
less than the USDA’s projection of 801 million bushels, Rabobank
said. The bank also increased its estimate for U.S. corn
planting to 94.3 million acres, up from 94 million projected
previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
