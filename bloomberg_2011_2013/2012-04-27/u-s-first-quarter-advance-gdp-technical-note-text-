Following is the text of the Gross
Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  This technical note provides background information about
the source data and estimating methods used to produce the
estimates presented in the GDP news release.  The complete set
of estimates for the first quarter is available on BEA’s Web
site at www.bea.gov; a brief summary of “highlights” is also
posted on the Web site.  In a few weeks, the estimates will be
published in BEA’s monthly journal, the Survey of Current
Business, along with a more detailed analysis of the estimates
(“GDP and the Economy”).  Real GDP  Real GDP increased 2.2 percent (annual rate) in the first
quarter of 2012, following an increase of 3.0 percent in the
fourth quarter.  The deceleration in real GDP in the first
quarter reflected a deceleration in inventory investment and a
downturn in nonresidential fixed investment that were partly
offset by accelerations in  consumer spending  and in exports.  Source Data for the Advance Estimate  The advance GDP estimate for the first quarter of 2012 is
based on source data that are incomplete and subject to revision.
Three months of source data were available for consumer spending
on goods; shipments of capital equipment, including aircraft;
motor vehicle sales and inventories; manufacturing durables
inventories; federal government outlays; and consumer, producer,
and international prices.  Only two months of data were
available from most other key data sources; BEA’s assumptions
for the third month are shown in table A.  Among those
assumptions are the following:  *    an increase in nondurable manufacturing inventories,
*    an increase in non-motor-vehicle merchant wholesale and
retail  inventories,
*    an increase in exports of goods, excluding gold, and
*    an increase in imports of goods, excluding gold.  Prices  The price index for gross domestic purchases--the prices
paid by U.S. residents for goods and services wherever produced-
-increased 2.4 percent in the first quarter after increasing 1.1
percent in the fourth. Excluding food and energy prices, the
price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.2 percent
after increasing 1.2 percent.  Disposable Personal Income and Personal Saving  Real disposable personal income (DPI) increased 0.4 percent
in the first quarter, following an increase of 1.7 percent in
the fourth.  Current-dollar DPI increased 2.8 percent, following
an increase of 2.9 percent. The personal saving rate was 3.9
percent in the first quarter, compared with 4.5 percent in the
fourth.  Table A. KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ADVANCE ESTIMATE OF GDP FOR THE
FIRST QUARTER OF 2012  For many of the key series used to prepare the advance
estimate of GDP, including retail sales, unit automobile and
truck sales and inventories, manufacturers’ shipments of
nondefense capital goods, manufacturers’ inventories of durable
goods, federal defense spending, and consumer, producer, and
international price indexes, actual data are available for all
months of the quarter.  For the key series shown in this table, actual data for the
third month of the quarter usually are not available in time for
inclusion in the advance GDP estimate.  BEA makes assumptions
for the source data that are not yet available; assumptions for
March 2012 are shown in the last column of the table.  For most
series shown, the data for February are preliminary and subject
to further revision.  Occasionally, the data for earlier months
are also subject to revision.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars,
seasonally adjusted at annual rates, and are published by the
Bureau of the Census.  2011                         2012  Oct.
