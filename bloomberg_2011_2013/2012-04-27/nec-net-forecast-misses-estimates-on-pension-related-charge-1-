NEC Corp. (6701)  forecast profit lower
than analysts’ estimates as  Japan ’s biggest maker of
telecommunications equipment took a pension-related charge.  Net income may be 20 billion yen ($248 million) for the
current fiscal year, compared with a loss of 110 billion yen for
the 12 months ended March 31, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement today. The result was lower than the 29 billion yen
average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. NEC is
taking a 5 billion yen charge to transfer some of its stake in
 Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  to its pension trust, it said.  NEC, which posted its third annual loss in four years, took
a charge of about 40 billion yen for restructuring including
cutting 10,000 jobs or about 8.6 percent of the  workforce . It’s
focusing on carrier-network business and cloud computing, as it
failed to win customers with its Medias smartphones and LaVie
notebook computers.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  almost doubled its profit last
quarter with the iPhone and iPad.  The network builder formed a venture with  Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992) ,  China ’s biggest PC maker, last year. NEC,  Casio Computer
Co. (6952)  and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  merged their mobile-phone handset
operations in 2010.  Sales may rise 3.7 percent to 3.15 trillion yen. Operating
profit may rise 36 percent to 100 billion yen, the company
reported today.  NEC fell 4 percent to 145 yen in Tokyo trading before the
company announced its earnings. The stock has lost 7.1 percent
this year, compared with a 10 percent gain for the broader Topix
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
