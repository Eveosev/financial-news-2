Brunello Cucinelli SpA (BC) , an Italian
maker of luxury cashmere clothing, rose 37 percent on its debut
in Milan trading after investors sought to purchase 17 times the
amount of stock available in an initial public offering.  The shares gained as much as 2.84 euros from the 7.75-euro
offer price and were up 30 percent at 10.12 euros as of 10:30
a.m. That gave the Solomeo, Italy-based company a market value
of about 688 million euros ($907 million).  Cucinelli follows competitors  Prada SpA (1913)  and Salvatore
Ferragamo SpA in offering stock to the public in the last 12
months as demand for  luxury goods  in Asia fuels earnings growth
and draws investors. The clothier raised 158 million euros this
week after selling shares at the top end of a targeted range.
The IPO was the first in Italy this year.  “Brunello Cucinelli is a small luxury player with
excellent positioning,” Thomas Mesmin, an analyst at CA
Cheuvreux, wrote in an April 17 note. He estimates earnings per
share may rise 20 percent annually for the next three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
