European Central Bank Vice
President  Vitor Constancio  said policy makers are relying on new
data to analyze the impact of increasing secured lending between
financial institutions on the transmission of monetary policy.  “If the unsecured money market will continue to shrink and
lose importance in relation to the secured money market
activity, then the implementation framework of monetary policy
will lose some traction,” Constancio told lawmakers in Brussels
today. “We really are vitally interested in following detailed
information on what’s going on” with regard to “the increase
in secured lending in the money markets.”  A global initiative, coordinated by the Committee on the
Global Financial System, to conduct a qualitative quarterly
survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated
 securities lending  and OTC derivatives markets “will be of some
help,” Constancio said. The ECB said yesterday that secured and
unsecured money markets have become increasingly impaired as a
result of the financial crisis.  Constancio also proposed the creation of a European-Union
wide central database for repurchasing agreements, “similar to
the model in the U.S.”  “The EU would be well placed for central data gathering
for the repo markets,” Constancio said.  Repurchase agreements are contracts where one investor
agrees to sell a security and then buy it back at a future date
and a fixed price. The trades, known as repos, are one of
several so-called shadow banking activities being targeted by
the Group of 20 nations on concerns they may be used to evade a
clampdown on excessive risk taking.  To contact the reporters on this story:
