Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  climbed the most
since August after the German provider of polysilicon said
first-quarter volumes surged almost 50 percent as demand
rebounded, enabling all its production facilities to run at full
capacity.  A new 900 million-euro ($1.19 billion) plant that went into
operation today should reach full nominal capacity of 15,000
metric tons in the next few weeks, the Munich-based company said
in a statement today. Wacker’s total polysilicon output,
including supplies from the new plant, is “almost completely
under contract until the end of 2015,” making it one of the
largest producers worldwide, it said.  The stock rose as much as 11 percent to 63.60 euros, and
traded at 61.14 euros as of 11:13 a.m. in  Frankfurt .  “We are optimistic about the outlook for photovoltaics,”
Chief Executive Officer Rudolf Staudigl said in the statement.
“The expansion of capacity is a key prerequisite to enable us -
- now and in the years to come -- to meet our customers’ demand
for top-quality polysilicon for use in highly efficient solar
cells.”  Demand will remain robust in the months ahead, Staudigl
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
