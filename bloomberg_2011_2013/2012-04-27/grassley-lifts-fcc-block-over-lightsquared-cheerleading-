A U.S. senator said he would stop
blocking two nominees to the  U.S. Federal Communications
Commission  over concerns the agency rushed to approve  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared Inc. wireless venture.  The FCC has begun producing documents, and that’s enough
progress to remove holds on Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, and
Ajit Pai, a Republican, Senator  Charles Grassley  said in an e-
mailed statement.  “It appears the FCC wanted LightSquared to succeed,” the
Iowa Republican said. “Is the FCC a neutral arbiter weighing
all public interests in each case, or is it a cheerleader for
favored projects?”  The FCC preliminarily approved LightSquared in January
2011, setting off objections from navigation-gear makers and
users such as airlines who said the service’s ground-based
towers would overwhelm devices using the global-positioning
system. In February, President  Barack Obama ’s administration
determined interference couldn’t be mitigated, and the FCC said
it intends to revoke approval.  Grassley in November announced he’d prevent a vote by the
full Senate on the nominees because the FCC wasn’t responding to
his requests for information about its dealings with
LightSquared. The Commerce Committee approved the nominees on a
voice vote in December.  The five-member agency has two open seats because one
member quit to join  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and another’s term expired.  “We are pleased this roadblock to the confirmation of two
outstanding nominees appears to have been removed,” Tammy Sun,
an FCC spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
