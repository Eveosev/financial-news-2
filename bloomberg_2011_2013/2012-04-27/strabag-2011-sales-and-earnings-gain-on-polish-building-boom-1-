Strabag SE (STR) , central  Europe ’s
biggest construction company, will raise its dividend after
revenue and sales gained from  Poland ’s “booming” construction
sector,’’ the company said today in an e-mail.  Net income climbed 27 percent to 239.3 million euros
($314.7 million) as sales increased 11 percent to 13.7 billion
euros. Analysts had  forecast  net income of 188 million euros and
sales of 13.6 billion euros, according to estimates collected by
Bloomberg.  “The growth is due to the strong demand in the German
building construction and civil engineering segment, the booming
Polish construction sector above all in the field of
transportation infrastructure and the expansion in northern
Europe,” according to Strabag’s statement.  Government austerity programs to combat the European debt
crisis may cut into Strabag’s future earnings, the company said.
Output in 2012 will remain unchanged at about 14.3 billion
euros. An earnings before interest and tax forecast in excess of
300 million euros is “more than ambitious,” the company said.
Ebit was 334.8 million euros in 2011.  Strabag seeks to raise its dividend to 60 cents after
paying out 55 cents a share last year. Shareholders will decide
on the measure at the company’s annual general meeting June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
