The amount of Brazilian sugar to be
loaded on ships waiting at the country’s main ports rose 42
percent from a week ago after rains halted operations, according
to SA Commodities.  Vessels were waiting to load 705,000 metric tons as of
yesterday, the Santos, Brazil-based consultancy said in an e-
mailed report. Heavy rains were forecast for this week in sugar
cane-producing areas in the states of Parana and  Sao Paulo ,
weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia said in a report e-mailed
on April 23.  “Loading operations are paralyzed for now in Santos, as a
heavy rain arrived,” Luiz Carlos dos Santos Jr., head of sugar
brokerage and operations at SA Commodities, wrote in the report.
Santos is  Brazil ’s biggest port.  Rains this week prevented the start of the new crop in
Brazil, the world’s largest sugar producer, according to Somar.
Harvesting is likely to begin May 1, after rains stop, Sao
Paulo-based broker ICAP do Brasil Ctvm said in a report e-mailed
April 25.  Cane output in center south, the nation’s main producing
region, may climb to 509 million tons in the 2012-13 season,
industry group Unica estimates. Output fell for the first time
in a decade in the prior period to 493.3 million tons as dry
weather, frost and flowering reduced yields, it has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
