BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest natural-gas producer, agreed to sell its 40 percent
stake in the Quintero liquefied gas plant in  Chile  to  Enagas SA (ENG) 
for 272 million euros ($359 million).  Enagas, the operator of  Spain ’s gas grid, plans to buy BG’s
shareholding in two phases, according to a  statement  today. The
second tranche will be carried out in “conjunction with a
partner,” Enagas said, leaving it with 51 percent of BG’s
interest in GNL Quintero and the other partner with 49 percent.  BG, based in Reading, U.K., had originally planned to sell
only half of its holding and continue to supply LNG to the plant
It plans to sell as much as $5 billion in assets around the
world as the company invests in oil and gas fields in  Brazil ,
the  North Sea  and  Australia .  It will continue to supply as much as 1.7 million tons a
year of LNG to the Chilean market through 2030, according to a
separate statement.  Other shareholders in GNL Quintero include state-owned oil
refiner Empresa Nacional del Petroleo, Empresa Nacional de
Electricidad SA and Metrogas SA. The plant has a 3.4 million
ton-a-year capacity regasification capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
