European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said the resumption of international talks over  Iran’s
nuclear program  gave a “reason to hope” that the country is
serious about addressing the issue.  Stressing the EU’s “deep concern over Iran’s nuclear
program,” Van Rompuy said today in Brussels that the April 14
talks “in Istanbul give us reason to hope that Iran will engage
in a sustained process of serious dialog on the nuclear issue.”
He said the 27-nation bloc has introduced “robust restrictive
measures which are important in convincing Iran to return to
meaningful negotiations.”  World powers broke a 15-month stalemate on the nuclear
conflict during the April 14 discussions. The talks between Iran
and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members -
- the U.S., the U.K.,  China , Russia and France -- plus Germany
are set to resume on May 23 in Baghdad.  Van Rompuy  also said the EU “remains deeply concerned
about the fragile situation in Syria with systematic and
widespread violations of human rights by the regime and reports
of heavy weaponry in civilian areas.” He urged the Syrian
government “to allow the effective operation and deployment of
the fully fledged observer mission without delay.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
