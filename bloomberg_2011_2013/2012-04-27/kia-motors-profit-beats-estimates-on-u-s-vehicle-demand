Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ,  South Korea ’s
second-largest carmaker, posted first-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates as demand for Rio compacts and Sportage sport-
utility vehicles boosted sales overseas more than forecast.  Net income  rose 26 percent to 1.2 trillion won ($1.1
billion) in the three months ended March from 953.2 billion won
a year earlier, the Seoul-based carmaker said in a regulatory
filing today. That compares with the 948.4 billion won average
of 26  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  First-quarter vehicle sales in the U.S. rose a revised 32
percent, more than triple the pace of Kia’s annual target, with
an increase of 25 percent in  Europe  and 15 percent in  China  as
its models gained popularity in export markets. The  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380)  affiliate said in January it’s targeting growth of 10
percent in the U.S. and 23 percent in Europe.  “The company’s global sales trend will continue,” said
Shin Chung Kwan, an analyst at KB Investment & Securities Co.
“Kia’s sales in the domestic market, where it struggled last
quarter, will also grow as it launches the new K series models
scheduled to be released this year.”  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, increased 33 percent to 1.12 trillion
won, the company said.  Sales rose 11 percent to 11.8 trillion won, beating the
11.5 trillion won average of 26 analysts’ estimates.  Production Capacity  Kia shares  rose 1.4 percent to 80,700 won at the close in
 Seoul , compared with the Kospi index’s 0.6 percent gain. The
stock has risen 21 percent this year.  Hyundai Motor, which owns 34 percent of Kia, yesterday
reported first-quarter profit rose 31 percent to 2.45 trillion
won.  The company currently has capacity to produce 2.8 million
or more vehicles this year, said Joo Woo Jeong, head of
financial management at Kia, in a conference call today.  “This is more than our original sales target of 2.7
million,” said Joo. “We expect sales to exceed the target.”  Kia plans to start construction of its third plant in China
in June, and may start production earlier than planned, Joo
said.  The automaker aims to sell 2,000 to 2,500 units of the new
K9 luxury sedan per month in  Korea , said Min Chung Sik, head of
Kia’s investor relations team. The company currently estimates
pre-orders of the K9 to be at around 3,000 units. Kia is
carefully considering exporting the new sedan, Min said.  Kia plans to introduce the new C’eed hatchback in Europe
and the K3 small sedan in China this year, Min said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
