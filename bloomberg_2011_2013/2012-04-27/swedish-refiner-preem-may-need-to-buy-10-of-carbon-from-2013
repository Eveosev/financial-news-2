Preem AB,  Sweden ’s largest oil
refiner, may need to buy at least 10 percent of its European
Union carbon allowances in the eight years through 2020, after
receiving permits for free through this year.  “Beginning in 2013, we may be required to purchase a
minimum of 10 percent to 20 percent of our total emission
allowance requirements in order to comply with the stipulated
environmental regulations,” according to its 2011  annual report
 published today on the company’s website.  Preem expects the 2.5 million metric tons of allowances it
received annually in the five years through 2012 to be
sufficient to cover its emissions, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
