Stemcor Holdings Ltd., the world’s
largest independent steel trader, said it signed a $850 million
 credit line , 31 percent more than its original target after
lenders offered more than it sought.  ABN Amro Bank NV, BNP Paribas SA, ING Groep NV, Natixis,
Societe Generale SA and Standard Chartered Plc arranged the 364-
day revolving credit that will replace a $772.5 million facility
signed last year, lenders said in a statement.  “We have had a strong response to the facility and taken
advantage of the over subscription offered,” Michael Broom,
Stemcor’s chief financial officer said in the statement. “The
year ahead remains challenging for the sector, but we remain
cautiously optimistic for the group and are ready to take
advantage of the upturn when it comes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
