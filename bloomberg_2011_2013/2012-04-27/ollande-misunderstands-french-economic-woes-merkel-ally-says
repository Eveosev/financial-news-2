Socialist presidential candidate
 Francois Hollande  fails to understand  France ’s economic
shortcomings and risks doing more harm than good with his
spending plans, a senior lawmaker from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party said.  “Herr Hollande has misunderstood the problems in his
country and in other euro area countries,” Michael Meister, the
deputy caucus chairman of Merkel’s  Christian Democrats , said in
a phone interview in Berlin today. “If one throws money into a
country with structural problems that won’t solve those
structural problems. In fact, one makes the problems worse.''  Meister said that he supports structural reforms for the
individual economies in the euro area to iron out imbalances and
make them more competitive and not stimulus spending. He
proposed using money from the European Union budget that is
already directed to member states and “prioritizing those
payments to ensure they spur economic growth” as structural
reforms are carried out.  Merkel’s government “strictly” opposes “pumping more
money into economies,” Meister said. “It would more likely
make the implementation of the fiscal compact more difficult,”
he said. “The aim is to gain control over excessive debt, not
increase it.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
