The Obama administration is
threatening to veto Republican legislation to freeze student
loan rates over the way the measure is funded.  The administration, in a statement, called the proposal to
fund the loan-rate freeze from money designated for preventive
health care “politically motivated.” The House is scheduled to
vote on the proposal today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
