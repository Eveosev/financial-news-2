Spain ’s  unemployment rate  rose to
24.4 percent, the highest in 18 years, as the euro area’s
fourth-largest economy entered its second recession since 2009
amid the deepest austerity efforts in more than three decades.  The jobless rate advanced in the first quarter from 22.9
percent in the previous three months, the National Statistics
Institute in  Madrid  said today. Unemployment was higher than the
median estimate of 23.8 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of three analysts. Spain’s inflation rate rose in April to 2
percent from 1.8 percent, a separate report showed today.  Surging unemployment rates from Spain to Italy and Greece
are threatening to derail efforts to quell the region’s debt
crisis and keeping bond yields close to record levels relative
to benchmark German bunds. Spain is home to more than a third of
 the euro-area’s jobless  and more than half of young people have
no work, sapping government tax revenue. Spain will miss its
2012 budget deficit target as its economy contracts, the
government said on March 2.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond has risen about
one percentage point since early March to 5.99 percent today,
approaching the 7 percent level that helped force  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  into bailouts.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds rather than similar-maturity German securities was 432
basis points at 8:55 a.m. in Madrid, compared with an average
131 in the past five years. The rate has climbed more than 100
basis points this year.  Deficits to Persist  Joblessness may worsen as the recession deepens and labor
market laws are overhauled. In power since December, Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  passed a plan in February to make it
cheaper for employers to let workers go while raising taxes and
cutting spending including health care and education.  Rajoy’s People’s Party government has pledged to reduce the
budget gap to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from
8.5 percent in 2011 and by more than 2 percentage points next
year to get within the European Union’s 3 percent limit.  The  International Monetary Fund  said on April 17 it expects
budget deficits to persist in Spain, where the economic
recession will be deeper than in other euro-region countries.
The IMF forecasts a shortfall of 6 percent of GDP in 2012,
narrowing to 4.1 percent in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
