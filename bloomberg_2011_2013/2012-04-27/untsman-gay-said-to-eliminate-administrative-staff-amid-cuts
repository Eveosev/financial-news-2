Huntsman Gay Global Capital LLC, a
private-equity firm focused on mid-sized companies, has
eliminated some positions among its administrative staff,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The layoffs at the Palo Alto, California-based firm include
Donald Miller, the head of the firm’s portfolio group; Judy Frodigh, chief administrative officer; and Ben Thorndike, head
of  investor relations , said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the cuts haven’t been publicly announced.
Both Frodigh and Thorndike worked in the firm’s office in
Foxborough,  Massachusetts , which will be closed.  The changes follow the departure earlier this year of
Robert Gay, co-founder of the firm, who left for a full-time
position with the Church of  Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints.
He co-founded the firm in 2007 with Jon Huntsman, father of
former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr. and chairman of
chemical maker  Huntsman Corp. (HUN)   Huntsman Gay raised its first fund in 2009 with $1.1
billion. It has no plans to raise money this year, the person
said.  A spokesman for Huntsman Gay declined to comment on the
cuts. E-mails to Miller, Thorndike and Frodigh weren’t
immediately returned.  Fortune Magazine reported on the organizational changes
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
