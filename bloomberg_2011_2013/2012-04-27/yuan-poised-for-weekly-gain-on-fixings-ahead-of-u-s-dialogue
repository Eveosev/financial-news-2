The yuan was poised for a weekly
gain as  China  fixed its  reference rate  at the highest level
since 2005 ahead of a meeting next week with U.S. officials.  The People’s Bank of China set its daily  fixing  0.07
percent stronger at 6.2787 against the dollar. The rate has been
lifted by 0.34 percent in the last three days. The fourth round
of the U.S.-China strategic and economic dialogue will be held
in Beijing on May 3 and May 4 and will be attended by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  and Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan .  “There’s fear in the market these friendly fixings will be
reversed once the dialogue is finished,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh ,
a currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore.
“We’ve certainly seen that in the past. The theory is the
broader macroeconomic backdrop for China is still very
uncertain.”  The yuan strengthened 0.03 percent this week to 6.3066 per
dollar as of 10:51 a.m. Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It dropped 0.01 percent today. The
currency is allowed to move as much as 1 percent either side of
the fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.04
percent to 6.3068 today and was little changed this week.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged today
and fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, this week to
2 percent.  China’s capital inflows fell in the first quarter, leading
to a smaller increase in foreign reserves as the government
allows greater currency flexibility to seek more balanced
international payments.  Forwards Decline  Net inflows under the capital account dropped by 56 percent
from a year earlier to $49.9 billion, the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange said in a statement on its website on April
26. The  trade surplus  narrowed 14 percent to $24.7 billion,
showing that cross-border fund flows are “more balanced,” the
agency said.  Gross domestic product  increased 8.1 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the least in almost three years,
after an 8.9 percent gain in the previous three months, official
data showed April 13.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.15 percent
this week to 6.3500 per dollar in  Hong Kong , 0.7 percent weaker
than the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts were little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
