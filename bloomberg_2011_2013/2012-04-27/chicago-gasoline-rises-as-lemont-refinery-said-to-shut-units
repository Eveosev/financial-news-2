Chicago  gasoline and diesel rose
against futures after Citgo Petroleum Corp. was said to be
shutting some units for repairs at its Lemont, Illinois,
refinery.  The discount for 87-octane gasoline in Chicago narrowed 4.5
cents to 8.5 cents versus futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4:24 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the smallest discount since April 2.  Citgo is scheduled to shut most of the main production
units at its 170,500-barrel-a-day refinery by May 1, said a
person familiar with plant operations who isn’t authorized to
speak for the refinery and so declined to be identified.
The company began shutting units yesterday, the person said.  Citgo is a unit of Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, Venezuela’s
state-owned oil company.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago strengthened 6 cents to
a premium of 3 cents above heating oil futures on the New York
exchange. The fuel had been trading at a discount since April 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
