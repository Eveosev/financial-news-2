Burundi’s government is considering
suspending taxes on imported food to alleviate hunger in the
East African nation, second Vice President Gervais Rufyikiri
told lawmakers today in the capital, Bujumbura.  Labor unions and civil-society groups last month staged a
general strike to demand the government reduce the cost of
living. Burundian annual inflation accelerated to 24.5 percent
in March from 22 percent in February as food prices rose.  Burundi, a coffee and tea-exporter, ranks third-last on the
United Nations’  Human Development Index , which measures
indicators including education and income, with only Niger and
the  Democratic Republic  of Congo below it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
