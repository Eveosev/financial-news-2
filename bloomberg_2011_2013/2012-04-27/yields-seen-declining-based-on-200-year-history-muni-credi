Investors in U.S. municipal bonds
should look back to  James Madison ’s tenure in the White House
for guidance on how far tax-exempt interest rates may fall.  The $3.7 trillion market’s best annual start since 2009
drove yields to the lowest since the 1960s this year. Even at
that level, they’re close to three times their trough since 1900
and just below their 200-year average, according to Janney
 Capital Markets .  “History shows that there is room for yields to go down,”
 Tom Kozlik , director of municipal credit analysis at Janney in
Philadelphia, said in an interview.  A Bond Buyer index of 20-year general-obligation bonds
yielded  3.86 percent  yesterday, following a seven-week climb
that was the steepest since 2010. The record low on the
benchmark was 1.29 percent in 1946.  Looking back two centuries to the presidential
administration of Madison, who was first elected in 1808, long-
term municipal yields have averaged 4.65 percent, according to
Kozlik. He used data from “A History of Interest Rates” by
Sidney Homer and  Richard Sylla  for his calculation.  New England municipal bonds yielded about 5 percent the
year Madison took office, according to the book.  Cash Flow  Tax-exempt mutual funds added $17.5 billion in the first 14
weeks of the year, the biggest start since 2007, according to
data from JPMorgan Securities LLC and Lipper US Fund Flows.
Buyers have been lured in part as eight straight quarters of
rising state tax revenue signaled fiscal pressures are easing
following the 18-month recession that ended in 2009.  Local debt has earned 3.15 percent in 2012 through April
25, the best start in three years and beating a 0.05 percent
decline in Treasuries, according to Bank of America data
tracking price changes and interest payments.  In the next two months investors will receive about $60
billion combined from interest and redemptions, almost $30
billion more than the total in March and April, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  That wave of funds is chasing a dwindling supply of bonds.
States and cities are set to issue  $7.6 billion  in the next
month, down from $12.8 billion of projected sales on April 3,
data compiled by Bloomberg data show.  Reinvestment Plan  Bondholders tend to reinvest coupon and maturity payments,
helping push down tax-exempt yields, Ebby Gerry, who manages $14
billion as head of municipals at UBS Global Asset Management Inc.
in  New York , said in an interview.  “There’s a greater potential for muni yields to come down
because of the increased demand,” Gerry said.  Signs of improving municipal  credit quality  may also add to
demand.  Standard & Poor’s  raised the  credit rating  on 1.46
public-finance issuers from January through March for each one
it downgraded, according to an April 24 report. That’s the first
time upgrades dominated since the second quarter of 2011.  “There is a feeling that the asset class is safer than
many expect,” Michael Pietronico, who manages $720 million of
municipals as chief executive officer of Miller Tabak Asset
Management in New York, said in a telephone interview.  Interest rates  on benchmark 30-year municipals dropped to
 3.32 percent  yesterday, the lowest level since March 6,
according to Bloomberg BVAL data. Yields on AAA tax-exempts due
in 10 years were 1.9 percent.  Following are descriptions of coming sales:  ILLINOIS is set to sell $1.8 billion of general-obligation
bonds as soon as May 1 to refund debt. Jefferies & Co. is the
underwriter. S&P rates the state A+, fifth-highest. (Added April
27)  SEATTLE plans to borrow as soon as next week about $127
million of general-obligation bonds to refund debt, according to
bond documents. The debt will price through competitive bid. S&P
rates the sale AAA. (Added April 26)  To contact the reporter on this story:
