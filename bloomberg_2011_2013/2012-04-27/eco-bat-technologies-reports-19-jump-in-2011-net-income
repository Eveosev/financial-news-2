Eco-Bat Technologies Ltd., the
largest lead producer in  Europe  and  South Africa , reported a 19
percent increase in 2011 net income as the average price of the
metal used in batteries rose.  Net income gained to 102.7 million pounds ($166.1 million)
from 86.5 million pounds in 2010, the Matlock, England-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. Revenue jumped to
