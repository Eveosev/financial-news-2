Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar as the central bank reduced  money supply  in
the market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained for a
third day, climbing less than 0.1 percent to 83.14 per dollar by
4:08 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, heading for its strongest in
a week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
had earlier declined as much as 0.2 percent.  Kenya’s central bank received bids of 11.3 billion
shillings ($135.9 million) after offering 5 billion shillings of
seven-day  repurchase agreements . It accepted 5 billion shillings
at a weighted average rate of 14.49 percent.  The repo auction helped manage liquidity in the market, and
support the shilling, Nahashon Mungai, a currency trader with
Equity Bank Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi, the capital.  “The fact the central bank had more than twice the bids
show the market is awash with liquidity,” he said. “The repo
has helped support the shilling and stem its losses.”  Uganda ’s shilling climbed 0.4 percent to 2,505 per dollar,
heading for its biggest gain in two weeks, while Tanzania’s rose
for the first time in four days, adding 0.3 percent to 1585.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
