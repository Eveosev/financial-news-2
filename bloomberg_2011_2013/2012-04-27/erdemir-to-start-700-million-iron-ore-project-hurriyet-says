TAS (EREGL) ,  Turkey â€™s biggest flat steelmaker, will start a $700 million
investment to develop an iron ore plant by 2016, Hurriyet
reported, citing chairman Fatih Tar.  Erdemir, as the company is called, will tap new iron
reserves estimated at 1 billion metric tons in the central
province of Malatya, as reserves at its Sivas plant to the north
of Malatya will be depleted by 2016 and 2017, Tar said,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Erdemir is upgrading a furnace at a cost of $45 million, as
part of annual capacity increase and modernization investments
of between $300 million and $400 million, Hurriyet quoted Tar as
saying. The company plans to produce 1,800 millimeter-wide steel
sheets for the Turkish automotive industry, in addition to 1,525
millimeters it makes, Tar said, according to the newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
