 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.01 percent to 1,576.2867.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell from the highest level in almost four weeks in New
York, trimming a second weekly gain, after a cut in  Spain ’s
credit rating renewed concern that  Europe ’s faltering economy
may curb fuel demand.  Crude for June delivery slid as much as 81 cents to $103.74
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $104.19 at 9:44 a.m. London time. The
contract rose 43 cents yesterday to $104.55, the highest close
since April 2. Prices are up 1.1 percent this week and have
posted a similar gain this month.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in  New York  rose amid signs of warmer-
than-normal weather across the continental U.S.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a benchmark price for
 Asia , dropped 48 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.51 a barrel at

Associates Ltd., a broker. The spread has fallen 0.3 percent
this week, the first weekly decline since Feb. 23. Singapore

percent, to $726.25 a metric ton, PVM data showed. Singapore

spread widened 3.7 percent from $4.30 a barrel on April 20.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may decline for the first time in four days in  London 
as a stronger dollar curbs demand for the metal as an
alternative investment.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1,655.40 an ounce by 9:42 a.m. in London. Prices are up 0.7
percent this week, cutting the monthly loss to 0.8 percent.
June-delivery futures were 0.3 percent lower at $1,655.90 on the

gains and declines in London as investors weighed falling
inventories of the metal against concern the euro-area debt
crisis may worsen.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans gained for a fourth day, heading for the third
straight monthly rise, on concerns that reduced production in
 South America  will boost demand for supplies from the U.S.  Soybeans for July delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent to
