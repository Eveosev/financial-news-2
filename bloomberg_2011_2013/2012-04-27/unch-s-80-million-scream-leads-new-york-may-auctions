A version of “The Scream” by
Edvard Munch headlines the big May auctions, with the three  New
York  houses gearing up to sell as much as $1.5 billion of
Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in the next two
weeks.  Works are coming from the estates of philanthropist David
Pincus, Wall Street financier Theodore Forstmann and  Los Angeles 
art patron Beatrice Gersh. Christie’s has 15 artworks valued at
$10 million or more; Sotheby’s has 11 and Phillips de Pury has
three.  “More people believe in art as a good wealth holder, and
that’s driving the market upward,” said Suzanne Gyorgy, global
head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank. “We are
seeing a lot of activity in  Asia  and the  Middle East . They want
to buy real estate in the U.S. and in  London  and they want to
buy art for the blank walls.”  Here are some auction highlights.  The biggest presale estimate belongs to “The Scream”
(1895), the only one of four renditions by the Norwegian artist
(1863-1944) that remains in a private collection.  The consigner is Petter Olsen, a Norwegian businessman
whose father, Thomas, was a friend and patron of Munch. The
family has owned the work for over 70 years. It’s expected to
fetch more than $80 million during  Sotheby’s (BID)  Impressionist and
modern evening sale on May 2.  Forstmann Works  Sotheby’s is selling an estimated $75 million of works from
the Forstmann collection, led by Picasso’s 1941 portrait of Dora
Maar, valued at $20 million to $30 million.  The top lot at Christie’s Impressionist and modern evening
sale on May 1 is Cezanne’s watercolor “Joueur de cartes” from
the estate of Texas collector Heinz Felix Eichenwald, expected
to fetch $15 million to $20 million.  There will be more fireworks at Christie’s postwar- and
contemporary-art sale on May 8.  Yves Klein’s 1962 fire-color painting “FC 1,” whose
creation involved two naked models and a blowtorch, is expected
to set an auction record for the French artist at Christie’s on
May 8.  Estimated between $30 million and $40 million, the work has
been guaranteed by a third party. Klein completed it several
weeks before his death at 34.  In the same sale, Christie’s will include 13 of 40 artworks
that belonged to Pincus, the former chairman of apparel
manufacturer Pincus Brothers-Maxwell, who died last December.  Rothko, Pollock  Among them is an 8-by-7-foot Rothko titled “Orange, Red,
Yellow” (1961) and expected to bring $35 million to $45
million. The painting hung for many years at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art, loaned by Pincus, a former museum trustee.  Another highlight is Pollock’s “No. 28” (1951), estimated
to bring $20 million to $30 million. The work was included in
the artist’s 1967 retrospective at the  Museum of Modern Art  in
New York.  Barnett Newman’s 1952 “Onement V” has a $10 million to
$15 million estimate. The canvas, featuring his signature
“zip,” had also been on loan to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art.  At Sotheby’s, “Figure Writing Reflected in Mirror” (1976)
by  Francis Bacon  is also valued between $30 million and $40
million. It’s the highlight of Sotheby’s contemporary-art
evening sale in New York on May 9.  ‘Sleeping Girl’  Warhol’s “Double Elvis [Ferus Type]” (1963) is heading to
the auction block with a $30 million to $50 million estimate. It
was one of 22 Elvis silkscreen paintings first exhibited at the
Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in late 1963. Nine of them are in
museum collections, including MoMA.  Roy Lichtenstein ’s “Sleeping Girl” is expected to fetch
$30 million to $40 million. Since 1964, the work was in the
collection of the late Hollywood talent agent Phil Gersh and his
wife Beatrice who bought it from the Ferus Gallery. The Gershes
were founding members of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles.  The auctions will conclude at Phillips de Pury, the
smallest of the three houses, owned by Russia’s Mercury Group.
Its evening sale on May 10 will star a 1981 canvas by Jean- Michel Basquiat in which a central figure wears a crown of
thorns. It’s expected to sell for $8 million to $12 million.  Christie’s Impressionist and  modern art  evening auction is
on May 1, at 20 Rockefeller Plaza, at 7 p.m. Sotheby’s is on May
2, at 1334 York Ave., at 7 p.m.  Christie’s postwar and contemporary evening auction is on
May 8, at 7 p.m. Sotheby’s contemporary evening auction is on
