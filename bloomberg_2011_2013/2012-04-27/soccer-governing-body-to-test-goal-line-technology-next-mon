International soccerâ€™s rule-making
body will start testing goal-line technology next month as it
seeks to reduce refereeing mistakes.  Sony Corp.-owned Hawk Eye will start testing its technology
at the Hampshire F.A. Senior Cup Final between Eastleigh FC and
AFC Totton on May 16 in Britain, FIFA said in an emailed
statement. The system of GoalRef, a German-Danish collaboration,
will be tested in two separate matches in  Denmark .  A final decision will be made at a special meeting of the
 International Football Association Board  on July 2, FIFA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
