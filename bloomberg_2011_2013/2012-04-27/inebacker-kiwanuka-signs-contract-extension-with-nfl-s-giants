Linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka signed
a contract extension with the  New York Giants , the  National
Football League ’s Super Bowl champions said in a news release.  Financial terms of the deal and its length weren’t
disclosed in the release. The Star-Ledger newspaper said it
covers three years and includes about $11 million in guaranteed
money.  The 29-year-old played in every game of the team’s 2011
championship season while recording 3 1/2 sacks, an
interception, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery, the team
said.  Kiwanuka, a seven-year veteran chosen by the Giants with
the last pick in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft, was
limited to three games during the 2010 season because of a
herniated disk in his neck.  To contact the reporter on this story:
