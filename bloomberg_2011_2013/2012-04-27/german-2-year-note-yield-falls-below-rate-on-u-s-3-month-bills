German two-year notes rose, driving
the yield on the securities to a  record low  thatâ€™s less than the
rate the U.S. pays to borrow for three months.  The  yield  on the German securities fell to as low as 0.083
percent and was at 0.089 percent at 7:05 a.m. London time. The
yield on U.S. three-month bills was 0.086 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
