Spain’s bonds fell, with two-year
note yields rising the most in almost two weeks, after  Standard
& Poor’s  cut the nation’s credit rating and as a report showed
the  unemployment rate  jumped to an 18-year high.  German note yields reached a record low as concern the
European debt crisis is worsening spurred demand for the
region’s safest government securities. Dutch notes rose as the
government struck a deal with the opposition to meet European
Union budget rules. Italian bonds were little changed as the
nation’s borrowing costs increased and it raised less than its
maximum target at a debt auction.  “After the rating cut there was a sell-off in the
periphery and stronger demand for bunds,” said Mohit Kumar,
head of euro-area rates strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London.
“The auction results are reasonable, given the volatility in
the market.”  Spain ’s  10-year yield  rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.88 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
climbing as high as 6 percent. The 5.85 percent bond due January
2022 declined 0.355, or 3.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,323) face
amount, to 99.77.  The two-year note yield increased two basis points to 3.28
percent after rising as much as 22 basis points, the biggest
intraday gain since April 16. The yield is up 75 basis points
this month.  Rating Cut  S&P lowered Spain’s long-term credit rating by two steps to
BBB+ from A, with a negative outlook, citing concern the nation
will have to provide further fiscal support to banks. Spanish
10-year yields have climbed more than 80 basis points this year
as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  struggles to quash investor
speculation the nation would need outside aid.  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish debt against default
for five years advanced five basis points to 473 basis points.  Italy ’s  10-year bond yields  climbed as much as 13 basis
points before ending trade little changed at 5.64 percent.
French 10-year yields increased two basis points to 3 percent.  Italy raised 5.95 billion euros from today’s debt sale,
less than its maximum target of 6.25 billion euros. The nation
sold 2.5 billion euros of a 10-year benchmark at a yield of 5.84
percent, up from 5.24 percent at the previous auction on March
29. Investors bid for 1.48 times the amount offered, versus 1.65
times last month.  The Treasury sold 2.42 billion euros of five-year notes at
4.86 percent, compared with 4.18 percent last month. It also
auctioned securities due in 2016 and 2019.  German Bunds  German two-year yields were little changed at 0.10 percent,
after falling to a record 0.075 percent. Five-year yields
dropped one basis point to 0.64 percent. They earlier declined
to an all-time low of 0.595 percent. The 10-year yield rose two
basis points to 1.70 percent.  “Sentiment is deteriorating and part of that story is of
course the outlook for Spain, and the rating downgrade doesn’t
help at all,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at
Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht. “The short-end yield levels we
are seeing in  Germany  are almost zero, it’s crazy.”  Spain’s jobless rate climbed to 24.4 percent in the first
quarter from 22.9 percent in the previous three months, the
National Statistics Institute said.  Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos ruled out seeking
a bailout. “Nobody has asked Spain, either officially or
unofficially” to turn to  Europe ’s bailout mechanisms, he said
in  Madrid  yesterday in a Bloomberg News interview.  Dutch Notes  Dutch notes advanced for a fourth day as Prime Minister
 Mark Rutte  and Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager reached a deal
with the opposition and got a majority backing on an austerity
package to meet the nation’s budget deficit target.  The two-year yield dropped one basis point to 0.39 percent
after rising as high as 0.55 percent on April 25.  The deal “is likely to remove the Netherlands from the
market’s spotlight in the short term,” Francois Cabau, an
economist at Barclays Plc in  London , wrote in note today. Still
negotiations after elections in September could be lengthy “and
return the country into the spotlight,” Cabau wrote.  German bonds returned 1.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s have lost 1.1 percent, and
Italy’s securities gained 8.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
