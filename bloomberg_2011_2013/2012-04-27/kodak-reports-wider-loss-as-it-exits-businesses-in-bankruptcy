Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the film pioneer
that filed for bankruptcy in January, reported a wider first-
quarter loss as it exited the digital-camera business and
photography sales declined.  The net loss expanded to $366 million from $246 million a
year earlier, the Rochester, New York-based company said today
in a statement. Sales fell 27 percent to $965 million, Kodak
said.  Kodak sought  bankruptcy protection  after years of burning
through cash as digital technology destroyed its film business.
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez, who took the helm in
2005, is selling photography and patent assets as part of a plan
to shrink the 131-year-old company into a digital-printing
specialist that sells faster, more flexible commercial and
consumer printers to profit from ink sales.  “We took decisive steps -- including filing for Chapter 11
and exiting unprofitable businesses -- to accelerate our
transformation and emerge in 2013 as a profitable, sustainable
business,” Perez said in the statement. “We saw improved
profitability of our Commercial and Consumer business.”  The company ended March with $1.4 billion in  cash  after
cutting spending and raising more financing.  Kodak is trying to sell more than 1,100 digital-imaging
patents and is pursuing mobile-device makers including Apple
Inc. and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  for patent infringement,
claiming the companies owe it royalty payments.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
