U.S. stocks rose for a fourth
straight day as improving  consumer confidence  and earnings
overshadowed lower-than-forecast economic growth and a downgrade
of  Spain ’s credit rating. The dollar weakened versus 14 of 16
major peers while Treasuries were little changed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2 percent to
1,403.36 at 4 p.m. in New York and the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) 
closed up 0.8 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields were little
changed at 1.93 percent after earlier dipping to a 12-week low.
The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.3242 as it gained for a
fourth day. Spain’s bonds fell as the nation lost its A rating
at S&P, while Italian bonds erased earlier losses.  Amazon.com Inc. posted earnings-per-share that  quadrupled 
the average analyst estimate, joining about three quarters of
 S&P 500  companies to exceed forecasts so far in the reporting
season and leading a gauge of retailers in the index to a
 record . The Commerce Department said the  U.S. economy  grew at a
2.2 percent annual rate, below the 3 percent pace at the end of
last year and the 2.5 percent median forecast of economists. The
report showed a smaller contribution from inventories
overshadowed higher  consumer spending .  “The economy is not gangbusters, but the chance of a
recession is dimming,” Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5
billion as chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in
 Boston , said in a telephone interview. “We’re encouraged by the
earnings surprises. We’re not happy with today’s GDP data, but
it shows domestic spending being on track.”  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final index of
sentiment increased to 76.4 from 76.2 last month. The  gauge  was
projected to hold at the 75.7 level initially reported earlier
this month, according to the median forecast of economists.  Earnings Season  Amazon.com (AMZN)  surged 16 percent, the most since 2009. Expedia
Inc. surged 24 percent for the best gain in the S&P 500 after
the online travel agency reported adjusted earnings-per-share
that almost doubled the average analyst estimate.  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX)  fell 5.3 percent as the biggest coffee-shop chain reported
same-store sales that  trailed  projections.  Procter & Gamble Co .
slid 3.6 percent as the largest consumer-products company cut
its profit estimate.  The S&P 500 rallied almost 1.8 percent this week after
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  posted earnings that almost  doubled , sending the
index to its biggest gain of the week on April 25. The index is
down about 0.4 percent in April, threatening to snap a four-
month streak of gains, its longest since 2009.  Investors are “getting spooked by uncertainty”
surrounding the  U.S. budget deficit  and reemergence of Europe’s
debt crisis, mirroring concerns at this time of year in 2011 and
2010, according to  Thomas Lee , chief U.S. equity strategist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New York . The S&P 500 tumbled 19 percent
from its 2011 high in April to its low in October. In 2010, it
slid 16 percent from an April peak to its July low. This year,
it has slipped about 1 percent from an almost  four-year high  on
April 2.  ‘Different Amplitude’  While the parallels of 2012 to 2011 “are striking, the
downside risks, in our view, are lower,” Lee wrote in a note to
clients, saying that the U.S. budget standoff and  Japan ’s
tsunami and nuclear disaster aggravated concerns last year. “In
a nutshell, same frequency, different amplitude,” he wrote.  The Stoxx 600 erased an earlier decline of as much as 0.9
percent as construction, financial-services and bank shares led
gains. Sales at Vinci SA,  Europe ’s largest builder, topped
analyst estimates, while Sandvik AB, the world’s biggest maker
of metal-cutting tools, reported first-quarter profit that beat
projections. Earnings have slipped 1.7 percent on average for
the 128 companies in the Stoxx 600 that released results since
April 10, while still beating analyst estimates by 6.9 percent.  ‘Element of Support’  “For the past few days, the market has been focusing on
earnings and this is an element of support,” said Guillaume Duchesne, an equity strategist at BGL BNP Paribas SA in
Luxembourg. “The debut of earnings season has been impressive.
There are signs of hope in the U.S. economy.”  Italy sold 4.92 billion euros ($6.5 billion) of 2017 and
2022 bonds, close to the maximum target, even as its borrowing
costs rose.  European Yields  The two-year Italian note yield erased earlier gains to
trade little changed at 3.25 percent as the government also sold
debt maturing in 2016 and 2019. The Spanish 10-year yield
climbed five basis points to 5.88 percent and was above 6
percent earlier, as S&P cut the nation’s sovereign rating two
steps yesterday, to BBB+ from A, on concern the country will
have to provide further fiscal support to the banking sector. A
report today showed unemployment surged to 24.4 percent, the
highest in 18 years.  Oil rose 0.3 percent to $104.88 a barrel in New York,
reversing losses in the last  hour of floor trading. Gold
futures advanced 0.3 percent to $1,664.80 an ounce on the Comex
in New York. Copper rallied 1.5 percent to $3.8295 a pound for a
fourth straight advance.  Emerging-market stocks rose, erasing an earlier decline.
The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  advanced 0.4 percent. The gauge
is still poised for a sixth weekly retreat, the longest losing
streak since October 2008. Russia’s Micex Index gained 1.6
percent, and  Poland ’s WIG20 Index climbed 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
