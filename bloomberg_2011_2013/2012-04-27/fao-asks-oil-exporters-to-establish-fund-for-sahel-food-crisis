The  Food and Agriculture
Organization  of the United Nations asked oil-exporting countries
to set up a fund to help manage a food crisis in Africa’s Sahel,
said Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva.  “We are very concerned about the Sahel because there are
already many conflicts in the region,” he said today at a
conference in Brazzaville, the capital of Republic of Congo,
which he said has given “rigorous support” for the fund plan.  More than 5 million people in Niger are facing food
insecurity, along with 3 million in Mali and 1.5 million in
 Burkina Faso , according to the FAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
