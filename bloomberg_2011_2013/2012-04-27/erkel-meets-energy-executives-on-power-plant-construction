German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
will meet representatives from the  energy industry  including  RWE
AG (RWE) ’s Juergen Grossmann next week for talks about power plant
expansion in  Europe ’s biggest electricity market.  The discussions starting at 4:30 p.m. in Berlin on May 2
will tackle “the future of power-plant construction,” Merkel’s
spokesman Steffen Seibert said at his regular news conference
today.  Grossmann will take part in the meeting, Annett Urbaczka, a
spokeswoman, said by phone from Essen. Carsten Thomsen-Bendixen,
a spokesman for EON AG, Germany’s biggest utility, declined to
comment when contacted by phone.  Germany intends by 2022 to replace nuclear reactors that
supplied about a fifth of its electricity with renewables such
as solar and wind as well as a new fleet of fossil-fuel plants.  EON and RWE have threatened to halt investment in offshore
wind projects because of delays in connecting their projects to
the  power grid . They’re also refusing to build new gas-fired
generators as the fuel’s rising cost and the spectre of Europe’s
second recession in three years wipe out returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
