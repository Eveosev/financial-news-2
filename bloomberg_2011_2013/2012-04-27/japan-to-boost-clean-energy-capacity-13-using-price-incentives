Japan  will boost renewable-energy
capacity by about 13 percent through the year ending March 2013
after it begins a price incentive program for generators this
July, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said.  Japan will add 2,500 megawatts of clean energy including
solar and wind in the fiscal year, the ministry said today. The
country currently has a capacity of 18,750 megawatts.  Utilities must pay above-normal rates to renewable energy
producers under the incentive program. Costs will be passed onto
power users as a surcharge of as much as 0.4 yen (0.5 cent) a
kilowatt-hour, the ministry said. An average household will pay
as much as 100 yen a month for the surcharge, it said.  Estimates were issued today at a meeting of a panel to set
tariffs for solar, geothermal, wind, biomass and hydropower. The
five-member panel led by Kazuhiro Ueta, environmental economics
professor at  Kyoto University , will today submit recommendations
to Industry Minister  Yukio Edano , with approval expected next
month. The solar rate was 42 yen a kilowatt-hour for 20 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
