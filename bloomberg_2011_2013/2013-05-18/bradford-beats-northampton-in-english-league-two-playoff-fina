Bradford beat Northampton 3-0 in the
League Two playoff final to return to the third tier of English
soccer for the first time since 2007.  James Hanson, Rory McArdle and Nahki Wells scored in the
opening 28 minutes at Wembley Stadium in  London . Bradford joins
Gillingham and Rotherham, who earned automatic promotion as the
top two teams in the division, in moving up to League One next
season.  Bradford was playing its second Wembley final of the season
after losing 5-0 to Swansea in Februaryâ€™s League Cup title
match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
