German  government bonds  rose, with
10-year yields dropping the most in six weeks, as reports
showing the euro-area economy contracted and inflation slowed
underpinned demand for the region’s safest securities.  Germany ’s  two-year yields  dropped below zero and approached
the lowest level this year as the Federal Statistics Office said
the nation’s economy cooled last quarter. Austrian, Dutch and
Belgian securities also gained. Spanish and Italian bonds
trimmed weekly declines after the nations were successful in
selling 13 billion euros ($16.7 billion) of debt via banks.  “The economic data was disappointing, the only good news
was that Germany was still growing, though slower than the
market expected,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ
Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “It will take some time until all the
other European economies come out of recession and because of
that everybody was looking for bunds, or safe havens again,
despite the low yield.”  Germany’s 10-year yield dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point this week, to 1.33 percent, the biggest decline
since the period ended April 5. The 1.5 percent bund maturing in
February 2023 gained 0.49, or 4.90 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 101.575.  The two-year note yield fell eight basis points to minus
0.029 percent after dropping to minus 0.045 percent on May 3,
the lowest level since Dec. 28. A negative yield means investors
who hold the security until it matures will receive less than
they paid to buy it.  Longer Recession  Euro-area  gross domestic product  shrank 0.2 percent in the
first quarter, after falling 0.6 percent in the previous three
months, the European Union’s statistics office said May 15.
Annual consumer price inflation slowed to 1.2 percent in April,
from 1.7 percent in March, the office said the following day,
confirming an April 30 estimate.  The bonds of other so-called core nations also gained this
week. Austria’s  10-year yield  fell nine basis points to 1.69
percent, while similar-maturity Dutch yields dropped seven basis
points to 1.64 percent and  Belgium ’s declined eight basis points
to 2 percent.  Spanish and Italian securities trimmed declines amid
speculation investors’ view of the two countries is improving
after  Spain  sold 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds through banks
on May 14 and  Italy  allotted 6 billion euros of 30-year debt the
following day.  Spain’s syndication attracted bids for more than 21 billion
euros of debt, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.
Italy garnered 12.7 billion euros of bids for its 30-year bonds,
a person close to the transaction said.  Spain’s 10-year yield rose less than one basis point this
week to 4.21 percent after being as much as 21 basis points
higher. Similar-maturity Italian rates ended the week less than
a basis point up at 3.90 percent, trimming an earlier increase
of 19 basis points.  Germany’s bonds returned 0.4 percent this year through May
16, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s securities
gained 7 percent and Italy’s earned 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
