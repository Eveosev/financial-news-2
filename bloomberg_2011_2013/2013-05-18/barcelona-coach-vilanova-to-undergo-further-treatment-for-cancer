Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova will
return to  New York  in two days to undergo further treatment for
cancer, the Spanish soccer champion said on its website.  Vilanova, 44, was to have “pioneering treatment” this
summer but it’s being moved up since Barcelona has won the
Primera Liga title with three games remaining, the club said.  Vilanova has had surgery for throat cancer twice since
November 2011. He spent two months in New York earlier this year
receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment and will now
be away from the club for five days, Barcelona said.  Barcelona, which claimed its fourth league title in five
seasons last weekend, hosts Valladolid tomorrow before
completing its campaign against Espanyol and Malaga.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
