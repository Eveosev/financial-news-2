French President Francois Hollande
today signed a law authorizing gay marriage and adoption by
same-sex couples, his office said.  The law “will provide new rights for some without taking
away any from others,” Hollande said in a video message posted
yesterday on the website of Elysee Palace, the presidential
residence. The president won’t comment further on the matter,
his office said today.  While public opinion favors gay marriage, the French by a
small majority oppose same-sex adoption, polls show.  France ’s
constitutional court yesterday approved the law, rejecting a
motion brought by opposition members of parliament.  Hollande last month asked for calm after lawmakers voted in
favor of the law, saying the focus must turn to repairing the
economy. France is suffering from its worst economic contraction
since 2009, forcing the president to abandon his 2013 deficit
target. Joblessness has surged to a 15-year high as PSA Peugeot-Citroen SA and other manufacturers eliminate tens of thousands
of jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
