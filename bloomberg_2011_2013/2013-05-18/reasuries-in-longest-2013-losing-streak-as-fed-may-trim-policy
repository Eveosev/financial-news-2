Treasuries fell in the longest losing
streak this year as the economy showed more signs of strength,
prompting speculation the  Federal Reserve  may start to slow the
pace of its monetary stimulus.  Benchmark 10-year yields  reached  a two-month high as a
measure of  consumer confidence  in May reached an almost six-year
high, while the pace of consumer prices remained below the
central bank’s 2 percent target. Fed Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said May 16 that the central bank may
begin to slow bond purchases as early as this summer. The
 difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity
inflation-indexed debt shrank to the lowest level since August
before a $13 billion sale of Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities on May 23.  “We keep on getting this modestly better data,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in
 New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade directly with the
Fed. “The continued talk of tapering by Fed speakers is
weighing on the market.”  U.S. 10-year yields rose five basis points this week, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.95 percent, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.75 percent note due in May
2023 fell 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 6/32.  Ten-year yields have risen for three consecutive weeks,
from 1.66 percent on April 26, in the longest stretch of
increases since December. The yield reached 1.98 percent on May
15, the highest since March 15.  Futures Positions  Investors reversed to a net-short position from a net-long
position in 10-year note futures in the week ended May 14, the
first time in a net-short position since March 22, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 11,153 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Last week, traders were net-long 37,956
contracts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks climbed 2.1
percent to a record 1,667.47.  “Stocks are hitting new highs because they believe the
economy is getting better,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice
president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in
New York. “It’s diverting money out of the Treasury market.”  Inflation Measure  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity inflation-indexed debt shrank to 2.23 percentage
points, the lowest level since August, indicating reduced
concern about rising prices.  TIPS handed investors a loss of 1.9 percent in May through
May 16, already making this month the worst since December 2009,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Treasuries
overall have declined 0.7 percent.  The  consumer price index  decreased 0.4 percent, the biggest
decline since December 2008, after falling 0.2 percent in March,
the Labor Department said May 16. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected a 0.3 percent drop, according to the median
estimate.  Fed Bank of Boston President  Eric Rosengren  said inflation
that has “persistently” stayed below the Fed’s goal is a
concern and may suggest policy hasn’t done enough to support
growth.  Fed View  “The longer we in the U.S. remain so far below our 2
percent target, the greater the risk that inflation expectations
could fall and real  interest rates  rise,” Rosengren said in
prepared remarks delivered in Milan May 16.  The central bank said after a policy meeting on May 1 it
will maintain stimulus as long as the outlook for inflation
doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent and as unemployment remains above 6.5
percent.  “The Fed is going to continue its public debate about when
to taper, without actually tapering,” said Steven Ricchiuto,
chief economist in New York at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., a
primary dealer.  Issuance of Treasury notes, bonds and TIPS may plunge if
the  Congressional Budget Office ’s estimate of smaller federal
deficits proves accurate, wrote  Michael Schumacher , head of
global rates strategy at UBS AG, a primary dealer, in a report
dated May 16. Net issuance totaled $667 billion between Oct. 1
and April 30, exceeding the CBO’s predicted budget deficit with
five months remaining in the fiscal year, he wrote.  Fiscal Position  A report May 14 showed the  U.S. budget deficit  will shrink
this fiscal year to $642 billion, the smallest shortfall in five
years, according to the nonpartisan CBO. The agency reduced its
estimate of the likely deficit, citing stronger-than-expected
tax receipts. In February, it had projected a $845 billion
deficit for the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Last
year’s deficit was $1.1 trillion.  Net issuance was $364 billion in the first four months of
calendar 2013, suggesting that Treasury needs another $176
billion of net issuance this year, the UBS strategist said,
noting that amounts to a 21 percent decrease in gross issuance.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment rose to 83.7 in May, the highest
since July 2007, from 76.4 the prior month, a report yesterday
showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a gain
to 77.9.  Existing home sale increased 1.2 percent in April after a
0.6 percent decline the previous month, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before a May
22 report from the National Association of Realtors. The Fed
will release minutes of the April 30 to May 1 policy makers
meeting on the same day.  The direction of yields “is going to be dependent on the
Fed speak,” said Elaine Stokes, a  money manager  who helps
oversee the $23.5 billion, Boston-based Loomis Sayles Bond Fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
