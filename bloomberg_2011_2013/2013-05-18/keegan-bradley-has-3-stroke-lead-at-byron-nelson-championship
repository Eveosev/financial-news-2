Keegan Bradley shot a 1-under-par 69
to hold a three-stroke lead going into the third round of the
PGA Tour’s Byron Nelson Championship.  Bradley, who won the tournament in 2011, finished 36 holes
at 11-under par 129 yesterday at the TPC Four Seasons Resort in
Irving,  Texas . He fired an opening-round record 10-under par 60.  “I’m almost more proud of this round than yesterday
because I didn’t feel comfortable all day,” Keegan told
reporters yesterday. “I don’t know what it was. I was a little
uncomfortable and then I settled in and hit some really good
shots.”  Tom Gillis hit a 7-under 63 to share second place at 8-under 132 with  South Korea ’s Sang-Moon Bae, who had a 4-under 66.
A stroke back were 2012 PGA Tour rookie of the year John Huh,
 Ryan Palmer  and 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel.  Eighty-three players made the cut yesterday at even-par 140.
An additional cut to the top 70 and ties will follow today’s
third round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
