New England Patriots tight end  Rob Gronkowski  may need back surgery, ESPN reported, citing a person
familiar with the situation.  Gronkowski has a disk injury from last season that may need
to be repaired, the sports network said.  Gronkowski, 24, already is facing a fourth surgery on his
forearm that was originally broken Nov. 18 in the Patriotsâ€™ game
against the Indianapolis Colts and then re-fractured in the
American Football Conference divisional round against the
Houston Texans on Jan. 13.  The surgery to replace the plate in his forearm is expected
to require 10 weeks of recuperation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
