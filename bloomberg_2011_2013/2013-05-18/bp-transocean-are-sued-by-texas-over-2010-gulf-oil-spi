Texas  sued  BP Plc (BP/) , Transocean Ltd.
and others involved in the 2010  oil spill , calling it the
“worst environmental disaster” in U.S. history and becoming
the fifth  Gulf of Mexico  state to file claims.  The state accused the companies of violating Texas
environmental laws, and is seeking damages for economic loss,
including lost tax revenue, as well as for harm to natural
resources. Texas asked for civil penalties for every day of oil
discharge and every barrel that was dumped into the gulf.  The companies “engaged in willful and wanton misconduct,”
causing the disaster, state Attorney General  Greg Abbott  said in
a 43-page complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
Beaumont. As a result of the spill, natural resources “have
been injured, destroyed or lost,” according to the complaint.  In a separate proceeding, a judge in New Orleans postponed
to December the trial of a former BP engineer charged in the
first criminal case arising from the 2010 spill to December. It
had been scheduled to start June 10.  The U.S. charged Kurt Mix, the former BP engineer, with two
counts of obstruction of justice last year, alleging he deleted
from his mobile phone text-message strings related to the
company’s effort to estimate the size of the spill. The trial
had previously been postponed from February.  Transocean, Halliburton  The Texas lawsuit names as defendants London-based BP,
owner of the doomed Macondo well that blew out in the Gulf;
Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that
exploded and sank; and  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , which provided cementing
services for the project. Texas also sued  Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC) , which held a 25 percent share of the well.  Texas is the fifth state along the Gulf of Mexico to file a
lawsuit over the spill against BP and the other companies.
 Louisiana  and  Alabama  sued in 2010, and Mississippi and  Florida 
filed last month.  The Texas lawsuit “preserves the state’s interest in
collecting environmental resource and economic damages,”  Tom Kelley , a spokesman for the attorney general, said in an e-mail.
“A jury verdict or final settlement would determine the level
of appropriate damages.”  The companies involved in the spill are liable for the full
cost of restoring harmed natural resources, or “in the
alternative,” should pay as much as $350 million in natural
resources damages, as calculated under the state’s natural
resources code, Texas said in the complaint.  Lost Taxes  Texas is also seeking pollution fines of as much as $25,000
a day under each of two separate state statutes, which could add
as much as $4.2 million in fines. Texas presented the state’s
claims for lost tax revenues to BP’s “government claims web
site” last month and its claims for lost state-park revenue May
16, according to the lawyers.  Scott Dean , a BP spokesman, declined to comment on the
suit. Lou Colasuonno, Transocean’s spokesman,  didn’t
immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages yesterday
seeking comment on it.  “We continue to believe that we have substantial legal
arguments and defenses against an liability in the Macondo
incident and that BP’s indemnity obligation protects
us,” Beverly Stafford, Halliburton’s spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “Accordingly we will maintain our approach of taking all
proper actions to protect our interests.  Settlement Terms  John Christiansen , Anadarko’s spokesman, declined yesterday
to comment on the litigation. In regulatory filings this year,
Anadarko stated the company’s settlement agreement with BP
indemnifies it against all spill-related expenses except for
potential fines under the U.S. Clean Water Act, which aren’t
sought by Texas in this action.  The blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed
11 workers and set off the largest offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The accident sparked hundreds of lawsuits against well
owner BP; Vernier, Switzerland-based Transocean; and Houston-based Halliburton.  A nonjury trial on fault for the incident ended last month
in federal court in New Orleans. U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier , who is overseeing the blowout litigation, has said he
may not issue a judgment on fault and gross negligence before a
second phase of the trial set for Sept. 16. That phase will
concern the size of the spill and the efforts to contain it.  Regional Tourism  While the Texas coastline largely escaped physical oiling
during the 2010 spill, regional tourism and seafood businesses
were affected, which had a ripple effect on the state’s income
from taxes and coastal usage fees, according to the complaint.  Tourists avoided the shore, seafood restaurants were forced
to import supplies, and traditional fishing waters were closed
by the threat of pollution, lawyers for the state said in the
complaint. State officials claim they remain concerned about
recontamination from oil and chemical dispersants that linger in
the ecosystem.  ‘‘The full extent of potential injuries, destruction, loss
and loss of services is not yet fully known and may not be fully
known for many years, because of ongoing assessment work,
including monitoring and long-term study analysis,” Texas
lawyers said in the filing.  “Additionally, as sunken and dispersed oil resurfaces,
additional harm to marine ecosystems will occur and continue,”
the lawyers said.  The sinking of the Deepwater Horizon and its aftermath also
set off a criminal investigation by the  U.S. Department of
Justice . Mix’s prosecution was the first criminal case to arise
from the 2010 spill.  Text Messages  Mix worked on BP efforts to estimate the amount of oil
leaking from the Macondo well. The two counts of the indictment
concern  text messages  between him and a contractor and another
string with his supervisor.  Since his arrest in April 2012, BP and  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  have
pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the spill. In addition,
two BP well-site managers were charged with involuntary
manslaughter and the company’s former vice president of
exploration for the Gulf of Mexico was charged with obstruction
of Congress and false statements related to the size of the
spill. All three have pleaded not guilty.  The delay in Mix’s trial comes after defense attorneys
complained that federal prosecutors failed to turn over evidence
requested that might exonerate him. Duval ordered the government
at a hearing May 14 to provide the defense with additional
evidence. Mix’s lawyers said they needed to postpone the trial
to search through this material, according to the docket.  The U.S. didn’t oppose the postponement.  The new case is State of Texas v. BP Exploration &
Production Inc., 13-cv-00315, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Texas (Beaumont). The criminal case is U.S. v. Mix,
12-cr-00171, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
( New Orleans ).  Lawsuits overseen by Barbier are consolidated with In re
Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico
on April 20, 2010, 10-md-02179, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Louisiana (New Orleans).  To contact the reporter on this story:
