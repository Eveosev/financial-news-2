Half-centuries from Joe Root and
Jonathan Trott helped England to a 205-run lead over New Zealand
in the opening cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Root scored 71 and Trott made 56 as England reached 180-6
at stumps on day three. The two teamed for 123 runs before
England suffered a late collapse of four wickets for 12 runs.  Earlier,  James Anderson  took 5-47 and  Steven Finn  was 4-63
as New Zealand was bowled out for 207 in response to the host’s
first-innings total of 232. The visitors lost their last six
wickets for 52 after starting the day 153-4.  New Zealand is trying to win its first Test series in
England since 1999. The two-match series concludes at Leeds
beginning May 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
