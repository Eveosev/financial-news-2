Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
gained the most in more than four months, led by real estate
developers and petrochemical companies.  Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co. (ALARKAN)  gained the most in
more than 10 months, while  Jabal Omar Development Co. (JOMAR)  rose to
the highest since December 2007.   Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) ,
the world’s largest petrochemical maker, also known as Sabic,
increased to the highest in more than a month.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 1.1 percent to 7,229.02
by the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh , the most since Jan. 2,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia’s bourse
is the only one in the  Persian Gulf  that trades on Saturdays.  Today’s increase follows a slide which occurred after
“profit-taking that occurred specifically in the last three
trading sessions,”  Turki Fadaak, head of research and
consultancy at Albilad Investment Co., said in an e-mailed note.  Dar Al Arkan climbed 9.6 percent to 9.15 riyals, and Jabal
Omar rose 5.6 percent to 28.4 riyals. Sabic increased 0.8
percent to 92 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
