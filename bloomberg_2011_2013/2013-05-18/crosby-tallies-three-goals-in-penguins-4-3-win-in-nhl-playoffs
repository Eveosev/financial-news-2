All-Star center Sidney Crosby scored
three goals to lead the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins to a 4-3
victory over the Ottawa Senators in the second game of their
National Hockey League playoff series.  The Penguins have won the first two games in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals. The winner will play the
 New York  Rangers or Boston Bruins in the conference final.  Tonight, the Chicago Blackhawks will try to expand their
series lead to 2-0 against the Detroit Red Wings, while the Los
Angeles Kings will seek a third straight victory over the San
Jose Sharks.  Crosby scored three minutes, 16 seconds into the first
period and again 13 minutes later at Consol Energy Center in
Pittsburgh. He added his third goal just over one minute into
the second period, with Brenden Morrow capping the Penguins
scoring midway through the period.  Crosby made his postseason debut on May 3 after missing 13
games with a broken jaw. He was injured during a March 30 game
and didnâ€™t return to team practices until April 26. At the time
of the injury, he led the NHL with 56 points, with 15 goals and
a league-best 41 assists in 36 games.  Kyle Turris, Colin Greening and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored
for the Senators.  The series moves to Ottawa for Game 3 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
