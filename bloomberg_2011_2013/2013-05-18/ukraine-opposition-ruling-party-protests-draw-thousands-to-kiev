Thousands of Ukrainians took to the
streets of the capital today as the opposition demanded the
release of jailed ex-Premier Yulia Tymoshenko, and the ruling
party organized a rival demonstration.  The opposition said that around 50,000 people came to
Sofiivska square in downtown Kiev, while police estimated around
6,500 people attended the rally as of 12:30 p.m., according to a
statement on the  Interior Ministry ’s website.  President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s Party of Regions said that
over 50,000 people attended its demonstration against attempts
by “political extremists to revive an ideology of national
enmity, racial and religion intolerance.”  Tymoshenko was convicted in October 2011 for abusing her
powers when as prime minister she signed a 10-year natural gas
agreement with  Russia  in 2009. Yanukovych, who won the
presidential election over Tymoshenko in 2010, said the deal
cost Ukraine $6 billion a year.  Ukraine’s association agreement with the European Union,
planned for 2011, has been delayed by the imprisonment of
Tymoshenko, which the EU called an act of selective justice.  For Related News and Information:
