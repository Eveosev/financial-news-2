Top-seeded  Syracuse University  topped
Yale University 7-6 and  Cornell University  beat third-seeded
Ohio State University 16-6 to reach the semifinals of the men’s
national college lacrosse tournament.  In today’s quarterfinals, second-seeded Notre Dame meets No.
7 Duke and fourth-seeded Denver plays No. 5 North Carolina. The
semifinals are May 25 with the championship game set for two
days later at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.  Syracuse’s Luke Cometti and Derek Maltz each scored two
goals to spur the team’s advance to the semifinals against North
Carolina or Denver.  Brandon Mangan had three goals for Yale while Conrad
Oberbeck added two at College Park, Maryland.  Cornell’s Steve Mock scored seven goals, setting a school
record for a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
game. It’s the second straight upset by the Big Red, who
eliminated No. 6 Maryland last week.  Cornell advances to meet  Notre Dame  or Duke.  Jesse King scored two goals for Ohio State, which ends its
season with a 13-4 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
