The  San Diego Chargers  agreed to a
two-year contract with free-agent defensive end Dwight Freeney,
the National Football League team said on its website.  Freeney, 33, played the past 11 seasons with the
Indianapolis Colts, who declined to offer him a contract in
February. The seven-time Pro Bowl selection recorded 10 or more
sacks seven times and led the NFL with 16 sacks in 2004.  “It’s great to add a solid veteran who brings valuable
experience to our defense,” Chargers coach Mike McCoy said.
“His proven pass-rush ability is a perfect fit for our
defense.”  Freeney set a Colts record with 107.5 sacks in 163 games.
He played on seven division champions, two conference champions
and the Colts’ 2006 team which beat Chicago 29-17 in the  Super
Bowl .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
