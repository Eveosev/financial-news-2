Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  pledged
to cut taxes in  Spain  before the next election, due in 2015, as
he forecast a return to growth for the euro area’s fourth-largest economy.  “I’m not satisfied in any way with the results we’ve
achieved,” Rajoy told a meeting of party officials in
Salamanca, Spain, today. “In this legislature we’ll cut taxes.
In this legislature there will be economic growth and  job
creation .”  The premier is battling to sustain the morale of his
People’s Party, which has been battered in opinion polls and
suffered internal strains over the allocation of spending cuts.
The economy is in the sixth year of a slump and unemployment
won’t fall below 25 percent until 2016, according to government
forecasts.  “We have set our course,” Rajoy said. “Until there is
growth and we start to create jobs, we can’t stop.”  Support for the  People’s Party  declined in May to 22.5
percent from 24.5 percent a month earlier with the Socialists,
the largest opposition party, at 20.2 percent, according to a
Metroscopia poll for El Pais newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
