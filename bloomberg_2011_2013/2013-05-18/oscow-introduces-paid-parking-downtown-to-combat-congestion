Moscow,  Europe ’s largest city, is
introducing paid parking downtown to combat one of the world’s
worst congestion levels.  From June 1, drivers will have to pay 50 rubles ($1.60) an
hour to park their cars inside the limits of the Boulevard Ring
in Moscow, according to a statement posted on the website of the
mayor’s office.  A pilot plan introduced last November succeeded in reducing
average parking times in the areas concerned by 60 percent to
one hour and 20 minutes, said Deputy Mayor Maxim Liksutov.  Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  has vowed to focus on easing
transportation and uprooting corruption after taking over in
2010 from Yury Luzhkov, who had governed the city of 11.5
million for 18 years.  Air pollution from traffic is a serious problem. More than
45 percent of drivers in the capital reported getting stuck in
traffic jams exceeding three hours, or almost 2.5 times the
average for the 20 cities examined in IBM’s latest  Commuter Pain
Survey  released in September 2011. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  said that year that traffic is the
biggest obstacle to Moscow’s ambitions to be a global financial
center.  Parking fees can be paid through text message, mobile apps
or through parking meters,  City Hall  said. Residents can apply
for annual parking permits that cost 3,000 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
