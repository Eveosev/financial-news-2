Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell
beat defending champion Nicolas Colsaerts of  Belgium  in the
quarterfinals of golf’s World Match Play Championship.  McDowell won 2-and-1, meaning he had an unassailable two-hole lead with one to play, at Thracian Cliffs Golf and Beach
Resort in Kavarna,  Bulgaria . Colsaerts beat McDowell in last
year’s final.  McDowell will meet South African Branden Grace, who beat
England’s Chris Wood 2-and-1, in one semifinal tomorrow. South
African Thomas Aiken, who beat Francesco Molinari of Italy 3-and-2, plays Thailand’s Thongchai Jaidee, a 4-and-3 winner over
Scotland’s Scott Jamieson, in the other, with the final also
played tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
