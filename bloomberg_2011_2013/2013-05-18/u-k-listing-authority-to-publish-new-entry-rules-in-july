The U.K. Listing Authority will
publish new rules in July for companies seeking a share offering
or that already list securities in the country, Financial
Services Authority spokesman  Chris Hamilton  said.  The move follows a public  consultation  period on proposed
changes to the rules that began in October, Hamilton said today
by telephone.  The UKLA will insist on independent directors forming a
majority on the boards of companies with a controlling
shareholder, and plans to introduce a new dual voting procedure,
the Financial Times reported earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
