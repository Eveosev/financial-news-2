Toulon defeated Clermont Auvergne
16-15 in the all-French final of rugby’s Heineken Cup.  Jonny Wilkinson converted Delon Armitage’s 64th-minute try
to give Toulon the lead for good at Aviva Stadium in Dublin.
Wilkinson also booted three penalties as Toulon won Europe’s top
club competition for the first time.  Napolioni Nalaga and Brock James touched down for Clermont,
which was trying to become the first team to win all nine of its
games in a Heineken Cup season. Clermont had a chance to take
the lead in the final two minutes, but David Skrela’s drop-goal
attempt was blocked.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
