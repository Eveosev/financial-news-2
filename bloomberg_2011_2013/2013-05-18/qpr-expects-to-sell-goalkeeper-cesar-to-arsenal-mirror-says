Queens Park Rangers expects to sell
goalkeeper Julio Cesar to Arsenal, the  Daily Mirror  said.  Cesar, whose agents spoke to Arsenal last year before he
joined QPR from  Inter Milan , has been told he can leave the
relegated west London club, the Mirror said. AC Milan is also
interested in taking him back to Italy, the newspaper said.  QPR will let the 33-year-old Brazil international leave
cheaply so it can get his 70,000 pounds-per-week contract off
its books and the club is convinced Arsenal is his final
destination, the Mirror said. Hamburg’s Rene Adler, Stuttgart’s
Sven Ulreich and Stoke’s Asmir Begovic are also on the Gunners’
list of goalkeeping candidates, the Mirror said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
