New Zealand’s rising house prices
will increase the pressure on the central bank to raise interest
rates, Finance Minister Bill English said.  “These households heading into quite high debt to buy
highly priced houses need to be aware at some stage the RBNZ
will increase interest rates, particularly if the housing market
keeps growing at rapid rates,” English said in an interview
broadcast on Television New Zealand’s Q&A today.  Low interest rates have helped fuel demand for property,
raising prices at the fastest pace since 2007 and prompting the
central bank to signal its concern about the risks if the
housing bubble bursts. Central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler is
reluctant to increase the official cash rate from a record 2.5
percent because it may boost demand for the currency.  “I’m just stating the fact that interest rates are likely
to rise at some stage,” said English. Home-loan interest rates
are at 50-year lows and borrowers “don’t want to believe that’s
permanent,” he said.  The government doesn’t want borrowing costs to go as high
as they did in the previous housing boom in 2006-07 when the
cash rate climbed to as much as 8.25 percent, English said. Last
week it agreed with the central bank on new tools to potentially
curb lending, and also announced plans to increase the supply of
housing to ease pressure on prices.  “Rather than rely on the interest rate tool, which is what
was used last time around, we’ve spent the last two or three
years working out what the tool kit is that we need to beat the
housing cycle,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
