European Union President Herman  Van Rompuy  said overcoming youth unemployment is “the utmost
priority today” and may be tackled by the 27-nation bloc’s
leaders later this year.  “We stand ready to support all new ideas, to accompany
every country in its own efforts,” Van Rompuy said, according
to the text of a  May 17 speech  to the Federation of Young
European Greens that was published on the EU’s website today.
“Every one must be mobilized: national governments, local
authorities, companies big and small, social partners, and the
European institutions too.”  Van Rompuy said he hoped the social partners, which include
labor unions and employer groups, can agree on a “job plan”
before a June leaders summit. He said the EU has made progress
overhauling its economy during the financial crisis and has more
work to do.  “We are not yet out of the woods, far from it,” Van
Rompuy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
