Juventus out-earned European Cup
winner Bayern Munich in last season’s Champions League because
of the Italian soccer team’s income from broadcasters.  Juventus was the top-earner in Europe’s elite club
competition, getting 65.3 million euros ($86.3 million). That
included 44.8 million from the television market pool, the most
for any team, according to figures released yesterday by
tournament organizer UEFA, the region’s soccer governing body.  Bayern, which beat fellow German club Borussia Dortmund 2-1
in May’s final, got 55.05 million euros. That was made up of
35.9 million euros in fees for matches and performance bonuses
and 19.15 million euros as television income, UEFA said.
Dortmund received a total of 54.2 million euros.  Chelsea was  England ’s top earner from its European
campaign, even though the west London team failed to advance
from the group stage of the Champions League, which it won in
2012. The Blues received 30.8 million euros from the elite
competition, and then 10.7 million euros for winning the second-tier Europa League.  Manchester United (MANU)  made 35.6 million euros from Champions
League participation, while Arsenal, which also made it out of
the group stage, received 31.4 million euros.  AC Milan got 51.4 million euros, Real  Madrid  earned 48.4
million and Barcelona received 45.5 million euros from the
Champions League.  Clubs made 8.6 million euros for reaching the 32-team group
stage. They could then earn 1 million euros for each win and
500,000 euros for each draw. Teams got 3.5 million euros for
reaching the round of 16, and then more for advancing each stage
until the final, where Bayern took the 10.5 million-euros
winner’s payment.  UEFA said it distributed a total of 904.6 million euros to
teams competing in the Champions League and television money was
divided among the participants based on their national broadcast
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
