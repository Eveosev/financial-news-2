Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia â€™s third-biggest iron ore producer, said fourth-quarter
shipments rose 39 percent, missing analyst estimates.  Shipments were 23.9 million metric tons in the three months
ended June 30, compared with 17.1 million tons a year earlier,
Perth-based Fortescue said today in a statement. That compares
with the median estimate of 24.6 million tons of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fortescue, which sold $5 billion in loans to cut debt after
prices fell last year, is aiming to boost capacity to 155
million tons by 2013. The company started talks in December for
the sale of its port and railroad assets, which could raise an
estimated $3 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Talks are continuing for a sale of a minority stake in the
port and rail unit, Fortescue said in the statement. The company
plans to use cash from a sale to  repay debt .  Fortescue rose 0.3 percent to A$3.69 at 11:54 a.m. in
Sydney. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
