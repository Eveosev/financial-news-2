Ford Motor Co. (F)  said it will hire
3,000 salaried employees this year, 800 more than originally
planned, as it moves to fill positions in engineering and other
technical areas.  Of the new hires, 2,400 will be professionals for product
development, manufacturing, quality, purchasing and  information
technology , according to an e-mailed statement.  “Engineers and technical professionals are in as much
demand as our cars, trucks and SUVs,” Felicia Fields, group
vice president for human resources, said in the statement. About
half of the positions have been filled already, according to the
statement.  Ford is expanding as industrywide U.S. new-vehicle sales
have increased for 25 consecutive months, according to Bloomberg
Industries. The second-largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales
has been the biggest gainer of market share in 2013’s first half
on strong demand for the Fusion family car and F-Series pickups.  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  has led Ford to 16
consecutive  quarters of net income  after supervising a
restructuring without the bankruptcies that befell the
predecessors of  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group LLC.
Mulally, 67, has boosted profits by selling the same models
worldwide, rather than different versions for various regions.  Ford fell 0.6 percent to $16.94 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 31 percent this year, compared with a 19
percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
