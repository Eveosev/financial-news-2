U.S. stocks and Treasuries fell as
housing and manufacturing data fueled speculation the Federal
Reserve may reduce its asset-buying this year as investors
weighed earnings reports from  Apple (AAPL)  Inc. to Caterpillar Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to
1,685.94 at 4 p.m. in New York, after climbing to within 3
points of 1,700 for a third straight day. The yield on 10-year
Treasuries jumped eight basis points to 2.59 percent. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index rallied 0.6 percent to an almost eight-week
high. The Bloomberg Dollar Index climbed 0.5 percent for its
first advance in four days, and the euro gained against most of
its 16 major peers. Oil tumbled 1.7 percent and gold lost 1.1
percent.  New U.S. home sales rose more than forecast in June to the
highest level in five years. Manufacturing indexes based on
surveys of purchasing managers rose in the U.S. and  Germany  this
month, London-based Markit Economics said today, while
preliminary data showed  China ’s manufacturing contracted more
than economists estimated.  “What I am looking at is an extended market that has
basically gone parabolic straight up,” Tim Hartzell, founder
and chief investment officer of Sequent Asset Management who
helps oversee $425 million in Houston, said in a telephone
interview. “It is all predicated on the Fed continuing to pump
money into the system. When the punchbowl gets taken away,
there’s the old cliché that the party will be over. With the
market at the highs, it is probably pretty easy to trim things
here and take profits.”  Equities and bonds retreated amid speculation the Fed may
reduce its purchases of government securities this year, and
extended declines after a notes auction. The central bank will
start trimming its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases in
September, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg
News. The Fed has said economic data will determine the timing
and pace of any reduction in monthly asset purchases.  Home Sales  U.S. new-home sales climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized
pace of 497,000 homes, the highest level since May 2008, the
Commerce Department said in  Washington  today. The median
estimate of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
gain to 484,000.  The Markit Economics preliminary index of U.S.
manufacturing increased to 53.2 in July from a final reading of
51.9 a month earlier, the London-based group said today. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists called
for a gain to 52.6. A reading greater than 50 indicates
expansion.  Bull Market  Support from central banks and better-than-estimated
corporate earnings have driven the  S&P 500 (SPX)  up as much as 151
percent from its March 2009 low. The rally has pushed  valuations 
close to the highest level since May 2010, with the S&P 500
trading at 16.3 times reported earnings, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  When the S&P 500 rose to a record close on July 22, the
gauge had gained for 12 of the previous 13 trading days, a
stretch that hasn’t happened since September 1995, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The 14-day  relative-strength index  for 83 S&P
500 stocks exceeded 70 that day, the most since May 21,
Bloomberg data show. RSI measures the degree to which gains and
losses outpace each other, and some analysts who watch charts to
predict market moves consider a reading over 70 as an indication
the stock has risen too far, too fast.  ‘Big Run’  “The market has had a big run and we are a bit overbought
here,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at RW Baird &
Co., said in a telephone interview from Sarasota,  Florida . His
firm oversees $100 billion. “There is a lot of optimism coming
into the market short term, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we
rested in here for a while.”  Of the 178 companies in the benchmark gauge that have
posted  quarterly results  so far, 71 percent have exceeded
analysts’ profit estimates and 57 percent have topped sales
projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Caterpillar slipped 2.4 percent, the most in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU) , after cutting its earnings forecast.
Broadcom Corp. sank 15 percent, for the biggest decline in the
S&P 500, after predicting revenue that trailed estimates. Apple
advanced 5.1 percent, it’s largest rally since November, after
revenue and sales topped forecasts. Ford Motor Co. added 2.5
percent after raising its full-year profit target.  All 10 main industries in the S&P 500 fell except for
 technology companies , which added 0.9 percent. Utility and
commodity shares lost the most, retreating at least 0.9 percent.  Facebook Inc. surged 20 percent after the markets closed as
the company reported earnings that beat estimates. Baidu Inc.,
the owner of China’s largest Internet search engine, jumped 12
percent in late trading after profit topped forecasts as
increasing use of smartphones attracted advertisers.  Notes Auction  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, jumped 4.1 percent today to 13.18. The equity volatility
gauge, which moves in the opposite direction as the S&P 500
about 80 percent of the time, reached a six-month high in June
and has since fallen 36 percent.  Treasuries extended their drop after the U.S. sale of $35
billion in  five-year notes  was met with weaker-than-average
demand. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.46,
compared with 2.45 at the June sale, the least since September
2009, and an average of 2.8 for the past 10 sales.  The yield on the current five-year note rose seven basis
points to 1.38 percent.  European stocks rose to the highest level since May 30 as a
report signaled Germany is leading a revival in euro-area
manufacturing. Preliminary data showed euro-area manufacturing
expanded this month for the first time since July 2011, with a
purchasing managers’ gauge increasing to 50.1 from 48.8 in June,
Markit Economics said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
predicted 49.1.  Volvo Rises  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  gained 5 percent as the world’s second-largest
truckmaker reported earnings that beat estimates. EasyJet Plc
jumped 3.7 percent after the budget airline’s quarterly sales
rose 11 percent. The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx
600 companies was 14 percent less than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks fell for the first time in three days in Shanghai.
China’s manufacturing weakened by more than estimated in July,
according to a preliminary survey. The reading of 47.7 for the
Purchasing Managers’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics compares with the 48.2 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 19 economists.  “The bad PMI data is proving that the economy is declining
further and there are worries that company profits may retreat
too,” said Zhang Haidong, an analyst at Tebon Securities Co. in
 Shanghai . “It seems the government is persistent in not
changing its monetary policy and this will drag the market
lower.”  Dollar, Euro  The euro gained 0.7 percent versus the yen and slipped 0.2
percent to $1.3202. The dollar rose 0.9 percent to 100.30 yen
and  Australia ’s currency slid 1.4 percent to 91.67 U.S. cents.
The yen weakened against 10 of its 16 major peers.  Germany’s 10-year bunds declined, pushing the yield 10
basis points higher to 1.65 percent. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds was little changed at 4.37 percent and the rate on
similar-maturity Spanish debt fell one basis point to 4.68
percent.  Oil tumbled 1.7 percent, the most in more than a month, to
$105.39 a barrel amid the China manufacturing data and a report
showing U.S. output surged to a 22-year high last week. The
Energy Information Administration said  crude production  rose 0.9
percent to 7.56 million barrels a day, the most since December
1990. Crude and fuel supplies declined, the report showed.  Gold declined the most in two weeks as home sales added to
signs the Fed may scale back financial stimulus measures.
Futures for December delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $1,320.30
an ounce on the Comex in New York. Gold has slumped 21 percent
this year.  Copper slipped 0.6 percent in New York, snapping the
longest rally in nine months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
