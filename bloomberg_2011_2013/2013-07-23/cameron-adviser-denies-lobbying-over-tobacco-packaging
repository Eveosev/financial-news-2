Lynton Crosby, the Australian
lobbyist employed by U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  as a
Conservative Party campaign strategist, denied lobbying the
government over cigarette labeling.  Cameron’s government ditched plans to force  tobacco
companies  to sell cigarettes in plain packages on July 12, and
opposition  Labour Party  lawmakers asked if Crosby, the co-founder of lobbying firm CTF Partners, had influenced the move.  “At no time have I had any conversation or discussion with
or lobbied the prime minister, or indeed the health secretary or
the health minister, on plain packaging or tobacco issues,”
Crosby said in a statement released through the Press
Association newswire today. “Indeed, any claim that I have
sought to improperly use my position as part-time campaign
adviser to the  Conservative Party  is simply false.”  Cameron has been asked repeatedly by opposition lawmakers
and by reporters if he spoke to Crosby about plain cigarette
packaging and has always replied with the formula that he has
“never been lobbied” by Crosby, without saying if they had
ever talked about the issue.  Labour has also asked questions about Crosby’s input into
government decisions on fracking, the overhaul of the National
Health Service reform and the decision to drop plans to impose
minimum pricing for alcohol. Crosby did not specifically address
any of those issues in his statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
