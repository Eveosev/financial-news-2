Asian stocks  rose , extending a two-month high, after Premier  Li Keqiang  said  China ’s economic
growth won’t be less than 7 percent and as U.S. housing data
damped concerns the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
second-biggest lender by market value, jumped 4.9 percent in
Hong Kong. Samsung Electronics Co., the largest maker of
smartphones, rose 2.7 percent in Seoul.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo
Metal Corp. (5401)  climbed 3.3 percent in  Tokyo  after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the No. 1 steelmaker by value agreed to a 10
percent price increase with Toyota Motor Corp.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.8 percent to 137.06
as of 9:28 p.m. in Hong Kong, with about four stocks rising for
each that fell. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  jumped 2 percent.
China’s “bottom line” for gross domestic product growth is 7
percent and the nation can’t let growth go below that, Beijing
News reported today, citing Premier Li’s comments at a recent
meeting with economists and business people.  Li’s statement “helped to reassure investors,”  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based head of Asia equity research at ABN Amro
Private Bank, which oversees about $207 billion, said by
telephone. “China could introduce some kind of fiscal stimulus
to help stabilize the economy. While there’s a likelihood the
Fed will start tapering monetary stimulus in September, we don’t
expect the Fed to start raising rates until the end of 2014. We
remain overweight on equities.”  China Rallies  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
traded in Hong Kong added 3.9 percent, its biggest gain since
Jan. 2. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained 2.3 percent, its
largest rally since July 11. The Shanghai Composite Index also

rose 0.3 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.6
percent, Taiwan’s  Taiex Index (TWSE)  gained 1.4 percent and  Singapore ’s
Straits Times Index increased 0.2 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent after the gauge rose 0.2 percent to a record in New York
yesterday. A decline in U.S. home sales eased concern the
Federal Reserve will start reducing stimulus within two months.
Sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly dropped 1.2
percent in June, data yesterday showed.  Federal Reserve  “The timing of the start of tapering might get pushed out
a bit,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has about $130
billion under management. “Tapering is less of a threat to the
market than many had feared a few months ago. By year-end, we’ll
be looking at indexes being quite a bit higher than they are at
the moment.”  Half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg say the
Federal Reserve will in September begin tapering its bond-buying
program that has supported bond and equity gains.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, advanced 5.2 percent this year through

Poor’s 500 Index and 13.5 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s Topix index surged 42 percent this year, the best-performing of 24 developed markets tracked by  Bloomberg News .  Abe Win  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
