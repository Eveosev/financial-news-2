MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
wireless operator, fell to the lowest level in almost four weeks
after Chief Financial Officer Nazir Patel quit, citing
undisclosed allegations against him.  MTN  dropped  2.8 percent to 175 rand by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, the lowest since June 26. Volume was about 1.2
times the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Patel resigned on July 21 and was replaced by Brett
Goschen, chief executive officer of the Nigerian business, amid
an investigation, Johannesburg-based MTN said in a statement
yesterday. Patel didn’t want his employment to prejudice the
company with respect to “certain” allegations made against
him, it said. MTN didn’t specify the nature of the probe.  “Change in management is never good for any operation,”
Alastair Jones, a London-based analyst at New Street Research
LLP, said in a phone interview. “Not only are you changing the
CFO of the group, you’re also changing the CEO of the biggest
operation within their business. That immediately raises
question marks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
