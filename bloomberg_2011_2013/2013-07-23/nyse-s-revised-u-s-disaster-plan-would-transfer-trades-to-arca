NYSE Euronext (NYX)  updated its plans for
opening its U.S. equity markets during emergencies, almost nine
months after  Hurricane Sandy  prompted the  New York  Stock
Exchange’s longest weather-related shutdown since the 1800s.  In the event of a disaster that prevents the humans who
normally run the New York Stock Exchange from reporting for
work, transactions would be shifted to the firm’s NYSE Arca
platform and coded as having taken place on that venue,
according to a  filing  yesterday.  The October storm shut American markets for two days. In
the months that followed, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission mandated more testing of disaster preparedness
programs. NYSE Euronext said this week’s revision was a response
to requests from clients who need to update their systems to
handle a shift away from the New York Stock Exchange, the
world’s biggest market by the value of listed companies.  “Our proposed plan will simplify customers’ ability to
trade” companies listed on the NYSE or NYSE MKT, a venue for
smaller companies,  Richard Adamonis , an NYSE Euronext spokesman,
wrote in an e-mail.  While the New York-based market operator has had a
contingency plan involving Arca since 2009, the old system
didn’t include the plan to report the transactions as having
taken place on that platform. The proposal requires SEC
approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
