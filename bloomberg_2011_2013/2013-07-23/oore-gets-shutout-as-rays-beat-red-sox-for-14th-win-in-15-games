Matt Moore  pitched his first career
shutout as the Tampa Bay Rays beat Boston 3-0 to pull within a
half-game of the American League Eastern Division-leading Red
Sox with their 14th win in 15 games.  Moore allowed two hits and won his sixth consecutive
decision last night to improve his record to 14-3 on the season,
tied for the most victories in Major League Baseball.  James Loney drove in two runs at Boston’s Fenway Park for
Tampa Bay, which is 59-41 overall. The Red Sox fell to 60-41.  Max Scherzer of the Detroit Tigers matched Moore with his
14th win, outpitching Chris Sale in a matchup of All-Star
starters in a 7-3 win over the  Chicago White Sox . Scherzer
(14-1) gave up two runs over eight innings.  Yu Darvish returned from the disabled list to pitch the
Texas Rangers to a 3-0 win over the  New York  Yankees. Darvish,
who had been out since July 6 with a strained side muscle,
combined with three relievers on a three-hitter.  The  Atlanta Braves  scored two runs in the top of the ninth
inning to rally for a 2-1 win against the New York Mets. With
two runners on base in the bottom of the ninth, Jason Heyward of
the Braves made a diving, game-ending catch of a line drive by
 Justin Turner  in the left-center field gap.  Tim Lincecum , making his first start since pitching a no-hitter July 13, allowed nine hits and eight runs over 3 2/3
innings last night in the San Francisco Giants’ 11-0 loss to the
Cincinnati Reds.  The Seattle Mariners’ winning streak reached seven games
with a 2-1 victory against the Cleveland Indians, as Kendrys Morales and Mike Zunino each hit a solo home run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
