Emile Griffith, the former
welterweight and middleweight boxing champion who killed a man
in a 1962 fight, has died. He was 75.  Griffith died today at the Nassau County Extended Care
Facility in Hempstead,  New York , the  International Boxing Hall
of Fame  said on its website. A cause of death wasn’t given.  Born Feb. 3, 1938, in the Virgin Islands, Griffith moved in
1957 to New York, where he won a Golden Gloves title at age 19.
He began his professional career the following year.  He captured the welterweight title three separate times
from 1961 to 1966. Moving up in weight class, he also held
middleweight titles twice from 1966 to 1968. In a 19-year career
he was 85-24-2, with one no-contest and 23 knockouts.  “Emile Griffith was a gifted athlete and a truly great
boxer,” Hall of Fame Executive Director Edward Brophy said on
the museum’s website. “Outside of the ring, he was as great a
gentleman as he was a fighter.”  The most famous bout of Griffith’s career came in March
1962, when he scored a 12th-round knockout over Benny Paret in a
nationally televised fight at Madison Square Garden. Paret, who
had taunted Griffith with homosexual slurs before the fight, was
battered in the final round, and died 10 days later from brain
injuries.  Griffith boxed 339 title-fight rounds in his career, more
than any other fighter in history, according to his Hall of Fame
 biography page . He suffered from dementia later in life, and
struggled to overcome Paret’s death, according to  Sports
Illustrated .  The Canastota, New York-based Hall of Fame will fly its
flags at half-staff in Griffith’s honor. Griffith was inducted
in 1990.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
