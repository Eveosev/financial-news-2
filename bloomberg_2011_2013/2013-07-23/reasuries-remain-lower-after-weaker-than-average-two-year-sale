Treasuries fell for the first time
in three days as an auction of U.S. two-year notes attracted
lower-than-average demand with the Federal Reserve likely moving
closer to winding down its asset-purchase program.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio on the $35 billion in notes, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 3.08, compared with an average of 3.54
for the past 10 sales. The Fed will start trimming its $85
billion in monthly  bond purchases  in September, according to a
survey of economists by  Bloomberg News  released today. The U.S.
will sell $35 billion in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion
in seven-year securities on July 25.  “The market is settling back into the fact that tapering
is going to occur,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in
 New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The market is
defining 2.50 percent on 10s as a level that kind of makes
sense.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.51 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2023 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to
93 15/32.  The current  two-year note  yield was little changed at 0.31
percent.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury  trading volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $246.7 billion,
up from $194 billion yesterday, the highest level since July 5.
The 2013 average is $318.8 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was at 74.05, up from
yesterday’s 72.62, the lowest level since May 24. The figure is
down from 117.89 on July 5, the highest since December 2010. The
one-year average is 64.8.  Today’s two-year note auction drew a yield of 0.336
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.338 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers.  Demand as measured by the ratio of bids to debt sold was
“lighter” than average, said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S.
rates sales at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “The five-year’s going to be a little more difficult just because the
five-year sector has rebounded off its lows.”  Bidder Participation  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 30.4 percent of the notes, compared
with 35.8 percent at the June sale, the highest since February
2012, and an average of 25.2 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.4 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with 7.8 percent last month and
an average of 23.9 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.3 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  “There’s a general feeling that QE tapering will be
happening in September, and it’s not a good scenario for the
 bond market ,” di Galoma of ED&F Man said.  Investors have bid $2.93 for each dollar of the $1.193
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction so
far this year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold
at last year’s offerings.  This week’s three note auctions, totaling $99 billion added
to the $15 billion of 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities sold last week, will raise $54.6 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $59.4 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  Net Longs  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  Treasuries investors raised bets the price of the
securities will gain in price, becoming the most bullish since
November, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The proportion of  net longs , or bets the securities will
rise, increased to 10 percentage points in the week ending
yesterday, from 8 percentage points the previous week. The
figure is the highest level of bullish bets since Nov. 12. The
percentage of outright longs rose to 23 percent from 21 percent.  An index measuring 10-day price  volatility  in Treasuries
dropped to 2.44 percent yesterday from 7.49 percent on July 8,
which was the highest since November 2011.  The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate Move Index
fell to 72.62 yesterday, the lowest level in almost two months.
The figure is down from 117.89 basis points on July 5, which was
the most since December 2010. The one-year average is 64.7.  Fed Expectations  None of the 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg from July
18-22 predicted the  Federal Open Market Committee  will begin
reducing its monthly purchases at its meeting scheduled for July
30-31.  In its first reduction, the FOMC will probably cut monthly
bond buying to $65 billion, according to the survey. Economists
see purchases divided between $35 billion in Treasuries and $30
billion in mortgage-backed securities.  The Fed has kept its target for overnight bank lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. It has said
it will consider raising the  target  when the  unemployment rate 
falls to 6.5 percent, versus 7.6 percent as of June.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told congressional panels last
week it was “way too early to make any judgment” about whether
the biggest buyer of Treasuries will start cutting back in
September.  Benchmark yields jumped 17 basis points June 19 after
Bernanke said the central bank may start dialing down its
unprecedented bond-buying program this year and end it entirely
in mid-2014 if the economy finally achieves sustainable growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
