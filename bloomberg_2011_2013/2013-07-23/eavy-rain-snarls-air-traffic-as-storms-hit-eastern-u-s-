Heavy rain swept through the eastern
U.S., delaying airline travel from New England to the  Great
Lakes , including New York.  New York City ’s LaGuardia Airport had delays of two hours
and 46 minutes at 3 p.m., according to the  Federal Aviation
Administration  website. Flights to Newark’s Liberty
International Airport were held up for 90 minutes and to
Boston’s Logan International for almost an hour.  Traffic into Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New
York’s John F. Kennedy International was also delayed.  “Individual showers or thunderstorms could produce 1 to 2
inches of rain in an hour or less,” the  National Weather
Service  said in a flash flood watch issued for New York City and
southern Connecticut. As much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) “is
possible where showers and thunderstorms repeatedly move over
the same areas.”  Flash flood watches and advisories were posted from  Maine 
to Delaware.  Around the U.S., 476 flights were canceled as of 3:36 p.m.
New York time, 168 of them into or out of LaGuardia, according
to  FlightAware , a Houston-based airline tracking service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
