A group of lenders to Philip A. Falcone’s LightSquared Inc. proposed a reorganization plan for
the company, saying its LP unit should be sold at auction with
the lead offer from an entity owned by  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)   L-Band Acquisition LLC, wholly owned by Dish, raised its
offer for LightSquared’s assets to $2.2 billion by adding
$220 million in cash under certain conditions,  Tom Lauria , a
lawyer for the lenders, said today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
 Manhattan . LightSquared has refused to meet with L-Band.  “This case resists all attempt to walk in a straight line,
but we’re going to keep at it,” U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman said after admonishing lenders’ lawyers for not telling
her in advance that they intended to file the plan before
today’s hearing. The hearing was scheduled to consider a
timeline for LightSquared to receive proposals.  Chapman approved a timeline that requires competing bids by
the end of the day on Dec. 6 and sets a hearing to confirm a
final plan to begin Dec. 10.  LightSquared had said it expected competing proposals to
reorganize its assets. The broadband-network services provider
lost the exclusive right to control its reorganization July 15.  The lender group, which owns debt in the LP unit, includes
Capital Research & Management Co., Cyrus Capital Partners LP,
Intermarket Corp.,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and SP Special Opportunities LLC, a
fund owned by Dish Chairman  Charlie Ergen . Their plan would
split the LP unit from LightSquared’s Inc. unit.  Cash Bag  Rachel Strickland, a lawyer for SP Special and L-Band, told
Chapman today that LightSquared has refused to meet with its
potential acquirer, even though a “bag of $2 billion in cash”
has been sitting at its doorstep for more than 45 days.  Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners LLC is “trying
desperately” to keep ownership of LightSquared in the face of
debt-buying by SP Special, at the expense of creditors, lenders
have said. The Ergen fund joined the lender group on June 13.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for
bankruptcy in May 2012, listing assets of $4.48 billion and debt
of $2.29 billion.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
