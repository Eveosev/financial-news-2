U.S. Senator Carl Levin, the
Michigan Democrat who leads the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, said lawmakers may use subpoena power to examine
banks’ trading and ownership of physical commodities.  “We have been into this issue for a long time and it’s a
very, very significant issue,” Levin said in an interview today
after a Banking subcommittee hearing led by Senator Sherrod Brown on whether power plants and oil refineries should be owned
by financial holding companies such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   The potential for conflicts of interest and manipulating
prices to benefit their proprietary holdings “is huge,” said
Levin, whose subcommittee held hearings over Goldman Sachs’s
packaging and sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities and
JPMorgan’s “London Whale” trading losses.  “I’m very, very glad that Senator Brown’s subcommittee got
into it today,” Levin said. “He and I have talked and he is
hopefully going to continue and we’re going to continue looking
as we have I think six months or a year.”  Levin said he may hold hearings in his own subcommittee if
he isn’t satisfied with the outcome of Brown’s effort.  “We don’t want to duplicate what he’s able to do,” Levin
said, noting that Brown’s subcommittee doesn’t have subpoena
power while his does. “It may depend on what their hearings
produce and what any additional information we’re able to
produce because of the easier availability of subpoena power.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
