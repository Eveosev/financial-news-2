Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest independent
merger-advisory firm, hired Lachlan Edwards from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to head its Australian capital structure advisory
business, said two people familiar with the matter.  Edwards, who was Goldman’s head of Asia-Pacific
restructuring, will start with Lazard in Sydney on Oct. 1, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. He will report to John Wylie, managing director & head
of corporate advisory for  Australia , the people said.  Lazard bought Sydney-based independent advisory firm
O’Sullivan Partners in September as it seeks to expand its
business in the South Pacific nation. Former Prime Minister  Paul
Keating  is the firm’s chairman of  corporate advisory, according
to Lazard’s Australian website.  Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Hayley Morris declined to comment
on Edwards’s departure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
