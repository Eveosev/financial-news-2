Corn futures tumbled to a 33-month
low as forecasts for cool, wet weather improved prospects for a
crop expected to be a record in the U.S., the world’s biggest
grower. Wheat fell to a one-year low, and soybeans declined.  Precipitation is expected in  Iowa , the top U.S. grower of
corn and soybeans, and in  Illinois  over the next six to 10 days,
Commodity Weather Group said today in a report. Rain in the
Mississippi River Delta region also will benefit crops. Yields
in southwestern Illinois will jump 60 percent from last year’s
drought-damaged harvest to 183.3 bushels an acre, field samples
taken yesterday by Doane Advisory Services Co. showed.  Farmers will harvest more corn than ever this year and 29
percent more than 2012, when the worst drought since the 1930s
damaged Midwest fields, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.
Prices are 38 percent lower than a year ago, making  global food
cheaper  and reducing feed costs for meat companies including
 Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and ethanol refiners including  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  The USDA forecast domestic corn inventories will
more than double by September 2014.  “The buyers out here have no fear, whether it’s the
livestock feeders or an ethanol producers,”  Dale Durchholz , a
senior market adviser at Agrivisor LLC in Bloomington, Illinois,
said by telephone. “The crop is going to be big enough to see a
fairly big build in ending stocks. I don’t see any rush to
buy.”  Corn futures for December delivery tumbled 2.5 percent to
settle at $4.855 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $4.82, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 5, 2010.  Rising Supply  The domestic harvest will jump to 13.95 billion bushels
this year, up from a six-year low of 10.78 billion in 2012, the
USDA said July 11. Stockpiles on Sept. 1, 2014, before next
year’s harvest, will jump to 1.959 billion bushels from an
estimated 729 million this year, the agency said.  Nationwide, yields are expected to jump to 156.5 bushels an
acre from 123.4 bushels last year, according to the USDA.
Growers seeded 97.4 million acres, the most since 1936, and are
forecast to harvest corn from 89.1 million acres.  Food costs have dropped in six of the past nine months and
are down 11 percent since reaching a record in February 2011,
according to the  United Nations . Shares of Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods climbed 39 percent this year through yesterday
as lower feed costs helped boost earnings at its chicken and
pork units.  Crop Conditions  Expected rains will help improve conditions for corn after
a month of “not ideal” weather, especially in Iowa, where a
hot, dry spell probably reduced yield prospects from earlier
forecasts, Christopher Narayanan, the head of agricultural
research at Societe Generale SA in  New York , said in a telephone
interview.  Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$6.5375 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $6.505, the lowest
for a most-active contract since June 19, 2012.  Soybean futures for delivery in November slipped 2.2
percent to $12.6025 a bushel in  Chicago , the first decline in
three sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
