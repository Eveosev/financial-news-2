Alison Saunders, who led the
organized crime division at the U.K. prosecutors’ office, was
named the head of the agency.  Saunders, who has worked for the  Crown Prosecution Service 
since 1986, will start as Director of Public Prosecutions after
the current head,  Keir Starmer , steps down at the end of
October, the agency said in a  statement  on its website today.
Saunders has been London’s Chief Crown Prosecutor since 2010.  Saunders made the decision to charge suspects in the
investigation into the hacking of mobile phone voicemails at
News Corp. newspapers. She has also prosecuted cases involving
bribery, human trafficking, immigration, counterfeiting, money
laundering, sexual assault and murder, the CPS said.  “Saunders is a first-class lawyer with great experience
and a thorough understanding of the way the CPS works,”  Stephen
Parkinson , head of criminal law at Kingsley Napley LLP in
 London , said in an e-mail.  Saunders said she would continue with “reforms, both
within the CPS and more widely in the criminal justice system,”
that Starmer began.  To contact the reporter on this story:
