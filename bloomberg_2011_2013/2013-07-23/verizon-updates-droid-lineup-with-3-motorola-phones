Verizon Wireless (VZ) , the largest U.S.
wireless carrier, introduced three Motorola Mobility phones --
the Droid Mini, Droid Ultra and Droid Maxx -- to update its
lineup of devices made by the  Google Inc. (GOOG)  unit.  The phones have 10-megapixel cameras, Basking Ridge, New
Jersey-based Verizon said today at an event in  New York . The
Mini, available Aug. 29, starts at $100 with a contract. The
Ultra will sell for $200 and the Maxx for $300, both available
in stores Aug. 20.  Motorola, acquired last year by Google for $12.4 billion,
started its smartphone partnership with Verizon in 2009 with the
original Droid phone. The devices, which use Google’s Android
operating system, compete against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and
Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy phones.  The new Droids have Motorola X8 eight-core processor chips,
hands-free operation that activates with the command  “OK
Google Now,” and camera software that has features like slow-motion video.  Motorola is scheduled to introduce the Moto X, which will
use two processors to conserve battery life, on Aug. 1. Neil
Shah, a Motorola spokesman, declined to comment on the Moto X.  To contact the reporter on this story:
