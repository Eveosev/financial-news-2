Rubber futures in  China , the world’s
biggest user of the material used to make tires, may rally as
much as 7 percent in the next week, Wanda Futures Co. said,
citing a technical study of moving averages.  The moving average convergence-divergence indicator is
showing signs of strengthening, said analyst Yang Zhiyong by
phone from Urumqi in western China. The most-active contract,
which closed 18,665  yuan  ($3,039) a ton yesterday, may test
20,000 yuan, he said. Futures have broken the five-day, 10-day
and 20-day averages in the rebound through July.  Futures have surged 11 percent since touching 16,835 yuan
on June 25, the lowest level since September 2009. Some
investors believe the market has bottomed out and physical
inventory in China is declining, Yang said.  Inventories in Qingdao, China’s trading hub for the
commodity, fell 3.4 percent to 330,300 tons on July 15 from
341,900 tons on June 28, according to the Qingdao International
Rubber Exchange. Inventory was at record 371,100 tons on April
26, the bourse said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
