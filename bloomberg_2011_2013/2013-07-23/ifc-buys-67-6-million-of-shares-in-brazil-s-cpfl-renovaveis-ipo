Brazilian power utility  CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3) , as part of an initial
public offering.  CPFL Renovaveis, as the Sao Paulo-based company is known,
will use the funds from the IPO completed last week to develop
projects and possibly buy existing ones, IFC said today in an e-mailed statement. The IFC is the Washington-based lending unit
of the World Bank.  CPFL Renovaveis and its shareholders raised as much as 900
million reais by selling 28 million new shares and 44 million
existing shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
