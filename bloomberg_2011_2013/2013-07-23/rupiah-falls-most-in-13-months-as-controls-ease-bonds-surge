Indonesia ’s rupiah plunged the most
in 13 months in onshore trading as Bank Indonesia allows a more
rapid slide toward levels quoted in the offshore market. The
yield on 10-year  government bonds  fell the most since 2011.  The rupiah dropped 1.3 percent to 10,200 per dollar as of
4:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks. The
currency reached 10,258 earlier, the weakest level since July 14,
2009. One-month non-deliverable forwards were 1.7 percent weaker
than the spot rate at 10,379. That gap exceeded 5 percent last
month for the first time since 2011.  “Bank Indonesia has stepped back to allow real supply and
demand in the market to play out,” said Suriyanto Chang, head
of treasury at PT Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “The rupiah
could strengthen from now, as exporters sell dollars and
investors start to look at picking up the nation’s debt.”  The central bank has allowed the rupiah to gradually
depreciate, especially this month, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo
said July 12. The nation recorded trade deficits in seven out of
the past eight months, while its current account has been in
 shortfall  for the six quarters through March, official data show.  The rupiah has weakened 2.7 percent in July and 5.5 percent
this year, the worst performance among Asia’s 11 most-traded
currencies after  Japan ’s yen and  India ’s rupee. The 10,000 per
dollar level is in line with economic fundamentals,  Bank
Indonesia  Governor Agus Martowardojo said last week.  Bonds Surge  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
66 basis points, or 0.66 percentage point, to 12.67 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. A  fixing  by the Association of
Banks in Singapore that is used to settle the rupiah contracts
was set at 10,204 today, stronger than Bank Indonesia’s spot
reference rate at 10,222.  “Investors remain unconvinced of the rupiah outlook and
the nation’s current-account-deficit fundamentals, and are
trying to get out while they have the chance,” said Greg Gibbs,
foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in  Singapore .  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 fell 41
basis points to 7.44 percent, the lowest level since July 5,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield
has plunged 86 basis points, or 0.86 percentage point, in five
days from a 28-month high of 8.3 percent on July 16.  A weaker rupiah minimizes the risk for foreign investors to
buy Indonesian bonds and stocks as the currency gets closer to
what might be the new equilibrium, Alvin Pattisahusiwa, chief
investment officer at PT Manulife Asset Management in Jakarta,
said today, adding that he expects the currency to weaken to
10,500 per dollar.  Chris Siniakov, the head of  Asia  fixed income at Deutsche
Asset & Wealth Management in  Melbourne , and Ezra Nazula, head of
fixed income at Manulife Asset in Jakarta, said in interviews
yesterday that a 10-year yield of around 8 percent offered good
value for investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
