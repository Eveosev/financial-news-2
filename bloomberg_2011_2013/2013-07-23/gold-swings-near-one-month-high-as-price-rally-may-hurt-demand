Gold futures fell from a one-month
high as  India , the world’s largest buyer, added to restrictions
on imports.  The Reserve Bank of India said yesterday it would be
mandatory for gold buyers to set aside 20 percent for re-exports
as jewelry in a bid to cut a record current-account deficit. The
country has doubled a tax on inbound shipments to 8 percent this
year. Imports may tumble 63 percent to 175 metric tons in the
second half from a year earlier, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, a
director at the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation.  “The restrictions on Indian imports is a further blow to
physical demand,” Marc Ground, a commodity strategist at
Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview. “Gold continues to remain vulnerable to the
downside.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,335.20 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Yesterday, the price jumped as much as 3.6 percent to
$1,340.50, the highest for a most-active contract since June 20.  The metal has climbed 13 percent from a 34-month low of
$1,179.40 on June 28 as demand for coins, bars and jewelry
increased following the slump. Yesterday, futures jumped 3.3
percent, the most in 12 months, on speculation that the Federal
Reserve will maintain economic stimulus.  “Market participants are locking in some profits following
yesterday’s surge,” Tom Hungerford, a sales representative at
Heraeus Metals New York LLC, said in a report.  2013 Decline  Gold has dropped 20 percent this year, erasing $56.4
billion from the value of assets in  exchange-traded products 
backed by the metal. Some investors lost faith in the metal as a
store of value amid an equity rally and low inflation.  “Medium term, we expect that gold prices will decline
further given our U.S. economists’ forecast for improving
economic activity and a less accommodative monetary policy
stance,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday in a report.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 1.2 percent to
$20.254 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached
$20.595, the highest since June 20. Trading was 42 percent below
the average in the past 100 days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1,443.10 an ounce, ending
a three-session rally.  Palladium futures for September delivery slumped 1.5
percent to $739.45 an ounce, the biggest drop since June 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
