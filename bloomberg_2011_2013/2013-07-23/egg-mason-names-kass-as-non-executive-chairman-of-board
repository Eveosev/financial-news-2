Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  named Dennis Kass as
non-executive chairman of its board, replacing Allen Reed, who
was appointed to the role in September.  Kass joined Legg Mason’s board in April after retiring last
year as chairman of Jennison Associates, an asset-management
firm owned by Prudential Financial Inc., according to a
statement today from the Baltimore-based money manager. Reed,
who will continue on the board, oversaw a strategic review of
Legg Mason’s business model and operations and led the search
committee for a new chief executive officer that started last
year.  Joseph A. Sullivan took over as Legg Mason’s interim CEO in
October and was permanently appointed to the position in
February.  Mark Fetting  stepped down as CEO Oct. 1 under pressure
from activist investor  Nelson Peltz  after failing to end almost
five years of client redemptions.  Kass, 62, previously spent more than a decade at JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s investment unit. He served in President  Ronald
Reagan ’s administration from 1985 to 1987 as assistant secretary
of the U.S. Labor Department, where he was responsible for
pension and welfare benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
