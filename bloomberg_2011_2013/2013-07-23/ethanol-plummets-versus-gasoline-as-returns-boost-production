Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
reached the widest level in three months on speculation higher
profit margins to make the fuel will boost production.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 5.5 cents to
68.01 cents a gallon as the December corn contract on the
Chicago Board of Trade touched the lowest level for a most-active contract since October 2010. The spread is the widest
between front-month contracts since April 1.  “Corn was off overnight, so that’s the main reason ethanol
is weak,” said  Chris Wilson , a broker at Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “Out on the curve, margins
look really good.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 5.1 cents, or
2.1 percent, to $2.379 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 8.6 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 0.4 cent to $3.0591 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  was 876,000 barrels a day in the week
ended July 12, up 14 percent from a record low in January,
according to Energy Information Administration data.  Corn for September delivery decreased 18.25 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $5.225 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively traded
December contract dropped 12.5 cents to $4.855.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 36 cents, up
from 33 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
margin was minus 35 cents on Dec. 31.  Tracking certificates, known as Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, are used by refiners and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, to show compliance with
government mandates to use ethanol.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 3 cents to $1.33, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 6 cents to $1.36.  The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings
today and has a meeting planned for tomorrow focusing on whether
the country should adjust the Renewable Fuels Standard.  U.S. Representative  Fred Upton , a Republican from  Michigan 
and the chairman of the committee, said today that modifications
are necessary and the “current system cannot stand.”  Cash Market  In cash market trading, ethanol tumbled 12 cents to $2.455
a gallon in  New York , 9 cents to $2.40 in Chicago, 10 cents to
$2.47 on the  Gulf Coast  and 9 cents to $2.595 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf widened 1 cent to
12.5 cents, the largest since July 10, while Chicago’s discount
to New York Harbor contracted 3 cents to 5.5 cents, the tightest
since July 18.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release the latest
production, supply and import data on ethanol at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow in  Washington .  Last week’s report showed  stockpiles  gained 5.5 percent to
16.6 million barrels in the seven days ended July 12, from the
previous period. Imports doubled to 50,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
