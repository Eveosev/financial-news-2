European stocks may jump 3.6 percent
to a five-year high after the benchmark index held above a key
level, averting the formation of a head-and-shoulders pattern, a
technical analyst at Natixis said.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index may rise to as high as 311 in
six weeks after it closed above 299 in the past three days, Ouri
Mimran, a technical strategist at Natixis in Paris, said. That
would be 3.6 percent greater than yesterday’s close. A drop
below 299 would have led to a reversal of gains, he said.  “If the index had failed to clear 299, a head-and-shoulders pattern would have threatened the bullish trend,”
Mimran said yesterday. “Now we have seen a confirmation that
the bullish trend will continue. We will probably see new highs
in the coming months.”  The benchmark gauge rose 1.2 percent last week, the longest
stretch of gains in two months, boosted by Chinese economic data
and assurances from the  Federal Reserve  that its stimulus
program remains flexible.  A head-and-shoulders top, three consecutive peaks in which
the middle one is the highest, indicates price declines,
according to technical analysts. The Stoxx 600 last week avoided
forming the third peak required to complete the reversal pattern
as it rallied for a fourth week, Mimran said.  The gauge closed at 310.59 on May 22, the highest since
June 2008, after rising as high as 311.07 in intraday trading.
It advanced 0.2 percent to 300.3 yesterday.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price
charts to predict changes in a stock, commodity, currency or
