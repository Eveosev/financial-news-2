Corn yields measured in the western
third of  Illinois , the third-biggest U.S. grower, were projected
higher than a year earlier as warm temperatures and adequate
soil moisture boosted plant populations, according to the Doane
Advisory Services Co. crop tour.  Yields measured yesterday from  St. Louis  to Sterling,
Illinois were 183.3 bushels an acre, 60 percent higher than a
year earlier when the worst drought since the 1930s damaged
crops. They were also 6.8 percent above the average from 2007 to
2011, based on field inspections during the first day of the
30th annual Doane tour. Yields ranged from 168 bushels measured
in Macoupin County to 198 bushels measured 250 miles north in
Whiteside County.  “The fields that were planted closer to normal dates have
high yield potential” because plant populations in the western
third of the state are above average, Marty Foreman, a senior
economist at Doane, said from  Cedar Rapids ,  Iowa . “While plant
population were consistently high, the 20 percent that was
planted two to three weeks late could see yields fall by a third
to as much as half.”  Futures on the  Chicago  Board of Trade tumbled 29 percent
this year, signaling lower food prices and reducing expenses for
producers of livestock feed and ethanol. The U.S. harvest will
climb to a record 13.95 billion bushels, the Department of
Agriculture estimates.  Corn in Illinois was rated 65 percent in good or excellent
condition on July 21, down from 69 percent a week earlier and
just 7 percent a year ago, the USDA said in a  report  yesterday.  Soybean Yields  Soybean fields in Illinois graded by Doane economists
showed yields were 12 percent higher than that of last year’s
drought-damaged crop. Yield potential was estimated at 44.3
bushels an acre, down from 44.5 bushels on average from 2008 to
2012, Doane data show.  “Plant size is variable and that is a direct result of
later plantings and dryness in the western third,”  Bill Nelson ,
a Doane senior economist, said yesterday in Cedar Rapids, after
traveling more than 360 miles. “We clearly did not see as many
outstanding fields as usual and some crops need rain soon.”  Soybeans in Chicago dropped 8.6 percent this year.  About 72 percent of Illinois soybeans were rated in good or
excellent condition, down from 73 percent a week earlier and 13
percent a year ago, according to the USDA report.  An estimated 11 percent of the state’s crop was beginning
to set pods, down from 36 percent a year ago and 17 percent on
average in the past five years, the USDA said. About 27 percent
of topsoil was rated short or very short of moisture. Illinois
temperatures averaged 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit (-15.6 Celsius)
above normal during the week and rainfall in the state was 0.5
inches (12.7 millimeters) below normal, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
