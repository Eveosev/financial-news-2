PacifiCorp, a utility unit of  Warren
Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , agreed to buy power from a
wind farm that Apex Clean Energy Inc. plans to build in Utah.  PacifiCorp will buy the output from closely held Apex’s
$230 million Long Ridge wind farm, which will consist of two 80-megawatt projects and is expected to produce enough electricity
for about 43,000 average U.S. homes, the Charlottesville,
Virginia-based developer said in a statement on its website
today.  The two contracts are expected to receive final state
approval this year, Apex said. Terms weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
