U.S. Midwest gasoline strengthened
versus New York futures after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  reported a unit upset
at the area’s second-largest refinery.  The  discount  for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
narrowed 1.5 cents to 17 cents a gallon under futures at 2:39
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Conventional 87-octane
gasoline in Group 3 gained 2.75 cents to a discount of 7.25
cents, the  smallest spread  in two weeks. Group 3 includes states
from  Oklahoma  to the northern U.S. border.  The discounts narrowed after Phillips 66 flared gases
because of a unit upset at its 356,000-barrel-a-day Wood River,
 Illinois , refinery. The plant is the second-largest in the
Midwest behind  BP Plc’s 420,000-barrel-a-day Whiting refinery  in
 Indiana . When a plant reports an upset, it can cause prices to
rise because operators may need to purchase more supply.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in  Chicago , a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
 Texas  Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, widened 33 cents to
$15.63 a barrel. The  same spread  in Group 3 grew 77 cents to
$19.56 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The spread between gasoline in Chicago and the  Gulf Coast 
was 6.85 cents, the smallest since June 26. Conventional CBOB
gasoline was  unchanged  on the Gulf Coast today at 25.75 cents a
gallon below futures.  An inventory report may show tomorrow that U.S. supplies of
gasoline surged 1.8 million barrels last week, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S.
Energy Information Administration will provide inventory data at
10:30 a.m.  “All eyes are on the report tomorrow,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin, Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
