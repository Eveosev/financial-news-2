Orange juice  tumbled the most in
four weeks on signs that demand is slowing in the U.S. Cotton
also declined.  In the four weeks ended July 6, U.S.  retail sales  totaled
39.53 million gallons, the lowest since at least January 2002,
the Florida Department of Citrus said in a report after the
close of trading yesterday. Stockpiles monitored by ICE Futures
U.S. surged 67 percent in the week ended July 22, to the
equivalent of 16.875 million pounds, based on electronic
warehouse receipts tracked by the exchange.  “The stocks are there, but demand is the lowest in
years,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Combine that
with the lack of weather threats, and there’s no reason for the
market to move upward.”  Orange-juice futures for September delivery slumped 2.8
percent to $1.42 a pound at 11:34 a.m, heading for the biggest
loss since June 26. Prices through yesterday rallied 25 percent
this year, on signs of a smaller crop in Florida and the risk of
crop damage during the  hurricane season  from June through
November.  “There are no organized tropical cyclones in the Atlantic
region at this time,” Joel Burgio, a meteorologist for DTN said
in a report today.  Florida  is the world’s largest orange grower
after  Brazil .  Cotton futures for December delivery slid 1.7 percent to
84.75 cents a pound on ICE. Prices through yesterday rose 15
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
