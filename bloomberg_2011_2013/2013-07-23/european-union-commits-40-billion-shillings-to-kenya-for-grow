The European Union pledged to give
 Kenya  40 billion shillings ($459 million) by 2020 to help the
East African nation achieve its goal of faster economic growth
that benefits the poor.  The funding may rise to as much as 50 billion shillings in
the period, which would represent a 10 percent increase from the
current level, EU Ambassador to Kenya Lodewijk Briet said today,
according to an e-mailed statement. Discussions are under way to
decide which projects the funding will support.  President Uhuru Kenyatta, elected in March, has vowed to
boost growth in  East Africa ’s biggest economy to an annual 10
percent, create 1 million new jobs a year and lift 10 million
people out of poverty by 2017. The country’s $37 billion economy
is forecast by the government to grow 5.8 percent this year from
4.6 percent in 2012.  The European Union currently targets its funding to Kenya
to help improve crop production and build roads, according to
the statement. Kenya is the world’s largest black-tea exporter
and it supplies one-third of the flowers traded in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
