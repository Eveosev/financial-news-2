John Swire & Sons Ltd., a company
that provides storage to industries including aviation and
agribusiness, bought Argent Energy Group Ltd., a Scottish
producer of clean diesel from used cooking oil and waste.  The deal will enable Argent to replicate its business in
other parts of the world, according to an e-mailed statement
today from Motherwell-based Argent. The company declined to
disclose the value of the purchase.  Governments are increasingly putting in place targets to
spur the adoption of cleaner fuels as they strive to curb
polluting emissions from transport. The U.K. plans to get 10
percent of the energy used in road transportation from biofuel
by 2020. Vehicles contribute as much as 21 percent to its total
greenhouse gas emissions, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
