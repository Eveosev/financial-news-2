Options are signaling that the
 Federal Reserve  can reduce its bond-purchase program without
causing a spike in price swings in the Treasury market.  Three-month implied volatility  on 10-year  interest-rate
swaps  dropped to a one-month low of 89.4 basis points from 122.6
basis points on July 5, which was the highest since 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge is a measure
of projected yield fluctuations over the next 90 days. Half of
the economists surveyed by Bloomberg said the Fed will begin
trimming its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases in September.
The U.S. plans to sell $35 billion of two-year notes today.  “The market is calming down,” said Ali Jalai, a Treasury
trader in  Singapore  at Scotiabank, a unit of  Canada ’s  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , one of the 21 primary dealers that trade directly
with the Fed. “The market has accepted that tapering is
different than tightening. In the next six months to a year, all
we’re getting is tapering, we’re not getting tightening.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed today at 2.48
percent as of 1:50 p.m. in  Tokyo , Bloomberg Bond Trader data
showed. The 1.75 percent note due May 2023 traded at 93 22/32.
The yield has fallen from 2.75 percent on July 8, which was the
highest level since August 2011.  The next target for yields is 2.415 percent, which was this
month’s low,  George Davis , chief technical analyst at RBC
Dominion Securities Inc. in Toronto, wrote in a report
yesterday.  Japan ’s 10-year yield slid 1 1/2 basis points to 0.77
percent, a level not seen in 10 weeks. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Treasury Losses  Treasuries have fallen 2.2 percent this year, while Japan’s
sovereign debt returned 0.7 percent, based on the Bloomberg
World Bond Indexes.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares returned 13
percent including reinvested dividends.  An index measuring Treasuries’ 10-day price  volatility 
dropped to 2.44 percent yesterday from 7.49 percent on July 8,
which was the highest in 20 months.  The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate Move Index
fell to 72.62 basis points yesterday, the lowest level in almost
two months. The figure is down from 117.89 basis points on July
5, which was the most since December 2010. The one-year average
is 64.71.  None of the 54 economists surveyed July 18-22 predicted the
 Federal Open Market Committee  will begin paring its $85 billion
of monthly purchases at its meeting scheduled for July 30-31.  Monthly Buying  In its first reduction, the FOMC will probably cut monthly
bond buying to $65 billion. Economists see purchases divided
between $35 billion in Treasuries and $30 billion in mortgage-backed securities, according to the median estimate.  The Fed has kept its target for overnight bank lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. It has said
it will consider raising the  target  when the  unemployment rate 
falls to 6.5 percent, versus 7.6 percent as of June.  Investors shouldn’t be complacent about a reduced Fed
purchase program, according to Tomohisa Fujiki, an interest-rate
strategist in Tokyo at BNP Paribas SA, another primary dealer.
BNP expects the Fed to start tapering in December, he said.  “There are still potential risks that may cause a big move
in the market,” Fujiki said. “Once the Fed starts tapering,
volatility is more likely to pick up.”  Housing Market  Ten-year yields were close to the lowest level in two weeks
yesterday as an industry report showed purchases of existing
homes fell 1.2 percent to a 5.08 million annual rate. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was a 5.26
million pace.  New home sales  probably rose for a fourth month in
June, based on a separate survey before the Commerce Department
issues the figure tomorrow.  Treasury  trading volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $194 billion. It fell
to 184.3 billion on July 19, which was the lowest level since
April.  The two-year securities scheduled for sale today yielded
0.325 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.43 percent
the last time the notes were sold on June 25.  Demand weakened at the previous two offerings of the notes.
The  bid-to-cover  ratios, which gauge demand by comparing the
amount bid with the amount offered, at the June and May auctions
were 3.05 and 3.04, the two lowest since February 2011, Treasury
data show.  Direct bidders , investors and dealers outside of the
primary-dealer network bidding directly to the Treasury, won 7.8
percent of the June offering, the least since April 2012.
Indirect bidders, the group that includes foreign central banks,
bought 35.8 percent of the debt, the most since February.  The U.S. is also scheduled to sell $35 billion of five-year
debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year securities July 25.
It auctions this combination of securities every month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
