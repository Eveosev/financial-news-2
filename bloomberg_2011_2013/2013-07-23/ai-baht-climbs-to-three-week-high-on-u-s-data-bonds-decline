Thailand ’s baht climbed to a three-week high after a decline in U.S. home sales eased concern a
reduction in the Federal Reserve’s monetary stimulus is
imminent.  Government bonds  dropped for a fourth day.  Sales of previously owned homes in the world’s largest
economy unexpectedly  dropped  1.2 percent in June, according to
data published yesterday. The Fed will start tapering its bond-buying program, which has spurred demand for emerging-market
assets, in September, according to half of the economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . A manufacturing report for China
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics is due tomorrow.  “The biggest factor moving the market is the U.S. economic
data while some attention is being paid to this week’s China
data,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at
 Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)   The baht climbed 0.5 percent from July 19 to 30.90 per
dollar as of 9:57 a.m. in Bangkok after touching 30.89 earlier,
the strongest level since July 2, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Onshore financial markets were closed yesterday for a
public holiday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.65 percent.  Exports climbed 1.5 percent in June after a 5.3 percent
drop the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due July 26.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023
