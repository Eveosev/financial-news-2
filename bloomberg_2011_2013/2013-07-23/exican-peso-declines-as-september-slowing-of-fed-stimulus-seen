Mexico’s peso dropped as a growing
number of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  forecast that
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce in September a bond-buying
program in the U.S. that has fueled demand for the Latin
American country’s securities.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 12.5131 per U.S.
dollar at 11:04 a.m. in Mexico City. Peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark debt maturing in 2024 down six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.69 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will trim in September the
Fed’s monthly bond buying to $65 billion from the current pace
of $85 billion, according to half of the economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, up from 44 percent last month. Foreign
investors, many facing near-zero  interest rates  at home, had
pushed holdings of fixed-rate Mexican peso bonds to record highs
before Bernanke said in May that the Fed may curb stimulus.  Concern that the Fed will soon reduce its stimulus means
that as “investments in pesos, in high-yielding currencies are
reduced, the currency depreciates a bit,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a
currency trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said in a
telephone interview from Guadalajara, Mexico. “It hasn’t been
abrupt because it was already more or less being expected.”  Mexico  will hold its weekly debt auction to sell short-term
bills today with results to be released by the central bank at
11:30 a.m. local time. It also plans to offer 3 billion pesos
($240 million) in fixed-rate bonds due in 2042.  To contact the reporter on this story:
