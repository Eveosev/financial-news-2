Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  slumped the most in
three months in London trading after failing to find commercial
quantities of crude or gas at two wells off  Mozambique  and
French Guiana.  Tullow slid as much as 8 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since April 17. The shares were 7.4 percent lower at 1,032 pence
as of 8:50 a.m. for the worst performance on the benchmark  FTSE
100 Index. (UKX)   The Cachalote well, where  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Inpex Corp. (1605)  are
partners, in the  Ibo High  area off  Mozambique  discovered a “gas
bearing reservoir” that “is unlikely to be commercial on a
standalone basis,” Tullow said today in a statement.  The GM-ES-4 well targeting the Cebus prospect off  French
Guiana  revealed “no indications of hydrocarbons,” Tullow said
in the statement.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Total SA (FP)  and Northpet
Investments Ltd., a company jointly owned by  Northern Petroleum
Plc (NOP)  and  Wessex Exploration Plc (WSX) , are partners in the well.  Wessex fell as much as 37 percent and Northern Petroleum
retreated 8.2 percent in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
