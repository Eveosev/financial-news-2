Sekisui House Ltd. (1928) , a Japanese home
builder, will construct a 9.2 billion yen ($92 million) solar
power station in southwestern  Japan .  The Osaka-based company will build the plant on a former
golf course in Kagoshima prefecture, it said in a  statement 
today. Construction of the 25.8-megawatt plant is expected to be
finished by the end of August 2014.  Sekisui expects to earn about 1.14 billion yen a year from
solar power generation, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
