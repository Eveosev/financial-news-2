Rubber rose to a seven-week high
after  China ’s Premier  Li Keqiang  said the nation’s economy will
grow by at least 7 percent, boosting speculation that demand for
the commodity used in tires will gain in the biggest consumer.  Rubber for delivery in December on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange settled at 256.3 yen a kilogram ($2,575 a metric ton),
the highest for the most-active contract since June 5. Futures
closed at 256.2 yesterday and have lost 15 percent this year.  Li said at a recent meeting with economists that 7 percent
is the “bottom line” and the nation can’t allow growth below
that, the Beijing News reported today. Speculation that growth
would fall below the government’s annual target of 7.5 percent
announced in March has intensified after Finance Minister  Lou
Jiwei  said earlier this month that 6.5 percent expansion
wouldn’t be a “big problem.”  “Li’s comment provided optimism that rubber demand in
China will increase,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity
broker Yutaka Shoji Co. Gains were limited as Japan’s currency
strengthened against the  U.S. dollar , he added.  The yen climbed as much as 0.5 percent to 99.15 per dollar,
reducing the appeal of futures denominated in the Japanese
currency, after a report showed yesterday that purchases of
existing U.S. homes declined.  Rubber imports by China slumped 21 percent to 130,000 tons
in June from a year earlier, data from the nation’s customs
general administration showed yesterday. Inventories climbed
1,025 tons to 115,255 tons, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said
on July 19, based on a survey of nine warehouses.  Rubber for January delivery on the SHFE lost 1.5 percent to
18,380  yuan  ($2,995) a ton today.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 79.35 baht
($2.56) a kilogram on July 19, according to Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . Thai markets were closed today and
yesterday for a holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
