Gecina SA (GFC) , Paris’s largest publicly
traded office landlord, said first-half earnings rose 1.5
percent on increased occupancy and lower financing costs.  Pretax earnings excluding changes in asset values and other
items, known as net recurrent income, climbed to 167.4 million
euros ($221 million) from 164.9 million euros a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. Occupancy increased to
94.8 percent from 94.1 percent.  Gecina has been restructuring its holdings for the past two
years to help cut debt. Net financial expenses fell 10.3 percent
to 72.8 million euros after the company reduced borrowing.  “The policy to deleverage and realign the group that we
have been implementing for the past two years is delivering
benefits,” Chief Executive Officer Philippe Depoux said in the
statement. “Gecina now has sound foundations for continuing
with its development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
