The number of projects benefiting
from foreign investment into the U.K. increased by 11 percent in
2012-13 from a year earlier, according to  statistics compiled by
U.K. Trade & Industry .  Officials at UKTI, the government’s trade promotion body,
estimated that the 1,559 projects ensured the maintenance of
110,000 existing jobs and created 60,000 new jobs. The 170,000
total was an increase of 50 percent on a year earlier, UKTI said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “The U.K. has received a major vote of confidence from
foreign investors confirming that the U.K. remains a world-leading business destination,” Trade Minister  Stephen Green 
said in the statement. “UKTI will continue to work with
companies to help create and sustain a globally attractive,
highly competitive and truly international economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
