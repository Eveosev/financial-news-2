Indian stock-index futures gained
amid signs the central bank won’t tighten monetary policy at its
meeting next week.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for July delivery rose 0.4
percent to 6,058 at 9:37 a.m. in  Singapore . The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 6,031.80 yesterday.
The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.1 percent to 20,159.12. The Bank of
 New York  Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares climbed
1.4 percent.  The  Reserve Bank of India ’s move to raise two of its
interest rates last week while keeping the main repurchase rate
unchanged doesn’t signal a shift toward a tightening bias,
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said yesterday.
Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao , who has one monetary-policy review
left before his term expires in September, is under pressure to
contain inflation and stem a plunge in the rupee that has
boosted import costs.  “The clarification by the finance minister that the RBI is
not signaling to increase rates is supporting bank stocks,”
R.K. Gupta, who helps oversee about $743 million as managing
director at Taurus Asset Management Co., said by phone from New
Delhi yesterday. “Bank stocks are rebounding as valuations have
become relatively attractive.”  The S&P BSE India Bankex index of 13 Indian lenders slumped
to the lowest since September on July 17. The measure has
plunged 17 percent since climbing to an all-time high on May 16.  Directional Bets  Global investors  bought $66.8 million of local shares on
July 19, the first inflow since July 10, taking this year’s net
purchases to $12.4 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Overseas funds have sold a net $933 million of  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks
this month, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, extending June’s $1.8 billion sell-off.  “Investors are waiting to see the major earnings before
taking any directional bets,” Rajendra Wadher, director at PRB
Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview yesterday. “Earnings
of consumer and industrial companies could provide the next
trigger for stocks.”  Two out of the seven Sensex companies that have reported
earnings for the quarter ended June 30 so far have missed
estimates. That compares with 27 percent for the March quarter
and 43 percent in the three months through December.  The Sensex has gained 3.8 percent this year and  trades  at
13.9 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
