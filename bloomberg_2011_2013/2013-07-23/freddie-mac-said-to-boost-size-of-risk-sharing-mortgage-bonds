Freddie Mac (FMCC)  increased the size of
its sale of a new type of debt tied to the risk that homeowners
will fail to repay their mortgages, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The government-controlled mortgage-finance company may
issue $500 million of the notes, up from $400 million, in the
offering being managed by Credit Suisse Group AG, said the
person, who asked not to be named because terms aren’t set.  The deal reflects an effort by the Federal Housing Finance
Agency to reduce the role of  Freddie Mac  and  Fannie Mae  in the
residential-mortgage market, where government-backed loans now
account for more than 85 percent of lending. The FHFA, which has
overseen the firms since they were seized by the U.S. in 2008,
has been directing them to raise how much they charge to
guarantee their traditional mortgage bonds and asked each to
attempt to share risk this year on $30 billion of home loans.  Investors are being drawn to the notes after McLean,
Virginia-based Freddie Mac boosted the extra yield it’s willing
to pay relative to benchmark  interest rates , the person said.
After those potential spreads widened last week following the
announcement of the deal, the debt may be priced tighter than
those levels, though still wider than in discussions before
formal marketing began, the person said.  A more senior-ranking portion of the debt may be sold at
3.4 percentage points more than the one-month London interbank
offered rate, the person said. A junior-ranked slice may price
at a spread of 7.15 percentage points, down from earlier
guidance of 7.5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
