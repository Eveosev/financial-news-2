The  Reserve Bank  of  New Zealand ’s
board elected former deputy Governor Rod Carr as its new
chairman, replacing Arthur Grimes, whose 10 years in the role
will end in September.  Deputy chairman Sue Sheldon was re-elected, the RBNZ said
in an e-mailed statement. In New Zealand, decisions on  interest
rates  are made by the governor and not by the board, which takes
an oversight role.  Carr, who is Vice Chancellor at the University of
Canterbury in Christchurch, was deputy to Governor Don Brash at
the RBNZ from 1998 to 2002 and became acting Governor when Brash
resigned suddenly in April 2002. Carr resigned from the bank
when Alan Bollard was appointed Brash’s successor.  Carr was appointed to the board by the Minister of Finance
in July 2012. Sheldon was appointed in May 2009 and has been
deputy chairman since September 2009, according to today’s
statement.  Grimes joined the RBNZ board in March 2002 and was elected
chairman in September 2003 after new laws required that the
governor could no longer be chairman. He won a visiting
professorship from the NZ-UK Link Foundation and will be based
at University of London from September to November, the
foundation said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
