Sichuan Expressway Co., an operator
of toll roads, bridges and tunnels in  China , has preliminarily
agreed to invest about 50 billion yuan ($8.1 billion) in
infrastructure projects.  The company, based in  Chengdu  in western China’s Sichuan
province, entered a “strategic cooperation agreement” with the
government of the province’s Renshou county to develop
industrial and logistics parks, transportation and real estate,
according to a filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday.  Sichuan has been hit by a series of natural disasters in
recent years that have damaged homes, roads and other
infrastructure. The area was devastated by a 7.9-magnitude
earthquake in 2008 that left more than 87,000 people dead or
missing. A quake in April left at least 196 dead, and 58 people
died and 175 went missing after rainstorms triggered floods and
a landslide in the province this month.  Sichuan Expressway said it agreed to cooperate on a 14.5
billion  yuan  urban infrastructure project, a 13 billion yuan
transportation project, a 12.5 billion yuan real-estate project
and a 10 billion yuan plan to build industrial and logistic
parks. The company is also working on the 300 million yuan
expansion and construction of an expressway service area.  The agreement isn’t legally binding and separate formal
agreements will set out the cooperation methods, project periods
and investment amounts of each project, Sichuan Expressway said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
