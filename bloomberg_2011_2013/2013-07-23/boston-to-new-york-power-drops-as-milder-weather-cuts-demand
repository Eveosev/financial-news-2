Spot wholesale electricity at major
Northeast hubs slumped for a second day as milder weather
reduced the need for power to run air conditioners.  Seasonal temperatures are expected to predominate in the
eastern U.S. through the first week of August, damping energy
demand, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC. The high in Manhattan today will be 83 degrees Fahrenheit
(28 Celsius), 1 below normal, and Boston will be 3 lower than
the norm at 79, AccuWeather Inc. said.  Spot power for Boston dropped $10.54, or 18 percent, to
$48.07 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 11 a.m. from the
same time yesterday, while  New York City  slipped 95 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $48.84, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Prices on PJM Interconnection LLC’s Western hub, which
includes deliveries to  Washington , were little changed. They
rose 4 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $49.09 a megawatt-hour compared
with the 10 a.m. hour yesterday.  Electricity use  on the PJM network, which serves more than
60 million people from  New Jersey  to North Carolina and
Illinois, will peak at 133,457 megawatts during the hour ending
at 5 p.m., according to its website. Yesterday’s  high  was
133,828 megawatts at 4:15 p.m.  New York  City  power consumption  will peak at 9,849
megawatts versus the high yesterday of 10,032 megawatts,
according to the New York Independent System Operator Inc.,
which manages the state grid.  ISO New England Inc. expects peak demand on its six-state
grid to rise to 22,600 megawatts from a 21,922 megawatts
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
