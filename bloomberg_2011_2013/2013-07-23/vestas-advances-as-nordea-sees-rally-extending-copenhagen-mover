Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  rose the
most among Copenhagen’s benchmark stocks today as Nordea Private
Banking said the Danish wind turbine maker will extend a winning
streak that has doubled its market value in three months.  Vestas gained as much as 1.9 percent, making it today’s
biggest winner in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20 index. The stock
added 1.8 percent to 102.80 kroner at 10:13 a.m. local time with
trading volume at 30 percent of the three-month daily average.  Vestas shares have gained in 17 of the last 21 trading days
after an inflow of new orders fueled investor optimism that the
Aarhus, Denmark-based producer will return to profit. Nordea
said that after Vestas’s share price exceeded 100 kroner
yesterday for the first time since October 2011, the stock is
poised for further gains.  “We see good chances that the current momentum will
continue,” the bank, a unit of Stockholm-based  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ,
said in a note, repeating a buy recommendation.  Vestas competitor General Electric Co. reported renewable
equipment orders of $1.4 billion in the second quarter, up 55
percent compared with the same period a year ago. That may
indicate strong U.S. activity after a production tax credit was
renewed, according to Bloomberg Industries analyst James Evans.  Vestas is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on
Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
