Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) 
surged in  Tokyo  trading after a newspaper report said the
company agreed with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to raise steel prices.  Nippon Steel, the world’s second-biggest steelmaker,  rose 
3.3 percent to 309 yen in Tokyo, its highest since Feb. 8, 2011.
The 32-member Topix Iron and Steel  index  rose 2.8 percent while
the broader Topix index gained 0.5 percent.  The Tokyo-based steelmaker reached agreement with Toyota to
raise prices by 10,000 yen ($100) per ton, or 10 percent, for
the first half of the year to March 2014, the Nikkei reported
today, without saying where it obtained the information. The
increase is the first in two years, the report said.  Higher raw material costs and the weaker yen’s benefit to
Nippon Steel’s automaking customers is behind the price
increase,  Shinya Yamada , an analyst at Credit Suisse Securities
Japan Ltd., said.  “The reported increase is higher than many market players
anticipated,” said Yamada, who  rates  Nippon Steel outperform.  Tsuyoshi Yoshizumi, a spokesman for Nippon Steel, declined
to confirm the Nikkei report. Kayo Doi, a Tokyo-based
spokeswoman for Toyota, also declined to comment, saying the
automaker doesn’t disclose individual procurement details.  Other steelmakers advanced following the Nikkei report.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , Japan’s second-biggest steelmaker, rose
3.4 percent to 2,621 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Kobe Steel
Ltd. (5406)  climbed 2 percent to 155 yen in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
