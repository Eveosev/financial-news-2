VMware Inc. (VMW)  rose the most in more
than four years after the software maker reported second-quarter
sales and profit that exceeded analysts’ projections, helped by
customers’ renewal of multiyear licenses.  Profit before certain items was 79 cents a share on sales
of $1.24 billion, VMware said yesterday in a statement. That
beat analysts’ average estimate of 77 cents on revenue of $1.23
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares
surged as much as 17 percent.  VMware, which is majority-owned by EMC Corp., makes
software that lets computers run multiple operating systems. The
better-than-projected sales and profit, as well as a forecast
for third-quarter revenue that was in line with  estimates , may
help reassure shareholders that customers are renewing long-term
contracts and that spending won’t deteriorate further this year.  “The enterprise license-agreement renewal cycle has
probably started to kick in,” said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. who recommends buying the shares.
Bookings, a measure of future revenue, were $1.45 billion, he
said. Analysts on average had estimated $1.25 billion, he said.  VMware  shares  rose 16 percent to $82.90 at 1:01 p.m. in New
York, and earlier touched $83.30 for the biggest intraday gain
since October 2008. The stock had dropped 20 percent in the past
year as sales growth slowed, hurt by reduced technology budgets
at U.S. companies and federal agencies.  Sales Forecast  Second-quarter net income rose 27 percent to $244.1
million, or 57 cents a share, from $191.7 million, or 44 cents,
a year earlier, VMware said.  Sales in the current period will increase to $1.27 billion
to $1.3 billion, the Palo Alto, California-based company said,
compared with an average analyst estimate of $1.28 billion. In
last year’s third quarter,  sales  were $1.13 billion. Annual
revenue will be $5.12 billion to $5.26 billion. Analysts on
average projected $5.17 billion, compared with $4.61 billion in
2012.  EMC, the world’s biggest maker of storage computers,
reported second-quarter earnings that met analysts’ estimates as
customers bought new machines to handle surging volumes of data.  Profit before some costs was 42 cents a share, the
Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based company said today in a
statement. That matched the average analysts’ estimate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales also met analyst
estimates, with $5.61 billion reported.  EMC is benefiting as customers invest in new equipment to
run Web-based applications and store reams of digital content.
It also got a boost from increased contract renewals at VMware.  Sales growth is likely to accelerate in the second half of
the year, said Lamba, who recommends buying the shares.  Shares of EMC advanced 5.6 percent to $26.75, and were
little changed this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
