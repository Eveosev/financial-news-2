Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its
price forecast for arabica coffee futures traded in New York,
citing a surplus that will take stockpiles to a five-year high
at the end of the 2013-14 season.  Arabica coffee will be at $1.30 a pound on the ICE Futures
U.S. exchange in three, six and 12 months, the bank said in a
report e-mailed today. That’s down from a previous forecast of
$1.45 a pound. The beans fell 12 percent this year to $1.263 a
pound by 4:26 a.m. in New York.  Global coffee production will exceed demand by 4.46 million
bags in 2013-14, from a 10 million-bag surplus a year earlier,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Inventories
will reach a five-year high of 30.53 million bags, the USDA
predicts. A bag of coffee weighs 132 pounds.  “The expected 2013-14 surplus that would bring stocks to
their highest level in five years is leading us to lower once
again our three- to 12-month forecasts,” Damien Courvalin, an
analyst at the bank, wrote in the report. “Potential for prices
to rebound from their current levels include weather risks in
 Brazil , the potential for further cuts to Central American
production and short covering flows of near-record short net
speculative positions.”  Arabica coffee gained 2.8 percent last week as a forecast
for a cold front that may bring freezing temperatures to some
coffee areas in Brazil, the world’s top producer, resulted in
speculators closing bets on lower prices. Some coffee growing
areas may get freezing temperatures today and tomorrow,
forecaster Somar Meteorologia said on July 18.  Net-Short Positions  Large and small speculators excluding index funds reduced
their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, on arabica
coffee to 28,452 contracts in the week ended July 16, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission compiled by
Bloomberg showed. That’s down from a net-short position of
32,941 lots a week earlier.  Prices of raw sugar traded in New York will also be lower
than previously forecast, the bank said, citing a record crop in
Brazil’s center south, the main growing region of the world’s
leading producer, and a “promising start” to the monsoon in
second-ranking  India .  Sugar will be at 16.50 cents a pound on ICE in three
months, down from a previous forecast of 17.50 cents a pounds.
Prices will gain to 17.50 cents a pound in six months and to 19
cents a pound in 12 months, the bank said, adding that it sees
“downside” to its medium-term forecast. Raw sugar was down 16
percent this year to 16.39 cents a pound.  Potential support to prices could come either from rain in
Brazil or weather and, or production disappointments in India
later this year, according to the Goldman Sachs report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
