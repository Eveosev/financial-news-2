Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) , the owner of
 Africa ’s biggest  iron-ore  mine, said profit rose in the first
half as output from a new site countered losses from strikes.  Net income climbed to 7.76 billion rand ($790 million) from
7.66 billion rand a year before, the Johannesburg-listed company
said today in a statement. Earnings excluding one-time items
gained to 24.13 rand a share from 23.88 rand. The contribution
to  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s profit slid 8.8 percent to $579 million,
the London-based parent company said in a separate statement.  Production of the ore used in steel-making at the Sishen
mine in Northern Cape province fell 10 percent to 16.1 million
metric tons. Sishen was brought to a standstill when 125 staff
occupied the operation for two weeks in October, threatening to
damage mining equipment valued at about 3.3 billion rand. At the
same time, the Kolomela mine, shipping its first ore in December
2011, raised output 62 percent to 5.26 million tons, Kumba said.  “Steel fundamentals remain under pressure as the Chinese
economy slows down,” Kumba said. “Iron-ore prices are expected
to remain under pressure as supply exceeds demand in the second
half of the year, though restocking by  steel mills  may support
prices.”  China  is the largest producer and consumer of steel.  Operating expenses excluding royalties increased 14 percent
to 11.4 billion rand, and the company’s mining of 40 million to
50 million tons of waste at Sishen to make up for volumes lost
in the strike, may add to second-half costs, it said.  Output Goal  “There might be some upside risk if we don’t meet our
production targets,” Chief Financial Officer Frederick Kotzee
said by phone. Kumba retained a full-year output goal of about
37 million tons at Sishen and about 9 million tons at Kolomela.  Iron ore for immediate delivery at  Tianjin port  in China, a
benchmark, fell 1.9 percent to $137.02 a ton from a year ago,
according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  The weaker rand should help Kumba control costs, Deutsche
Bank AG said in an e-mailed note to clients. “Beyond 2013, an
ability to ramp Kolomela further should be a source of cost
reduction for the group average cost as well,” the bank said.  Capital spending  will peak at 5.3 billion to 6 billion rand
this year, Kotzee said in a Johannesburg presentation, after 2.3
billion rand in the first half. Kumba will pay an interim
dividend of 20.10 rand a share, from 19.20 rand last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
