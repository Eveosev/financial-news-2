The U.S. Financial Stability

designated systemically important.  In an e-mailed statement, Treasury Department spokeswoman
Suzanne Elio said the council now has 60 days to make a final
decision. The statement doesn’t identify the company.  On July 2,  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential Financial
