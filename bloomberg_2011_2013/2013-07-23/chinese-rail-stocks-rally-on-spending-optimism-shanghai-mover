CSR Corp. (601766)  and China CNR Corp. paced
gains among Chinese rail-related stocks on speculation the
government will increase spending on railway construction to
support economic growth.  CSR, the nation’s biggest train maker, jumped 8.1 percent
to 3.86 yuan in Shanghai at the 3 p.m. local-time close, while
the Hong Kong-traded shares climbed 7.2 percent to HK$5.21.
China CNR, the second largest, advanced 8 percent to 4.47 yuan.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 2 percent.  The government may spend more than the originally planned
650 billion yuan ($106 billion) on railway construction this
year, the China Business News reported today, citing an
unidentified person close to senior government officials. New
high-speed rail lines could help reduce over-capacity in
industries such as steel and cement, the  Shanghai  Securities
News reported today, citing railway officials.  “Railway investment is the easiest way for the government
to bolster growth every time the economy slows,” said  Li Jun , a
strategist at Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai.  Spending on rail may pick up in this half of the year given
only one third of the annual investment target has been met,
according to the Shanghai Securities News.  China Railway Group Ltd. (390) , the nation’s biggest construction
company by total assets, climbed 7.3 percent to HK$4.13. China
Railway Construction Corp., builder of more than half the
nation’s rail links since 1949, added 7.2 percent to 4.76 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
