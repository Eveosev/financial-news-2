Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  was sued by a pension fund over allegations
its Medicis unit conspired to preserve a monopoly on the acne
drug Solodyn.  Medicis “orchestrated a multi-faceted scheme” to delay
generic competition by filing sham citizens’ petitions with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in Philadelphia. Medicis also
entered into unlawful agreements with generic manufacturers
including  Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL) , which got at least
$55 million to drop a patent challenge, according to the filing.  Impax was named as a defendant in the case, along with  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , Mylan Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. and Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit.  Julie Masow, a spokeswoman for Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis, declined to comment on the complaint. Officials at
Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  Nina Devlin, a spokeswoman for Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call seeking
comment. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, and Dawn Wolfe and Sharon Santacroce, spokeswomen
for  India ’s Ranbaxy, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails
seeking comment.  The case is United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 &
Participating Employers Health and Welfare Fund, 13-4235, U.S.
District Court Eastern District of  Pennsylvania  (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
