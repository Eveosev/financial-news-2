AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, posted profit that fell just below analysts’ estimates
as costs rose for smartphone discounts used to persuade more
customers to sign long-term contracts.  Second-quarter earnings were 67 cents a share, leaving out
one-time items, Dallas-based AT&T said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts had estimated earnings of 68 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.6 percent to $32.1 billion,
topping the average estimate of $31.8 billion.  AT&T added 551,000 contract customers, compared with
320,000 a year ago. Analysts had projected 499,000 new monthly
subscribers, according to an average of 10 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson has
been unveiling new subscription plans for heavy Internet users
to catch up with Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile-phone
carrier, which added 941,000 contract users last quarter.  “For at least the near-term, AT&T does have a number of
tools at its disposal that could help to at least partially
offset the impact of competitive pressures emerging in the
market,”  Amir Rozwadowski , an analyst with Barclays Plc, wrote
in a note before the results were announced.  The shares dropped 1.1 percent to $35.40 at the close in
New York. AT&T has risen 5 percent this year.  Net income fell to $3.82 billion, or 71 cents a share, from
$3.9 billion, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Adjusted for the sale
of a unit, revenue would have risen 2.6 percent, AT&T said.  Smartphone Record  While discounts helped pushed smartphone sales to a record
in the quarter, they reduced the wireless service profit margin
to 42.4 percent from 45.8 percent a year ago, missing the 43.4
percent average estimate.  The average monthly wireless bill for contract customers
was $66.12, beating the average estimate of $65.76.  AT&T’s landline revenue declined 0.9 percent to $14.8
billion, hurt by demand for traditional phone connections,
especially among business customers. The company added 233,000
U-verse TV customers to help make up for landline losses.  Last week, in a nod to a wireless pricing strategy that  T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS)  introduced in March, AT&T said it would start
selling phones and tablets on an installment plan with the
option for customers to upgrade phones more frequently.  T-Mobile used its own plan and the introduction of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 to help lure customers and end a three-year
streak of contract customer losses in the second quarter, people
familiar with the company have said. The carrier, controlled by
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , is scheduled to report second-quarter
results Aug. 8.  Earlier this month, AT&T agreed to buy  Leap Wireless
International Inc. (LEAP)  for $1.2 billion. The move, AT&T’s first
proposed acquisition since the failed $39 billion T-Mobile
takeover, will give the company 5 million customers and
additional airwaves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
