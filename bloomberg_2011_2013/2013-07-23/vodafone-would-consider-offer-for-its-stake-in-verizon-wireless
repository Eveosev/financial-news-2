Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  Chairman  Gerard Kleisterlee  told shareholders the company would consider an
offer for its stake in Verizon Wireless, which partner Verizon
Communications Inc. has said it’s interested in buying.  Vodafone, the second-largest wireless carrier, has no
update on the situation, Kleisterlee said today at the Newbury,
England-based company’s annual shareholder meeting.  “There is ongoing communication,” Kleisterlee said.
“Everyone on the board, at every board meeting gets an update
on where we are.”  Verizon Wireless is the biggest U.S. mobile-phone company.
It reported last week that it added 941,000 mobile customers in
the second quarter, and said sales grew 7.5 percent to $20
billion.  “If we see proposals that generate more value for
shareholders we will consider them,” Kleisterlee said.  Verizon told analysts earlier this year that $100 billion
is a fair price for Vodafone’s 45 percent stake, people familiar
with the matter said at the time.  Vodafone is a “happy holder” of  Verizon Wireless , Chief
Financial Officer Andy Halford said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
