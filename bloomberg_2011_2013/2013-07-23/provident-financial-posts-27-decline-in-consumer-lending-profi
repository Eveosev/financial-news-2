Provident Financial Plc (PFG) , the U.K.’s
largest subprime lender, cut 170 jobs at its consumer-credit
business as rising fuel, food and utility bills eroded demand
for borrowing.  The cuts, equivalent to about 10 percent of the division’s
workforce, came as first-half profit at the unit fell 27 percent
36.1 million pounds ($55.4 million), the Bradford, England-based
company said in a statement today. A 70 percent increase in
profit at its Vanquis Bank unit helped to boost Provident
Financial’s net income to 55.3 million pounds from 54 million
pounds in the year-earlier period.  “It’s a tale of two different businesses,” Chief
Executive Officer Peter Crook said by telephone today.  Provident Financial’s consumer-credit division has been hit
by a weak U.K. economy, low customer confidence and pressure on
household incomes. Demand for credit from higher-quality
customers, who typically borrow more for longer, remains weak,
the company said in the statement.  “The group overall has performed in line with its internal
plan in the first half of 2013 and expects to do so for the year
as a whole,” the company said.  The shares rose 0.7 percent to 1,599 pence as of 8:15 a.m.
in London trading. The stock has advanced 17 percent this year,
for a market value of about 2.2 billion pounds. The company will
pay a first-half dividend of 31 pence a share, up from 28.8
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
