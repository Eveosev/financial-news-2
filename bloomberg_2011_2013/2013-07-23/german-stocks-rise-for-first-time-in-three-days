Stocks in  Germany  advanced for the
first time in three days as telecommunication companies rallied
after Telefonica SA agreed to buy Royal KPN NV’s German wireless
unit.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , the nation’s biggest phone company,
increased 2.3 percent.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  retreated 1.8
percent for a second day of losses.  The DAX Index rose 0.3 percent to 8,358.79 at 10:57 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark has  climbed 8.7 percent  from a
low on June 24. The broader HDAX Index also gained 0.3 percent
today.  “The focus today is on telecom stocks due to the KPN-Telefonica deal,” Soeren Steinert, who helps manage about $24
billion as associate director for equities trading at Quoniam
Asset Management GmbH in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail.
“Deutsche Telecom is the top winner.”  In the U.S., a release at 10 a.m.  New York  time may show a
gauge of manufacturing in the region covered by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Richmond rose to 9 in July from 8 the previous
