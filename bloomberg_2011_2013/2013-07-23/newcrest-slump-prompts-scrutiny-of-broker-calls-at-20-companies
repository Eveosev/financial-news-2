Australia ’s securities regulator
will attend analyst meetings at about 20 companies next month as
part of a clampdown on selective briefings, after questions were
raised about broker coverage of  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)   The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will
also listen in on some one-on-one calls with analysts,
Commissioner Cathie Armour said in an interview in Sydney
yesterday. She declined to name the companies, saying they were
picked to represent a spread of industries and locations and
weren’t necessarily suspected of any wrongdoing.  Newcrest shares  fell 12 percent  in the two days before the
company announced a possible A$6 billion ($5.6 billion)
writedown June 7, raising concerns of selective briefing that
have been denied by the Melbourne-based gold producer. Australia
requires companies to disclose all market-sensitive information
to the Australian Stock Exchange, and  the Commission announced 
it would be running spot checks of analyst briefings July 7.  “We are hoping that as part of this exercise both
companies and research houses are actually having a good look at
their own processes and procedures,” Armour said. Companies
suspected of selective briefing won’t necessarily be targeted
for spot checks as ASIC would have investigated them already,
and some of the businesses were picked as examples of best
disclosure practice, she said.  ASIC will alert companies selected for the spot checks and
“it would be appropriate” for them to share with analysts the
fact that the regulator is listening in, Armour said. All the
companies involved end their fiscal years in June and will be
presenting annual results during August, she said.  ‘Smoking Gun’  “I don’t think they’re trying to catch someone with a
smoking gun,” Evie Bruce, a partner at lawyers King & Wood
Mallesons in Sydney, said by phone. The regulator is “trying to
make sure, following the Newcrest incident, that they get as
much behavioral change out of it as possible,” she said.  The decision to alert companies in advance was akin to
putting up signposts on roads close to speed cameras, Bruce
said. “They’re trying to raise awareness and improve
behavior.”  Newcrest named former Australian Securities Exchange
Chairman Maurice Newman to head an internal inquiry into the
company’s disclosure and investor-relations policies, the
producer said on a June 25 conference call.  “We do not think we have done anything wrong,” Chairman
Don Mercer told reporters on the call. “If we have, we want to
know about it and I can assure you we will hold people
accountable from top to bottom.”  Investor Relations  Newcrest Chief Executive Officer Greg Robinson said
investor relations staff had held meetings prior to the
company’s announcement and insisted that they acted in
accordance with regulations.  ASIC is stepping up monitoring of the stock market, which
it gained responsibility for in August 2010, and prosecutions of
insider trading. The agency has prosecuted 28 cases of insider
trading since 2010, triple the number over the previous 15
years.  The regulator took enforcement action in the courts or
through its own processes against 371 companies during the six
months ended June, according to a twice-yearly report issued
today. Of those actions, 78 related to corporate governance,
market integrity, and financial services, with the rest relating
to small businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
