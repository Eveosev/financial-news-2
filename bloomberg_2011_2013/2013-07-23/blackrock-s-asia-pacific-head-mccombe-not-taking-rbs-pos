Mark McCombe,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Asia-Pacific chairman, told Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc he isn’t interested in the chief executive officer position and plans to stay at the world’s biggest money manager, according to a BlackRock spokesman.  McCombe, who joined BlackRock in September 2011, informed his senior staff today about his decision to stay at BlackRock, said Brian Beades, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. The Financial Times reported earlier today that McCombe was the leading external candidate for the CEO role at RBS.  Ed Canaday , a spokesman for RBS, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call after business hours.
