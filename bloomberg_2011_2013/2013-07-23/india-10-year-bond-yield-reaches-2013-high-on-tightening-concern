India ’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing
the yield to the highest level this year, on speculation the
central bank will tighten monetary policy further to arrest a
slide in the rupee.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the marginal standing
facility and the  bank rate  to 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent
last week, while keeping the key repurchase rate unchanged after
cutting it in May. The rupee fell by the most in two weeks
yesterday and lost 7.7 percent in 2013. A weaker currency makes
imports costlier and threatens to spur gains in  consumer prices ,
which have stayed close to 10 percent for more than a year.  “There are fears the central bank may reverse its policy
stance as the rupee doesn’t seem to be behaving in the desired
manner even after the recent measures,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “The bond markets are pretty jittery.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 rose one
basis point to 8.1 percent as of 10:08 a.m. in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system. That’s the highest for a
benchmark 10-year note since Dec. 28, 2012. The rate surged 41
basis points last week, the most for a 10-year government
security since December 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Policy tightening by the RBI will cool growth in  Asia ’s
third-largest economy, which is already expanding at the slowest
pace in a decade, and strain public finances, according to a
Nomura Holdings Inc. research note dated July 19. The central
bank’s next review is on July 30.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.85 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The rate surged 110 basis points last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
