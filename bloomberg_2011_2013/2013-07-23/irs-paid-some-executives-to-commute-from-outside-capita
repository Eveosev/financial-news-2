Some Internal Revenue Service
executives who live outside the  Washington  region commuted to
the capital on most work days while taxpayers paid their travel
and lodging costs, an inspector general said.  In fiscal 2011 and 2012, five IRS executives traveled for
more than half the year to a single location, mostly Washington
and in one year Atlanta, according to a report released
yesterday the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.  The IRS could save money by relocating the executives to
Washington’s national headquarters instead of paying for travel,
lodging and rental cars, said David Holmgren, deputy inspector
general for inspections and evaluations.  “We found no misconduct within the IRS on executive
travel,” Holmgren told reporters on a conference call. “When
it was to the same location over and over again, it appeared
that those individuals might not have the proper permanent place
of duty.”  The report found that IRS travel costs for executives
weren’t excessive. It focused on the agency’s top 15 executive
travelers, who made up 4 percent of all IRS executives in 2012
and accounted for $1.1 million, or 23 percent, of the travel
costs for this group.  The IRS has been criticized by lawmakers on several issues
over the past few months, including its spending on training
conferences and extra scrutiny the agency applied to Tea Party
and other groups applying for tax-exempt status.  IRS Budget  The IRS, whose budget House Republicans want to cut by 24
percent, says it has found $1 billion in savings in recent
years. Senate Democrats yesterday proposed a $12.1 billion
agency budget for fiscal 2014 -- 34 percent larger than the $9
billion being proposed by the House.  That difference will get negotiated as part of a broader --
and thus far elusive -- agreement on the government’s fiscal
2014 spending plan.  House Republicans also plan to pass a series of bills aimed
at curbing the IRS. Today, the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee is considering four such measures, including
one that that would allow taxpayers to record meetings and phone
calls with federal enforcement officials.  The inspector general’s report redacted the names and
titles of the executives whose travel was examined. One IRS
official, listed as Executive D in the report, received $161,105
in travel reimbursements in 2011 and $122,386 in 2012. In 2011,
Executive D spent 172 days and 136 nights in Washington,
followed by 187 days and 145 nights in 2012.  Policy Change  The IRS has changed its policy on executive travel, ending
the practice of executives commuting to Washington from outside
the region. An interim policy implemented in April generally
prevents employees from being on travel status more than 75
nights in any fiscal year, the report said.  “Travel by leadership is critical because the IRS is a
national operation, with about 90,000 employees located in 620
locations from coast to coast,” the agency said in a statement.
“Face-to-face interaction with employees and managers is
critical to ensure that sound practices and proper procedures
are being followed both for taxpayer service efforts and tax
compliance.”  The inspector general is conducting a second review on
whether some of the expenses for people on long-term travel
arrangements should have been taxable. That will be released
within 60 days, Holmgren said.  The House bills are H.R. 2711, H.R. 2549, H.R. 1660 and
H.R. 1541.  To contact the reporter on this story:
