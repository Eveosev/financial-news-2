Electromechanical Co. (600151) , a maker of car air conditioners and
solar-power components, plans to invest 5 billion  yuan  ($814

500 megawatts of solar farms in Ningdong town in Chinaâ€™s
northwestern region of Ningxia, the company said yesterday in a

subject to shareholder approval.  Shanghai Aerospace said last month that it has invested and
built more than 200 megawatts of solar farms in Gansu and
