Suess Microtec AG rose the most in
four months after Berenberg Bank said the microelectronics
industry supplier’s lithography unit will be the company’s main
profit-growth driver and recommended clients to buy the stock.  Suess  gained  as much as 7.7 percent, the biggest intraday
increase since March 28, and was trading up 1.6 percent to 7.85
euros at 5:02 p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the Garching, Germany-based company at 150 million euros ($199 million). Trading
volume was 2 1/2 times the three-month daily average.  Lithography, used in packaging of semiconductors, accounted
for 69 percent of 2012 sales of 164 million euros at Suess,
Berenberg said, and the entire pretax income last year. The
remainder of sales came from substrate bonder and photomask
equipment, which are also used in the microelectronics
manufacturing.  “Lithography, the bread and butter business, will continue
to generate revenues, while bonder and photomasks have the
potential to become the future darlings,” Tammy Qiu, a London-based analyst at Berenberg, said by telephone.  Qiu said she observed a recovery in the front end of the
semiconductor industry in the first quarter and initiated Suess
with a buy recommendation and a price estimate of 9.40 euros as
the manufacturer is at the “back end” of the semiconductor
fabrication process, and order recovery will normally be delayed
by three to six months.  “The profitability of the lithography division is likely
to improve in the coming quarters as the top line recovers from
the 2012 trough,” she said in a note to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
