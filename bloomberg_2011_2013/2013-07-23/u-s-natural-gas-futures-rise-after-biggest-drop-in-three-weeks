Natural gas futures gained in  New
York , reversing two days of losses.  Gas for August delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent to
$3.724 per million British thermal units in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $3.710 at 11:46
a.m. Singapore time.  The contract dropped 3 percent yesterday to $3.677, the
most in three weeks, on an outlook for milder weather, which
would reduce demand for the power-plant fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
