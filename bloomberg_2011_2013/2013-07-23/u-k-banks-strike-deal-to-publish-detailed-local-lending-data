The U.K. government struck a deal
with the main retail banks to provide local detail of their
lending to businesses.  Seven lenders, which make up about 80 percent of company
lending, will provide data on 10,000 postal codes, allowing the
government to target where there are gaps, the Treasury in
 London  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “From next year businesses will be able to see exactly
where the major banks are lending -- up to within a few streets
of their premises,” Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said in the statement. “It is a major step forward in
terms of transparency and should encourage competition by
helping smaller lenders to identify gaps in the market and
allowing businesses to hold their local bank to account where
they aren’t lending.”  Business Secretary Vince Cable used an interview in the
Financial Times published today to criticize Bank of England
policy makers, whom he labeled a “capital Taliban” for
imposing burdens on banks that are limiting lending.  They are “imposing restrictions which at this delicate
stage of recovery actually make it more difficult for companies
to operate and expand,” Cable said, according to the newspaper.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Nationwide
Building Society and  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) ’s Yorkshire
and Clydesdale units have signed up to the transparency program,
the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
