Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway
Ltd., its chairman and several fuel companies were sued in
 Chicago  on behalf of a person killed when a runaway oil-tank
train crashed and exploded in a town near  Quebec  this month.  The defendants, including Montreal, Maine & Atlantic
Chairman Edward Burkhardt, failed to take measures that would
have prevented the accident, according to the lawsuit filed by
Annick Roy, special administrator of the estate of Jean-Guy
Veilleux, who was killed in the explosion. The complaint was
filed in Cook County Circuit Court on July 22.  An unattended parked train with 72 tankers filled with
crude oil rolled downhill into the town of Lac-Megantic after 1
a.m. on July 6. More than 20 tank cars derailed, crashed and
exploded, killing 47 people. An estimated 1.5 million gallons of
crude oil were spilled in the crash, according to the complaint.  Montreal, Maine & Atlantic “carelessly and negligently
failed to train its employees to properly set brakes when trains
are left unattended,” the complaint states.  Burkhardt didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment
on the suit yesterday.  The case is Roy v. Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway, 2013-LOO8272, Circuit Court of Cook County,  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
