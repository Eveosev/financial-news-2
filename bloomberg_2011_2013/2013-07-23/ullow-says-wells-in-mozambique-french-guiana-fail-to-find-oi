Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer, said wells in Mozambique and French Guiana failed to
make discoveries.  The Cachalote-1 exploration well off the coast of
Mozambique, drilled with operator  Statoil ASA (STL)  and others,
encountered gas that isn’t commercial and didn’t find oil,
Tullow said in a statement today. The company is searching for
oil close to where others have made the century’s biggest
natural gas discoveries off the East African coast.  “The potential for discovering oil in this region
remains,” said Exploration Director Angus McCoss. “We will
integrate this valuable data into our regional model to improve
our chances of unlocking the oil play potential offshore
Mozambique.”  Tullow has declined more than 11 percent this year after a
previous exploration well in  French Guiana  failed to find
significant oil in April and projects in Ethiopia were delayed.
The setbacks blemished the company’s record of exploration
success in Kenya and Ghana, where its Jubilee discovery in 2010
opened up a new oil province.  In South America, the GM-ES-4 exploration well in French
Guiana, where Tullow found the country’s first crude with the
Zaedyus discovery in 2011, revealed no hydrocarbons, it said
today.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is the operator on that block and
 Total SA (FP)  also owns a stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
