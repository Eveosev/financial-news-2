The Australian and New Zealand
dollars extended gains to a third day as rising commodity prices
and a drop in volatility supported demand for higher-yielding
assets.  The Aussie strengthened versus most of its 16 major
counterparts after gold prices climbed to a one-month high
yesterday, while  iron ore  remained near the highest since April.
New Zealand’s kiwi dollar traded near the strongest in a month
after a measure of volatility for the currency touched the
lowest since May. The equivalent gauge for  Australia ’s currency
dropped to the least in eight weeks.  “The Aussie’s done pretty well overnight,” said Ray Attrill, the Sydney-based global co-head of currency strategy at
National Australia Bank Ltd. “Helping the Aussie is a big jump
in gold prices. Declining volatility is giving a little bit of
support to higher-yielding currencies as well.”  The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to 92.57 U.S. cents
as of 10:46 a.m. in Sydney after rising 0.9 percent over the
previous two days. It fell 0.1 percent to 92.12 yen.  New
Zealand ’s currency gained 0.2 percent to 79.81 U.S. cents after
touching 79.91 on July 19, the highest since June 19. It was
little changed at 79.40 yen.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (CRY)  of raw materials
closed at 291.04 yesterday, the highest since May 9.  Gold was at $1,334 per ounce after touching $1,339.49
yesterday, the most since June 20, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The price of  iron ore , Australia’s biggest export, was at
$131.50 a metric ton yesterday after climbing to $131.90 on July
18, the strongest level since April 30, according to a gauge
from The Steel Index Ltd.  One-month volatility for the kiwi touched 11.5 percent, a
level unseen since May 17. The equivalent rate for the Aussie
dropped to as low as 11.1 percent, the least since May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
