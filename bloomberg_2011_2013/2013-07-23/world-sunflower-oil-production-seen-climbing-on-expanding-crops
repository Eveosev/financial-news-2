World production of sunflower oil
will rise in the coming season as larger flower crops in  Russia 
and  Ukraine  boost processing margins, Oil World said.  Output of the oil will climb to 14.7 million metric tons in
the year through September 2014 from 13.6 million tons in 2012-13, the Hamburg-based industry researcher wrote today in an e-mailed report. Production was a record 15.1 million tons in
2011-12, Oil World said.  Demand for sunflower oil may rise by 500,000 to 600,000
tons in 2013-14, trailing gains in production as supplies of
competing vegetable oils expand, according to Oil World. That
will boost sunflower-oil stockpiles, it said.  “Assuming that the growth of domestic usage will be below
that of production, primarily in Ukraine and partly also in
Russia, we expect a pronounced recovery of world sunflower-oil
export supplies next season,” Oil World wrote.  Increased supply will benefit “price-sensitive markets”
including India,  Egypt  and  Iran , according to the researcher.  Farmers in Ukraine may harvest 9.4 million tons of the
oilseed and Russia will produce 8.6 million tons, with increased
output “shifting bargaining power back to the crusher and
allowing a strong pickup of domestic processing in both
countries,” the researcher said.  Sunflower-seed prices in the  Black Sea region  dropped to
$420 a ton as of July 18 from $440 a week earlier, compared with
$604 in July 2012, Oil World wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
