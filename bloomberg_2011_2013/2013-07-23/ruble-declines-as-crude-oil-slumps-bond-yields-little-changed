The ruble weakened for a second day
as crude oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, dropped and yields on
the nation’s dollar bonds rose.  The ruble depreciated 0.1 percent versus the dollar to
32.3830 by 6 p.m. in Moscow after a 1 percent advance last week.
The currency slid 0.1 percent to 37.0242 against the dollar-euro
basket and was steady against the euro at 42.6870. The yield on
Russia’s dollar bond maturing in March 2030 rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.789 percent.  The ruble rallied last week as investors speculated that
the Federal Reserve will keep stimulus measures in place,
boosting appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets. Oil fell
as much as 1.4 percent to $105.46 per barrel in  New York  today
as a Bloomberg survey of economists showed that the  Federal
Reserve  will pare stimulus in September. The oil and natural-gas
industries contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s budget
revenue.  “There are very few growth triggers right now,” Igor Akinshin, foreign exchange trader at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow, said
by phone. “Oil isn’t offering support for the ruble.”  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers last week that
the central bank’s $85 billion of monthly bond purchases “could
be reduced more quickly or expanded” depending on the pace of
recovery in the U.S.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Emerging Currencies Index retreated
0.1 percent to 91.303.  To contact the reporter on this story:
