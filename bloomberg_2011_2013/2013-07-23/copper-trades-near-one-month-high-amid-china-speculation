biggest consumer, may ready to step in to boost growth.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,035.25 a metric ton at 11:18

news organizations reported, signaling the nation will act to
support expansion if needed. China’s stocks gained today, with
the benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rising as much as 2.1
percent, the most in almost two weeks.  “Market participants believe that the Chinese government
will take actions when they think necessary to boost the
economy,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co.
in Shanghai. “Copper is poised to test $7,100 near term.”  Copper for delivery in September on the Comex was little
