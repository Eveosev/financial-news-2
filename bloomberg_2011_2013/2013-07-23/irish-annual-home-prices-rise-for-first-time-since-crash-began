Irish annual home  prices  rose in
June for the first time in more than five years, signaling the
worst may be over in the biggest real estate crash in Western
Europe since the financial crisis began.  Home prices  nationwide increased 1.2 percent in June from a
year earlier, the first gain since January 2008, and climbed the
 same amount  on a monthly basis, the  Central Statistics Office 
said on its website today. Dublin residential prices rose 4.2
percent in the period from a year earlier, with apartment values
in the Irish capital climbing 9.7 percent.  Irish home prices are still 50 percent lower than the peak
of the nation’s property bubble in 2007. The real estate crash
destroyed the nation’s financial system, with five of the six
biggest banks taken over by the state. Some signs of life have
emerged in the market in the past 18 months, with buyers
including Blackstone Group LP acquiring real estate in Ireland.  “From a sentiment perspective, it’s a positive and it’ll
probably encourage more activity,” said Juliet Tennent, an
economist at  Goodbody Stockbrokers  in Dublin. “It is down
basically to a lack of supply” in Dublin, she said.  On an annual basis, Dublin home prices have gained for six
consecutive months, the CSO said. Property website Daft.ie said
last month that residential property prices in South County
Dublin rose 12 percent from the previous year in the second
quarter, while prices overall in Dublin gained 5.3 percent
during the period, the strongest growth since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
