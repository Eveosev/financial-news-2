Acciona SA (ANA)  and  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) ’s
contract to privatize the water supply in Barcelona is still in
effect and has not been annulled by Catalonia’s Superior Court,
the Acciona-led group said today.  The 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) contract signed last year
“remains a legally effective contract” and the venture plans
to manage the city’s waters for the next 50 years, the renewable
energy company said. The shares rose as much as 5.6 percent in
Madrid trading, the most since April 10.  Catalonia’s court ruling on July 19 that sided with a
challenge by  Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona  to nullify
the contract ruled on precautionary measures and wasn’t a final
judgment, Alcobendas, Spain-based Acciona said in the statement.  Acciona and BTG also said any ruling is subject to appeal
before the Supreme Court. There was no answer at the court press
office when called this afternoon for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
