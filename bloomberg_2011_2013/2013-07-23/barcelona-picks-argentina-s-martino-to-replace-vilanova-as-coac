Barcelona said it plans to hire
Gerardo “Tata” Martino on a two-year contract to replace Tito
Vilanova, who stepped down as coach because of illness.  Martino, 50, is from the same Argentine city of Rosario as
Barcelona’s three-time world player of the year Lionel Messi.
Martino’s last coaching job was at Newell’s Old Boys.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
