The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 1 basis point to 126.5 basis
points as of 9:22 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge has declined 51.3 basis points from its
highest level this year reached on June 24, and is heading for
the lowest close since June 5, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 to 113 as of
10:05 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia Bank Ltd. prices show.
The benchmark has plunged 36.5 from its 2013 peak last month,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 92 basis
points as of 8:48 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
