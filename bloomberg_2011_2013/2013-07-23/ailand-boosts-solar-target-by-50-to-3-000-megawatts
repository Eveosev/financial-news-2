Thailand  will build 3,000 megawatts
of solar power capacity by 2021, 50 percent more than previously
announced, after approving new subsidized rates for rooftop and
village-based projects.  The government will work with the Village Fund, a state-run
microcredit provider, to develop 800 megawatts of community-owned photovoltaic plants by the end of 2014, the Ministry of
Energy said in a July 16 statement.  In addition, 200 megawatts of rooftop installations built
by the end of the year will be eligible for the special rates,
it said. Half must be built on residential homes.  Thailand follows Europe and  Japan  in offering feed-in
tariffs, or fixed rates above the wholesale price of power, to
attract investment into renewable energy. The country, which
relies on fossil fuels for 80 percent of its energy consumption,
seeks to build 13,927 megawatts of clean-energy capacity by
2021.  The ministry announced tariffs as high as 6,960 baht ($225)
per megawatt-hour for the smallest rooftop projects. Thatâ€™s
about 57 percent above the global average for crystalline
photovoltaic projects, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The projects will sell their power to the government under
25-year contracts. Village-owned projects will get paid as much
as 9,750 baht per megawatt hour at the beginning before the
tariff levels off to 4,500 baht per megawatt hour by the end of
the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
