Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a metallurgical-coal producer, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent from 12.5
cents as a condition for amending a $2.73 billion credit pact.  The move was among changes to covenants agreed with
lenders, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said today in a
filing.  Walter’s net senior secured leverage will rise to more than
5.5 times this quarter, the level needed to remain in compliance
with the debt agreement, Benjamin Nelson, a New York-based
analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a June 19 report.  Second-quarter metallurgical coal output was about 2.9
million metric tons, about 7 percent more than in the preceding
period, Walter said in a separate statement. Cash production
costs fell more than 10 percent in the same comparison, it said.
The company didn’t provide year-earlier numbers.  “The short-term outlook for global met coal pricing
remains depressed,” Chief Executive Officer Walt Scheller said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
