Manufacturing in the region covered
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond unexpectedly shrank in
July as sales and orders weakened.  The central bank’s fifth district factory  index , which
covers North Carolina,  South Carolina , the  District of Columbia ,
Maryland, Virginia and most of  West Virginia , fell to minus 11
this month from a revised 7 in June. The median  forecast  of 10
economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected the index would
improve to 9. Measures lower than zero signal contraction.  The Richmond Fed’s factory index stands in contrast to
improvements in other regions. The  New York  Fed’s  general
economic gauge  climbed in July to a five-month high, while the
Philadelphia Fed’s measure increased to the highest level since
March 2011.  The Richmond Fed’s gauge of factory  sales  fell to minus 15
in July from 11 the prior month, today’s report showed. The six-month outlook for shipments climbed to 24 from a June reading of
21.  The index of current new orders declined to minus 15 from
9, while the employment measure held at zero.  Data for the Richmond Fed’s factory gauge represented
responses from 91 of the approximately 220 firms surveyed each
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
