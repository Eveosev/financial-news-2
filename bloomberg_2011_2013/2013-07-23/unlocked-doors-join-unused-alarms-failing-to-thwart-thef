Millions of Americans who invest in
deadbolts and home alarms are failing to benefit from those
devices and leaving their property vulnerable to theft,
Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. said.  Twenty percent of homeowners with alarm systems fail to
activate them during the day, even though that’s when most
thefts occur, according to a Nationwide survey released today.
About 25 percent of Americans said they left their front doors
unlocked when leaving the house at least once in the past year.  “Preventive measures only work if you use them,” Pete
Lore, associate vice president of property technical claims at
Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide, said in a statement.  June, July and August have the highest burglary rates of
the year, according to Nationwide, the  seventh-largest  U.S. home
insurer. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that
Americans were the  victims  of about 2.19 million burglaries in
2011, an increase of about 0.9 percent from a year earlier.  More than a third of homeowners said they tend to leave
ground-floor windows unlocked. Forty-one percent of those age 18
to 34 said they post social media photos or updates when they’re
on vacation, revealing their absence.  The survey was conducted by Harris Interactive of 1,005
Americans with homeowners or condominium insurance, Nationwide
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
