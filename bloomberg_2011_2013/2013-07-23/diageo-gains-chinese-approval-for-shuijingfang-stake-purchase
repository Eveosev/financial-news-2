Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s largest
liquor company, consolidated control over Sichuan  Shuijingfang (600779) 
Co., a maker of the popular Chinese spirit baijiu, as it seeks
to expand in the country.  Diageo got approval from Chinese authorities to buy the
remaining 47 percent of Sichuan Chengdu Shuijingfang Group
Company Ltd. from its partners, it said today in a statement.
The acquisition of the stake in the related joint venture, at a
cost of about 233 million pounds ($358 million), will give
Diageo full indirect control over 39.7 percent of Shuijingfang,
the listed maker of baijiu.  The purchase is “a milestone in the journey we began with
our partners six years ago,” Gilbert Ghostine, president of
Diageo Asia Pacific, said in the statement.  Diageo, which competes with international companies
including  Pernod Ricard SA (RI)  in China, is seeking to expand in the
country’s local spirits category as booming economic growth
increases alcohol consumption. Baijiu, a clear spirit usually
made from sorghum or rice, is popular in China, where only about
2 percent of the volume of spirits consumed are foreign-made
liquors like whisky or cognac.  Shuijingfang shares rose 3.1 percent at the close in
Shanghai. Diageo’s  shares  were little changed at 2,039.5 pence
at 9:51 a.m. in London.  Vermilion Partners acted as transaction adviser to Diageo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
