Cytokinetics Inc. (CYTK) , the developer of
an experimental drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said it
will increase the number of patients in a trial of the therapy
after some were given a placebo by mistake.  After talking with regulators, Cytokinetics expanded the
trial to include about 680 patients and updated the statistical
methods section. The changes are expected to increase trial
costs by about $5 million this year and next, the South  San
Francisco , California-based company said today in a statement.  A programming error controlling study drug assignment
caused 58 patients that should have been treated with the drug,
tirasemtiv, to instead be given a placebo, Cytokinetics said
July 8. More than 500 patients have been enrolled so far in the
trial, which is in the second of three phases generally required
for regulatory approval.  The company said enrollment is expected to be completed in
the second half of this year, with results available in early
2014. ALS, or  Lou Gehrig â€™s disease, is a fatal breakdown of the
central nervous system with no known cure.  Cytokinetics fell 4.5 percent to $13.10 at the close in  New
York . The shares have tripled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
