All-Pro linebacker  Von Miller  of the
Denver Broncos is appealing a four-game National Football League
suspension, according to the NFL Players Association.  Miller, who had 18 1/2 sacks last season, violated the
NFL’s substance abuse policy, ESPN reported yesterday, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  “I know I did nothing wrong,” Miller said yesterday on
 Twitter . “I’m sure this’ll be resolved fairly.”  NFLPA spokesman George Atallah  said via Twitter  that the
union is “working closely” with Miller to appeal the ban.  Under NFL rules, Miller would face a four-game suspension
only if he tested positive twice for illegal substances.  Atallah didn’t say what Miller tested positive for, yet
said in a separate Twitter post that his case doesn’t involve
the NFL’s steroids and related substances policy. The NFL won’t
comment unless Miller’s appeal fails, per league policy.  Miller, 24, has totaled 30 sacks over his first three
seasons with the Broncos, the fourth-most in the league since
2011, when he was voted the NFL’s defensive rookie of the year.  The Broncos are scheduled to open the regular season
against the Super Bowl champion  Baltimore Ravens  on Sept. 5 and
then face the  New York  Giants,  Oakland Raiders  and Philadelphia
Eagles in their next three games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
