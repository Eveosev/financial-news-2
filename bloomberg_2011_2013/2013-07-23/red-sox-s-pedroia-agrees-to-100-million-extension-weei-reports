The Boston  Red Sox  agreed to a
contract extension with  Dustin Pedroia  that will pay the All-Star second baseman about $100 million over seven years,
according to WEEI Radio in Boston.  The deal will begin in 2015, after the guaranteed years of
Pedroia’s current six-year, $40.5 million contract end, the
 radio station said , citing an unidentified person in baseball.  Pedroia, 29, the 2008 American League Most Valuable Player,
is batting .308 this season with six home runs, 25 doubles and
57 runs batted in. For his eight-year Major League Baseball
career, he’s a .303 hitter with 96 homers and 466 RBIs. He’s
also a two-time Gold Glove winner as the best second baseman in
the AL.  The Red Sox lead the AL East at 60-41, one-half game ahead
of the Tampa Bay Rays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
