Pope Francis began his first trip abroad with an open-air drive through Rio de Janeiro’s historic center as throngs on the streets screamed, waved and jockeyed for a view of the Roman Catholic Church’s leader.  Francis was greeted at the airport yesterday by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff ahead of the church’s World Youth Day, which organizers say will draw as many as 2.5 million participants. Abandoning the Vatican’s “Popemobile,” the 76-year-old pontiff traveled to the city cathedral in a Fiat hatchback, greeting supporters through open windows as some jumped on the vehicle. People crowded building steps in the city center and climbed into trees to glimpse his passing.  “It’s so exciting to see the pope in our country,” Antonio Dantas, a 24-year-old seminary student from northeastern  Brazil , said yesterday as he balanced barefoot atop a fire hydrant. “I hope he brings a message of peace to all of us who make up the Catholic religion, but also people of other religions.”  This week’s trip may reveal more about the direction in which Francis, the first non-European pope in more than 1,200 years, intends to take the church, which is struggling to leave behind an era of sex-abuse and financial scandals. His messages of humility and justice for society’s most marginalized coincide with Brazilian street protests last month for better basic services and an end to corruption.  “I learned that to have access to the Brazilian people, it is necessary to enter through the door of its immense heart,” Francis, speaking in Portuguese, said in his first address. “Allow me at this point to knock softly on that door.”  ‘Make Disciples’  During the July 23-28 World Youth Day, whose  theme  is “Go and make disciples of all nations,” Francis will tour a slum, meet young inmates and celebrate three public Masses.  “I just get chills every time I see him, it’s the best,” said Laura Vandorpe, a 19-year-old student from  Ohio  who, draped in an American flag, is attending her second World Youth Day. “He’s so awesome. He’s like a grandfather. I just love him.”  Pope Francis’ visit is “the most complex police operation in Rio’s history” and entails reinforcement of normal security forces with nearly 7,000 civil and military police, Rio state’s security secretariat said. Police found a small homemade bomb near a shrine he is due to visit this week, O Globo reported, citing military police.  Molotov Cocktails  Police near the Guanabara palace, where Francis met with Rousseff, deployed tear gas against some protesters who threw Molotov cocktails and demanded the resignation of Rio state Governor Sergio Cabral, O Globo’s television channel reported.  The pope today will be resting and has no scheduled events, according to his official agenda. Tomorrow, he will fly by helicopter to Brazil’s largest shrine to the Virgin Mary, located in Sao Paulo state, where he will hold his first public Mass. The following day he will receive the keys to Rio de Janeiro and bless the flags of the 2016 Olympic Games, which will be hosted in the city, then visit the slum of Varginha.  Since becoming pope in March, the Argentine-born Francis has worked to portray himself as a man of the people, shirking the traditional robes, jewelry and even papal apartment for more spartan trappings.  Many Brazilians who turned out in the streets last month may hold Francis up as a model for their own political leaders, said Paul Freston, religion and politics professor at Wilfrid Laurier University, from his home in Campinas, Brazil. The country’s National Conference of Bishops last month declared their solidarity and support for the demonstrations, which attracted more than a million people across the nation.  “We have before us a religious leader who is sensitive to the desires of our people for social justice, for opportunity for all, and for citizen dignity,” Rousseff, standing alongside Pope Francis, said yesterday. “We fight against a common enemy: inequality, in all its forms.”  To contact the reporters on this story: David Biller in Rio de Janeiro at  dbiller1@bloomberg.net ; Juan Pablo Spinetto in Rio de Janeiro at  jspinetto@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bill Faries at  wfaries@bloomberg.net
