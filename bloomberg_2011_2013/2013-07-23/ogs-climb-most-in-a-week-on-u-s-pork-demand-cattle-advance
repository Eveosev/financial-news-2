Hog prices headed for the biggest
gain in a week as falling U.S. pork supplies signaled increased
meat demand. Cattle prices also advanced.  Warehouses  held 564.924 million pounds of pork (256,245
metric tons) as of June 30, down 4.7 percent from a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report
released after the close of regular trading yesterday.
Wholesale-pork prices have surged 21 percent this year through
yesterday.  The cold-storage figures “showed good demand in the month
of June,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services in
Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “We’ve seen a
little bit better domestic demand.”  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.6 percent to
85.775 cents a pound at 9:55 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that level would be the biggest increase
for the most-active contract since July 16.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
$1.2615 a pound on the CME. The price was down 5.1 percent this
year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.9
percent to $1.54275 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
