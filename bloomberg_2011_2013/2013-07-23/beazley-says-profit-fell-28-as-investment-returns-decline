Beazley Plc (BEZ) , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, posted a 28 percent fall in first-half profit as
returns from bond investments declined.  Net income fell to $72.1 million in the six months to June
30 compared with $100.1 million in the year-earlier period, the
Dublin-based company said in a statement today. Net investment
income fell to $300,000, from $36.1 million, Beazley said.  “The last six weeks of the half were marked by significant
rises in U.S. interest rates,” Beazley said in the statement.
“The rise in rates created mark-to-market losses in the fixed-income portfolio that canceled out the profits we had made
earlier in the year.”  Beazley said further rises in U.S. interest rates will
“suppress” earnings from investments. The company raised its
first-half dividend by 7.4 percent to 2.9 pence a share in line
with its strategy of increasing the payment by 5 percent to 10
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
