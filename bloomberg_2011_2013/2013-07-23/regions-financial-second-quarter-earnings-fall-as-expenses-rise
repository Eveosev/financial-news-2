Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , Alabama’s
largest bank, said second-quarter profit fell 8.8 percent as
expenses increased.  Earnings available to common shareholders fell to $259
million, or 18 cents a share, from $284 million, or 20 cents, a
year earlier, the Birmingham, Alabama-based lender said today in
a statement. Twenty-seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated per-share earnings of 21 cents.  While some regional lenders are bracing for a decline in
mortgage revenue amid rising interest rates, Regions Chief
Financial Officer  David Turner  said last month that the business
would continue to be “strong” for the bank. Regions is also
“relentlessly” focusing on expenses, he said. Non-interest
expenses rose 5 percent to $884 million in the second quarter.  “By continuing to execute on our business priorities, our
company is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the
economy continues to improve,” Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 56, said in the statement.  Regions has gained 46 percent this year, the third-best
performer in the 24-company KBW Bank Index, which has increased
30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
