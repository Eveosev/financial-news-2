Hong Kong   stocks  climbed, with the
benchmark index heading for the highest level in a month, after
a decline in U.S. home sales eased concern about an early exit
from economic stimulus efforts.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.7 percent to 21,561.7 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland shares climbed 1.4 percent to 9,548.92.  The  Hang Seng Index  last week capped its fourth straight
weekly gain as coal producers jumped. The gauge is down 5.5
percent this year through yesterday, the second-worst
performance among major developed markets after Greece. Shares
slid amid signs China’s growth is slowing and amid speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will taper its stimulus.  Previously owned U.S. home sales fell 1.2 percent to a 5.08
million annualized rate, the National Association of Realtors
reported yesterday in Washington. The median forecast of 79
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 5.26 million pace.  Smaller banks slid yesterday after the People’s Bank of
China scrapped the floor on the rates banks can charge customers
on July 19 while keeping a cap on deposit rates. The limit on
 mortgage rates  will stay to curb property speculation, the PBOC
said. Also unchanged was a 10 percent limit on what banks can
offer over PBOC-set deposit rates.  Materials and energy companies led  declines  this year on

times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15.4 times for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.5 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, fell 23 percent from a Feb. 1 high through

yesterday, 35 percent below its five-year average of 1.78.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The U.S.
equity index gained 0.2 percent yesterday in New York after the
housing data and weaker-than-estimated earnings from companies
including McDonald’s Corp. fueled speculation stimulus would
