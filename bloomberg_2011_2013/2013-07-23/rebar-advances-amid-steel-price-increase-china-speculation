Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose as some steel producers in  China  lifted prices and
on speculation the government may take action to boost growth.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 0.4 percent to 3,692  yuan  ($601) a
metric ton, and traded 3,688 yuan at 11:30 a.m. local time. The
most-active contract has gained 4.3 percent this month.  Hebei Iron & Steel Co. raised August hot-rolled products by
150 yuan per ton and cold-rolled by 50 yuan, Beijing News
reported. Premier  Li Keqiang ’s government sees 7 percent growth
as the bottom line for tolerance of an economic slowdown,
Chinese news organizations reported, signaling the nation will
act to support expansion if needed.  “The increase in product prices by steelmakers helped
boost rebar futures,” Ren Xinlei, analyst at Luzheng Futures
Co., said from Jinan.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port dropped 0.2
percent to $131.50 a ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index
Ltd. The average  spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,452 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from
