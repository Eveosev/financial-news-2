Hog prices rose the most in three
weeks as falling U.S. pork supplies signaled increased meat
demand. Cattle prices also advanced.  Warehouses  held 564.924 million pounds of pork (256,245
metric tons) as of June 30, down 4.7 percent from a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report
released after the close of regular trading yesterday.
Wholesale-pork prices surged 21 percent this year through
yesterday.  The cold-storage figures “showed good demand in the month
of June,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services in
Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “We’ve seen a
little bit better domestic demand.”  Hog futures for October settlement rose 1.2 percent to
close at 86.325 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest increase for a most-active
contract since June 27.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
settle at $1.259 a pound on the CME. The price is down 4.8
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.4
percent to $1.536 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
