Aviation Industry Corp. of  China ,
the country’s biggest aerospace company, agreed to buy Thielert
Aircraft Engines GmbH, focusing the insolvent German supplier
fully on powering private aircraft and away from U.S. drones.  The Chinese manufacturer’s  AVIC International Holding Ltd. (232) 
unit, which has already acquired Minnesota-based planemaker
Cirrus Aircraft and engine producer Continental Motors Inc. of
 Alabama , is adding Thielert’s civil engine business to prepare
for a domestic boom in private aviation, Bruno Kuebler,
Thielert’s insolvency administrator, said on a call with
journalists.  The sale ends five years of insolvency proceedings and
restructuring for Hamburg-based Thielert. Kuebler said Thielert
remained profitable with three German sites and just over 200
employees because of orders mainly from San Diego-based General
Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. to power drones.  General Atomics indicated potential interest in Thielert,
but AVIC offered a “‘strategic price’’ for the propeller-engine
maker, Kuebler said, declining to provide details.  Thielert had 24.5 million euros ($32.3 million) in sales
last year, the administrator said. The German manufacturer
stands to benefit from growing demand in Asia and Africa for
diesel-engine planes because of the wider availability of fuel,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
