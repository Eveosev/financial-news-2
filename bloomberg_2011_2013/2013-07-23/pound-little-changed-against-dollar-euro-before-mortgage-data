U.K. government bonds fell, with 10-year yields rising the most in two weeks, as an industry report
showing U.K. mortgage approvals increased in June added to signs
Britain’s economy is improving.  Gilts dropped along with sovereign securities in  Germany 
and the U.S. as  China ’s premier pledged economic growth of at
least 7 percent, reducing demand for the safety of fixed-income
assets. The U.K. sold 4 billion pounds ($6.14 billion) of
inflation-linked bonds through banks, paying a positive yield
for the first time since November. The pound weakened against
the euro.  “The longer and stronger the signs of U.K. economic
recovery the less likely it is we’ll see any resumption of
quantitative easing and that’s been a key factor driving gilt
yields down,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at
Bank of America Corp. in London. Europe’s “outlook has become a
bit more balanced. That particularly tends to coincide with
slightly higher safe-haven yields,” he said.  The U.K. 10-year yield climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.31 percent at the 5 p.m. close of trading
in London, the biggest increase since July 5. The 1.75 percent
bond due in September 2022 fell 0.37, or 3.70 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 95.45.  U.K. mortgage approvals increased to 37,278 in June from a
revised 36,290 the previous month, the British Bankers
Association said in a report. Gross mortgage borrowing rose to
8.9 billion pounds in June from 8.7 billion pounds in May.  Quicker Growth  U.K. economic growth doubled to 0.6 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months, according to a Bloomberg
News survey before the  government  releases the data on July 25.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s government sees 7 percent
growth as the bottom line for tolerance of an economic slowdown,
Chinese news organizations reported, signaling the nation will
act to support expansion if needed.  The German 10-year yield increased four basis points to
1.55 percent and the yield on similar-maturity Treasuries
climbed two basis points to 2.50 percent.  The U.K. 10-year yield rose to 2.59 percent on June 24, the
highest since October 2011, as the economy showed signs of
gaining momentum since returning to growth in the first quarter.
Yields have increased from 1.83 percent on Dec. 31.  BOE Decision  The Bank of England announces its next policy decision on
Aug. 1 after kept its  bond-purchase target  at 375 billion pounds
on July 4. The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee also left
the key interest rate at a record-low 0.5 percent.  The pound declined 0.2 percent to 86.03 pence per euro and
was little changed at $1.5356.  Sterling has strengthened 1.5 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro rose 2.5 percent
and the dollar climbed 0.7 percent.  “The U.K. economy will improve and that will attract
overseas investors to buy the pound and so I am reasonably
optimistic on the pound in the short term,” said Neil Jones,
head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in  London .
“Domestically and internationally we are underestimating the
recovery.”  The U.K. Debt Management Office said it sold 0.125 percent
inflation-linked bonds due in 2044 at a price of 100.922. That
is equivalent to a real yield of 0.0945 percent, compared with
minus 0.234 percent at the previous offering on May 8. Local
investors took 93 percent of the bonds, the DMO said.  The outlook for inflation climbed from the lowest in a
month, bond trading showed.  The U.K.  30-year break-even rate  widened one basis point to
3.44 percentage points after shrinking to 3.42 percentage
points, the narrowest since June 20.  The gauge measures investor expectations of price increases
over the lifetime of the debt and is derived from the yield
difference between gilts and inflation-protected securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
