Treasuries declined, snapping two
days of gains, before the government sells $35 billion of two-year notes today.  Price swings in the Treasury markets as measured by options
fell, signaling that the  Federal Reserve  can probably reduce its
stimulus program without spurring volatility in the  bond market .
Three-month implied volatility on 10-year  interest-rate swaps 
dropped to a one-month low of 89.8 basis points. The Fed will
begin trimming its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases in
September, according to economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.51 percent at 10:12 a.m. London
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent note due in May 2023 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face
amount, to 93 15/32. The yield has fallen from 2.75 percent on
July 8, the highest level since August 2011.  The two-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.34
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.43 percent the
last time the securities were sold, on June 25.  Demand weakened at the previous two offerings of the notes.
The  bid-to-cover  ratios, which gauge demand by comparing the
amount bid with the amount offered, at the June and May auctions
were 3.05 and 3.04, the two lowest since February 2011, Treasury
data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
