The U.S. Treasury Department
designated two Mexican nationals today for their ties to
 Mexico ’s Los Zetas drug-trafficking organization.  The Treasury identified the two individuals as Jose Odilon
Ramirez Perales and Ismael Lopez Guerrero. They’re involved in
smuggling funds between the U.S. and Mexico, the department said
in a statement.  The actions generally prohibit U.S. citizens from doing
financial transactions with them and freezes assets they may
have under U.S. jurisdiction, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
