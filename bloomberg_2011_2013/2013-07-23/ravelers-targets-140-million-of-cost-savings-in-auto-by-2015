Travelers Cos., the lone property
insurer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , said it is
targeting $140 million in annual cost reductions at an auto unit
amid competition that is pressuring profit margins.  The plan is expected to be fully implemented in 2015 and
will result in $16 million of costs, $10 million of which will
count against earnings in the three months ending Sept. 30, the
New York-based insurer said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
