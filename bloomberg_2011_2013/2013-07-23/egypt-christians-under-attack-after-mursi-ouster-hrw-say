Christians in  Egypt  have been
attacked several times since the ouster of Islamist President
Mohamed Mursi,  Human Rights Watch  said, calling for a government
investigation.  The worst incident occurred on July 5 when four Christians
were beaten to death by a mob in a village near Luxor in
southern Egypt, while police failed to intervene during 17 hours
of violence, the New York-based group said in a report published
today. It cited at least six attacks on Christians across the
country since the military’s July 3 intervention.  “Authorities in Egypt should ensure that prosecutors
promptly and impartially investigate allegations of sectarian
violence,” HRW said. “Police officers who fail to act
appropriately should be held to account.”  Christian and secular groups joined a wave of street
protests that led up to Mursi’s overthrow by the army, calling
for his removal on the grounds he was seeking to consolidate
Islamist control of the country. Leading Christian clerics
endorsed the army’s action.  Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood has refused to join the interim
government installed by the military, and has held daily
protests to demand his restoration. They have frequently
escalated into violent clashes with Brotherhood opponents or
security forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
