MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that raised more than $1 billion in capital this year,
rallied after reporting its first quarterly  profit  since 2010.  MGIC gained 10 percent to $7.35 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York .
The Milwaukee-based firm  surged  176 percent this year as it
replenished capital by selling shares and debt.  “We expect profitability metrics at MTG to gradually
improve,” Jason Stewart, an analyst at Compass Point Research &
Trading LLC., wrote in a research note today, using MGIC’s
ticker symbol. “The primary driver of the earnings beat was a
lower incurred loss.”  Net income was $12.4 million, or 4 cents a share, in the
second quarter compared with a loss of $273.9 million, or $1.36,
a year earlier, MGIC said in a statement today. Claims costs
tied to soured home loans shrank to $196.3 million in the
quarter from $551.4 million in the same period a year earlier,
as delinquencies declined.  “I am pleased with the credit quality and performance of
the new business we have written since 2009,” Chief Executive
Officer Curt Culver, 61, said in the statement.  Mortgage insurers cover losses when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs. Expenses tied to the  housing
crash  pushed some guarantors from the business and drained
capital at companies including MGIC and rival  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)   Radian, which is scheduled to report second-quarter results
tomorrow, advanced 4.1 percent to $13.83. The Philadelphia-based
company also sold shares and debt this year.  Genworth Financial
Inc. (GNW) , which sells  life insurance  in addition to mortgage
guaranties, rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
