South Korea ’s won rose for the third
day after the government said it is looking to cut a home-purchase tax and as foreign investors bought more local stocks
than they sold. Sovereign bonds fell.  The government will submit detailed steps of the plan to
parliament by the end of August, the ministries of finance, land
and public administration said in a statement yesterday. South
Korea proposed in April to give tax breaks to home buyers and
cut borrowing costs to boost sales. The benchmark Kospi Index
rose today as overseas investors bought a net 82 billion won
($73 million) of local stocks, exchange data show.  “Foreign funds are net-buying Korean shares and the tax-break proposal could boost investor sentiment,” said Jeon Seung Ji, an analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “The won’s
rise won’t be big as market volume has been thin.”  The currency rose 0.2 percent to 1,116.96 per dollar as of
10:04 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,115.45, the strongest level since July 17. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, fell 15 basis points to 7.32
percent, the lowest level since May 9.  Home transactions fell 14 percent to 47,288 in February,
the least for that month in seven years, land ministry data
show. January’s total of 27,070 deals was the second-lowest for
any month dating back to 2006, when the data was first released.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government notes due June
2016 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.87
percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
