Denso Corp. (6902)  is in talks to invest as
much as 2 billion yen ($20 million) in  Sharp Corp. (6753) , a person
familiar with the plans said.  Denso is interested in Sharp’s safety-related technologies
and may make a decision in the next month or two, the person
said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private.
Representatives at Denso and Sharp declined to comment beyond
saying nothing has been decided.  Sharp is searching for investors to replenish capital after
dwindling demand for televisions led the company to two straight
years of record losses. Denso,  Lixil Group Corp. (5938)  and  Makita
Corp. (6586)  are among potential investors, the Nikkei newspaper
reported last week.  Denso was among a group of companies -- including Toyota
and Nissan Motor Co. -- that bailed out automotive-chip maker
 Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  for $1.8 billion last year. Denso’s
portion was 1 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
