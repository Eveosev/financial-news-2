Seasonal temperatures are expected
to predominate in the eastern U.S. through the first week of
August, damping energy demand, said Matt Rogers, president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Readings will probably remain near normal along the East
Coast and parts of the South until Aug. 6, said Rogers in
Bethesda,  Maryland . In the Great Lakes states of Michigan,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois, readings may dip
about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) below normal from now
until Aug. 1.  “No major cooling demand concerns are currently detected
from the Midwest and East over the next two weeks,” Rogers said
in a note to clients today. “There are brief risks for slightly
warmer weather ahead of each cool front, especially on the East
Coast, but these warm-ups are much weaker and diluted by storms
compared to last week’s powerhouse heat show.”  High temperatures and humidity increased energy use last
week in the eastern U.S. and Midwest as residents turned to air
conditioning to keep cool.  The normal average temperature for Aug. 1 is 78 in New
York, 73 in  Boston , 78 in Philadelphia, 79 in  Washington  and 74
in  Chicago , according to  MDA Weather Services  in Gaithersburg,
Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
