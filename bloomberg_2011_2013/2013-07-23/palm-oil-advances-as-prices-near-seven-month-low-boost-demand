Palm oil climbed for a second day as
prices near the lowest level in more than seven months spurred
demand from importers.  The contract for delivery in October gained as much as 0.5
percent to 2,283 ringgit ($720) a metric ton on the Bursa
 Malaysia  Derivatives and ended the morning session at 2,277
ringgit. Futures lost 5.4 in the past two weeks, reaching 2,222
ringgit on July 16, the lowest price for most-active futures
since Dec. 13. Palm for local physical delivery in August was at
2,335 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “At these levels buyers are happy to buy,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and commodities at RHB
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. There is no “aggressive
buying due to expectations of higher production” in the coming
months, he said.  Palm oil  output  may accelerate from August to October
leading to a buildup in stockpiles in Malaysia, the world’s
second-largest producer, Thomas Mielke, executive director of
Hamburg-based researcher Oil World, said yesterday. Production
is typically highest from July to October each year.  Soybean oil for delivery in December climbed 0.5 percent to
45.54 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in November were little changed at $12.875 a bushel.
Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 0.2 percent to
5,628  yuan  ($917) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil advanced 0.7 percent to 7,308 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
