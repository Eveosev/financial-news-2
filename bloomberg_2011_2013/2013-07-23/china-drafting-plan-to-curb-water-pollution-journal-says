China  is drafting a plan to prevent
water pollution as part of its efforts to protect the
environment, the China Securities Journal said.  The plan may be submitted to the State Council by early
August and include a quota system for discharging waste water,
the newspaper reported, citing people it didn’t identify from
the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Two calls to the
ministry’s press office went unanswered.  The government won’t approve new industrial projects until
quotas are allocated, the Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
