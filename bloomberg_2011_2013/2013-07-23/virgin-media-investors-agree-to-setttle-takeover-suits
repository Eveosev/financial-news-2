Virgin Media  Inc. and investors
agreed to settle lawsuits over the company’s $16 billion sale to
Liberty Global Plc completed last month.  Liberty Global, controlled by billionaire John Malone,
agreed in February to buy Virgin Media for cash and stock in the
biggest media deal since the merger that created Thomson Reuters
Corp.  Shareholders sued New York-based Virgin Media in state
 Supreme Court  in Manhattan in February seeking to stop the sale.
Lawyers for both sides engaged in “extensive arms-length
negotiations” and reached an agreement in principle to settle
the suits in May, according to a court filing dated today.  As a result of the settlement, which needs court approval,
London-based Liberty Global and Virgin Media agreed to
modifications of terms of the transaction, including a reduction
of a termination fee to $370 million from $470 million, which
was reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in May, according to the court document.  The case is In Re Virgin Media Inc. Shareholders
Litigation, 650537/2013,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
