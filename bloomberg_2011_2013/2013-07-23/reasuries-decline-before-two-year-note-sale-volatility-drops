Treasuries fell for the first time
in three days as the U.S. prepared to sell $35 billion of two-year notes amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  is moving closer
to winding down its asset-purchase program.  Price swings in the Treasury market as measured by options
declined, signaling the central bank can probably reduce its
stimulus program without increasing volatility. The Fed will
start trimming its  $85 billion  in monthly bond purchases in
September, according to a survey of economists by  Bloomberg News 
released today. The auction is part of $99 billion of notes the
government is scheduled to sell this week.  “The market is settling back into the fact that tapering
is going to occur,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in
New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The market is
defining 2.50 percent on 10s as a level that kind of makes
sense. The two-year auction should go well -- front-end paper is
in demand.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.50 percent at 12:13 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2023 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to
93 1/2. The yield has dropped from 2.75 percent on July 8, the
highest level since August 2011.  Treasuries handed investors a loss of 2.2 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares returned 12 percent
including reinvested dividends.  Net Longs  Treasuries investors raised bets the price of the
securities will gain in price, becoming the most bullish since
November, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The proportion of  net longs , or bets the securities will
rise, increased to 10 percentage points in the week ending
yesterday, from 8 percentage points the previous week. The
figure is the highest level of bullish bets since Nov. 12. The
percentage of outright longs rose to 23 percent from 21 percent.  The percentage of outright shorts, or bets the securities
will fall in value, was unchanged from the previous week at 13
percent. Investors cut neutral bets to 64 percent from 66
percent.  The two-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.34
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.43 percent at
the previous sale of the securities on June 25.  Demand Falls  Demand weakened at the previous two two-year offerings. The
 bid-to-cover  ratios, which gauge demand by comparing the amount
bid with the amount offered, at the June and May auctions were
3.05 and 3.04, the two lowest since February 2011, according to
Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.]  The three auctions this week will raise a total of $30.6
billion of new cash with $59.4 billion in securities maturing.  “There’s money that needs a home and a lot of times it
just gets recycled,” said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate
strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in New York, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “That helps the auctions go
just fine.”  The yield on current  two-year notes  rose one basis point to
0.31 percent. The rate will climb to 0.41 percent by year-end,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  An index measuring 10-day price  volatility  in Treasuries
dropped to 2.44 percent yesterday from 7.49 percent on July 8,
which was the highest since November 2011.  The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate Move Index
fell to 72.62 yesterday, the lowest level in almost two months.
The figure is down from 117.89 basis points on July 5, which was
the most since December 2010. The one-year average is 64.7.  ‘Much Calmer’  “The market has been much calmer,” said Annalisa Piazza,
a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in  London . “Investors
have finally got the right message that, while the Fed may
reduce the amount of bonds it purchases in coming months, its
policy will remain accommodative.”  None of the 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg from July
18-22 predicted the  Federal Open Market Committee  will begin
reducing its monthly purchases at its meeting scheduled for July
30-31.  In its first reduction, the FOMC will probably cut monthly
bond buying to $65 billion, according to the survey. Economists
see purchases divided between $35 billion in Treasuries and $30
billion in mortgage-backed securities.  The central bank will purchase up to $3.75 billion in
Treasuries today maturing between April 2019 and June 2020.  Bernanke’s View  The Fed has kept its target for overnight bank lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. It has said
it will consider raising the  target  when the  unemployment rate 
falls to 6.5 percent, versus 7.6 percent as of June.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told congressional panels last
week it was “way too early to make any judgment” about whether
the biggest buyer of Treasuries will start cutting back in
September.  Benchmark yields jumped 17 basis points June 19 after
Bernanke said the central bank may start dialing down its
unprecedented bond-buying program this year and end it entirely
in mid-2014 if the economy finally achieves sustainable growth.  Ten-year notes rose yesterday as an industry report showed
purchases of existing homes fell 1.2 percent to a 5.08 million
annual rate, boosting demand for safer assets.  New home sales 
rose for a fourth month in June, based on a separate survey
before the Commerce Department releases the data tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
