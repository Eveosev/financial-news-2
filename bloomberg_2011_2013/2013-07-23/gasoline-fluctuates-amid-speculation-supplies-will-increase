Gasoline futures advanced on
speculation that wholesalers bought more fuel last week amid
concern that higher crude prices will raise gasoline costs.  Futures gained 0.4 cent after earlier falling as much as
1.2 percent. West Texas Intermediate crude rallied to a 16-month
high last week, boosting gasoline to the best performance this
month in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 commodities.
Gasoline slid 2.2 percent yesterday on optimism refinery unit
shutdowns along the East Coast will soon be resolved.  “I think demand was strong last week and my view is there
is going to be a draw in inventories,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .
“Wholesalers watch the futures.”  August-delivery gasoline settled at $3.0591 on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 3.8 percent below
the 100-day average at 3:31 p.m.  Prices rose as high as $3.0826 before paring gains near the
2:30 p.m. close of floor trading.  “It’s not a big move today,” said Jason Schenker,
president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
energy consultant. “It’s probably some pretty standard
volatility with some market participants looking to mitigate
some price surprise tomorrow” after the inventory report, he
said.  August gasoline’s premium to September narrowed 0.68 cent
to 3.01 cents a gallon, down from 8.13 cents on July 16.  Inventory Survey  The Energy Information Administration may report tomorrow
that gasoline inventories rose 1.8 million barrels last week,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  The EIA reported that gasoline supplies rose 3.06 million
barrels in the week ended July 12 to 224.1 million. Demand sank
6.1 percent from a week earlier, while over the past four weeks
it was 2.3 percent above a year ago.  The total inventory increase came as refiners used 92.8
percent of capacity, the highest level in almost a year.
Gasoline output fell 5.6 percent to 9.05 million barrels a day,
the lowest rate in seven weeks, as refiners shut process units
for unplanned outages.  “The selling has dried up but if we keep rates up, we’ll
just end up with more products in storage,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Everyone is waiting for the inventory
report.”  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 17 cents to
$19.99 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent gained 18 cents to
$18.80 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to $3.666 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery gained 0.29
cent to $3.0693 a gallon on volume that was 17 percent below the
100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
slipped 13 cents to $21.82 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
narrowed 11 cents to $20.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
