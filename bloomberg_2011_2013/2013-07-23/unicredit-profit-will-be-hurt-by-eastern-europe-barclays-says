UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s plans to increase
profit will be hit by the economic slowdown in central and
eastern  Europe  because the region contributes more than half of
pretax profits, according to  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   “We see slowing economic growth in the region combined
with interest rate movements as headwinds to the net interest
margin, volume growth and credit quality,” Antonio Rizzo and
Rohith Chandra-Rajan, analysts at Barclays in London, wrote in
an e-mailed report today. They lowered their earnings estimates
for the bank by 8 percent this year and 4 percent in 2014.  UniCredit is reviewing strategies in central and eastern
Europe to strengthen its finances as Italy’s longest recession
is hurting earnings in its main market. Chief Executive Officer
 Federico Ghizzoni  said in March that the bank will reduce its
financial projections because of the recession in Italy and the
rest of Europe.  Barclays expects UniCredit to report weaker net interest
income this year, a third of which is generated in emerging
market economies in Europe. UniCredit’s unit in  Turkey  will be
affected by higher funding costs in the period, while the Polish
division will probably see deposit-led margin contraction and
limited volume growth, the analysts said.  UniCredit, which posted net income of 449 million euros
($592 million) in the first quarter, will report second-quarter
earnings on Aug. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
