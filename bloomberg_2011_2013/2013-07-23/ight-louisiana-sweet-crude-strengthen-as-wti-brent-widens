Light Louisiana Sweet crude
strengthened relative to West Texas Intermediate for the first
time in four trading days as the U.S. benchmark lost ground to
foreign oils.  WTI’s discount to European benchmark Brent increased to as
much as $2.73 a barrel in intraday trading, from yesterday’s
close of $1.21. WTI rose above Brent on July 19 for the first
time since 2010.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and
other Gulf of Mexico oils compete with foreign crude priced
against Brent for space in U.S. refineries.  LLS strengthened by 55 cents to a $6.80-a-barrel premium to
WTI at 2:03 p.m., the largest differential since July 1,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 85 cents to a $6.70-a-barrel
premium. Eugene Island crude strengthened by 5 cents to a $4.20
premium.  Mars Blend’s premium gained 60 cents to $2 a barrel.
Poseidon strengthened 70 cents to a $1.60 premium. Southern
Green Canyon strengthened by $1 to a 50-cent-a-barrel premium,
the first time the crude has traded above WTI since July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
