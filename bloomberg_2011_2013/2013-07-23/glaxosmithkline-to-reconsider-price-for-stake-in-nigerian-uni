GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s
biggest drug-maker, will consult Nigerian shareholders and that
country’s regulator before making a fresh bid to increase its
stake in the local unit.  The company, which is at the center of a bribery and
corruption probe in  China , withdrew a plan yesterday “after the
parties did not conclude on where to pitch the price,”
 GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria Plc (GLAXOSMI)  Chairman Olusegun Osunkeye
told reporters in Lagos, the commercial capital, today. “Glaxo
will consult with Nigerian shareholders and regulator to come
back with acceptable plan.”  Glaxo agreed with its Nigerian unit in November to raise
its stake to 75% from 46.4% at 48 naira a share. Nigerian
shareholders want it to pay the prevailing market price “and
will resist any attempt to obtain their shares at an unfair
price or by force,” Godwin Anono, the president of Standard
Shareholders Association of  Nigeria , which represents minority
shareholders, told a meeting.  Glaxo Nigeria gained for a second day, adding 2.6 percent
to 60 naira at the close on the local exchange. The stock has
surged 33 percent this year, in line with a 35 percent gain for
the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   “We understand the difference in the stock price today
from what it was when the offer was made and will consider
appropriate amendments to the initial offer,” Osunkeye said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
