Investec Bank Plc said it’s able to
provide 8 billion rand ($813 million) in debt funding for clean-energy projects in  South Africa  as the country adds wind and
solar output.  The money would be used to finance plants in the nation’s
third renewables bidding round, Robert Gecelter, a member of
Investec’s Project and Infrastructure Finance team, said today
in Johannesburg.  South  Africa , seeking to cut dependence on coal for power,
intends to add 3,725 megawatts of renewable-energy capacity by
the end of 2016 with five tenders. That may help state utility
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. meet demand as it struggles to fund
maintenance and expansion in the continent’s biggest economy.  “We expect round three to be very competitive,” Gecelter
told reporters. The second round attracted bids from  Electricite
de France SA (EDF) , Tata Power Co. and  Acciona SA. (ANA)  The deadline for
submissions in the third is Aug. 19.  Investec has participated in about 20 billion rand of
financing for South African clean-energy and renewable ventures
so far, including 6.4 billion rand of debt, according to Fazel Moosa, head of the Project and Infrastructure Finance team. The
projects are needed to ensure sufficient electricity supply for
industry, he said.  “Our power supply is actually constraining growth” in the
country, Moosa said. The bank is also “looking broadly in
Africa” for projects, including in Ghana, Kenya and  Mozambique ,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
