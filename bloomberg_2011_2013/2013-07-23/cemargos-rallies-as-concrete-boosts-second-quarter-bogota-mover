Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) , Colombia’s
largest cement maker, rose for the first time in three days
after reporting a 14 percent increase in revenue as concrete
sales jumped.  The  common shares  climbed 0.9 percent to 8,650 pesos at
1:12 p.m. in Bogota after gaining as much as 1.3 percent. The
Colcap index increased 1 percent. Medellin-based Cemargos’s
shares dropped 3.2 percent over the previous two trading days.  The company’s concrete volumes jumped 9.3 percent in the
second quarter as infrastructure and housing projects began in
Colombia, according to an e-mailed presentation yesterday.
Cement volumes grew 1.8 percent during the same period.  The concrete “ready-mix business saves the day,” Banco
Santander SA analyst Andres Soto wrote in an e-mailed report.
“We have a positive outlook for the ready-mix business in
 Colombia  due to the company’s involvement in the government’s
housing programs.” Santander has a hold recommendation.  Cemargos said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization in the second quarter jumped 32 percent from a
year earlier to 244 billion pesos ($129 million), exceeding
Santander’s estimates by 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
