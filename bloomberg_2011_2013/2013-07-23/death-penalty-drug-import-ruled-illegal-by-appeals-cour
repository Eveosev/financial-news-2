A drug used in some U.S. executions,
sodium thiopental, can’t be imported into the country because it
hasn’t been approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration ,
the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Washington ruled in a lawsuit filed
by death row inmates.  The ruling upheld a lower-court decision that “permanently
enjoined the FDA from allowing the importation of apparently
misbranded or unapproved thiopental,” according to an opinion
by Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg, writing for a three-judge
panel.  The decision also blocked a second part of the lower-court
ruling that required the FDA “to notify state correctional
departments that the use of imported thiopental is unlawful and
that existing stocks must be sent the FDA.”  The court can’t require states to turn in the drug to the
FDA because they weren’t a party to the suit, Ginsburg wrote.  Six states -- Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia,  South
Carolina  and Tennessee -- received shipments of sodium
thiopental at issue in the complaint.  The case is is Cook v. U.S.  Food and Drug Administration ,
12-05176, U.S. Court of Appeals,  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
