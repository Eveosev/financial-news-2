ZTE Corp. (763) ,  China ’s second-largest
maker of equipment for phone networks, rose the most in almost
five years in Hong Kong trading after posting a surge in first-half earnings.  The  shares  jumped 20 percent, the biggest gain since
October 2008, to close at HK$13.84.  Net income  rose 23 percent
to 302.3 million yuan ($49 million) in the six months ended
June, the Shenzhen-based company said in a filing yesterday.  Cutting expenses for selling as well as research and
development helped boost margins at ZTE and limit the impact of
sliding sales. The result, which follows a  loss  in the second
half of 2012, was also boosted by one-time items including the
sale of its stake in Shenzhen ZNV Technology Co.  “ZTE’s fundamentals have been improving and will push its
results back on track” in the second half of this year, Tony Yang, an analyst at BOCI Research Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote in a
note to clients today.  Revenue fell 12 percent to 37.7 billion  yuan  in the first
half amid lower demand for handsets and data cards, the company
said in yesterday’s statement.  ZTE yesterday also announced an incentive plan for
employees under which options may be granted for as many as
103.2 million A shares, or about 3 percent of total share
capital. The stock had been suspended since July 15 as the
company adopted the plan.  Closely held Huawei Technologies Co. is China’s biggest
maker of phone network equipment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
