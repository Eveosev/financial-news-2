Germany ’s 10-year bunds dropped for
the first time in a week after  China ’s leadership said it won’t
let economic growth slow below 7 percent, damping demand for the
safest fixed-income assets.  German  two-year yields  climbed to a two-week high as a
report showed  consumer confidence  in the euro area improved more
than economists estimated in July and an indicator of overnight
borrowing costs rose. Spanish and Italian securities also
declined. The Netherlands sold 1.79 billion euros ($2.37
billion) of bonds due in July 2021 and January 2042 and Spain
auctioned bills.  “Risk sentiment in general has been well underpinned by
the comments from the Chinese Premier,” said Allan von Mehren,
chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. German bund
yields are rising with higher money-market rates on concern
excess liquidity provided by the  European Central Bank  is
diminishing, he said.  Germany’s  10-year yield  rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.55 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time,
after falling to 1.50 percent on July 19, the lowest level since
June 7. The 1.5 percent bund due in May 2023 dropped 0.325, or
3.25 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.535.  The two-year yield increased as much as five basis points
to 0.15 percent, the highest since July 4.  China Growth  Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang ’s government sees 7 percent
growth as the bottom line for tolerance of an economic slowdown,
Chinese news organizations reported, signaling the nation will
act to support expansion if needed and boosting Asian stocks.  The European Commission’s  gauge of sentiment  increased to
minus 17.4 this month from minus 18.8 in June. That’s higher
than the minus 18.3 estimated by 27 economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.101
percent yesterday from 0.098 percent at the end of last week.
ECB excess liquidity was at 236 billion euros as of July 22, the
lowest since Dec. 2011  The yield on the Euribor futures contract expiring in
December 2015 increased six basis points to 0.86 percent, while
the rate on the December 2013 contract rose three basis points
to 0.33 percent.  Periphery Bonds  Italy’s 10-year yield rose four basis points to 4.35
percent and  Spain ’s climbed six basis points to 4.67 percent.  Portugal ’s bonds fell for the first time in four days with
the 10-year yield climbing two basis points to 6.41 percent. The
rate dropped as much as 49 basis points to 6.31 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since June 20.  Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho yesterday pledged to
complete the country’s bailout program and push ahead with a
government reshuffle after lawmakers failed to reach agreement
on cost cuts last week.  The Netherlands sold 30-year bonds at an average yield of
2.581 percent, up from 2.408 percent at its previous sale of the
securities on Jan. 22.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Germany and Portugal,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German bunds handed investors a loss of 0.6 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Dutch securities fell 0.7 percent, while Portugal’s
returned 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
