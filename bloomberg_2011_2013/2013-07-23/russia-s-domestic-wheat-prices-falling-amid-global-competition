Russia ’s domestic wheat prices fell
10 percent this month as the harvest progresses at a quicker
pace than last year, signaling more affordable supplies for
traders seeking to export the grain amid global competition.  Average prices of fourth-grade milling wheat, the main
shipping variety, have declined to 6,583 rubles ($203) a metric
ton this month in southern Russia, the traditional source of
grain for exports at this time of year, according to a report
from the Grain Union today. Traders usually buy more grain to
export when the domestic price falls as it gives them a bigger
profit margin for shipping.  The country is expected to export 20 million tons of all
cereals, up from 15.7 million tons in 2012-13, according to
Agriculture Ministry estimates. Russia has harvested 30.7
million tons of wheat and other cereals so far this season, up
from 19.5 million tons a year earlier, according to Agriculture
Ministry data.  “Russia’s grain potential is high and the country will be
among major exporters,” Alexander Korbut, the Grain Union vice
president, said by phone from Moscow today.  Russia is forecast to ship 17 million tons of wheat in the
2013-14 season begun July 1, ranking it fifth after the U.S.,
the European Union,  Canada  and  Australia , according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  Global wheat production for 2013-14 was raised earlier in
July to a record 704 million tons on good prospects in all major
growers except the U.S., according to a report by the Rome-based
Agricultural Market Information System.  Benchmark Declines  Wheat traded in  Chicago , a global benchmark, fell 16
percent this year on a rebound in production after drought cut
harvests across the Northern Hemisphere last year.  “Bigger harvests are expected to result in a significant
increase in world cereal stocks,” according to the AMIS report.
“More ample supplies could result in lower and more stable
prices in 2013-14 compared to 2012-13.”  Russia won its first international tender of the season on
July 18 when it sold two 60,000 ton cargoes of wheat to  Egypt  at
$247.66 and $248.95 a ton. The world’s largest importer of the
grain also bought tenders from Romania and Ukraine, both the
Black Sea states like Russia.  “Russia confirmed competitiveness of its wheat again,”
Korbut said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
