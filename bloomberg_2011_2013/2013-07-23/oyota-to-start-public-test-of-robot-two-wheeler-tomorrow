Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  plans to begin
public testing of its Winglet two-wheeled vehicle tomorrow at a
district research center north of Tokyo to assess its safety and
functionality.  Trials of the device, ridden standing up, are scheduled to
run until March 2016 at the Tsukuba Mobility Robot Experimental
Zone, the Toyota City, Japan-based company said today in a
release.  The Winglet, which travels as fast as 3.7 miles per hour (6
kilometers per hour), is being developed to help improve
transportation safety, according to the statement today.
Starting in 2014, research on the device will focus on demand
for the vehicle and how it could improve the environment and
help local communities.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Toyota’s second-biggest Japanese rival,
introduced a personal transportation device it calls the Uni-Cub
last year after rolling out the unicycle-like U3-X three years
earlier, calling it the world’s first drive system that enables
movement in all directions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
