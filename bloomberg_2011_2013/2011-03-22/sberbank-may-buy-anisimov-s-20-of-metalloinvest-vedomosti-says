Russian billionaire Alisher
Usmanov’s partner in Metalloinvest, Vasily Anisimov, plans to
sell his 20 percent stake in the holding company to OAO
Sberbank, Vedomosti reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.   Sberbank will pay about $2.5 billion for the stake in
 Russia ’s largest iron-ore producer, the Moscow-based newspaper
said today. Usmanov will get the right to buy the stake back
from Sberbank at a later date, Vedomosti said.   Usmanov said in an e-mailed statement that no agreement
has been struck. Sberbank declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
