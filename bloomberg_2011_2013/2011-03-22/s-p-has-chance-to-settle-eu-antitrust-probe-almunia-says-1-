Standard & Poor’s  may be able to
reach a settlement with European Union antitrust officials to
end a probe over licensing fees for securities identification
numbers, the region’s competition chief said.  “I don’t exclude that we can settle this case with S&P,”
 Joaquin Almunia , the European Union’s antitrust commissioner,
told the European Parliament in Brussels today. “This
possibility has emerged, but we are not yet there.”  The European Commission sent an antitrust complaint to S&P
in 2009 over the fees it charges financial firms and
information-service providers for using International Securities
Identification numbers in their databases. The EU antitrust
agency opened the probe into S&P after the Brussels-based
 European Fund and Asset Management Association  said that S&P’s
fees were unfair.  Almunia said today that EU regulators “have concerns”
that S&P, owned by publisher McGraw-Hill Cos., may “charge too
much.”  S&P has had “open and frank” talks with regulators,
Michael Privitera, a spokesman in  New York , said in an e-mail.
The ratings company is “learning how we may be able to provide
products and services more uniquely suited to the European
market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
