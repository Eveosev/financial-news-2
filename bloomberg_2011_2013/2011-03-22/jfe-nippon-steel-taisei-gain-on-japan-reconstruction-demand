Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , JFE Holdings
Inc. and  Taisei Corp. (1801)  led gains among steel and construction
companies in Tokyo on optimism they will benefit from  Japan ’s
rebuilding effort after the nation’s worst postwar earthquake.  Nippon Steel, the nation’s biggest producer, gained 7.1 to
271 yen as of 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo. JFE Holdings, the
second-largest steelmaker, surged 11 percent to 2,489 yen, the
biggest advance since Nov. 10, 2008. Taisei, which builds houses
and offices, advanced 11 percent to 224 yen.  “Investors are paying attention to steel and construction
companies,” said Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a senior analyst at
Shinsei Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The gains reflect
expectations the earthquake will boost reconstruction demand.”  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  pledged to “rebuild from
scratch” following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that
destroyed roads, bridges and railways. The quake is creating
demand for steel used to build temporary shelters, produce dump
trucks and reinforce pillars supporting high-speed rail tracks,
Naoto Ohori, managing director at Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co.,
told reporters today in Tokyo.  The Topix iron and steel index, which gained 7.8 percent,
was the second-best performer among the industry groups
comprising the benchmark gauge, while the Topix construction
index rose 7.5 percent, ranking third at the close.  Recent  oil prices  have boosted the earnings outlook at  oil
companies , Matsumoto said, making the Topix oil and coal index
the best performer with an 8.8 percent surge at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
