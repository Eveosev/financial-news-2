Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second day against the dollar as demand for the greenback by oil
importers and telecommunication companies increased.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to 85.20 per dollar at 10:50 a.m. in Nairobi from a
close of 85.10 yesterday.  Crude oil fell from the highest in more than a week in  New
York , losing as much as 0.5 percent to $101.78 a barrel, on
concern prices that have jumped more than 25 percent in the past
year will derail a recovery in global energy demand.  “The local unit has weakened on the back of demand for
dollars by oil importers and telecommunication businesses,”
Steve Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
