(Corrects spelling of hog in headline and first
paragraph.)  Hog futures rose, capping the
longest rally in seven months, on speculation that demand for
pork will increase as supplies shrink. Cattle also gained.  On March 18, hog carcasses nationally averaged 209.45
pounds (95 kilograms), down 1 percent from the average weight on
Jan. 7, which was the heaviest since at least 2002, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale pork has jumped
26 percent in the past year.  “Demand continues to build” before the U.S. grilling
season, which begins April 1, said  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The weights
are also starting to seasonally fall.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.475 cent, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1.0145 a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The commodity gained 7.1 percent
over five sessions, the longest rally since mid-August.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.175 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1.1385 a pound in Chicago. The price
advanced for the fourth straight session, the longest string of
gains since the end of December. Feeder-cattle futures for
August settlement advanced 1.025 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$1.35175 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
