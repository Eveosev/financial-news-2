Germany ’s main lobby group for
investors in eastern  Europe , the Ost-Ausschuss, sent a protest
to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich about a draft law to
enforce state control over grain exports, the Financial Times
reported.  The planned regulation would create state export
monopolies, cut the income of Ukrainian farmers and drive away
foreign companies that have invested in grain-processing and
export facilities, according to Eckhard Cordes, the group’s
chairman, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
