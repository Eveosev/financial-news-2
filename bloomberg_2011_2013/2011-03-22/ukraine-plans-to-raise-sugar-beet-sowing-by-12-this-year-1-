Ukraine will expand the area sown
with sugar beets by 12 percent this year to help satisfy
domestic demand and meet a goal of exporting, said Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk.  The country, now a sugar importer, will plant beets on
565,000 hectares (1.4 million acres) this year, 62,000 hectares
more than in 2010, Prysyazhnyuk said today in a  statement  on the
government’s website.  Ukraine produced 1.545 million metric tons of sugar last
year and consumes about 2 million tons annually. The country
wants to export around 100,000 tons of sugar this year to
 Russia , Prysyazhnyuk said in October.  The former Soviet state also plans also to raise cereal
seeding by 3.5 percent in 2011, Prysyahznyuk said. Ukraine’s
total grain area will expand by 528,000 hectares from 2010 to
15.6 million hectares. Spring barley and corn planting will gain
by 70,000 hectares and 71,000 hectares, respectively, the
minister said. He added that about 94 percent of winter grains
are in good and satisfactory condition.  Ukraine planted 113,300 hectares with spring grains as of
March 21, including 85,400 hectares of barley, Prysyazhnyuk
said.  The government restricted grain exports last year in an
effort to curb domestic prices. Current caps of 4.2 million tons
are in force through the end of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
