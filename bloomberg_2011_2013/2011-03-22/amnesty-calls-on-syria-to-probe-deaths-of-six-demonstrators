Syria  should start an independent
investigation into the deaths of six antigovernment protesters
during unrest in the southern city of Daraa,  Amnesty
International  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Four men died after security forces opened fire on
demonstrators on March 18, a fifth man was shot dead the next
day and a sixth person died yesterday after inhaling tear gas
during unrest on March 20, the statement said.  “These deaths must be investigated promptly and thoroughly
and those responsible for unlawful killings brought to
justice,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s deputy director for the
Middle East and North Africa.  The rallies in Syria mark the latest extension of the
political turmoil that has engulfed the region this year.
Uprisings have toppled the presidents of Tunisia and  Egypt  and
threatened the rule of  Muammar Qaddafi  in  Libya , where United
Nations-backed international forces have started air strikes to
protect civilian protesters.  Syria’s southern province of Daraa is now calm, the state-
run Syrian Arab News Agency said today. Gatherings in villages
have been disbanded after demands were submitted to the
authorities, the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
