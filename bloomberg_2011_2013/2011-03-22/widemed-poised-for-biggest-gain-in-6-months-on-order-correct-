(Corrects size of gain in headline.)  WideMed (WDMD)  Ltd. jumped 7.8 percent to
1.024 shekels, headed for the biggest one-day increase since
September 2010, after the provider of bio-medical signal
diagnostics and treatment said it received an order for its
Morpheus Hx system from a Louisiana hospital.  The shares have gained 15 percent over the past year,
giving the Herzliya, Israel-based company a market value of 17
million shekels ($4.8 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
