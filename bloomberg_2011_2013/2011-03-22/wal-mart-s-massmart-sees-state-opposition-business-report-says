Three South African government
departments have asked the country’s Competition Tribunal to
delay hearings on Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s plan to buy control of
Johannesburg’s  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  because they say the deal
may not be justified by public interest and they want more time
to gather evidence,  Business Report  said, citing the application
to the antitrust authority.   The country’s trade, economic development and agriculture
departments want the hearing delayed from today until May 2, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the application. The
opposition may delay the transaction by months, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got that information.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
