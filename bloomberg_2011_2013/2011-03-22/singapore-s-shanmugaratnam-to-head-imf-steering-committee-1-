The International Monetary Fund
said Singapore’s Finance Minister  Tharman Shanmugaratnam  will
chair the fund’s steering committee.  Shanmugaratnam, 54, has accepted the position for up to
three years, the IMF said today in an e-mailed statement. He
replaces  Youssef Boutros-Ghali , who stepped down last month
after he was replaced as Egyptian finance minister in a Jan. 31
cabinet reshuffle amid the political unrest that then unseated
President  Hosni Mubarak .  Shanmugaratnam’s “broad experience, deep knowledge of
economic and financial issues, and active engagement with global
policy makers will be highly valuable to” the International
Monetary and Financial Committee, the IMF said in the statement.  The minister served as chief executive officer of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city state’s central bank
and regulator, before his entry into politics. He took up his
current post in 2007 after being education minister.  Shanmugaratnam is currently also a member of the Group of
Thirty, an international economic and monetary affairs advisory
group, the IMF said.  The IMFC’s 24 members, who meet twice a year, are finance
ministers and central bankers whose nationalities reflect the
composition of the IMF board of executive directors. Past
chairmen include  Gordon Brown , who stepped down when he became
U.K. prime minister in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
