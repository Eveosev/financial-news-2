Canadian stocks rose as gains by
gold producers amid unrest in  Libya  outweighed a decline by  Teck
Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  after it cut its 2001 copper and coal sales
forecasts.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s two
largest gold producers, rose as much as 0.7 percent as gold
futures advanced near a record on demand for an alternative
investment. Teck declined 1.8 percent after saying labor
disruption and difficult weather conditions have slowed
production in the first quarter.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 27.50
points, or 0.2 percent, to 14,027.50 at 10:16 a.m. in Toronto
after falling as much as 0.1 percent earlier.  The S&P/TSX yesterday fell 0.1 percent for its first
decline in four days. It had gained 3.6 percent from March 16
through March 21 for the biggest three-day advance in more than
10 months, as oil rebounded from its decline following the
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan . Energy companies make up 28
percent of Canadian stocks by market value, the most among 10
industries.  To contact the reporters on this story;
