Barclays Plc (BARC)  is among a group of
investors considering making a bid for a portfolio of mortgage-
backed securities that has already elicited a $15.7 billion
offer from  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the Financial
Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The
securities are held by a fund called Maiden Lane II that was
created by the Federal Reserve as part of its rescue of AIG
during the financial crisis, the FT said.  Seth Martin, a Barclays spokesman, declined to comment by
telephone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
