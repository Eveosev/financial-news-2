Arsenal defender Johan Djourou will
miss a month of the season after undergoing surgery on his
dislocated shoulder, the Premier League soccer team said today
on its website.  The 24-year-old Swiss national was hurt during the 2-0 F.A.
Cup loss at Manchester United. He wonâ€™t need reconstructive
surgery and will start his rehabilitation before returning to
training in four weeks, Arsenal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
