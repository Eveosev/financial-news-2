Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said he expects parliament to approve a draft law that
raises taxes on profits from gas and oil resources.  “I am convinced that this process will be completed with a
large majority, both in the  Knesset Finance Committee ,
apparently tomorrow, and also after that in the plenum,”
Steinitz said in a speech to a ministry conference in Jerusalem
today. “It is right, it is proper, and it is just;
economically, socially, and morally.”  The Cabinet in January approved draft legislation that
would increase the government’s share on energy profits to as
much as 62 percent, from the current 30 percent. The government
proposed the changes after a group including companies
controlled by Israeli billionaire Isaac Tshuva’s Delek Group
Ltd. and partner Noble Energy Ltd. made record gas finds off the
Mediterranean coast.  Some of the revenue generated by the taxes should be used
to reduce government debt, Steinitz said. The minister said he
supports the idea of creating a sovereign wealth fund that would
manage some of the revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
