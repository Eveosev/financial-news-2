Rwanda ’s economic growth
accelerated to 7.5 percent last year, driven by financial
services and the electricity, gas and water industries, the
National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda said.  The rate of growth rose from 6.1 percent in 2009, the
institute said on its  website  today. Finance and insurance
expanded 24 percent last year, while utilities grew 15 percent,
according to the statement.  “2010 was a year of economic recovery worldwide, including
Rwanda,” central bank Governor Francois Kanimba said by phone
today.  Kanimba reiterated the  Finance Ministry ’s forecast that
economic growth would ease to 7 percent this year, citing the
impact of poor rains on agricultural production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
