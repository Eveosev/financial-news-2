Gold rose in  New York  for the fifth
straight session as tensions in the Middle East and  Libya 
boosted demand for an investment haven.  The U.S. said attacks on Libya will ease in the following
days. Yemen’s president warned defecting generals they risk
dragging the country into a “bloody civil war.” Gold touched a
record $1,445.70 an ounce on March 7 as protests ousted leaders
in Egypt and Tunisia and spread throughout the region.  “The Middle East is going to take time to sort out, so
gold is well-supported by the ongoing tension,” said Matt
Zeman, a market strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago .  Gold futures for April delivery rose $1.20 to settle at
$1,427.60 at 1:37 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
price has gained 2.5 percent in five sessions.  Silver futures for May delivery climbed 26.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $36.269 an ounce on the Comex. That’s the highest

percent, to $737.85 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Platinum futures for April delivery fell $5.50, or 0.3
