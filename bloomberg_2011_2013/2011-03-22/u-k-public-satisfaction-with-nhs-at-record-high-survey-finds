The U.K. public’s satisfaction with
the  National Health Service  is at a record high, according to
the latest British Social Attitudes survey.  About 64 percent of respondents said they are “very” or
“quite” satisfied with the NHS, the highest level of
satisfaction since the survey began in 1983, according to an
article about the survey by John Appleby, chief economist at the
King’s Fund, to be published today on the  British Medical
Journal’s  website.  The higher satisfaction rate may be related to a large rise
in funding since 2000, and future studies will show whether
sentiment changes as funding for NHS is squeezed, Appleby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
