Ukraine will probably extend the
duration of grain export quotas, Robert Brovdi, head of state-
run grain trader Khlib Investbud, said in  Kommersant-Ukraine .  Ukraine has about 3 million metric tons of wheat and 3
million tons of corn stockpiles, Brovdi said. Of that, 1 million
tons are held in the country’s Agrarian Fund and can’t be
exported, Kommersant said.  Grain traders hold an additional 2.5 million tons of corn
and 2.2 million tons of wheat, Brovdi said.  Ukraine imposed grain export curbs last year that allow for
4.2 million tons of shipments through the end of March,
as the country sought to tame domestic grain prices after
drought damaged crops.  To contact the reporters on this story:
