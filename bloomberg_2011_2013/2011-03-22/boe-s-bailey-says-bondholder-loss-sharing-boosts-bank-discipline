Bank of England Chief Cashier
Andrew Bailey said creating a “credible” plan to force bank
bondholders to share losses when a lender collapses will
increase discipline in running banks.  “A credible bail-in regime” would “create incentives”
for bond and equity holders to hold management to account,
Bailey told The Economist’s Future of Banking conference in
Paris today. “That’s entirely appropriate. That’s market
discipline. So I’m optimistic.”  The remarks add to a debate among policy makers on the
extent to which investors should bear losses when lenders fail
and need to seek government support. Governments around the
world are seeking to provide standard systems for coping with
failing banks, and French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde
today called on the Group of 20 nations to improve their
capacity to cope with the cross-border collapse of a lender.  Bailey said two elements are needed to resolve the issue,
including “ensuring there is an orderly process” for dealing
with  bank failures .  The other is that a good “resolution regime lowers loss in
result of default. Lehman illustrates how losses” increase in
the case of a disorderly default.  Simply raising how much capital banks must hold risks
reducing market discipline, Bailey said.  “I’m not convinced we should set very high  capital
requirements ,” he said. “The new paradigm of very high capital
requirements is not obviously the right approach to take.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
