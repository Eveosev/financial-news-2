Swiss exports increased in February
as a strengthening European economy and surging Asian economies
fueled demand for watches and machinery parts.  Foreign sales, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation,
rose 4.2 percent from January, when they advanced 4.9 percent,
the Federal Customs Office in Bern said in an e-mailed statement
today. Imports rose 0.3 percent from the previous month and the
 trade surplus  widened to 2.49 billion Swiss francs ($2.8
billion) from 2.04 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
