Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  won a U.S. deep-
water drilling permit for the  Gulf of Mexico , becoming the
fourth company cleared to work in the largest source of domestic
crude after BP Plc’s oil spill last year.  Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, will drill in a Keathley
Canyon Block in 6,941 feet (2,116 meters) of water, about 240
miles off the Louisiana coast, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “We will continue to review and approve applications that
demonstrate the ability to operate safely in deep water,”
 Michael Bromwich , bureau director, said in the statement.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and ATP Oil & Gas
Corp. have received U.S. permits to resume work halted after
BP’s April 20 spill. While Exxon’s well is new, the company had
a rig on site and a permit to drill when BP’s Macondo well
exploded. Exxon had to suspend operations following the
disaster, according to the regulator.  Exxon fell 28 cents to $82.56 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  Exxon is the world’s second-largest operator of deep-water
 oil wells .  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, is the biggest.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S’s Maersk Developer rig is standing
by, ready to drill the well, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
