Severfield-Rowen Plc (SFR) , a U.K.
supplier of structural steelwork, said profit plunged last year
as government spending cuts and rising steel prices hurt demand.  Net income fell 76 percent, to 7.6 million pounds ($12.5
million), or 8.6 pence a share, from 31.3 million pounds, or
35.2 pence a share, in 2009, the company said in a statement.
Sales fell 23 percent to 266.7 million pounds.  Chief Executive Officer Tom Haughey said in a telephone
interview that he expects underlying pretax profit to be 8
million pounds to 11.5 million pounds this year, in line with
market forecasts, and salaries will be frozen. He foresees U.K.
orders of 270 million pounds to 290 million pounds by the end of
the year, up from 226 million at present.  “Subject to not falling off the rails, we will meet market
forecasts,” Haughey said. “We see better times from 2012, when
there are opportunities like in the London commercial office
market.”  The company, which is based in Thirsk, northern  England ,
said its Indian joint venture, JSW Severfield Structures Ltd.,
has seen its order book increase to 33 million pounds and the
company plans to expand in the country.  Haughey said the Indian market is strong, the sector is
busy and demand is good compared with the U.K.  Opportunities with the Indian joint venture are “very
exciting in our view,” said Andrew Douglas, an analyst with
Royal Bank of  Scotland , in an e-mailed note to investors today.
“Management’s comments in respect of the outlook are largely as
expected,” with “an underlying demand recovery expected in
2012.” Douglas recommends holding the stock.  The stock climbed 19 pence, or 8.2 percent, to 251 pence at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading today, giving the company
a market value of 223.5 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
