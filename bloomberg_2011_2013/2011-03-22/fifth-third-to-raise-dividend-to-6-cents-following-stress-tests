Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , Ohio’s largest
lender, will increase its dividend after the  Federal Reserve 
didn’t object to the company’s capital plan following its  stress
test .  Fifth Third’s board of directors approved the 5-cent
increase to 6 cents from 1 cent, the Cincinnati-based bank said
in a statement today. The dividend will be payable April 21 to
shareholders of record on April 1, the lender said. Fifth Third
cut its dividend to 1 cent during the financial crisis from as
high as 44 cents in 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  U.S. lenders announced more than $5.4 billion in annualized
dividend increases March 18 after the Federal Reserve’s tests
showed the industry gained enough strength to boost capital
deployments to shareholders. Fifth Third said last week the Fed
didn’t object to its capital plan, which included “possible”
securities buybacks, according to a March 18 statement.  “That does speak to their financial health and outlook,”
Terry McEvoy, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in an
interview before the announcement. “I would expect that the
bank looks at many different options in terms of capital
management and would pick one that’s most optimal for their
shareholders.”  Fifth Third last week exited the government’s Troubled
Asset Relief Program when it paid $280 million to buy back a
warrant to the  U.S. Treasury  for its bailout plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
