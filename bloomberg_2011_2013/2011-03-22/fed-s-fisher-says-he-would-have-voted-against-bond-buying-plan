Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President Richard W. Fisher said he would have voted against the
central bank’s plan to buy $600 billion of bonds through June if
he’d had a vote last year.  “I would have voted against QE2, had I had the vote,” the
regional bank chief, who votes on monetary policy this year,
said in a speech today in  Frankfurt . “We’ve done a bit too
much.”  Fisher said no additional monetary stimulus is necessary
after the Fed completes its second round of bond purchases,
dubbed “QE2” because it followed an earlier round of $1.7
trillion of purchases that ended a year ago.  “No further accommodation is needed after June,”
including by tapering the central bank’s purchases, Fisher said.
“Doing so would only prolong the injustice that we have
inflicted” on savers through inflation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
