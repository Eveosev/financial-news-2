Corporation Chairman  Sheila Bair  told bankers that while the
Dodd-Frank law is not “perfect,” it will strengthen the sector
by giving the agency tools to regulate “too-big-to-fail”
institutions.  “Dodd-Frank is not a perfect law. There are many things in
it that I would like to change,” Bair said at a conference
organized by the  Independent Community Bankers of America  in San
Diego today. The legislation “attacked the doctrine of too-big-
to-fail by extending the FDIC’s resolution process to large,
systemically-important financial institutions.”  Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation law enacted in July,
gave the FDIC authority to wind down complex firms after the
September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
exacerbated the credit crisis and forced the U.S. to bail out
companies including American International Group Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
