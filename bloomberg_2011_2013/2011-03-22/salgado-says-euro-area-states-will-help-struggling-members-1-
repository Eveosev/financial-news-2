Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said all countries in the euro area are prepared to help
members that are struggling to close budget deficits.  “All countries in the  euro zone  are ready to help,”
Salgado said today on the Madrid-based Onda Cero radio station.  European leaders meet March 24-25 to wrap up plans for a
permanent mechanism to resolve the sovereign-debt crisis that
has battered the most indebted nations such as Greece, Ireland
and Spain in the past year. Peripheral-government bonds rallied
after European Union leaders pledged to reinforce the temporary
European Financial Stability Facility at a March 12 meeting.  Those countries face an additional challenge as the
 European Central Bank  has indicated it may increase borrowing
costs next month for the first time in almost three years.  “We can handle an increase in  interest rates  without any
difficulty,” Salgado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
