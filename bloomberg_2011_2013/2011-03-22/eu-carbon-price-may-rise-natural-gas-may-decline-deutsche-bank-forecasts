U.K. natural gas prices may fall or
European Union carbon permits may rise, based on the profits
available to power utilities later this year, said Deutsche Bank
AG.  “Coal will be running ahead of gas across the EU at the
end of this year, unless either gas prices come down or carbon
prices go up,” Mark Lewis and Michael Hsueh, analysts for the
bank in Paris and  London  respectively, said today in an e-mailed
research note. “With uncertainty now clouding the outlook for
 Germany ’s nuclear generators, we see downside risk to the Winter
2010-11 National Balancing Point price, and/or upside risk to
December 2011 EU allowances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
