Finnish Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi said it would be “very, very difficult” to get the
Finnish parliament to approve an increase in  Finland ’s loan
guarantees to the European bailout fund in order to raise the
fund’s capacity to 440 billion euros ($625 billion) from 250
billion euros, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  Finland and the euro area’s five other AAA-rated countries
have been pressured to double their loan guarantees, the FT
said. This would be “impossible,” Kiviniemi said, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
