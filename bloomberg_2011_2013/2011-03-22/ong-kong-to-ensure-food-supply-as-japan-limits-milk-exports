Hong Kong ’s government said it will
ensure residents have access to alternative  food supply  as  Japan 
may limit exports because of the earthquake and nuclear crisis.  Japan may cut its supply of milk formula to Hong Kong as
the quake-stricken nation keeps stocks to meet domestic demand,
the Hong Kong government  said in a statement . Alternatives from
other countries are sufficient to meet the city’s needs, the
government said after a meeting between suppliers and Permanent
Secretary for Food and Health  Marion Lai .  Japan’s nuclear-safety agency said the nation will limit
distribution of spinach and milk after samples from the area
near the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant were found to have
higher-than-normal radiation levels. Hong Kong families rushed
to stock up on Japanese infant formula after the March 11 quake,
buying a month’s supply of Megmilk Snow Brand Co.’s products in
two days.  The Hong Kong government will continue to monitor the food
markets and act if there’s a need, the statement said. Lai met
representatives from companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition
Co.,  Nestle SA (NSRGY)  and A.S. Watson Group, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
