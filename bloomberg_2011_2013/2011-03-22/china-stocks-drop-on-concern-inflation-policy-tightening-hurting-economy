China ’s stocks rose for a third day
on speculation higher borrowing costs will bolster bank profits
and concerns eased that the Japanese nuclear crisis may curb
regional economic growth.  Industrial & Commercial  Bank of China  Ltd. and Bank of
China Ltd. led gains for lenders after Barclays Plc said banks
will post “strong” earnings. Anhui Conch Cement Co. jumped to
the highest in three years as Citic Securities Co. predicted a
peak season for cement consumption. Sinovel Wind Group Co., a
maker of wind turbines, slid 1.3 percent as  Japan ’s progress in
stabilizing nuclear reactors sent alternative energy stocks down.  “The Japan nuclear crisis has been progressing in a way
that the situation will be very likely brought under control,”
said  Wang Zheng , chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment
Management Co. in  Shanghai , which manages about $120 million.
“Stocks are still an attractive place to put money amid the
backdrop of the global recovery.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 10.01, or 0.3 percent, to
2,919.14 at the 3 p.m. close. The gauge trades at 13.7 times
estimated earnings, compared with around 16 times at the end of
last year. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.5 percent to 3,222.96.  The Shanghai Composite has climbed 4 percent this year on
optimism the world’s second-biggest economy will withstand
tighter monetary policies. The central bank has raised  interest
rates  three times since October to cool inflation that reached
4.9 percent in February, exceeding the government’s 4 percent
annual target. It’s boosted banks’  reserve requirements  nine
times since the start of 2010, including an increase on March 18.  Bank Earnings  Chinese lenders may extend their “outperformance”
relative to the market and regional banks as recent increases in
reserve requirements won’t hurt earnings, Emil Wolter, Asia
equities strategist at Royal Bank of  Scotland , said in a report.  Banks will report “strong” earnings for 2010, with net
profit growing at 35 percent on average, according to Barclays.
Net interest margins improved after the central bank raised
borrowing costs, May Yan and Allen Zhang, Hong Kong-based
analysts at Barclays, said in a report. Their top picks among
the H-share banks they cover are ICBC and Bank of China.  ICBC, the nation’s biggest listed lender, added 0.5 percent
to 4.36 yuan. Bank of China, the fourth largest by assets,
advanced 0.6 percent to 3.26 yuan.  China Construction Bank Corp. (601939) ,
the second-largest bank, rose 0.6 percent to 4.92 yuan.  ICBC is due to announce its 2010 earnings next week. Bank
of China and Construction Bank are scheduled to report this week.  Cement Consumption  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, jumped 4.8
percent to 37.88 yuan, its highest close since January 2008.
Gansu Qilianshan Cement Group Co. advanced 5.5 percent to 22.79
yuan. Huaxin Cement Co., the Chinese affiliate of Holcim Ltd.,
climbed 6.1 percent to 45.16 yuan.  China’s cement prices rose 0.2 percent last week from a
week earlier, analysts led by Zeng Hao at Citic Securities wrote
in a report dated yesterday. The brokerage forecast a peak
season for cement consumption in late March and maintained an
“overweight” rating on the industry.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average jumped 4.4 percent today.
The Asian country is likely to see a rebound in the second half
of this year after a blow that will be determined by the
magnitude of electricity disruptions caused by the earthquake
and tsunami, a survey of economists showed.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said yesterday there’s “light at
the end of the tunnel” in the nation’s battle to avert a
nuclear meltdown at a crippled power plant and progress was
being made restoring power to units at the plan.  Japan Temblor  The temblor wouldn’t have a “significant” effect on Asian
countries that export to Japan because the export loss will be
offset by reconstruction demand, Nomura Holdings Inc. said.  Sinovel Wind led declines for alternative-energy companies,
retreating 1.3 percent to 74.07 yuan. Xinjiang Goldwind Science
& Technology Co., the country’s second-biggest maker of  wind
turbines , slid 3.2 percent to 21.21 yuan. Risen Energy Co., a
manufacturer of solar cells, lost 2.7 percent to 73.70 yuan.  The yuan strengthened to a 17-year high today on
speculation policy makers will raise interest rates and allow
more currency appreciation to curb inflation. The Chinese
currency rose as much as 0.09 percent to 6.5553 per dollar in
Shanghai today, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. That’s the strongest level since China unified official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Liquor Makers  A gauge of consumer staples dropped 0.7 percent, the most
among the 10 industry groups in the CSI 300, amid concern
companies will struggle to pass off higher raw material costs on
to consumers.  Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest liquor maker by market
value, extended losses to a second day, falling 0.7 percent to
185.75 yuan. Its 2010 profit trailed analysts’ estimates with
profit margins squeezed by higher material costs.
     Anhui Gujing Distillery Co., a liquor maker, dropped 2.7
percent to 78.79 yuan. The company said it raised wholesale
prices for some of its products by 3 percent to 25 percent
because of inflation and higher ingredient and wage costs.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
