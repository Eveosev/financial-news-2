Japanese stocks rose, sending the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to its biggest two-day advance since
April 2009, as the country made progress in stabilizing reactors
at a crippled nuclear plant.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant which was damaged by the 9.0-magnitude
earthquake and tsunami on March 11, soared 16 percent. Toshiba
Corp., a nuclear reactor supplier, surged 13 percent. JX
Holdings Inc. rose 12 percent as its refining unit resumed
operations. Nippon Steel Corp.,  Japan ’s largest maker of the
alloy, leapt 7.1 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s largest bank by market value, advanced 8.3 percent. The
country’s equities markets were closed for a public holiday
yesterday.  The Nikkei 225 rose 4.4 percent to 9,608.32 at the 3 p.m.
market close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index climbed 4.5
percent to 868.13, the most among Asian equity indexes. All 33
industry groups in the index advanced.  “Japan is the market that fell the most last week as it
moved to price in the risk of a nuclear meltdown with much wider
consequences for Japan’s economy than just the earthquake and
tsunami,” said  Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy in
Sydney at AMP Capital Investors Ltd, which manages $98 billion.
“With the nuclear risk receding, it makes sense that it’s the
Japanese share market that is seeing the strongest bounce as
foreign investors see the greatest value there.”  Topix Valuations  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index gained 1.5 percent yesterday as concern
eased that Japan will suffer a nuclear meltdown and after AT&T
Inc. agreed to buy  T-Mobile USA  for $39 billion.  The Topix lost 7.6 percent this year through March 18,
compared with a gain of 3.2 percent by the  S&P 500  and a drop of
1.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 14 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, a measure of
Japanese option prices, has more than tripled in the past week
as equities tumbled. The gauge slipped 26 percent to 49.95 on
March 18, implying a 14 percent swing in the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average in the next 30 days.  “The nuclear issue has calmed,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi ,
a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “People
focused on low valuations will probably buy stocks.”  Tepco Surges  Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said yesterday he can see
“light at the end of the tunnel,” even as smoke at two
reactors hampered efforts to restore cooling systems at the
troubled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  Tokyo Electric Power, which operates the plant, said
yesterday it connected a power cable from reactor 3 to 4 and Kan
said progress was being made restoring power to units 1 and 2.
The stock soared by the daily limit of 150 yen, or 16 percent,
to 1,098 yen, the most in the Nikkei, followed by Toshiba. The
company was the most actively-traded stock in Japan.  “Anxiety decreased that things are going to be extremely
bad,” said Ichiro Yamada, manager of equities at Fukoku Mutual
Life Insurance Co. “Investors started to calm down, and stocks
are rebounding to make up for what was lost last week.”  Reconstruction Demand  Toshiba, a nuclear reactor supplier, surged 13 percent to
406 yen, the biggest increase since October 2008. Fanuc Corp.,
an industrial-robot manufacturer, climbed 5.7 percent to 12,150
yen. Tokyo Electron Ltd., a maker of semiconductor equipment,
advanced 7.7 percent to 4,670 yen, rising the most since May
2009.  Oil and coal companies as well as steelmakers were the two
industry groups with the greatest advances in the Topix.  JX Holdings surged 12 percent to 576 yen. JX Nippon Oil &
Energy Corp., the refining unit of JX Holdings, resumed
operations at its Negishi oil refinery near Tokyo today, said a
company official, declining to be named because of internal
rules.  Steelmakers advanced on speculation reconstruction
activities will boost material demand. Nippon Steel leapt 7.1
percent to 271 yen. JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s second-largest
steelmaker, jumped 11 percent to 2,489 yen, the biggest increase
since November 2008. Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. climbed 7.1
percent to 180 yen.  Buying Opportunity  Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett  said the record
earthquake is a buying opportunity and he won’t sell his shares
in Japan. Buffett canceled a trip this week to Japan to visit a
factory owned by Iscar Metalworking Cos.’s Tungaloy Corp. in
Fukushima prefecture, the site of the worst nuclear accident in
25 years. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns 80 percent of
Iscar, a maker of cutting tools.  Banks were the biggest support for the Topix. Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group rose 8.3 percent to 405 yen, the largest
gain since November 2009. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s second-largest lender, gained 6.6 percent to 2,715 yen.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc., the No. 3, climbed 7.9 percent to
150 yen.  Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of machines used
to test memory chips, surged 9.8 percent to 1,449 yen, advancing
the most since March 2009, after the Nikkei newspaper said it
will buy Verigy Ltd. for 74 Billion yen ($913 million).  “If the effects of the disaster don’t spread any more,
Japanese stocks are relatively cheap and it’s a good chance to
buy them even if corporate earnings worsen temporarily,” said
 Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. “The comments on Japanese stocks by
Buffett gave investors a push. Foreigners are seeing that the
sell-off of Japanese stocks was temporary, and things will
recover.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
