Polkomtel SA may be interested in
bidding for Exatel SA if the Polish utility PGE SA puts its
phone unit on sale again,  Puls Biznesu  reported, citing Jaroslaw Bauc, chief executive officer of  Poland â€™s second-largest mobile-
phone company.  Polkomtel may also bid for P4 Sp. z o.o., a Polish mobile
phone operator, the newspaper said.  First-quarter earnings at Polkomtel will be comparable to
same period a year-earlier, Bauc also told Puls in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
