International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
acquire Tririga Inc., gaining software that manages real estate
holdings.  Tririga’s programs help manage buildings, strategizing
space usage, monitoring utility costs and estimating
construction expense, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in a
statement. The financial terms weren’t disclosed. Tririga, which
is closely held, is based in  Las Vegas  and has about 200
employees worldwide, according to the statement.  IBM expects that projects making buildings, hospitals and
highways more efficient -- an initiative IBM calls Smarter
Planet -- will be a $10 billion business for the company by
2015. IBM plans to make $20 billion in acquisitions through
2015, buoying that program as well as other growth areas, such
as analytics, company officials have told investors.  The agreement ends IBM’s longest acquisition drought since
2003. The company last announced a deal in October. If it lasted
another week, the period without an announcement would have been
the longest since  Sam Palmisano  became chief executive officer
in 2002. He is also chairman and president.  IBM rose 32 cents to $158 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 23 percent
in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
