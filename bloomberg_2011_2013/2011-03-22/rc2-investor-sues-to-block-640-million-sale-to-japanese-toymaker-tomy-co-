An  RC2 Corp. (RCRC)  investor sued the
company, the maker of Thomas the Tank Engine products, and its
board of directors to block its sale to Tomy Co., saying the
$640 million price was inadequate.  The $27.90-a-share offer “substantially undervalues” RC2
and is an attempt by Tomy to buy the company “at a bargain
price during a temporary downturn in the economy,” Laborers’
Local #231 Pension Plan said in a complaint filed today in state
court in  Chicago . The union fund, which seeks to represent other
investors, accuses RC2 directors of breach of fiduciary duty.  Tomy, the Tokyo-based maker of Transformers and Pokemon
toys, agreed to buy RC2 to add Thomas the Tank Engine products
in  North America  as a declining birth rate erodes demand at
home. The offer was valued at $27.90-a-share in cash, 27 percent
more than the March 9 closing price, Oak Brook, Illinois-based
RC2 and Tomy said March 10.  RC2 Chief Executive Officer Curtis Stoelting, who was also
named as a defendant in the complaint, didn’t immediately return
a call to his office after regular business hours.  The case is Laborers’ Local #231 Pension Plan v. RC2,
11CH10899, Circuit Court of Cook County Illinois, County
Department, Chancery Division (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
