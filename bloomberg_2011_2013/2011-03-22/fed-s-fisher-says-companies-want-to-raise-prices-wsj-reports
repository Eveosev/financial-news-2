President Richard W. Fisher said each of the roughly 50 business
executives he speaks with on a regular basis is looking to price
goods or services “more aggressively” as costs rise, according
to the Wall Street Journal.  “That concerns me,” he said in an interview with the
newspaper today in  Frankfurt . “You’re beginning to hear numbers
in the 3 percent-plus level.”  The regional bank chief said he personally surveys about 50
businesses, more than most of his colleagues at the Fed, and
that the position on prices is “without exception, in every
sector in every size, whether they’re public or private.”  “We have to use a term that the great hockey player  Wayne Gretzky  used: we have to skate ahead of the puck,” Fisher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
