MetLife Inc. (MET)  is a winner among U.S.
financial stocks, based on a Citigroup Inc. competition inspired
by what’s known as March Madness.  The largest U.S. life insurer prevailed in a “Final Four”
that also included  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , according to a report yesterday from the
firm’s financial-services analysts.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, MetLife also has been the
top stock-market performer of the four since the current  bull
market  started two years ago. It’s the only one that has more
than tripled during the period.  Citigroup chose the stock from among its top 16 financial
picks. They were organized into brackets, similar to those used
for the  National Collegiate Athletic Association ’s annual men’s
basketball championship. Each was ranked and seeded according to
the gap between the current market price and the firm’s estimate
for the next 12 months. The MetLife target is $59, or 32 percent
higher than yesterday’s close.  MetLife defeated  CME Group Inc. (CME) ,  XL Group Plc (XL) , Goldman
Sachs and BlackRock en route to victory. The competition was
staged on March 17, before MetLife promoted Steven Kandarian to
succeed Robert Henrikson as chief executive officer. Winners and
losers were based on the analysts’ overall view of each stock.  If the contest had been determined by stock-market gains
and Citigroup had been included, then it would have prevailed
over the Final Four. The company’s shares, scheduled for a 1-
for-10 reverse split, have more than quadrupled since U.S.
stocks bottomed out in March 2009.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
