Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose 12
percent at the end of February from a year earlier, the
government said, as higher prices curbed demand for the meat.  Warehouses held 578.1 million pounds (262,222 metric tons)
of the meat on Feb. 28, up from  515.9 million  a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report.
Inventories climbed 7.3 percent from the end of January.  Wholesale-pork prices jumped 26 percent in the past year to
92.69 cents a pound yesterday, the highest since Aug. 30,
government data show. U.S. exporters shipped 8.3 percent less
pork in January than a month earlier, according to the most-
recent USDA  data .  “Soaring wholesale prices once again limited usage,”  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures Insights, said in an e-
mailed report.  U.S. shipments overseas were “not terribly robust” in
January compared with previous months,  Bob Brown , an independent
market analyst in Edmond,  Oklahoma , said before the report.  “People are still building rib and ham stocks for later,”
Brown said, citing the outlook for increased consumption during
the outdoor-grilling season in the U.S., and on Easter, when ham
is often served at dinner. The holiday is April 24 this year.  Ham supplies on Feb. 28 totaled 118.6 million pounds, up 39
percent from a year earlier and the highest for the date since
record-keeping began in 1995, the USDA said.  Rising Pork Prices  On March 18, hog carcasses nationally averaged 209.45
pounds (95 kilograms), about 2 pounds below the average weight
on Jan. 7, which was the heaviest since at least 2002, USDA data
show.  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.475 cent, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1.0145 a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 22 percent in
the past year, reaching $1.0235 on March 9, the highest since at
least April 1986.  As of Feb. 28, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 7.8 percent from a year earlier
to 51.2 million pounds, according to today’s report.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of February were 14
percent larger than a year earlier at 715.4 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies rose 16 percent to 467.7 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
