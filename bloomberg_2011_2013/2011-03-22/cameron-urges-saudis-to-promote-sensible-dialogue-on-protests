U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said he and Prime Minister David Cameron had urged  Saudi
Arabia ’s foreign minister to promote “sensible dialogue” in
the region.  Hague and Cameron met Prince Faisal Al Saud in London
today. Saudi troops entered Bahrain last week to support the
government against protestors.  “We want to work with Saudi Arabia on the solutions to
these issues,” Hague told business leaders. “Working with them
to promote sensible dialogue is very, very important. That’s
what the prime minister and I have spent a great deal of today
doing with Prince Saud.”  Hague said the protests for democracy across the Arab world
were “set to overtake the 2008 financial crisis and 9/11 as the
most important development of the early 21st century.” He urged
leaders to talk to their people and respond to their demands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
