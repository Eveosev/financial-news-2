FIFA President Sepp Blatter says
he’ll quit in 2015 should he win another four-year term as head
of soccer’s governing body.  Blatter, 75, is seeking re-election for a fourth time. He’s
being challenged by Mohamed Bin Hammam, the head of soccer in
 Asia , in the June 1 vote.  “You know very well that I aspire to another four years,”
Blatter told delegates today at a Congress for European soccer’s
governing body in Paris. “These will be the last four years
that I aspire to.”  The Swiss national said he needs the time to complete his
vision, notably on increasing soccer’s role in promoting social
benefits for young people.  Blatter, who’s been with FIFA since the 1970s, was first
elected president in 1998. The last challenge to his presidency
came in 2002 when Cameroonian Issa Hyatou stood against him.  Bin Hammam, 61, declared his candidacy last week. He and
Blatter had been close, with the Qatari millionaire funding much
of the campaign that took Blatter to his first presidency.  Bin Hammam  in an interview yesterday predicted a close
battle for votes from FIFA’s 208 members. He said he’d been
urged to stand by officials, who’ve told they want new
leadership at the top of soccer.  “People think it’s too long for Mr. Blatter and the change
is going to benefit FIFA,” Bin Hammam said. “I don’t think Mr.
Blatter can beat me easily and I don’t think I can beat him
easily.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
