(Corrects deficit target year in third paragraph.)  The  Portuguese government  forecasts
the economy will contract this year as investment declines and
it cuts spending to narrow the budget deficit.  Gross domestic product will fall 0.9 percent in 2011
following a 1.4 percent increase last year, according to
 Portugal ’s stability and growth program released last night. The
forecast is less than the 1.3 percent contraction predicted by
the Bank of Portugal in January and compares with an outlook of
0.2 percent growth included in the budget released last year.
The new plan says the economy will expand 0.3 percent next year,
0.7 percent in 2013 and 1.3 percent in 2014.  The government forecasts debt as a percentage of GDP will
climb to 87.9 percent in 2011 and 88.1 percent in 2012 from 82.4
percent last year. That ratio will start falling in 2013 to 87.4
percent, and will drop to 85.3 percent the following year, the
plan showed. The government set a target for a  budget deficit  of
4.6 percent of GDP in 2011, before reaching the EU limit of 3
percent in 2012, then 2 percent in 2013 and 1 percent in 2014.  Portugal is raising taxes and implementing the deepest
spending cuts in more than three decades, aiming to convince
investors it can narrow its budget gap, curb its debt and avoid
a bailout after the Greek debt crisis led to a surge in
borrowing costs for high-deficit euro nations.  Risk Premium  The spread between Portuguese and German 10-year bond
yields fell 1 basis point to 412 basis points today after
reaching a euro-era record of 484 on Nov. 11. Ireland in
November became the second euro country after  Greece  to seek a
bailout and the first to request aid from the  European Financial
Stability Facility . Portugal’s 10-year bond yield climbed to a
euro-era record of 7.70 percent on March 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The stability and growth program forecasts the average rate
of Portugal’s 10-year bonds will be 6.8 percent in 2011, 6.9
percent in 2012, 6.8 percent in 2013 and 6.5 percent in 2014.  Portuguese Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  had said his
government is available to discuss its deficit-cutting measures
with opposition parties as he tries to avoid a “political
crisis,” early elections and the possibility of a bailout. “If
parliament decides on a motion against the stability and growth
program, that means the government is not in a condition to make
commitments internationally,” Socrates said on March 15.  Additional Measures  Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos on March 11
presented additional deficit-cutting measures equal to 4.5
percent of GDP over the three years through 2013, including a
reduction in pensions of more than 1,500 euros ($2,134) a month
and further cuts in tax benefits. Teixeira dos Santos said
yesterday that a political crisis would make it more difficult
for the country to access financial markets.  Portugal’s  Social Democratic Party , the biggest opposition
group in parliament, has said it does not back the new measures
presented by the government. The  Social Democrats  have said that
they support Portugal’s plan to reduce its budget gap and meet
the deficit targets.  Socrates became prime minister in 2005 and his Socialist
Party won re-election in 2009 without a majority in parliament.
The Social Democrats agreed in October to let the government’s
2011 budget proposal pass in parliament by abstaining.  Bond Redemptions  Portugal intends to sell as much as 20 billion euros of
bonds this year to finance its budget and cover the cost of
maturing debt. Portugal faces bond redemptions in April and June
worth about 9 billion euros in total. It also faces bill
maturities in July, August, September, October and November.  The government is already trimming the wage bill by 5
percent for public-sector workers earning more than 1,500 euros
a month, freezing hiring and raising value-added  sales tax  by 2
percentage points to 23 percent to help narrow a deficit that
amounted to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2009, the fourth-biggest in
the euro region after Ireland, Greece and  Spain .  Portugal will report a 2010 budget deficit of about 7
percent of GDP, narrower than the 7.3 percent gap the government
had forecast,Socrates said on Jan. 28.  The government is estimating it will raise 2.18 billion
euros in revenue from the sale of state assets this year. To
strengthen the financial system, banks should have a core Tier 1
capital ratio of 8 percent by the end of 2011, according to the
plan released yesterday.  GDP fell 0.3 percent in the final three months of 2010, the
first quarterly contraction in a year. Portugal’s unemployment
rose to 11.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest since at
least 1998.  The government forecasts unemployment will rise to 11.2
percent this year from 10.8 percent in 2010, and inflation will
accelerate to 2.7 percent in 2011 from 1.4 percent last year.  Portugal’s economic growth has averaged less than 1 percent
a year in the past decade, one of  Europe ’s weakest growth rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
