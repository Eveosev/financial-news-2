Coal leases on federal lands in
 Wyoming  may raise as much as $21.3 billion from bids and royalty
payments after an auction this year, the Interior Department
said.  Powder River Basin tracts cover 7,441 acres and hold about
758 million tons of low-sulfur coal, according to a statement
today. Almost half of the revenue from sales will go to the
state of Wyoming, the department said.  “We’re moving forward with coal leasing opportunities,”
Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said today at a press conference
in Cheyenne, the state capital. “Wyoming is at the heart of
coal production in America.”  Wyoming provides almost 40 percent of the fuel used by the
U.S. coal-burning power plants. It’s more popular than coal from
the Eastern U.S., because it contains 15 times less sulfur and
leads to fewer emissions of  greenhouse gases , according to the
statement.  The anticipated sales will be held May 11, June 15, July 13
and Aug. 17, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
