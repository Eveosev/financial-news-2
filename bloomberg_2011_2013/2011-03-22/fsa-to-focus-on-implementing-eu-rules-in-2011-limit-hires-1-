The U.K. Financial Services
Authority will focus on implementing international financial
rules for banks and insurers this year and will forgo hiring
additional staff.  The financial watchdog targeted European insurance rules
and Basel III, an international accord on bank capital, as “the
two biggest policy initiatives,” in a statement on next year’s
 business plan . The FSA will also implement a review of the
mortgage market, publishing an assessment later this year.  “The 2011/12 business year for the FSA will be a difficult
one,”  Hector Sants , the FSA’s chief executive officer, said in
the  statement . “We will be seeking to deliver this agenda with
a capped headcount.”  The FSA increased its budget 10 percent to 501 million
pounds ($821 million) in February, citing structural changes and
more intensive supervision of large banks. The FSA, the U.K.’s
financial regulator, will be abolished by 2013 and replaced by
at least two new authorities.  “All this has to be done at the same time as taking
forward the preparations for a new regulatory structure,” Sants
said.  The FSA is creating internal units to prepare for the
creation of new authorities.  Margaret Cole , the FSA’s
enforcement chief, will lead the so-called Conduct Business
Unit, as managing director. Sants will lead the Prudential
Business Unit.  To contact the reporter for this story:
