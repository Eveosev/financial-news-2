South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably cut its forecast for
this season’s harvest of the grain, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 10.9 million
metric tons of corn, down from the 11.04 million tons projected
last month, according to the median estimate of 11 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 10.5 million tons
to 11.4 million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its second assessment of the harvest on March 24 at 3:30
p.m. Johannesburg time.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, fell 3 rand, or 0.2 percent,
to close at 1,592 rand ($230) a ton today. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery fell 14 rand, or 0.8 percent,
to 1,635 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal feed  in
South Africa. The U.S. and  Argentina  are the world’s biggest
corn exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
