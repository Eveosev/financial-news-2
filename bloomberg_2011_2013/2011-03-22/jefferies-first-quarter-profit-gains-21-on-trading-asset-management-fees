Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the
investment bank that’s been expanding its advisory unit, said
fiscal first-quarter profit rose 21 percent as trading and
asset-management revenue climbed.  Net income for the three months ended Feb. 28 was $87.3
million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $72.1 million, or 35
cents, in the three months ended March 31 last year, the New
York-based firm said today in a statement. The average estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 37
cents. The company announced last year it would change its
fiscal year-end to Nov. 30 from Dec. 31.  “We believe we are on the right track to balance the
realization of solid short-term growth and results,” Chief
Executive Officer Richard B. Handler, 49, said in the statement.  Jefferies increased its headcount by 17 percent to 3,084
employees in the 11 months through Nov. 30 to boost the firm’s
share of mergers-and-acquisition deals. Jefferies ranked 18th on
the financial advisory league tables in its fiscal first
quarter, up from 41st in the first three months of last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Advisory revenue rose to $126.4 million from $62.3 million
in the first period, according to the statement.  “We’re seeing corporations that have paid down their debt,
refinanced at cheap rates, are generally flush with cash, have
cut their costs and have increasing confidence,” Handler said
in a phone interview today. “If you’re a company that came out
of the crisis stronger rather than weaker, you are looking
toward M&A for growth.”  Record Net Revenue  Net revenue increased to a record $758.4 million, or 31
percent, from $580.1 million, Jefferies said. Investment-banking
revenue rose to $239.1 million in the first quarter from $198.3
million in the three months ended March 31 last year.  Asset-management fees increased to $23.9 million from $6.6
million in the three months ended March 31, according to the
statement. The increase was driven by the firm’s European-based
convertible fund, Chief Financial Officer Peregrine Broadbent
said today on a conference call.  Jefferies paid $442.9 million in compensation expenses, up
from $319.8 million in the year-earlier quarter. Headcount at
the end of the first quarter was 3,082.  Revenue from Jefferies’s fixed-income business jumped to
$318.1 million in the first quarter from $200.8 million in the
three months ending March 31 last year.  “We’ve been investing in that business for the past three
years,” Handler said. “That’s really one of the areas where we
were able to take advantage of the disarray and assemble a
first-rate global team.”  Jefferies shares fell 6 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $24.48 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
