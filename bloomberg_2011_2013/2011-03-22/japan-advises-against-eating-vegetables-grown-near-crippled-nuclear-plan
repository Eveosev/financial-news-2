Japan ’s health ministry advised
against eating some vegetables from the prefecture where crews
are struggling to bring a damaged nuclear power plant under
control.  People eating vegetables from Fukushima for the past 10
days will have ingested half of the natural level of a year’s
worth of radiation, the ministry said in a statement.  The ministry recommended avoiding leafy vegetables,
broccoli and cauliflower produced in Fukushima. No vegetables
produced in open fields have been shipped from the prefecture
since March 21, the ministry added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
