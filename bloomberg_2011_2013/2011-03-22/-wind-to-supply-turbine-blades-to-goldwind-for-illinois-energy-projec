LM Wind Power A/S, the world’s
biggest maker of turbine blades, will supply components for a
wind farm that Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.’s U.S.
unit is building in northern  Illinois .  The Shady Oaks project will have 70 to 75 of Goldwind’s
1.5-megawatt, direct-drive turbines with blades produced at LM
Wind’s Grand Forks,  North Dakota , plant, Chicago-based Goldwind
USA said today in an e-mailed statement. Construction is set to
start in the second half of the year.  Shady Oaks, in Lee County, will be the first large-scale
wind farm in the U.S. to use Urumqi, China-based Goldwind’s
turbines. A 4.5-megawatt project began producing power in
 Minnesota  in 2010 using Goldwind turbines and blades from
Kolding, Denmark-based LM Wind.  Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN)  announced March 15 that it would
supply Goldwind with about 70 towers for the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
