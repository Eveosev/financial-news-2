United Auto Workers President  Bob King  called  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s $56.5 million stock award to Chief
Executive Officer Alan Mulally “outrageous” and unfair to the
automaker’s employees.  “Alan Mulally is a great CEO, but I don’t think any human
being in the world deserves that much money,” King told
reporters yesterday at the union’s bargaining convention in
Detroit. “It’s outrageous.”  King, 64, elected president of the union in June, will
negotiate new contracts this year with Ford,  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and Chrysler Group LLC. While the agreements don’t expire until
September, King has said workers must be rewarded for the $7,000
to $30,000 in concessions they each gave since 2005 to help the
automakers survive.  Mulally, 65, who came to Ford from  Boeing Co. (BA)  in 2006, has
revived the automaker by emphasizing quality and expanding its
lineup with small cars such as the Focus and Fiesta. Ford earned
$9.28 billion in the last two years after $30.1 billion in
losses from 2006 through 2008.  As a reward for the turnaround, Ford on March 3 paid
Mulally unrestricted stock worth $56.5 million and gave
Executive Chairman  Bill Ford  unrestricted shares valued at $42.4
million. Ford withheld some of the stock awards to cover their
income taxes. After taxes, Mulally received $33.4 million and
Bill Ford got $25.1 million.  Ford shares rose more than fourfold in 2009 and gained 68
percent last year. The stock has declined 15 percent in 2011 and
slipped 25 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $14.34 yesterday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  ‘Morally Wrong’  “I like  Alan Mulally , but I just think it’s morally
wrong,” King said. “It creates problems for Ford both in the
salaried workforce and hourly workforce. It seems like one
individual is getting all the gains instead of gains being
shared by everybody.”  The size of Mulally’s stock grant will help the union get a
better deal at the bargaining table this year, King said.  “Will that give us more traction and more support from the
membership to make sure they get a very substantial share in the
upside? Sure it will,” King said. “I’d rather not have that
help.”  John Stoll , a Ford spokesman, said the Dearborn, Michigan-
based automaker has a “strong relationship” with the UAW and it
is in the company’s best interest to continue working together.  “In terms of the comments made about compensation, Alan
Mulally’s leadership during 2010 has been widely recognized as
extraordinary,” Stoll said. “His compensation reflects Ford’s
goal of retaining a world-class CEO.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
