Ethanol futures were little changed
for a second day in  Chicago  on speculation that supply and
demand are in balance for the biofuel.  The grain-based additive was steady ahead of tomorrow’s
Energy Department report on ethanol production and stockpiles.
Last week, output rose to 895,000 barrels a day, the highest
since Feb. 4, while stockpiles were little-changed at 19.9
million barrels.  “No one is really interested in anything,” said Ronnie
Virissimo, a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “It’s
pretty flat. We’re still a little bit tight. There’s not a lot
of direction coming from outside markets.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery added 0.1 cent to
$2.488 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures yesterday
increased 0.2 cent. Prices have gained 59 percent in the past
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast jumped
5.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.655 a gallon and in the U.S.
Gulf the additive increased 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.645,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 4 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.475
a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel lost 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.585.  Corn for May delivery advanced 0.25 cents to $6.8675 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes about 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Gasoline for May delivery gained 0.71 cent to $3.0045 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
