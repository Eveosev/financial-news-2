Czech President Vaclav Klaus spoke
out against the allied forces’ air campaign over  Libya , calling
it a “declaration of war,”  Hospodarske Noviny  reported him as
saying before the European Commission summit yesterday.  Other government officials, including Foreign Minister
Karel Schwarzenberg and Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra, are
lukewarm about the action, the newspaper said.  While the  Czech Republic  supports the campaign, it won’t
contribute forces unless it’s for humanitarian aid, the
newspaper reported Vondra as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
