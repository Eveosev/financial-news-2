The euro fell for the first time in
four days against the dollar as investors speculated  Europe ’s
leaders will struggle to find a permanent mechanism to address
the region’s debt crisis.  The shared currency erased gains against the greenback as a
spokeswoman for Allied Irish Banks Plc said it has no plans to
miss debt payments, even as Irish government two-year note
yields rose to 10.18 percent, the highest since 2003. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers,
touched a 15-month low. Currencies tied to growth, including the
New Zealand and Australian dollars and South Africa’s rand, were
the best performers against the dollar.  “It’s cautionary news for the euro; we’ve seen a little
bit of a pullback,” said  Brian Dolan , chief strategist at
FOREX.com, a unit of online currency trading firm Gain Capital
in Bedminster,  New Jersey . “Look at what the market has
shrugged off between  Japan ,  Libya , the intervention. The market
is looking at this as good for risk overall.”  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.4196 at 5:09 p.m. in New
York, after touching $1.4249, the highest since Nov. 5. The
dollar traded at 80.97 yen from 81.03 yen yesterday.  The Dollar Index was little changed at 75.427 after
reaching the lowest since December 2009. Gold fluctuated in New
York as a weaker dollar spurred demand for an alternative
investment. Gold futures for April delivery fell 40 cents, to
$1,425.40 an ounce.  Euro Counterparts  The 17-nation currency fell against most of its major
counterparts after Irish banks were forecast to need an
additional 20 billion euros ($28 billion) of capital to absorb
losses flowing from any rapid sale of assets, according to Davy,
the Dublin-based securities firm.  “The European Central Bank is moving ahead on in to a
rate-rising mode and that’s adding pressure to European
lawmakers to put meat on the bones of resolving the bailout
mechanism,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut . “This
is putting pressure on euro bulls in a risk on environment.”  EU finance chiefs settled yesterday on a permanent rescue
fund to lend 500 billion euros as of 2013, while remaining
divided over how to get the current stopgap fund to its full
capacity. Work thrashing out a solution to the region’s credit
woes is due to culminate at a March 24-25 summit of European
leaders.  Irish Yields  The yield on the Irish two-year note surged 65 basis points
to 9.898 percent, after reaching 10.18 percent, the most since
2003, when Bloomberg began collecting the data.  Catherine Burke , a spokeswoman for Allied Irish Banks, a
government-controlled lender, said it has “no plans” to miss
interest payments on its bonds.  The euro earlier touched a five-month high against the
greenback after  European Central Bank  Executive Board member
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and Governing Council member Yves Mersch both said yesterday that “strong vigilance” is
necessary to keep a lid on inflation.  Currencies tied to risk were the top performers against the
dollar as implied volatility measured by the JPMorgan Chase &
Co. index for seven major currencies fell to the lowest in more
than a week. The gauge touched 14.13 on March 17, the highest
since June as the yen strengthened to a post-World War II high
on March 16.  Kiwi Outlook  New Zealand’s dollar  was the best performer against the
dollar, appreciating 0.6 percent to 74.01 U.S. cents. The
 International Monetary Fund  said the nation’s central bank may
need to raise rates “relatively quickly” once the economy
begins to recover.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to
$1.0103 and  South Africa ’s rand rose 0.8 percent to $6.8974.  The pound rose as much as 0.6 percent to $1.641, the
highest since January 2010, as inflation data bolstered the case
for the  Bank of England  to increase rates. Against the euro,
sterling appreciated 0.5 percent to 86.75 pence.  Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in February from a year
earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics, higher
than the 4.2 percent median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The pound may advance to a level last reached in October
2008 against the dollar if it closes above $1.6380, according to
Citigroup Inc.  That rate, reached today, is a 74 percent retracement of
sterling’s drop from August 2009 to May 2010, Citigroup
technical analysts led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  in  New York  wrote in a
research note to clients. If the currency closes above $1.6380,
he said it may rise to $1.7050, which would be a 2 1/2-year
high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
