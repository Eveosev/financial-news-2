Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index rose 0.8% in February,
double its gain in each of the previous three months and
its largest advance since May 2010. The increase was
broadly-based, with 9 of the 10 components posting gains
in February compared with 5 rising the month before. A
turnaround in manufacturing contributed to the overall
increase in the index.  In manufacturing, new orders for durable goods
rebounded 1.0%, after three straight declines. Some of
this upturn reflects the marked improvement in exports in
December. The ratio of shipments to inventories posted its
first gain in five months. Manufacturers appeared
optimistic that the improvement in demand was sustainable,
as they extended the length of the workweek and
substantially boosted employment levels over the last
three months.  The stock market continued to lead all components with
a 2.7% increase in February. The housing index was close
behind with a 1.8% advance, mostly due to higher existing
home sales. The improvement in housing was reflected in
furniture and appliance sales, up 0.9% for their first
gain in eight months. Spending on other durable goods rose
0.6%.  To contact the reporter on this story:
