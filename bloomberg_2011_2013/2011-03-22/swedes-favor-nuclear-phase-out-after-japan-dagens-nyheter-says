Swedish support for phasing out its
reliance on atomic energy has risen as  Japan  struggles to
contain a nuclear crisis triggered by an earthquake and tsunami,
Dagens Nyheter reported, citing a poll conducted by Synovate.  Swedish support for gradually shutting down the Nordic
countryâ€™s reactors rose to 36 percent from 15 percent in 2008,
the Stockholm-based newspaper reported today. That compares with
21 percent support for expanding nuclear projects versus 47
percent backing for such steps in 2008, Dagens Nyheter said.  The poll was based on responses from 1,000 people collected
from March 15 to March 18, Dagens Nyheter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
