Prince William  and Kate Middleton
will travel in an open-air carriage following their marriage on
April 29, the same vehicle used by his parents, Prince Charles
and Diana, Princess of  Wales , on their wedding day 30 years ago.  “The Prince of Wales traveled to St Paul’s Cathedral in
the 1902 State Landau for his wedding in 1981, returning in it
with The Princess of Wales after the service,” Prince Charles’s
office said in an e-mailed statement.  William and Kate will travel in the Landau along the
processional route from Westminster Abbey, where the wedding
service will be held, to  Buckingham Palace , which is hosting the
reception. It was specifically built for King Edward VII and was
intended to be used at his coronation.  “In the event of severely wet weather, the couple will
travel in The Glass Coach,” the statement said. The Glass Coach
was built in 1881 and was purchased for use at King George V’s
Coronation in 1911. It was used by Diana on the way to her
wedding in 1981 and also by Sarah Ferguson for her 1986 marriage
to Prince Andrew, Charles’s brother.  William, 28, the grandson of  Queen Elizabeth II  and son of
the late Diana, has been dating Middleton, 29, since 2003 after
they met while studying at St. Andrews University in Scotland.
The engagement was announced on Nov. 16, ending years of
speculation about whether the second-in-line to the British
throne would marry his long-term girlfriend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
