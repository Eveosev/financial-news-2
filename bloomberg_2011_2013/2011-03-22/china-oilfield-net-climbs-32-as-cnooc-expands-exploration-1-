China Oilfield Services Ltd. (2883) , a
unit of the nation’s largest offshore oil producer, posted a 32
percent increase in profit as its biggest customer  Cnooc Ltd. (883) 
expanded exploration to meet growing domestic demand.  Net income rose to 4.13 billion yuan ($631 million), or
0.9184 yuan a share, from 3.14 billion yuan, or 0.6975 yuan, the
previous year, the Beijing-based company said in a  statement 
today. That compares with the 4.04 billion-yuan mean estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Cnooc, a unit of state-controlled China National Offshore
Oil Corp., beat its target of increasing output by as much as 28
percent last year as it opened new oilfields off the coast of
 China . Sales at China Oilfield dropped 1.8 percent to 17.6
billion yuan, according to the statement.  “High oil prices and increasing global demand for oil and
gas resources will motivate oil companies for more investments
in exploration and development activities,” it said in today’s
statement.  China Oilfield expects capital expenditure to reach 4.72
billion yuan this year, the company said Jan. 27.  Cnooc plans to commence four offshore Chinese projects this
year, the company said in January. It was awarded a contract for
as many as five years for its COSLPIONEER rig with Statoil ASA,
the company said in December.  China Oilfield’s shares fell 0.1 percent to HK$16.08 before
the earnings statement and are down 8 percent this year,
compared with a 2 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index .  China’s economy grew 10.3 percent last year, the fastest
pace in three years, boosting demand for energy. Vehicle sales
including cars, trucks and buses rose 32 percent in 2010,
according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  -- Wang Ying  in  Hong Kong . Editors: Stephen Cunningham, Jonas Bergman.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
