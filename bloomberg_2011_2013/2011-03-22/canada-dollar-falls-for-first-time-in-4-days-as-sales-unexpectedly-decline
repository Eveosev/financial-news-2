The Canadian dollar fell for the
first time in four days against its U.S. counterpart as retail
sales unexpectedly declined for a second month, spurring
speculation the nation’s economic recovery is slowing.  The currency, known as the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, earlier gained as crude oil, the
nation’s biggest export, advanced. The loonie extended losses as
budget documents released today showed  Canada  will boost
borrowing next year by 6.3 percent to a record C$102 billion
($104.2 billion).  “We had a nice rebound in risk appetite in the last four
days, and now the rebound is paused,” said  Brian Dolan , chief
strategist at FOREX.com, a unit of online currency trading firm
Gain Capital in Bedminster,  New Jersey . “It’s caused a
temporary lapse in risk appetite.”  Canada’s dollar depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 98.14
cents per  U.S. dollar  before trading at 98.07 cents at 5 p.m. in
Toronto, down 0.3 percent from 97.78 cents yesterday. Earlier it
gained as much as 0.3 percent to touch 97.47 cents, the
strongest level in a week. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0195.  Retail sales declined 0.3 percent in January to a
seasonally adjusted C$37.1 billion, following December’s 0.2
percent drop,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Sales were
expected to grow 1 percent, according to the median of 23
responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  “It’s a fairly large undershoot,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New
York. “The market has been heavily biased toward long Canadian-
dollar positions for a while, and when you have a market
overextended, you tend to have reactions that are more
notable.” A long position is a bet a currency will strengthen.  Bet Reductions  Futures traders lowered their bets last week that the
Canadian dollar will gain against the U.S. dollar, figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed. The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds 
and other speculators on an advance in the loonie compared with
those on a drop, so-called net longs, was 56,991 on March 15,
compared with net longs of 77,544 a week earlier.  The loonie dropped 0.6 percent over the past month in a
basket of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The euro rose 2
percent, while the U.S. dollar lost 1.6 percent.  Crude oil for April delivery climbed as much as 2.2 percent
to $104.54 a barrel in New York, the highest since March 10,
after earlier dropping 0.9 percent to $101.43. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.4 percent.  The greenback fell against most of its 16 major
counterparts today. The U.S. is Canada’s largest trade partner.  Loonie Versus Euro  The loonie fell 0.1 percent against the euro to C$1.3929.
The 17-nation currency weakened against most of its peers,
including the greenback, on concern  Europe ’s leaders will
struggle to find a permanent mechanism to deal with the region’s
debt crisis. European Union finance chiefs settled yesterday on
how to enable a permanent rescue fund to lend 500 billion euros
($712 billion) as of 2013, while remaining divided over how to
get the current stopgap fund to its full capacity.  Canada’s index of leading indicators rose in February the
fastest in nine months, Statistics Canada said today in a
separate report. The gauge increased 0.8 percent, led by gains
in stock prices and “a turnaround in manufacturing,” the
agency said. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a
0.7 percent rise.  The nation’s inflation rate, excluding volatile items like
gasoline, slowed in February to a record-low 0.9 percent from a
year earlier, compared with 1.4 percent in January, government
data showed on March 18.  Bonds Gain  Government bonds  rose today, pushing yields on the
benchmark 10-year note down three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.18 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent
security due in June 2020 increased 21 cents to C$102.51.  Canada will auction C$3.2 billion of three-year notes
tomorrow, according to a statement on the Bank of Canada’s
website. The 2 percent securities mature in March 2014.  Canada will boost borrowing next fiscal year as part of a
three-year plan to set aside more money to help the government
weather a financial-market collapse. Projected debt sales for
the fiscal year that starts April 1 match the record set in
2009-10, and exceed the estimate of C$70 billion to C$75 billion
in a Bloomberg News survey of three analysts last week.  Flaherty Budget  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , releasing his budget in
Ottawa, pledged to use an improving fiscal outlook to speed
 deficit reduction  while providing C$7.6 billion in new spending
and tax cuts to win support from opposition lawmakers and avoid
an election.  The  plan  projects a C$29.6 billion deficit in the fiscal
year that begins April 1, down from C$40.5 billion in the
current year and a record C$55.6 billion two years ago. A
surplus is projected for the 2015-2016 fiscal year.  The budget was rejected by opposition lawmakers, who hold a
majority of seats in the House of Commons. They have suggested
they may try to bring the government down with a no confidence
motion this week, and the government could also fall if the
fiscal plan is defeated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
