Germany ’s BaFin financial regulator
is investigating  Gagfah SA (GFJ)  Chief Executive Officer William Brennan on suspicion of  insider trading ,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing BaFin.  The probe concerns Brennan’s sale of Gagfah shares worth
4.7 million euros ($6.7 million) on Feb. 3, about four weeks
before the city of Dresden said it was considering taking legal
action against some of Gagfah’s units, the newspaper said in a
preview of an article to be published tomorrow. Brennan denies
any wrongdoing, Handelsblatt said.  The newspaper cited a Gagfah spokeswoman as saying that
Brennan had been aware for “a long time” that Dresden was
looking into the matter, though he wasn’t aware of any plans for
the city to make “hefty demands” on the company.  Spokespeople for BaFin and Gagfah didn’t immediately return
calls requesting comment after business hours today. A listing
for Brennan couldn’t be found in directory assistance or on the
Internet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
