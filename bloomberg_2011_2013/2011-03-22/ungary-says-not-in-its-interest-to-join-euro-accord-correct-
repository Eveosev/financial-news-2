Hungary  says it’s “not in its
interest” to join the euro area’s Competitiveness Pact as that
would require harmonizing its corporate tax rate with other
members, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.  Hungary wants to retain the independence of its tax system
and wants to continue “strengthening the competitive position”
of its tax regime, the ministry said.  The government agrees with the other areas of the
Competitiveness Pact and is already taking steps to ensure
Hungary’s fiscal and financial stability, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
