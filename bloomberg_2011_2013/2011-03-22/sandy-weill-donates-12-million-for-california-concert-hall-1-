Sanford “Sandy” Weill, former
chairman of  Citigroup Inc. (C) , is donating $12 million to complete
construction of a 1,400-seat concert hall and adjacent grounds
at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park,  California .  The contribution for the Green Music Center is the largest
cash gift in the history of Sonoma State and, in addition to the
hall, will pay for a terraced lawn and a 10,000-capacity
amphitheater, the school said today in an announcement. The
complex will be named the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Hall, Lawn
and Commons and is scheduled to open in September 2012.  “This could be one of the great destinations, a place that
attracts world artists to Northern California,” Sandy Weill
said in a telephone interview. He retired as Citigroup’s chief
executive officer in 2003 and as chairman in 2006.  The Weills bought a home in Sonoma County in October and
remain full-time residents of  New York  City. The gift is the
couple’s first large donation in Northern California, said
Michael Conway, Sandy Weill’s chief of staff. They have donated
more than $100 million to New York’s  Carnegie Hall , where Sandy
Weill is chairman, and have given away more than $800 million in
total, said the former Citigroup head.  To contact the reporter on this story:
