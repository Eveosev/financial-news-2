Europe ’s banking system is more
capable of resisting a sovereign default than investors believe,
according to Bernard de Longevialle, a  Standard & Poor’s 
analyst.  “We have modeled sovereign defaults for euro countries,
and the resilience of the European banking system to a sovereign
default is really quite high,” Longevialle said at The
Economist’s Future of Banking conference in Paris today. “There
is fear in the markets that is excessive.”  European Union  governments are testing major banks to gauge
how they would withstand a financial crisis. Critics say the
tests must take more account of the possibility of a sovereign
default in the region. The results of the tests on capital and
liquidity will be published at the end of the month.  “The market is obsessed by sovereign defaults, and until
you have addressed that, there will still be concern on the
stress-test results,” Longevialle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
