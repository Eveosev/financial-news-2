Turkey  paid two million liras ($1.3
million) in rewards for employees who reported  tax evasion  at
their workplaces last year, Star newspaper reported, without
saying how it got the information.  Turkey awards informants with 10 percent of the amount of
tax that was evaded, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. In one
case, an employee in the textiles industry got a reward of
400,000 liras, it said.  Last year was a record year both for the size of awards and
the number of people who came forward to make reports, Star
said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
