Odontoprev SA (ODPV3) , Brazil’s largest
provider of dental-care plans, led gains for Brazilian health-
care companies after Credit Suisse AG said it has a “bullish”
view of the industry.  Odontoprev rose 4.3 percent to 24.46 reais at the close of
 Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time.  Fleury SA (FLRY3) , a
medical-services provider, increased 4.1 percent to 24.23 reais.
 Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) , a Brazilian health insurer, rose 2.7
percent to 18.89 reais. The Bovespa index climbed 1.3 percent to
67,578.33.  “We believe a strong economy should lead to a larger
percentage of the population with payroll jobs and higher income
per capita, culminating in a higher penetration of health-care
plans, exams and dental plans among  Brazil ’s population,”
Natalia Lacava and Luiz Otavio Campos, analysts at Credit Suisse
in Sao Paulo, said in a note to clients dated yesterday. “Our
general view of the sector is bullish.”  Credit Suisse rates Amil and Odontoprev “outperform,” and
Fleury “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
