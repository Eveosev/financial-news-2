Taiwan ’s dollar gained for a second
day as optimism the worst of Japan’s nuclear crisis is over
boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  The Taiex index of shares rose to the highest level in
seven days after the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
yesterday that radiation-containment units at Fukushima’s Dai-
Ichi nuclear reactors are intact. The currency’s gains were
limited by official data yesterday that showed Taiwan’s export
orders increased 5.33 percent from a year earlier in February,
the least in 16 months.  “Looks like the situation in Japan has eased,” said
 Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in
 Hong Kong . “Risk appetite has come back. But the recovery
outlook of  Japan ’s economy is still something investors should
look at.”  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$29.536
against its U.S. counterpart as of 9:28 a.m. local time,
according to Taipei Forex Inc.  Government bonds were little changed. The yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021, the most-traded government
debt, was 1.342 percent, compared with 1.341 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
