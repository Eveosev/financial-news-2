Shakeel Ahmed, chairman of
 Hindustan Copper Ltd. (HCP) , India’s sole miner of the ore, comments
on copper demand and prices once Japan starts rebuilding regions
devastated by the earthquake and tsunami. He spoke in an
interview in Kolkata yesterday.  “Japan consumes only 5 percent of the global copper demand,
but as soon as reconstruction starts, this demand will go up.
Prices, however, will not be influenced by Japan.”  On the Libya impact:  “The unrest in Libya will not have a direct bearing on
copper prices. If the overall economic condition in the world
deteriorates, or if industrial growth slows due to sustained
higher crude  oil prices , then those may see copper demand
decreasing. As a result, prices may go lower too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
