Turkey  has assumed diplomatic
functions in Libya on behalf of the U.S., U.K., Italy and
 Australia  at their request, Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk
Unal said.  The Turkish embassy in Tripoli has agreed to perform
consular and diplomatic functions for the four nations after
they closed their missions and the U.N. began to implement a no-
fly zone over Libya, Unal said in a telephone interview today.  The Turkish embassy has played a key role in negotiating
the release of foreign journalists held in custody by Libyan
forces, including four New York Times journalists delivered to
Turkish authorities in Tripoli yesterday, he said.  Turkey maintains contact with Libyan regime authorities
both through its embassy in Tripoli and through the Libyan
embassy in Ankara, he said.  Dialogue with the Libyan regime must continue, Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said today in a speech to his
party at parliament. Turkey has doubts over whether military
intervention is justified in Libya and wants to encourage a
peaceful transition of power from leader  Muammar Qaddafi â€™s rule,
he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
