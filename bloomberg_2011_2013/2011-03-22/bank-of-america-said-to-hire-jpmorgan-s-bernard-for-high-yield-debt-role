Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender by assets, hired  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Adam Bernard
as a director in its high-yield debt unit, a person with
knowledge of the appointment said.  Bernard stepped down as an executive director in JPMorgan’s
high-yield capital markets group this week, said the person, who
declined to be identified because an announcement hasn’t been
made. Bernard will start in Bank of America’s New York offices
in the second quarter, the person said.  Bank of America was the second-biggest underwriter of U.S.
high-yield bonds last year, behind JPMorgan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The market for non-investment-grade debt
revived this week after issuance of all types fell more than 50
percent earlier this month amid the threat of a nuclear disaster
in  Japan .  Bernard will report to A.J. Murphy and John Cokinos, co-
heads of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank’s capital
markets operations for leveraged finance in the Americas.
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
