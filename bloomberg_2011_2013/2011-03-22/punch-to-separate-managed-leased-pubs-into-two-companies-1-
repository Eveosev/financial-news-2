Punch Taverns Plc (PUB) , a U.K. operator
of more than 6,700 pubs, plans to separate its managed
businesses handled by its Spirit division from its leased
outlets before the end of the summer and create two independent
public companies for them.  “A demerger will provide the platform to enable both
businesses to focus on the very different strategies required to
deliver  shareholder value ,” Chief Executive Ian Dyson said
today in a statement. “Spirit will be positioned to deliver
market leading sales and profit growth.”  Under the plan Punch will reduce its leased pub estate to
around 3,000 outlets and invest in its managed business to
“accelerate its operational turnaround and growth,” the
company said in today’s statement.  With “limited synergies” between the managed and leased
businesses the company’s current strategy is “not
sustainable,” Punch said.  The company plans to dispose of around 500 of its leased
pubs per year, Dyson said today in a conference call. Disposing
of the pubs could take as long as five years, he said.  Spirit will initially have an estate of around 1,400 pubs,
and the internal separation of Punch and Spirit will be
completed by July, Dyson said, adding that he is “very, very
committed to seeing this through.”  Punch rose as much as 3.45 pence, or 4.7 percent, in  London 
trading to 77 pence as of 8:31 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
