Manchester United’s parent company
had a record 104.7 million-pound ($171.5 million) fiscal-year
loss because of costs related to swapping a long-term  bank loan 
for a bond and lower income from player sales.  Red Football Joint Venture Ltd., the holding company for
the 18-time English soccer champion, spent 40.7 million pounds
on a 526 million-pound bond to replace long-term bank debt, and
had an unrealized currency-exchange loss of 19.3 million pounds,
it said in a filing published by  Companies House  for the year
ended June 30, 2010.  The club had a profit of 6.3 million pounds last year,
benefiting from the world record sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to
Real Madrid for 80 million pounds. Revenue increased to 286.4
million pounds from 278.5 million pounds for the year.  The accounts also note a 30 million-pound interest payment
on a so-called payment-in-kind loan. The 220 million-pound
borrowing has since been paid off.  To contact the reporter for this story:
