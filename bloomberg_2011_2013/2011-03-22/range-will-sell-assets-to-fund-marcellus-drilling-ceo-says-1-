Range Resources Inc., the U.S. oil
and gas producer that agreed to sell  Texas  assets for $900
million in February, will divest more fields to finance
development of its holdings in the Marcellus Shale formation in
 Pennsylvania , Chief Executive Officer John Pinkerton said.  “We’re a relatively small company and we’ve found probably
the largest gas field in the U.S.,” Pinkerton said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television today. “We’re going to need
all the capital we can find.”  Range plans to spend $1.4 billion this year, probably $1.4
billion next year and more in 2013 and will sell “lower-end”
assets as needed to fund Marcellus drilling, Pinkerton said.
Range can be profitable selling gas at $4 a thousand cubic feet
he said.  The interview was conducted before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Range, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, rose 45 cents,
to $52.78 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, the shares had risen 17 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
