OAO Rosneft slipped for the second
day in three as crude fell and after Kommersant reported Chevron
Corp. may abandon a joint venture with Russia’s biggest oil
producer in the  Black Sea .  The stock dropped 0.8 percent to 255.01 rubles by 10:53
a.m. in Moscow trading.  Crude for April delivery declined as much as 55 cents, or
0.5 percent, in  New York . Chevron may abandon the Val Shatskogo
venture on the Black Sea amid concern the project may not have
enough oil to make drilling profitable, Kommersant reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Chevron
also objects to Rosneft’s demand that the venture be registered
in Russia, according to Kommersant.  The news is “slightly negative” for Rosneft, Ildar
Davletshin, an analyst at  Renaissance Capital , wrote in an e-
mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
