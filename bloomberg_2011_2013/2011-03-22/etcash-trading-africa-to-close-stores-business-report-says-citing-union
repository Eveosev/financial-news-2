Metcash Trading Africa Ltd. plans
to close 51 of its 138 stores, Johannesburg’s  Business Report 
said, citing the South African Commercial, Catering and Allied
Workers Union.  The company is in talks with unions and a decision on the
number of stores to be closed hasn’t been taken, Clive Kairuz,
the company’s marketing director, said when called on his mobile
phone by Bloomberg today. He referred further enquiries to Peter
Dodson, the company’s chief executive officer. Calls to Dodson’s
office out of normal working hours weren’t answered.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
