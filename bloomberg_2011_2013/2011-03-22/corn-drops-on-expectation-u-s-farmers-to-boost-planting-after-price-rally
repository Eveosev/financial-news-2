Corn fell for the first time in
four days in  Chicago  on concern U.S. farmers may boost planting
this year and on speculation a three-day rally curbed demand.
Wheat and soybeans dropped.  U.S. farmers will increase corn seeding this year, boosting
supply and reducing prices in the next six months,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  said in a report e-mailed to clients yesterday.
Farmers in the world’s largest exporter probably will sow 92.1
million acres of corn this year, the bank said.  “Corn is likely to be under selling pressure in the near
term from the perspective of market fundamentals,” said Chris
Kwon, a trader at KTB Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul.
“High prices may mean more plantings, which could be a bearish
factor.”  Corn for May delivery slid 10 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$6.765 a bushel at 12:14 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain rose 11 percent in the three days through
yesterday. Futures surged 82 percent in the past year as
stronger demand eroded U.S. inventories, which the government
has forecast will reach a 15-year low this year.  Growers sowed corn on 88.2 million acres last year,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , which will
estimate this year’s acreage on March 31. Prices may fall to
$6.20 a bushel in the next three months, $6 in six months and
$5.80 in a year, according to the Goldman Sachs report.  Wheat for May delivery lost 13.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$7.075 a bushel, declining for a second day. The grain touched a
five-month low last week after the earthquake and tsunami in
 Japan  damaged ports. Milling wheat for May delivery traded on
NYSE Liffe in Paris fell 4 euros, or 1.8 percent, to 222 euros
($315.95) a metric ton.  May-delivery soybeans dropped 16 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$13.47 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
