European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said he can’t commit to an interest
rate increase in April after  Japan ’s earthquake heightened
economic uncertainty.  “Given the heightened uncertainty I cannot make any
commitment for the ECB,” Stark said in a March 18 interview
with Japan’s Nikkei, a transcript of which was released by the
ECB today. “The uncertainty has increased, in particular due to
the events in Japan and due to the geopolitical situation in
other regions,” he said. At the same time, “there are good
reasons to normalize the monetary policy stance.”  Stark said that “for me, the situation in the euro area,
with the ongoing economic growth and ongoing threat to price
stability, in the short term has not changed.”  While the ECB’s own forecasts show that inflation will
average 1.7 percent next year, meeting its definition of price
stability, the projections “currently factor in market
expectations of rising  interest rates ,” Stark said.
“Accordingly, if we did not to raise interest rates, the
inflation rate could turn out to be above 2 percent at the end
of the projection horizon.”  Stark also said the Group of Seven nations stands ready to
sell yen again if Japan asks it to.  It is “up to the Japanese authorities to consider this
possibility,” he said. “The G-7 finance ministers and central
banks expressed their readiness to provide any needed
cooperation, and the confidence in the resilience of the
Japanese economy and the financial sector. G-7 stands ready to
provide any support needed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
