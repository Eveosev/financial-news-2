Belvedere SA (BVD)  Chief Executive
Officer Jacques Rouvroy and his deputy Christophe Trylinski lost
an appeals court bid to recover shares in the French vodka-maker
seized by  hedge funds  in June.  Hedge fund firms Maple Leaf Capital LLP and Astin Capital
Management Ltd. may get as much as 15 million euros ($21.3
million) from the men under today’s ruling by an appeals court
in Dijon, France, a lawyer for the funds said.  “It is a question of weeks until they are out of
Belvedere’s capital structure,” said Fabrice Marchisio, a
lawyer for the funds. The shares have been frozen pending the
appeals court decision.  The Maple Leaf funds seized the shares, which directly and
indirectly account for about 15.5 percent of Belvedere’s share
capital. They were executing a 2009 ruling by the  High Court  in
 London  ordering the men to compensate the funds for losses
incurred on  stock options  they had subscribed to in exchange for
financing the executives’ efforts to regain control of the
beverage company in 2007.  The order can’t be enforced because the assets are owned
jointly with Rouvroy’s and Trylinski’s wives, Belvedere lawyer
Alain Ribeyre said in a telephone interview.  “Maple Leaf cannot touch any of their estates,” Ribeyre
said. “Neither their shares, nor the buildings, nor any of
their assets” because all are jointly owned with the men’s
wives, who weren’t parties to the contract with the funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
