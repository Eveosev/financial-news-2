Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, can “easily” double its 15
billion barrels of proven oil reserves in four to five years,
Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
needs $17 billion in financing over a five-year period if oil is
at $80 a barrel, Gabrielli said today at an energy event in Rio
de Janeiro. Crude oil for April delivery in New York rose as
high as $102.67 a barrel early today.  “We have 10 billion to 16 billion barrels already
discovered that can become proven reserves when we declare
commerciality,” Gabrielli said.  Petrobras, which plans to revise its investment plan this
year to include the development of new reserves it bought from
the government as part of a $70 billion share sale, aims to
produce 2.1 million barrels a day in  Brazil  in 2011, up from an
average of 2 million barrels in 2010, Chief Financial Officer
 Almir Barbassa  said Feb. 25.  Petrobras rose 36 centavos, or 1.8 percent, to 28.49 reais
at 9:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
