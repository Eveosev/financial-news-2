Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,
Europe’s third-biggest insurer, may have to pay as much as 3
billion euros ($4.3 billion) in July 2014 to buy out a stake in
a venture with PPF Group NV.  The company may have to purchase a 49 percent stake held by
PPF in their venture in accordance with an agreement signed in
2007, according to Generali’s annual report published today.
PPF’s put option is valued at between 2.5 billion euros and 3
billion euros, the Trieste-based insurer said.  Generali and PPF, an Amsterdam-based private-equity firm,
formed a joint venture in 2007 to combine their insurance assets
in eastern Europe to create a company with 9 million customers
in 12 countries. The Italian insurer, which makes about 6
percent of its sales in central and eastern  Europe , is boosting
business in the region to increase profitability.  Generali said it hasn’t put aside money for the potential
mandatory acquisition, adding that “any future financial
outflow has been duly taken into account in the company’s
financial forecasts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
