U.S. Gulf crude weakened against
West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s premium to the U.S.
benchmark narrowed.  The gap between May-delivery WTI futures and Brent, its
European counterpart, decreased 42 cents to $11.45 a barrel at
12:19 p.m. in  New York . A narrower gap between Brent and WTI
weakens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African oil priced against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 15 cents to
$15.20 a barrel at 11:48 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
strengthened 40 cents to $15.65 a barrel.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
narrowed 5 cents to $10.25 a barrel over the benchmark.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed 5 cents to $10.50.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 15 cents to
$10.25. Thunder Horse’s premium widened 20 cents to $12.50 a
barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 15 cents to $3.80 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $13 a barrel. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands 
in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select remained at
$19.25 a barrel.  -- Editors: Richard Stubbe, David Marino  To contact the reporter on this story:
