Indian stocks gained for the first
time in four days as risks to the global economic recovery
receded after  Japan  made progress in averting a nuclear crisis.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , a unit of Japan’s Suzuki Motor
Co., gained the most in three weeks. Japan’s Prime Minister said
yesterday he can see “light at the end of the tunnel” in the
country’s battle to regain control of a crippled power plant.
 Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams and bridges, rose,
paring this year’s drop to 20 percent.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest
Indian property developer, rose for a second day.  “The Japanese problem is probably coming under control; it
seems like the situation is much better than it was last week,”
said Ravi Gopalakrishnan, chief investment officer for equities
in Mumbai at Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt., the local unit of
Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC. with $750
billion in assets globally. He favors makers of steel, cement,
pharmaceuticals and capital goods.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 161.23, or 0.9 percent, to 18,000.28, according to
preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in  Mumbai . The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange added 53.70, or 1
percent, to 5,418.45, while its March settled at 5,437.95. The
BSE 200 Index rose 0.9 percent to 2,224.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
