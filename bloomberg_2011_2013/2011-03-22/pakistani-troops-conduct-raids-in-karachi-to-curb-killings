Pakistani paramilitary troops
raided a densely populated area of the nation’s financial
capital, Karachi, to control political and ethnic violence that
has killed 23 people since March 19.  One man was killed and several detained with weapons in the
raid at Liaquatabad, a neighborhood dominated by the Muttahida
Qaumi Movement, said Major Bilal, a spokesman for the  Pakistan
Rangers  who uses only one name. The MQM is a political party
that mainly represents Mohajirs, people whose families moved to
 Pakistan  from what is now  India  when Britain partitioned the
subcontinent in 1947.  This month’s upheaval and violence on Jan. 17 are part of a
contest for power in the city of 18 million among the MQM, the
ruling  Pakistan Peoples Party  and the ethnic Pashtun  Awami
National Party .  To contact the reporter on this story:
