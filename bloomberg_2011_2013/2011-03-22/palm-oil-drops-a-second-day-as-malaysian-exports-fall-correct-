(Corrects to show that soybeans were little changed in
ninth paragraph.)  Palm oil  fell for a second day on
concern that a drop in exports from Malaysia, the second-largest
producer, may expand stockpiles of the world’s most used cooking
oil.  The most-active June-delivery contract declined as much as
1.7 percent to 3,363 ringgit ($1,109) a metric ton, before
ending the morning session at 3,367 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur.
Futures rebounded 2.4 percent last week after plunging 8.1
percent in the week ended March 11.  “Malaysia is in the process of trying to rebuild its
stockpiles due to the higher demand at the end of last year and
lower production,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte, said by phone from Singapore today. “The bearish
export data is giving the investors a reason to book a profit
from recent gains.”  Palm oil output and stockpiles in  Malaysia  gained in
February from the previous month as adverse weather conditions
eased and exports dropped to the lowest in three years,
according to the nation’s Palm Oil Board. Inventory of the
edible oil climbed 4.2 percent to 1.48 million tons in February,
while shipments fell 8.5 percent to 1.11 million tons, the
lowest level since February 2008, it said on March 10.  Malaysia’s palm-oil exports fell 12.8 percent in the first
20 days of March to 719,302 tons from a month earlier,
independent market surveyor Intertek said yesterday. Shipments
slumped 9.5 percent in the same period, rival Societe Generale
de Surveillance said.  Global demand for palm oil isn’t expected to pick up in the
next few weeks, Phillip Futures’ Ker said.  Indonesia  Tax  Indonesia, the world’s biggest producer, reduced the tax
for crude palm oil exports in April to 22.5 percent from 25
percent this month and cut the base price to $1,135 a ton from
$1,222 a ton, Deddy Saleh, director general of foreign trade at
the Trade Ministry, said in a mobile-phone text message.  Palm oil has fallen 14 percent from a 35-month high of
3,967 ringgit on Feb. 10 on speculation of an increase in output
this year in Indonesia and Malaysia as yields improve and the La
Nina weather event fades.  Soybeans futures ended little changed yesterday on signs
that demand is slowing for supplies from the U.S., the world’s
largest grower and exporter. Palm and soybean oils are
substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Soybeans for May delivery dropped as much as 0.8 percent to
$13.525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today before
trading 0.6 percent lower at $13.555 at 12:22 p.m.  Singapore 
time. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell as much as
0.6 percent to 55.54 cents a pound.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  dropped as much as 0.8 percent to 9,200 yuan ($1,403) a
ton and was at 9,236 yuan at the midday trading break. Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month declined as much as 0.7
percent to 10,000 yuan a ton, before ending the morning session
at 10,068 yuan.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, fell 2 percent to $1,109 a ton
at 12:23 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
