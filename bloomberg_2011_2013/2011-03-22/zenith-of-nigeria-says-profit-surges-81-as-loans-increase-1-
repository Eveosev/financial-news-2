Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) ,  Nigeria ’s biggest
lender by market value, rallied to the highest in more than a
week after saying profit for the year through December increased
81 percent as loans grew.  The stock climbed for a third day, adding 73 kobo, or 5
percent, to 15.43 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the
strongest level since March 11.  Net income advanced to 37.4 billion naira ($241.2 million)
from 20.6 billion naira a year earlier, missing the 41.6
billion-naira median estimate by eight analysts, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Loans climbed 2 percent to 713.3
billion naira, while revenue declined 31 percent to 192.5
billion naira, it said in a statement on the Lagos-based
Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website. The bank plans to pay a
dividend of 85 kobo per share, it said.  Zenith has gained 2.8 percent this year, compared with a
0.9 percent increase in the stock exchange’s All-Share Index
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
