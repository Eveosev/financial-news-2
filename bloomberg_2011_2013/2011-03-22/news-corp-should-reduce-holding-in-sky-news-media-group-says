News Corp. (NWSA)  should reduce its
shareholding in  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ’s Sky News
channel, according to a group of U.K. media companies that
oppose the takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch’s company.  News Corp.’s proposed remedy to split off the 24-hour news
channel wouldn’t increase media plurality in the U.K. because
Sky News would be financially dependent upon the company for
most of its funding, a group of U.K. newspapers and  BT Group Plc (BT/A) 
said in a submission to the U.K. government. News Corp. has
offered 7.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion) for BSkyB.  Under initial proposals, Sky News would be spun off into
a public limited company. The channel’s shares would be
distributed to BSkyB shareholders, with News Corp. holding
39.1 percent. News Corp. would be barred from raising its stake
without government approval for 10 years.  News Corp., based in New York, won preliminary U.K.
government approval last week for its takeover plan for the
rest of BSkyB as it sought to avoid a long antitrust review.
U.K. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is now consulting on the
proposed remedy.  Murdoch’s company would be able to “influence
significantly” the editorial policy of Sky News, according to
BT and the newspaper companies, including Guardian Media Group
Plc, Associated Newspapers Ltd.,  Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI) , Northcliffe
Media Ltd. and Telegraph Media Group.  “It is fanciful to expect that Sky News will enjoy any
meaningful independence” under News Corp.’s proposal, the
group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
