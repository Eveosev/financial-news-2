U.S. nuclear-power output rose 0.7
percent as  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  boosted the Limerick 1 reactor in
Pennsylvania and  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  increased
power at the Hope 1 unit in  New Jersey , the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Production nationwide increased by 574 megawatts from
yesterday to 84,522 megawatts, or 83 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Seventeen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Exelon raised power at the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 1 to 81
percent from 57 percent yesterday. The generating station is
about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia.
Another reactor at the site, the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 2, is
operating at 91 percent of capacity.  Public Service boosted output from the 1,061-megawatt Hope
Creek 1 to 64 percent of capacity from 4 percent yesterday. The
utility also increased output at the adjacent 1,130-megawatt
Salem 2 reactor to 90 percent of capacity from 85 percent
yesterday.  The 1,174-megawatt Salem 1 is operating at full power. The
plant is about 18 miles south of Wilmington, Delaware.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  slowed its 852-megawatt FitzPatrick plant in
 New York  to 55 percent of capacity from full power yesterday.
The plant is 6 miles northeast of Oswego.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
