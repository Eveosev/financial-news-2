Winter grains in central and
eastern  Europe  are emerging from dormancy and resuming growth as
warm weather moves through the regions, the U.S. government
said.  Warm conditions are spreading east and encouraging greening
of plants that were sown from October through December,
according to a report from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and World Agricultural Outlook Board. Heavy rains in Spain and
Italy are benefiting winter wheat, the report found.  Heavy snow in Russiaâ€™s Volga District, where crops were
devastated by the worst drought in a half-century last year, is
keeping winter crops insulated from extreme cold, the USDA/WAOB
said. The snow is preventing fieldwork ahead of spring planting,
according to the report. Milder weather is melting the snow in
southern and western parts of the region.  In  Australia , rain is boosting prospects for summer crops
and maintaining reservoir levels for irrigated crops in southern
Queensland and northern New South Wales, according to the
report. Rain in Argentina is benefiting immature summer grains,
oilseeds and cotton, and showers in central  Brazil  are slowing
soybean harvests, the USDA/WAOB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
