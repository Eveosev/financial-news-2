Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the diversified
mining company that almost doubled its profit last year, raised
the cash performance bonus of Chief Executive Officer  Cynthia Carroll  by 10 percent to 411,000 pounds ($673,000).  Carroll’s total compensation fell to 1.57 million pounds
from 1.62 million pounds a year earlier as benefits in kind,
which include items such as car allowances, financial advice and
medical insurance, dropped 74 percent to 37,000 pounds, Anglo
