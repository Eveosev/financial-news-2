Middle East oils for sale to  Asia 
were little changed after rising for two days as refiners
finished up purchases for the month.  Qatar Marine for May loading remained at a premium of 11
cents a barrel to its official selling price for May loading,
Bloomberg data showed. Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co., was at a premium of 25 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Refiners have been buying cargoes amid a surge in refining
margins on concerns of declining fuel supplies after Japanese
processing plants closed following the March 11 earthquake. The
temblor disrupted supplies from plants accounting for about 1.3
million barrels a day of the country’s refining capacity, or 29
percent of the total. About 550,000 barrels of capacity are
still offline.  The crisis has pushed gasoil’s premium to benchmark Dubai
crude to $23.10 a barrel today, 17 percent higher than March 11.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell 77 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $108.33 a barrel today, according to Bloomberg data.
Dubai for loading in May was down 0.7 percent at $108 and Murban
crude declined 0.7 percent to $111.61.  Oman futures for May delivery fell 7 cents to $108.73 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:10 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,105 contracts traded. The settlement price was set
at $108.80 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, or EFS, for May
narrowed 12 cents to $6.28 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a brokerage. The exchange for swaps for
June decreased 8 cents to $6.41.  To contact the reporter on this story:
