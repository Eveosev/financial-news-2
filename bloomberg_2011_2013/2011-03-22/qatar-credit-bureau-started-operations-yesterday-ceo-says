Qatar’s credit bureau, an
institution that may reduce banks’ non-performing loans, began
operations yesterday, Bandar bin Mohamed Al Thani, Chief
Executive Officer of the bureau, said.  The bureau will help in “minimizing the write-offs and
defaults in the market,” he said today at a press conference in
the country’s capital Doha.  The bureau is currently able to provide credit reports on
individuals to the country’s banks, he said. The bureau will
begin producing credit scores in the second quarter and will
later begin providing reports to phone companies, utilities and
insurance firms, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
