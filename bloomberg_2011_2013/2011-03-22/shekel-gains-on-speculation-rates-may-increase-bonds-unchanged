Israel ’s shekel rose to the
strongest level in almost three months as inflation expectations
above the central bank’s target range added to speculation
policy makers may increase interest rates this month.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  Consumer prices will increase 3.1 percent in the next 12
months, according to the average forecast in a Bank of Israel
survey, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today. That was
above the bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range.
Market estimates are for inflation to increase to 3.5 percent,
said Amir Kahanovich, an economist at Clal Finance Investment
Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  “The shekel is strengthening as high inflation
expectations are raising bets that the  Bank of Israel  will need
to raise interest rates for a third time in a row next week,”
Kahanovich said by telephone.  The shekel rose 0.1 percent to 3.5297 against the dollar as
of 5:07 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The currency advanced to 3.5200
earlier, the strongest level since Jan. 4.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020
was at 5.25 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close, the highest since
December 2009.  Annual inflation in February quickened to 4.2 percent, the
fastest pace in more than two years, from 3.6 percent in
January, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said
March 15. Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer raised the
benchmark interest rate for a second month on Feb. 21, bringing
it to 2.5 percent. The central bank next meets on March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
