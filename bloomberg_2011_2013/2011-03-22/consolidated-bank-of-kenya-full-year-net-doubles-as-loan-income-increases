Consolidated Bank of  Kenya  Ltd.,
the state-owned lender that may list on the stock exchange by
2012, said full-year profit more than doubled as loan income
climbed.  Net income advanced to 172.5 million shillings ($2.03
million) in the 12 months through December, from 80.9 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based bank said in a
statement in the Daily Nation newspaper today. Net interest
income, the money banks earn from interest charges on loans,
grew 20 percent to 620.6 million shillings, it said.  Kenyaâ€™s government plans to raise 5 billion shillings by
selling shares in Consolidated Bank within the next two years,
the Nation reported in February 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
