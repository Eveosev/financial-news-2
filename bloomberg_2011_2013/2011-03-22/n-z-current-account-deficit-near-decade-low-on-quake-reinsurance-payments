New Zealand ’s current-account
deficit as a share of the economy was near the smallest in a
decade as local companies received reinsurance payments from
overseas after a September earthquake.  The shortfall was 2.3 percent of gross domestic product in
the year ended Dec. 31,  Statistics New Zealand  said in
Wellington today. The gap in the year through September was
revised to 2.2 percent from a previously reported 3.1 percent.
There was a NZ$3.52 billion ($2.6 billion) deficit in the fourth
quarter.  The annual gap is hovering near the smallest since 2001 as
a share of GDP amid rising milk, meat and lumber exports, and
reinsurance payments after a magnitude-7 quake struck the South
Island city of Christchurch in September. More payments from
another, more damaging temblor Feb. 22 may push the current
account into surplus this year.  “We are set for a period of annual surpluses. The last
time we had a surplus was in early 1970s,”  Mark Smith , an
economist at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Wellington, said in an e-
mailed note. Reinsurance inflows of about NZ$6 billion “look
set to lead to a large surplus” in the first quarter, he said.  New Zealand’s currency was little changed after the release,
buying 73.95 U.S. cents as of 12:06 p.m. in Wellington, from
74.01 cents yesterday.  Quake Money  The estimated inflow of reinsurance money in the third
quarter was revised to NZ$3.6 billion from NZ$1.7 billion
reported three months ago, the statistics agency said. The
figure is subject to further change.  Economists predicted the deficit would narrow to 2.5
percent of GDP in the 12 months through December and forecast
the quarterly shortfall would be NZ$2.2 billion, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  The annual deficit was NZ$4.38 billion from NZ$4.19 billion
in the year ended Sept. 30, today’s report showed. The current
account is the broadest measure of trade because it includes
services such as tourism, transfers and investment flows.  Central bank Governor Alan Bollard on March 10 forecast the
deficit would be 2.6 percent of GDP. He projected the account
will be in surplus in the year ending March 31 as the
reinsurance from the Feb. 22 earthquake, which killed more than
160 people, flows into the country.  Surpluses to Return  Current-account deficits may return in late 2011,
reflecting the one-time nature of the reinsurance and as imports
of building materials and equipment for the reconstruction of
the city increase, Bollard said.  The annual shortfall has narrowed from as much as 8.8
percent of GDP in late 2008 amid the recovery in exports. The
gap was last at 2.2 percent in the year ended Sept. 30, 2001.  The deficit has been volatile because of items such as
reinsurance and a reduction in profits of foreign-owned banks
due to settlement of tax disputes in the second half of 2009.
Excluding one-time items, the deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP in
the year ended Dec. 31, the statistics agency said today.  In the fourth quarter, the trade deficit was NZ$123 million,
reflecting a seasonal increase in exports, today’s report showed.
Meat and lumber shipments rose while dairy sales fell on lower
prices. Imports increased on purchases of fuel and aircraft.  The annual  trade surplus  widened to a 10-year high of
NZ$3.39 billion in the year ended Dec. 31 from NZ$3.27 billion
in the 12 months through September, the report showed. Exports
increased 20 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  Investment Income  In the quarter, the deficit on income, a measure of
international investment income and compensation for employees
which makes up most of the current-account balance, widened to
NZ$3.12 billion as profits earned by foreign-owned companies
increased, the report showed.  The annual deficit on income narrowed to NZ$10.75 billion
from NZ$10.83 billion in the year ended Sept. 30.  The annual surplus on transfers was little changed at
NZ$3.54 billion from a revised NZ$3.59 billion in the year ended
Sept. 30. The annual deficit on services widened because of
reduced spending by foreign visitors, the statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
