The pound may advance to a level
last reached in October 2008 against the dollar if it closes
above $1.6380, according to Citigroup Inc.  That rate, reached today, is a 74 percent retracement of
sterling’s drop from August 2009 to May 2010, Citigroup
technical analysts led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New York wrote in a
research note to clients. If the currency closes above $1.6380,
it may rise to $1.7050, which would be a 2 1/2-year high,
according to Citigroup.  “It’s not going to be that easy to go through, but if we
do, that would open up the way for an extension to higher
levels,” Fitzpatrick said in a phone interview. “Today it was
the extra little push out of the inflation numbers.”  The pound rose for a fourth day in the longest stretch of
advances since January after a government report showed U.K.
inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in more than two
years, adding pressure on the  Bank of England  to increase its
benchmark interest rate.  Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.6379 at 10:40 a.m.
in New York, from $1.6311 yesterday. It touched $1.6401, the
highest level since Jan. 19, 2010.  Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in February from a year
earlier after a 4 percent increase in January, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in  London . That’s the highest
level since October 2008.  The BOE will raise its benchmark interest rate from a
record low 0.50 percent by a quarter-percentage point in the
second quarter, according to the median forecast of 17
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
