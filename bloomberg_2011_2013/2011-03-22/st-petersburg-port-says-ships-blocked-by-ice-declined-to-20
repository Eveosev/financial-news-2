About 20 ships are blocked by ice
at the Russian port of  St. Petersburg , fewer than a week ago, a
port official said.  Operations at the harbor, which handles coal, metals and
fuel oil, should return to normal within days, the official said
today by phone from St. Petersburg, declining to be identified
because he isnâ€™t authorized to speak on the matter. About 100
vessels were stranded at the port earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
