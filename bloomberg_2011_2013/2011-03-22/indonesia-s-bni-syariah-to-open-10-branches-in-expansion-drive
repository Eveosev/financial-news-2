PT Bank BNI Syariah , the Islamic-
finance unit of PT Bank Negara  Indonesia , will open 10 branches
this year as it seeks to boost assets by 50 percent, said BNI
Syariah President Director Rizqullah Thohuri.  The Shariah-compliant lender also plans to open 28 sub-
branches, including in Bali and Kalimantan, Thohuri told
reporters during a break at an Islamic finance conference in
Jakarta today. Bank Negara Indonesia is the nation’s third-
biggest state-owned bank.  “We’re targeting assets to grow by 50 percent this year,”
Thohari said. “The network expansion will help achieve the
target.” BNI Syariah will also boost services in Islamic trade
finance, Thohari added.  Indonesia’s Islamic banking assets rose to 100.3 trillion
rupiah ($11.5 billion) at the end of last year, from 67 trillion
rupiah at the end of 2009, according to  central bank  data. The
country’s Shariah banking assets may expand 45 percent to 55
percent this year, Mulya Siregar, director of Islamic banking at
 Bank Indonesia , said Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
