Scotland  approved the construction
of wind farms by  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s ScottishPower unit and  Scottish
& Southern Energy Plc (SSE)  that have the capacity to power 64,000
homes, the government said today in an e-mailed statement.  ScottishPower was given permission to add an extra 23
turbines with 69 megawatts of electricity-generating capacity to
its existing Black Law wind farm near Shotts, the government
said in the statement. Scottish and Southern was permitted to
build the same number of turbines with the same capacity at
Blackcraig wind farm near New Galloway.  Scotland has set itself a domestic target of generating 80
percent of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind
and hydropower by 2020, up from 27 percent in 2009, according to
the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
