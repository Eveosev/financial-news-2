The investigation into the 2008
crash of a Spanair airliner in  Madrid  that killed 154 people has
shown that a control switch blamed by a judge for the accident
in fact had functioned properly, El Pais reported.  The electronic relay, retrieved from the crash site, was
studied by  Spain ’s aerospace institute in the presence of the
investigating judge and experts, the newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the probe.  The findings erase the main theory of what lay at the root
of a chain of events that led the pilot to take off without
using his flaps, which are needed to produce sufficient lift,
the report said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
