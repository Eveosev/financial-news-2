NATO broke a week-long deadlock
over whether to intervene in the Libyan conflict, agreeing to
use planes and ships to enforce the United Nations arms embargo
against Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  The trans-Atlantic alliance also said today that it has put
military assets on standby to police the no-fly zone and will go
into action in the skies over  Libya  “if needed.”  Allied warplanes and ships “will conduct operations to
monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of
carrying illegal arms or mercenaries,”  North Atlantic Treaty
Organization  Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a
statement in Brussels.  Wrangling over the alliance’s official role in the four-
day-old air campaign had exposed divisions between Italy,
 France , the U.K.,  Germany , Turkey and the U.S. over the command
structure and strategy for the fight against Qaddafi.  The  UN  resolution that created no-fly zone also authorized
what amounts to an air, land and naval blockade of Libya to
prevent the resupply of Qaddafi’s forces with weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
