Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  asked  Vale SA (VALE3)  shareholder Banco Bradesco SA to replace
Roger Agnelli as chief executive officer of the iron-ore
producer, O Estado de S. Paulo reported.  Mantega met Bradesco Chairman Lazaro Brandao on Friday to
start talks to name a new chief at Vale, where the bank holds a
stake through Bradespar SA, the newspaper reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  Mantega would like to make the change during Vale’s annual
shareholders meeting next month, Estado said.  A Vale official in Rio de Janeiro, who declined to be named
according to company policy, said the company has no comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
