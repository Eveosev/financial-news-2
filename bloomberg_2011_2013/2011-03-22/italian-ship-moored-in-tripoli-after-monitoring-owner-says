An Italian tugboat moored in the
Libyan port of Tripoli today where the crew has been allowed to
contact relatives, said the ship’s owner,  Augusta Offshore SpA .  Armed Libyans boarded the ship on March 20 and left the
port of Tripoli, Italian Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa said
that day. The government was monitoring the situation closely,
he said, to try to insure the safety of the boat’s 11-person
crew, which includes eight Italians.  In the last few days the activity of the boat named  “Asso
22”  was limited to “monitoring the Libyan shores,” Augusta
said in an e-mailed statement. The Naples-based operator said,
the issue related to the boat is “not resolved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
