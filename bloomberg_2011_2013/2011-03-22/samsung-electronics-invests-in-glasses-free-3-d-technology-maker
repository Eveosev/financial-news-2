Samsung Electronics Co.’s venture
arm invested $15 million in MasterImage 3D Inc., a closely held
maker of 3-D displays for mobile devices and movie-theater
screens, the companies said in a joint statement.  MasterImage, based in  Los Angeles ,  California , is working
with mobile device makers to incorporate its glasses-free 3-D
technology into smartphones and tablet computers, said Younghoon Lee, chief executive officer of MasterImage.  MasterImage, Sharp Corp. and others use a type of
technology called parallax barrier to deliver slightly different
images to each eye, creating the effect of viewing content in
three dimensions. Samsung Venture Investment Corp. and
MasterImage declined to comment on whether Samsung plans to use
the company’s technology in future devices.  “We are committing this investment to innovation,
specifically to advancing our 3D solutions for cinema,
smartphones, tablets, and larger autostereoscopic displays,”
Lee said in the statement. “We will continue to build toward
our vision of 3D on every screen.”  Sharp sells a type of 3-D technology called striped
parallax barrier. That’s used in Nintendo Co.’s new 3DS
handheld, which goes on sale in the U.S. March 27.  MasterImage’s method is called cell-matrix parallax
barrier, and it differs from competitors by letting viewers see
the 3-D effect in landscape or portrait mode and with a wider
viewing angle.  MasterImage also competes with  RealD Inc. (RLD)  and  Dolby
Laboratories Inc. (DLB)  for global sales of 3D movie equipment.
Industry leader RealD said it had installed cinema systems on
11,300 screens through the quarter ended Dec. 24. MasterImage
has 3,000 cinema systems installed, said Julie Miller,
spokeswoman for the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
