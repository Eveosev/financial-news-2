Japan ’s imports of thermal coal
used to generate power will expand 5 percent this year after
some of the nation’s nuclear reactors were damaged in the March
11 temblor and tsunami, Clarkson Research Services Ltd. said.  The world’s biggest importer of the fuel will take delivery
of 131.4 million metric tons in 2011, up from 125.3 million tons
in 2010,  Clarkson  said. It had predicted a 1 percent decline a
month ago.  “In the medium term, imports of thermal coal are likely to
increase to help counteract the downturn in nuclear power
capacity,” Clarkson said today in a report for clients on its
website.  Japan has been battling for 12 days to prevent a meltdown
at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. The reduction of nuclear power
will likely strengthen Japan’s imports of oil and liquefied
natural gas as alternative fuels, Clarkson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
