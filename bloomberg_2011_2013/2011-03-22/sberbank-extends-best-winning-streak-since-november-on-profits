OAO Sberbank advanced for a fourth
day after  Russia ’s biggest lender yesterday said fourth-quarter
profit jumped more than fivefold as provisions for bad loans
shrank.  The stock climbed 1 percent to 101.40 rubles by 11:29 a.m.
in Moscow, in its fourth day of gains and longest winning streak
since November.  Net income rose to 72 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) in the
final three months of 2010 from 14.1 billion rubles in the year-
earlier period, the Moscow-based company said in a statement on
its website late yesterday. Provisions dropped 96 percent to 3.8
billion rubles in the same period, the lender said.  “We view the numbers as positive for Sberbank’s stock due
to strong earnings momentum, NIM recovery and healthy loan
growth,” Rinat Kirdan and Sergey Kazaryan, analysts at Aton
Capital, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
