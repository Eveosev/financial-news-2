 Japan ’s rebuilding effort will boost fuel consumption and unrest
persists in the Middle East and North Africa.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 34.5 percent as of 4 p.m. in New York,

volatility has been coming in big overnight,” said Ray Carbone,
