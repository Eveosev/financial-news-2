Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) ,  India ’s largest iron
ore exporter, bought Bellary Steel & Alloys Ltd.’s plant and
land assets for 2.2 billion rupees ($49 million), foraying into
steelmaking after facing an overseas sales ban in one of its
mining states.  The resources of the Bellary-based company, which is
building a 500,000 metric ton plant and holds 700 acres of land
in the southern state of Karnataka, were transferred today, Sesa
Goa said in a Bombay Stock Exchange statement. Options are being
considered to start the mill, the company said.  Sesa Goa faced hurdles in doubling its mining capacity to
50 million tons by March 2013 after Karnataka banned iron ore
exports in July. The federal government also raised railway
freight charges and increased export taxes to discourage
shipments of the steelmaking ingredient and increase
availability for local mills.  “We’ve been looking at setting up value-addition
facilities, as desired by the state government, and this
acquisition provides us with an excellent opportunity to
leapfrog ahead in that direction,” Sesa Goa Managing Director
P.K. Mukherjee said in the statement.  Sesa Goa shares rose as much as 1.7 percent to 263.50
rupees and traded at 262.30 rupees as of 12:41 p.m. in Mumbai
today. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock
Exchange rose 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
