Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said there is no disagreement with President Dmitry
Medevev about the country’s position on coalition attacks on
Libya.  Putin, speaking at a press conference today in Ljubljana,
Slovenia, said the two Russian leaders are in agreement and
Medvedev is in charge of foreign policy.  “In our case, the president of the Russian Federation has
the final say on foreign policy and no splits are possible,”
Putin said. “Secondly, if you are interested if my approach to
this event differs from that one of Mr. Medvedev, I assure you
we are very close to each other and we understand each other.”  Putin urged all parties “to think about victims, whose
number increases” in  Libya .  Putin spoke a day after Medvedev dismissed as
“unacceptable” Putin’s description of Western-led attacks on
Libya as a “crusade,” marking their first public foreign-policy
dispute.  Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor urged the  United
Nations Security Council  to make clear what the political goals
are in Libya.  “We want to avoid the impression that the West is again
intervening in an Arab nation for its own selfish interests,”
Pahor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
