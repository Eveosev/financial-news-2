Peter Cummings, the former head of
the HBOS Plc corporate unit that posted losses of about 7
billion pounds ($11.5 billion), has become a director of a
Scottish charity.  Cummings, 55, has become a trustee of Ben View Resource
Centre, a registered charity for the elderly and people with
disabilities in Dumbarton,  Scotland , according to company
filings. Cummings’s position at the local council-funded charity
is unpaid, the filings said.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  needed more than 20 billion pounds
of taxpayer aid after acquiring HBOS in 2008. Cummings, HBOS’s
highest-paid banker, led the bank’s investment in commercial
real estate, construction and takeover finance. The corporate
banking unit “lent too much,” former HBOS Chairman Dennis Stevenson told a Parliamentary committee hearing in February
2009.  Cummings was entitled to total compensation of 2.43 million
pounds in 2007, more than former HBOS Chief Executive Officer
Andy Hornby. Cummings accrued a pension valued at 369,000 pounds
annually by the time he left the bank in 2009.  Cummings wasn’t immediately available to comment, said
Steven Cavan, general center assistant, at the charity’s office.
Nor was anyone available to comment on behalf of the charity, he
said. Cummings’s telephone number is unlisted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
