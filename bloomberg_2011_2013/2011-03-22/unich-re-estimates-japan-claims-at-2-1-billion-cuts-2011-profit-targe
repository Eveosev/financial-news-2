Munich Re, the world’s largest
reinsurer, fell as much as 3.1 percent in Frankfurt trading
after scrapping its 2011 profit target on claims from the quake
and tsunami in  Japan .  The shares dropped 1.2 percent to 108.70 euros at 5:05 p.m.
They have declined 6.6 percent since March 10, the day before
the record earthquake and tsunami hit Japan.  Claims from Japan will reach about 1.5 billion euros ($2.1
billion), bringing losses from major natural catastrophes in the
first quarter to more than 2.5 billion euros, “far exceeding
the volume to be expected for this period,” the reinsurer said
in a statement yesterday. “That means the profit target for
2011 of around 2.4 billion euros is no longer achievable.”  Munich Re, which expects the highest claims among  Europe ’s
biggest reinsurers, on March 10 reiterated the full-year profit
goal after disasters including the earthquake in  New Zealand  and
Cyclone Yasi in  Australia  cost it about A$1.5 billion ($1.5
billion) in the first two months of the year. It said at the
time that the target could only be reached, “if random losses
in the further course of the year remain below expectations.”  The next day the 9.0-magnitude earthquake hit Japan,
triggering a tsunami and leaving more than 9,000 people
confirmed dead. The Japanese government today estimated the
damage at as much as 25 trillion yen ($309 billion), or almost
four times the impact of  Hurricane Katrina  on the U.S. in 2005.  Estimated Impact  Catastrophe modeling firm Eqecat said on March 16 that
insurers and reinsurers will probably have losses of $12 billion
to $25 billion from the Japan earthquake and tsunami. Modeler
AIR Worldwide had estimated insured losses of as much as 2.8
trillion yen ($35 billion) from the quake alone.  Munich Re ’s preliminary claims figure is after retrocession
and before tax, the company said. Reinsurers, which help protect
primary carriers such as Allianz SE and Axa SA against the cost
of major claims from disasters such as hurricanes and
earthquakes, limit their own risks by selling parts of them to
other reinsurers in a process known as retrocession.  The reinsurer will shelve a plan to buy back 500 million
euros of its own shares by the annual shareholders meeting in
2012, spokesman Michael Able said by telephone today.  Munich Re will stick to a plan to  buy back  as much as 1
billion euros of stock before next month’s annual shareholder
meeting, he said, adding that the company will also keep its
proposal to raise the 2010 dividend by 50 cents to 6.25 euros a
share.  Swiss Re Claims  Hannover Re , the world’s third-biggest reinsurer, estimated
its claims from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan at about 250
million. The Hanover, Germany-based company’s shares lost 1.6
percent, bringing the decline since March 10 to 6.6 percent.  Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s second-biggest
reinsurer, said on March 21 it expects claims of about $1.2
billion and  Scor SE (SCR) , the world’s sixth-largest reinsurer,
estimated on March 14 its claims will be less than 185 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
