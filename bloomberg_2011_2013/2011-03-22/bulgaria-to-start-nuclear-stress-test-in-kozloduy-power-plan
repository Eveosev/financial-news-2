Bulgaria  will carry out a stress
test of its Kozloduy atomic plant on the Danube River after the
European Union agreed to gauge the safety of all reactors in the
27-nation bloc following  Japan ’s nuclear crisis.  The check up will cover seven criteria including threats
from earthquakes, floods, airplane crashes and terrorism as well
as reactors’ cooling systems and their age, the government said
in an e-mail today. Experts from the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency will be invited to monitor the tests,
according to the statement.  EU energy ministers agreed yesterday to conduct checks on
the region’s 143 atomic plants as the risk of a nuclear meltdown
in Japan following a March 11 earthquake and tsunami triggered
public protests in  Europe  against atomic power. Nuclear power
stations owned by companies including  Germany ’s RWE AG and
Electricite de France SA produce a third of the electricity in
the EU, which wants to draw up common criteria to gauge nuclear
safety in response to the Japanese crisis.  Kozloduy, Bulgaria’s only atomic power plant, has two
Russian-made 1,000-megawatt reactors, which supply 38 percent of
the nation’s needs. They were built in 1987 and 1991. The
government is considering building one or two new reactors at
the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
