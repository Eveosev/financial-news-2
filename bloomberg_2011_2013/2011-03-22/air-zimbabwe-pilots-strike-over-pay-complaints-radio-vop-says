Pilots employed by state-owned Air
Zimbabwe went on strike today, canceling flights to
Johannesburg,  Radio Voice of the People  reported, citing the
airline’s chairman, Jonathan Kadzura.  The pilots are demanding to be paid outstanding allowances,
according to the Harare-based broadcaster. The airline doesn’t
have enough cash to pay the pilots and hasn’t taken any action
to avert or end the strike, Radio VOP said.  Pilots at the airline walked out in September in an earlier
dispute over pay and allowances. The two-week strike ended
without a resolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
