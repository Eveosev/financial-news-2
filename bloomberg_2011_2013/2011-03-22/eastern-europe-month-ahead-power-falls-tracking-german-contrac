Next-month power in eastern Europe
declined as contracts in  Germany , Europe’s biggest market,
retreated from last week’s two-year high.  Czech month-ahead power decreased 1.7 percent to 53.60
euros a megawatt-hour ($76.18), the lowest level in more than a
week, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Hungarian
electricity for April fell 3.2 percent to 53.40 euros.  The  Czech Republic  has 17,625 megawatts of capacity
installed, according to Bloomberg data. The country was
exporting as much as 760 megawatts of power to Germany at 10:30
a.m. local time today, down from 1,930 at the same time
yesterday, according to  Entsoe , the European Transmission System
Operators transparency platform. Domestic demand at that time
was about 8,900 megawatts, according to CEPS AS, the Czech power
transmission system operator.  Polish electricity for April traded unchanged at 193.25
zloty ($68.07) a megawatt-hour.  German month-ahead electricity fell 1.8 percent to 55.40
euros a megawatt-hour. It last week closed as high as 62.50
euros after the announcement that its seven oldest would be
halted for security reviews.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition and Tullett
Prebon Plc. Brokers handle the majority of trading in  Europe ’s
electricity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
