Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  had record sales
in 2010 as production increased in  India  where it’s selling a
majority stake of its business to help finance oil and gas
exploration off Greenland.  Revenue rose to $1.6 billion from $234 million in 2009, the
London-based company said today in a statement. The gross
operated output rose 70 percent last year after the completion
of a pipeline from the Mangala field, Cairn said.  Cairn is selling a majority stake in its India business to
 Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  to finance exploration off Greenland, a
deal which is pending approval from the Indian government. The
sale will leave the explorer with as much as 22 percent of the
Indian unit, which operates the nation’s biggest onshore field.  “I hope the approval will reach cabinet soon,” Chief
Executive Officer Bill Gammell said on a conference call. “We
specialize in going into frontier areas ahead of the pack, and
we have huge real estate in  Greenland .”  The shares rose 8.3 pence, or 2 percent, to 428 pence in
London. The stock has risen 13 percent over the past twelve
months, valuing the company at 5.99 billion pounds ($9.8
billion).  The explorer operates 11 blocks Greenland, where it drilled
three wells in 2010. Cairn said it has contracted a drillship
and semi-submersible rig to drill as many as four wells this
year. Deputy CEO Mike Watts said the company will announce
specific drilling plans in May.  Full-year profit after tax and before exceptional items
increased to $1.1 billion from a restated $53 million in 2009.  Crude oil from the fields in the Indian province of
Rajasthan is now being pumped through the world’s longest
continuously heated pipeline to refineries, Cairn said. The
total resource base supports potential production of 240,000
barrels of oil a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
