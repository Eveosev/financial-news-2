England rugby captain  Mike Tindall 
is expected to miss three months after having surgery yesterday
to repair damaged ankle ligaments.  Tindall, 32, was injured in England’s 22-16 win over
Scotland in the Six Nations tournament on March 13. He’s likely
to be sidelined 12 weeks, his club,  Gloucester Rugby , said on
its website.  Tindall led champion England to victories in its first four
Six Nations games. He sat out the final 24-8 loss to Ireland
three days ago that denied England the Grand Slam.  England next plays Wales in London in a warm-up for the
Rugby World Cup on Aug. 6, followed by games in Wales (Aug. 13)
and Ireland (Aug. 27). England opens the World Cup in  New
Zealand  against Argentina on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
