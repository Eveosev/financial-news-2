The U.K.’s Committee on  Climate
Change , an adviser to the government, said the nation shouldn’t
rely on offsets to meet its emissions target for the five years
through 2017 and beyond.  “It is possible to meet these budgets at low cost and
through domestic action alone,” David Kennedy, chief executive
officer at the London-based group, said in an e-mailed
statement. “Reducing our own emissions now is necessary if we
are to be on track to the deep domestic cuts required through
the 2020s, and to developing new green industries including
 energy efficiency  and renewable energy.”  The adviser also recommended tightening the nation’s
ambitions to reduce emissions through 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
