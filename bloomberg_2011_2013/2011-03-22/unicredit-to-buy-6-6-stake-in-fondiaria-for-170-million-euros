UniCredit SpA,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, will acquire 6.6 percent of  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA)  after
agreeing to buy shares from  Premafin Finanziaria SpA. (PF)   UniCredit agreed with Italy’s Ligresti family to pay about
170 million euros ($241 million) for Premafin’s rights in
Fondiaria’s planned share sale of as much as 450 million euros,
the Milan-based bank said in a statement yesterday. The family
owns Premafin, which controls Fondiaria, Italy’s second-biggest
insurer.  The Ligresti family is seeking new investors to boost
capital of both Premafin and Fondiaria after Groupama SA’s
purchase of a stake in Premafin was halted by the Italian market
regulator. Fondiaria, which posted a fifth consecutive quarterly
loss in the three months to Dec. 31, is selling assets and
shares to become profitable again.  Salvatore Ligresti, the honorary chairman of Fondiaria and
Premafin, resigned as a non-executive UniCredit board member,
following the agreement.  The UniCredit deal, which would cut Premafin’s stake in
Fondiaria to 35 percent from 42 percent, is contingent on the
absence of a mandatory bid for the rest of Fondiaria’s shares.
The Italian market regulator Consob is expected to rule on the
matter by June 30, Unicredit said in the statement.  The lender also said that the purchase requires a review of
the agreement among the creditors’ banks, UniCredit and Premafin
signed in 2004.  Fondiaria, which will report its full year results today
traded down 2.1 percent at 6.64 euros, giving the company a
market value of 995 million euros. Premafin rose 0.6 percent to
61.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
