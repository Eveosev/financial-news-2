Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the world’s
largest mobile-phone company by revenue, agreed to acquire
 Macintosh Retail Group NV (MACIN) ’s BelCompany telecommunications stores
in the Netherlands for 120 million euros ($171 million).  Vodafone Netherlands, the country’s second-largest mobile-
network operator, will buy 210 stores, Newbury, England-based
Vodafone Group said today in a statement. It currently has 86.  Dutch telecommunications providers are shifting from
acquiring new subscribers toward retaining existing ones, which
is less profitable for BelCompany, Maastricht, Netherlands-based
Macintosh Retail said in a separate  statement .  The offer is subject to approvals from the works councils
of both companies and the Netherlands Competition Authority. The
deal may be completed “in a few months,” Macintosh said. The
sale will produce “a net transaction result” of 85 million euros
to 90 million euros, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
