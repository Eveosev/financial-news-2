Hong Kong stocks rose, driving up
the Hang Seng Index for a third consecutive day, as airlines
climbed after  Japan  made progress in stabilizing a crippled
nuclear plant and cement makers gained on the demand outlook.  Air  China  Ltd., the world’s biggest carrier by market value,
and  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  increased more than 3 percent as
speculation eased that radiation from the damaged nuclear plant
will deter travel. Lenovo Group Ltd., China’s largest maker of
personal computers, climbed 6.5 percent as its facilities in
Japan sustained “minimal damage” following the March 11
earthquake. Anhui Conch Cement Co., China’s No. 1 cement maker,
led the advance among cement makers.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.8 percent to 22,857.90 at the
close in Hong Kong, with more than twice as many stocks gaining
as declining among the index’s 45 companies. The gauge slumped
4.1 percent last week, the biggest weekly drop since February,
amid concern Japan’s biggest earthquake and a damaged nuclear
plant would cripple the world’s third-biggest economy.  “While Japan’s nuclear crisis seems to have settled down,
global uncertainties about rising oil prices and growing
tensions in the Middle East prevail,” said  Alex Au , managing
director in  Hong Kong  of Richland Capital Management Ltd., which
oversees $300 million of assets.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of H shares of
Chinese companies climbed 1.1 percent to 12,783.20.  Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said yesterday he can see
“light at the end of the tunnel,” even as smoke at two
reactors hampered efforts to restore cooling systems at the
damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. Japan’s economy will
likely rebound in the second half as the nation recovers from a
record earthquake and subsequent tsunami, analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News said.  Airlines Rebound  Airlines rebounded as concern eased that radiation in Japan
will reduce passenger demand. Air China increased 3.6 percent to
HK$7.19. Cathay Pacific gained 3.1 percent to HK$18.24. China
Eastern Airlines Corp. rose 4.1 percent to HK$3.07. China
Southern Airlines Co. added 3.1 percent to HK$3.29.  Cement producers advanced after Citic Securities Co. said
strong demand will boost prices of the building material. Anhui
Conch increased 4.2 percent to HK$43.40. China National Building
Material Co., the nation’s second-biggest cement maker, climbed
5 percent to HK$25.15.  Lenovo surged 6.5 percent to HK$4.45. The company said the
March 11 earthquake did “minimal damage” to its facilities in
Japan, where it’s pursuing a joint venture with NEC Corp.  Lonking Holdings Ltd. (3339) , a maker of construction machinery,
jumped 8.6 percent to HK$5.41 after Credit Suisse Group AG
reiterated its investment rating of “outperform” on the stock.  Developers Fall  Shares of property developers declined ahead of the release
of Hong Kong’s February inflation data. After the market close,
government data showed consumer prices rose 3.7 percent last
month from a year earlier, the fastest pace in 30 months. The
number compared with the 3.6 percent median estimate of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Hang Lung Properties Ltd., Hong Kong’s third-largest
homebuilder by market value, lost 0.9 percent to HK$31.70. Sun
Hun Kai Properties Ltd., the world’s biggest developer, fell 0.9
percent to HK$119.60. Sino Land Co., the Hong Kong developer
controlled by billionaire Robert Ng, slipped 0.2 percent to
HK$13.44.  “Inflation is still a major concern,” Au said. “The
government is most concerned about rising housing prices in Hong
Kong.”  Harbin Power Equipment Co. dropped 5.4 percent to HK$8.53.
Citigroup Inc. lowered its share-price forecast to HK$8 from
HK$11 and maintained its “sell” rating, saying earnings will
decline due to weak demand.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  increased 0.9 percent, and
the HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, declined 8.1 percent to 20.27, indicating that
options traders are expecting a swing of 5.8 percent in the next
30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
