Advantest Corp. (6857) , the worldâ€™s
biggest maker of memory-chip testers, rose the most in two years
in  Tokyo  trading after Verigy Ltd. said it supports a takeover
bid from Advantest over another offer.  The Tokyo-based company surged 9.8 percent to 1,449 yen at
the 3 p.m. close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its
steepest gain since March 13, 2009. The benchmark Topix index
gained 4.5 percent.  Verigy, a Singapore-based maker of chip-testing equipment,
said yesterday it prefers to be bought by Advantest to an early
offer by LTX-Credence Corp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
