Japan  is seeking to buy 15,000
metric tons of food wheat on March 29 through a tender system
introduced to loosen government grain-import controls, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  The shipments must be made by June 30, Masafumi Otsuka at
the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said today by phone in  Tokyo .  The tender will be held under the so-called simultaneous
buy-and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
