Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN) ’s earnings this
quarter will reflect depreciation and amortization for the
Merial animal-health unit now that the company no longer plans
to put the business in a joint venture with Merck & Co.’s
veterinary unit, Sanofi said.  The depreciation of Merial’s plant, property and equipment
and amortization of its intangible assets previously were
excluded from Sanofi’s income statement, the company said in a
statement. Had those items been included, 2010 net income would
have been cut by 240 million euros and 2009 net would have been
about 65 million euros lower, the company said.  Beginning with first-quarter results, Sanofi will include
amortization and depreciation, the company said. The company
also will have a “one-time amortization adjustment” to cover
the amounts not depreciated or amortized in 2009 and 2010, the
company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
