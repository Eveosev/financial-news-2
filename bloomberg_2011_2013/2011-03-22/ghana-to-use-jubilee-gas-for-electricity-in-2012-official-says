Ghana  will start using gas from its
offshore Jubilee oil field to generate electricity by mid-2012,
said Kwesi Botchwey, the head of the country’s National Gas
Development Taskforce, in an interview on Joy FM.  Ghana  will produce “lean gas for power generation” within
14 to 16 months, he said on the Accra-based broadcaster today.  Botchwey also denied a  report  published by Reuters news
agency that Trinidad and Tobago’s state-run Natural Gas Co. won
a bid to transport, process and distribute gas from Ghana,
according to the radio station’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
