Companies are waiting out or
delaying listings in Oslo because of the market turmoil,
Finansavisen reported.  There are 32 companies planning to list on the Oslo Bourse
this year or in the first half of 2012, the Oslo-based newspaper
reported.  Turbulent economic conditions and unforeseen events have
created a “nervous” market, Terje Skullerud, head of corporate
finance at DnB NOR Markets, told the newspaper. While this has
led to some listings being delayed none of the companies haven’t
abandoned their plans, he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
