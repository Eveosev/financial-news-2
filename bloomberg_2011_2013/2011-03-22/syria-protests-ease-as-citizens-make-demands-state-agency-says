Syria â€™s southern province of Daraa,
where security forces have killed five people and injured dozens
according to Human Rights Watch, is now calm, the state-run
 Syrian Arab News Agency  said today.  Gatherings in provincial villages have been disbanded after
notables there submitted demands to the authorities, the news
agency said. It showed pictures of a charred car and properties
that were damaged during protests. Syrian police faced the
protesters unarmed and were assaulted by some of them, the news
agency reported, citing policeman Karam Al-Tarshi, who it said
was injured during the clashes.  Government forces fired on demonstrators and used tear gas
to break up a public gathering in Daraa on March 20,  Human
Rights Watch  said on its  website . It called on the government to
stop using live fire and excessive force against protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
