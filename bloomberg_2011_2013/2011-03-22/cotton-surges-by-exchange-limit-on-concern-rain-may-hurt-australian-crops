Cotton jumped the most allowed by
ICE Futures U.S. on concern that wet weather may limit supplies
from  Australia , the world’s fourth-largest exporter.  Orange
juice  also gained.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology prediction for April to
June showed an “emerging risk” that rain may erode the quality
of the cotton crop and hamper the harvest that will start this
month, said Tracey Allen, an analyst at Rabobank Australia Ltd.
in Sydney. Prices have more than doubled in the past 12 months
as surging global demand outpaced shrinking supplies.  “News from Australia is positive for the market,” said
 Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers
& Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee. “There is some buying by
textile mills.”  Cotton for May delivery jumped by the limit of 7 cents, or
3.5 percent, to settle at $2.0596 a pound at 2:39 p.m. on ICE in
 New York . The fiber increased by the maximum for the third time
in four sessions. The most-active contract rose to a record of
$2.197 on March 7.  The U.S. is the biggest exporter, followed by India and
Uzbekistan.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery rose 0.15 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $1.582 a pound. Earlier, the price touched
$1.531, the lowest since Dec. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
