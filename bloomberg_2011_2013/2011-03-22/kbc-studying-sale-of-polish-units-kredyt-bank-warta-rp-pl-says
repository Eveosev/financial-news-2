KBC Group NV,  Belgium ’s biggest
bank and insurer by market value, is gauging investor interest
in a possible sale of its Polish units  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  and Warta
SA, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported today on its rp.pl
website, quoting unnamed sources.  “We have received preliminary inquiries from investment
bankers on the sale of Kredyt Bank, which we interpret as a
serious testing of the waters on the part of the Belgians,”
rp.pl quoted the chief executive officer of a Polish bank it
didn’t name as saying.   Inquiries on the possible transaction, which could fetch
up to 5 billion zloty ($1.76 billion) if Warta were included,
are linked to a delay in KBC’s plans to sell its Czech unit CSOB
AS on the Prague Stock Exchange, rp.pl said, citing a person in
the financial industry.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
