Spot gasoline in  New York  weakened
to the biggest discount to futures since May 2008 as U.S.
refineries returned units to service after seasonal maintenance.  “We’re seeing weakness in the cash market as refiners come
out of turnaround and make more gasoline,” said  Tom Knight ,
vice president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana, Texas.  BP Plc (BP/)  will start a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker
at its Texas City, Texas, refinery by March 25, according to a
filing with state regulators. The unit was shut in January for
planned work and inspections. The refinery also planned to shut
a crude unit during the work, a person with knowledge of the
maintenance schedule said Jan. 19.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor widened 0.5 cent to 19 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:44 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the widest
discount since May 29, 2008. Prompt delivery lost 0.65 cent to
$2.8059 a gallon.  European refiners may divert gasoline cargoes to the U.S.
because of disruptions to Japanese imports after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami shut about 22 percent of the country’s
petrochemical plants.  The discount for gasoline in the Gulf Coast widened 0.37
cent to 14 cents a gallon at 2:12 p.m. Prompt delivery lost 2.23
cents to $2.8389 a gallon.  The discount for the same fuel in the Midcontinent narrowed
0.38 cent to 12 cents. Prompt delivery gained 5.17 cents to
$2.8774 a gallon.  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  said it started sections of a fuel
pipeline east of a leak near Midland, Pennsylvania, at 5 p.m.
local time yesterday, according to an e-mailed statement. Supply
to areas east of the release site will be restored within the
next week, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
