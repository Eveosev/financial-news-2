Peru’s tax collection, which rose
17 percent in February from a year earlier, will grow at a
slower pace beginning this month after cuts in levies and import
tariffs, the government said.  Annual growth in receipts will likely be less than 10
percent after the government cut the  sales tax  to 18 percent
from 19 percent effective March 1 and reduced a levy on banking
transactions, said the state tax and import duty agency, known
as  Sunat , in an e-mailed statement.  Tax collection grew at the fastest pace in three months in
February to reach 5.19 billion soles ($1.87 billion) as booming
domestic demand spurs imports and retail sales, Sunat said.  Sales tax collection climbed 16 percent last month and
income tax revenue grew 14 percent, spurred by economic growth
and higher prices for the Andean nation’s mineral exports, the
agency said.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7814 per dollar at
2:28 p.m. New York time from 2.7827 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
