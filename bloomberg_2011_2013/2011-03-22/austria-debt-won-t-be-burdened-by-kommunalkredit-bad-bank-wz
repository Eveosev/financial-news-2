Eurostat will not include KA Finanz
AG, the “bad bank” of nationalized lender Kommunalkredit  Austria 
AG, in Austria’s debt statistics, Wiener Zeitung reported,
without saying where it got the information.  KA Finanz would have burdened Austria with 15 billon euros
($21 billion) and raised the Alpine country’s debts to more than
80 percent of gross domestic product, the Vienna-based newspaper
said.   The decision not to include KA Finanz will be made public
“in the coming days,” the paper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
