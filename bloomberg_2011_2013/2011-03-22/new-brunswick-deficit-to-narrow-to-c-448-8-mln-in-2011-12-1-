The Canadian province of  New
Brunswick ’s deficit will narrow to C$448.8 million ($458.2
million) in the 2011-12 fiscal year on spending restraint and
increased revenue, Finance Minister Blaine Higgs said.  The shortfall for the fiscal year ending March 31 will be
C$739.9 million, according to documents posted on the
government’s website today.  “Over the coming months, we will continue to work to
return the province to balance by 2014-2015,” Higgs said in the
text of a  speech  given today in Fredericton. It’s his first
budget since the Progressive Conservative Party led by David
Alward took office five months ago.  The province’s economy will expand 1.5 percent this year
after growing 2 percent in 2010 as stimulus spending slows,
according to the budget documents. Gross domestic product will
increase 2.2 percent in 2012, the finance department  forecast .  The province’s net debt will increase by C$630.3 million
and reach C$10.2 billion by the end of the 2011-12 fiscal year,
the budget report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
