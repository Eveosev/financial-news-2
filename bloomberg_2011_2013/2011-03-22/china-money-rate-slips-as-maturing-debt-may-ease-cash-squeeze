China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell, after jumping the most in a month yesterday, on
speculation debt maturing this month will ease a cash crunch
stemming from increases in banks’ reserve-requirement ratios.  Some 240 billion yuan ($36.6 billion) of central bank bills
fall due this week and next, according to Pin Ru Tan, a
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The People’s Bank of
China sold 50 billion yuan of one-year bills today, leaving the
yield unchanged at 3.1992 percent, according to traders at
primary dealers required to bid at auctions.  “There’s a chunky amount of debt maturing this month,
which is keeping the repurchase rate low,” said Singapore-based
Tan.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 12.5 basis points, or 0.125
percentage point, to 2.845 percent, according to a daily fixing
published at 11 a.m. in  Shanghai  by the Interbank Funding Center.  The rate climbed 95 basis points to 2.97 percent yesterday,
the biggest increase since Feb. 21, after the central bank said
March 18 it will  increase  lenders’ reserve requirements by half
a percentage point from March 25. The ratio will rise to 20
percent for the nation’s biggest banks.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point to 3.40 percent, as of 11:25 a.m. local time. The yield on
the 3.77 percent note due December 2020 slipped three basis
points to 3.91 percent, according to the National Interbank
Funding Center.  The central bank published in February a list of 50 primary
dealers allowed to participate in open-market operations,
including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp., China Citic Bank Corp., Industrial Bank
Co. and Postal Savings Bank of China.  --Sonja Cheung. Editors:  James Regan , Ven Ram  To contact the reporter on this story:
