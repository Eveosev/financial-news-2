U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne ’s March 23 budget will announce plans to put a
further 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) into the proposed green
investment bank, bringing its total capital up to 3 billion
pounds, the Financial Times reported, without attribution.  This would be sufficient for the bank to generate 18
billion pounds in funding for low-carbon energy projects by 2014
to 2015, the FT said. The bank will also be able to issue bonds
from April 2015, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
