The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
decline as much as 9.9 percent from its current level before
resuming its two-year-old advance, according to Bank of America
Corp.  The  S&P 500 ’s fall below support at 1,270 last week broke
the “uptrend” that has been in place since the middle of last
year, Mary Ann Bartels, Bank of America’s New York-based head of
technical market analysis, said in a note yesterday. The gauge
closed at 1,256.88 on March 16 and rose three straight days
since then, gaining 1.5 percent to 1,298.38 yesterday.  “The cyclical  bull market  since the March 2009 low is
intact,” Bartels said, “but a test of the recent low of 1,249
and possibly 1,220 to 1,170 cannot be ruled out.” She said her
estimate for the S&P 500 remains 1,400.  The S&P 500 has risen as much as 99 percent from its March
9, 2009, low as corporate earnings beat expectations, the
 Federal Reserve  bought Treasuries to stimulate growth and
economic data improved. The benchmark index for U.S. stocks
declined 6.4 percent from Feb. 18 through March 16 as violence
in the Middle East and northern Africa threatened to drive up
energy prices and an earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  caused
chaos in the world’s third-largest economy.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
