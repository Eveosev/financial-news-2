Vikas Babu, a currency trader in
Mumbai at state-owned  Andhra Bank , comments on the outlook for
India’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency were at
45.27 per dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in Singapore, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the rupee
will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of 44.98.  “I don’t see bullish sentiment on the rupee until global
 oil prices  come down. Oil prices are a key factor for the Indian
markets.  “The rupee may weaken to 45.50 in one month unless crude
prices come down to $90 a barrel. Crude trading at current
levels is negative for the currency. It is already burdening the
economy and it will increase inflation.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
