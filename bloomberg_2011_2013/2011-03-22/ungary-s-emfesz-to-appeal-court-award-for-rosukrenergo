Emfesz Kft., a Hungarian natural
gas trader, plans to appeal against a Swedish arbitration court
ruling that ordered it to pay $532 million to RosUkrEnergo AG,
the company said.  Emfesz cited “procedural and juridical mistakes” for
appealing the ruling in  Sweden  and in Hungary, the Budapest-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  RosUkrEnergo, a gas trader half-owned by OAO Gazprom, was
awarded $421 million for non-payment for gas, $106 million in
credit interest and 3.4 million euros ($4.8 million) in legal
costs in the March 17 decision. RosUkrEnergo is also half-owned
by Centragas Holding AG, a unit of Group DF, which has been in
an ownership dispute over Emfesz.  -- Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
