British lawmakers agreed to freeze
their salaries at 65,738 pounds ($107,192) without holding a
vote in the House of Commons last night, the Guardian reported.
The move brings the members of Parliament into line with most
public-sector workers, whose pay has been frozen for two years,
the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
