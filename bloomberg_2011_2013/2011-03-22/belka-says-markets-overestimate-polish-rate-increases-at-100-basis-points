Markets are overestimating the
scale of Polish interest-rate increases, which three-month
forward-rate prices suggest could amount to a full percentage
point over the next year, central bank Governor Marek Belka was
quoted today as saying by the Obserwatorfinansowy.pl website.  “My opinion is that the markets are overestimating the
necessary scope of tightening,” Belka said, according to the
website, which is operated by Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank Polski.
“Like a good physician, the central bank shouldn’t administer
medicine beyond the normal dosages.”  Poland’s current inflation rate is “high” and policy
makers “will have no choice” but to raise rates at the first
sign that higher food and fuel prices are feeding through to
wage demands, Belka said, according to obserwatorfinansowy.pl.  He said Polish tightening may have to be accelerated if
the  European Central Bank  increases euro-area borrowing costs
before the end of the year, as projected by the Polish central
bank.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
