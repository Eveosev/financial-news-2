The  Federal Reserve  said its
payments to the  U.S. Treasury  rose 67 percent to a record $79.3
billion last year on income from mortgage securities purchased
to spur economic growth.  The transfers, higher than initial Fed estimates, increased
from $47.4 billion in 2009, according to annual financial
statements released by the central bank today in Washington. The
statements included a letter from auditors Deloitte & Touche LLP
approving the numbers. The Fed in January reported an unaudited
2010 total of $78.4 billion in payments to Treasury.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in January that the
payments could decrease if the Fed raises short-term interest
rates because of a recovering economy. The Fed is buying $600
billion of  Treasury securities  through June in the second round
of quantitative easing. It purchased $1.7 trillion of mortgage
and Treasury debt from December 2008 to March 2010 in the first
round to revive the economy with the benchmark interest rate
near zero.  Operating expenses for the Fed and its 12 regional banks
rose to $5.07 billion from $4.98 billion. That includes $1.05
billion for Board of Governors operating expenses and currency
costs, up from $888 million in 2009; $33 million for the new
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which operates
independently of the Fed; and $10 million for the Treasury’s new
Office of Financial Research, the statement shows.  Both new organizations are funded through the Fed under
last year’s Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law. The financial-
research office will be funded by bank fees after the first two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
