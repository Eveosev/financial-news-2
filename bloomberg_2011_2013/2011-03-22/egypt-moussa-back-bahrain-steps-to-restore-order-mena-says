Egypt  signaled support for Bahraini
government measures to restore order in the kingdom, and the
 Arab League  stressed the importance of stability in a country
gripped by protests for more than a month.  Egypt’s Foreign Minister Nabil El-Arabi, who met his
Bahraini counterpart Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa in Cairo
today, said Egypt “supports what the government of Bahrain is
doing politically and supports the steps that it has taken,”
Egypt’s official Middle East News Agency said today.  Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa, who also met
with Sheikh Khalid, said Arab countries stress the importance of
preserving the stability and “Arabism” of Bahrain, Mena said.
The League has communicated this position through contacts with
countries including  Iran , Moussa told reporters.  Bahrain’s government declared a three-month state of
emergency on March 15 and began arresting opposition leaders,
after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Arab Gulf states
arrived to support the kingdom’s Sunni monarch in suppressing
demonstrations. Bahrain and its Gulf allies have blamed Iran for
instigating protests among the Shiite Muslim majority in
Bahrain.  Sheikh Khalid said that Bahrain has always had good
relations with Iran and “we hope that these relations can be
restored,” according to Mena. He said that the situation in
Bahrain “has developed toward quiet” and that “the issue now
is to restore security, realize stability and restore national
unity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
