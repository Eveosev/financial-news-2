Statnett SF, which operates
 Norway ’s power grid, is investigating the cause of an explosion
yesterday at a reserve power plant in Nyhamna, Norway.  “It doesn’t produce anything for the market on a regular
basis,” Martha Hagerup Nilson, a company spokeswoman, said by
phone. “It’s a mobile reserve power plant that we use in
situations where rationing is in place. We perform three test
drives a year of this kind.”  Statnett has two reserve natural gas power plants that have
a capacity of 150 megawatts each.  The explosion occurred yesterday in a turbine room during a
test run at the plant and the facility is secured, the company
said in a statement. No one was injured in the incident.  The power situation in mid-Norway, where the power plants
are located, is classified as “tight” because of low water
levels in the reservoirs which supply the hydroelectric plants.
Statnett applied for dispensation to open the reserve stations
in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
