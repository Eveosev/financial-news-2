Sotheby’s (BID)  said an auction of a
collection of wine from estates including the Domaine de la
Romanee Conti may fetch as much as $10 million next month.  About 11,000 bottles will be sold in almost 1,300 lots on
April 2 and 3, the New York-based auction house said in an e-
mailed statement. Sotheby’s raised $14.6 million in a two-day
wine auction in January, the statement said.  Wine sales in Hong Kong by Sotheby’s raised HK$410.4
million ($53 million) in 2010, 60 percent of its global total
and more than  New York  and  London  combined, it said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
