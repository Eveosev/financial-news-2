Senegal  is requesting donor support
for a 1.6 trillion-CFA-franc ($3.5 billion), five-year plan to
improve the West African nation’s road network, said Karim Wade,
minister for infrastructure, international cooperation, air
transport and energy.  The plan includes highways bound for Mauritania, Mali and
Burkina Faso along with bridges crossing the Gambia and
Casamance rivers, Wade told reporters in Dakar today.  “Our objective is to transform  Senegal  into a competitive
industrial and commercial hub in sub-Saharan Africa with perfect
connectivity,” Wade said.  Senegal should spend as much as 4.5 percent of its gross
domestic product on  road construction , compared with the current
2 percent, said Moctar Thiam, transport sector leader with the
World Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
