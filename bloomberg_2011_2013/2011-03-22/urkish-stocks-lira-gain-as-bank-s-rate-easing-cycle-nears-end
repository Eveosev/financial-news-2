Turkish stocks rose to one-month
high and the lira strengthened for a fourth day on speculation
tomorrow’s interest-rate decision will show the central bank has
ended its cuts aimed at weakening the currency.  The main ISE National 100 stock index climbed 1 percent to
64,841.33 at 5:12 p.m. in Istanbul. The lira advanced 0.5
percent to 1.5697 per dollar. Yields on benchmark two-year bonds
fell 6 basis points to 8.63 percent.  “We have to come to the end of the central bank’s easing
cycle,” Serhan Yenigun, a trader at Finansbank AS, said by
telephone. “No one expects further rate cuts and this also
gives support to the lira.”  The central bank unexpectedly lowered its key rate in
December and January, seeking to deter short-term capital
inflows and weaken the lira, as inflation slowed to a four-
decade low of 4.9 percent in the first month of 2011. All nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep
its one-week repo rate at 6.25 percent for a second straight
month tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
