--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Statistical Methodology  Survey Procedures: Grower surveys are conducted in the three estimating 
States (Washington,  Idaho , and  Oregon ) to collect stocks of hops held by 
growers. Additionally, contacts are made to collect stocks held by brewers 
and dealers. Telephone follow-up of mail survey non-respondents is used to 
ensure adequate coverage.  Estimating Procedures: Information obtained from the hops stocks grower, 
dealer, and brewers surveys are used to establish estimates of hops stocks. 
These estimates are reviewed for errors, reasonableness, and consistency with 
historical estimates.  Revision Policy: All hop stocks estimates are subject to revision the 
following year based on a thorough review of all available data.  Reliability: Survey indications are subject to sampling variability because 
all operations storing hops are not included in the sample. Survey results 
are also subject to non-sampling errors such as omission, duplication, 
imputation for missing data, and mistakes in reporting, recording, and 
processing the data. These errors cannot be measured directly, but are 
minimized through rigid quality controls in the data collection process and a 
careful review of all reported data for consistency and reasonableness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
