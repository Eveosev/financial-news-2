(Corrects index level in second paragraph.)  South African stocks climbed the
most in three days, led by Anglo American Plc, as copper
rebounded from its biggest drop in more than a week, boosting
miners.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index added 1.3 percent to
31,076.54 at 10:43 a.m. A close at this level would be the
strongest since March 11. Anglo, which comprises 11 percent of
the gauge, gained for a fourth day, rising as much as 1.9
percent to 350.95 rand.  Copper gained as much as 0.9 percent to $9,483 a metric ton
on expectations that the world will be short of the metal this
year even as the near-term demand outlook dimmed after  China 
further tightened liquidity.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
