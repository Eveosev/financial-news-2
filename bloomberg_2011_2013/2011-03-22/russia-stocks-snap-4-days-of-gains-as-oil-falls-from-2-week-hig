Russian stocks snapped a four-day
winning streak as oil, the country’s main revenue earner,
retreated from a two-week high.  The Micex Index declined 1 percent to 1,735.46 by 4:13 p.m.
in Moscow trading, poised for its biggest decline since March
15. OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, dropped
1.9 percent. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the country’s biggest
miner, slumped 2 percent while OAO Uralkali, Russia’s second-
largest potash producer, lost 2.2 percent.  Oil declined as much as 90 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$101.43 barrel in  New York . Yesterday it gained $1.26 to
$102.33, the highest settlement since March 10, after air
strikes in  Libya  threatened to prolong a disruption in supplies
in  Africa ’s third-biggest oil producer.  “We are seeing some consolidation and profit-taking after
recent gains,” Michael Kart, a managing director at Moscow-
based investment firm Marshall Spectrum Ltd., said by phone
today. “There won’t be any significant sell-off anytime soon
because the tension in the Middle East is not showing signs of
abating.”  The Micex Index has gained 2.9 percent this year compared
to a 3.1 percent loss for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
