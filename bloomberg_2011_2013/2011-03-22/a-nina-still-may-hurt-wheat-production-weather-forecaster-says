A weakening La Nina weather pattern
still may affect wheat in the Northern Hemisphere, according to
forecaster Weather Trends International.  “For growers, the biggest concern weather-wise remains on
the wheat side, as we still have some reason to pay closer
attention to the conditions surrounding Northern Hemisphere
winter crops coming out of dormancy, as well as spring planting
conditions in several origins,” Michael Ferrari, vice president
for applied technology and research, said in a report dated
yesterday.  La Nina, a cooling of waters in the  Pacific Ocean , is
blamed for flooding in  Australia  that halted coal shipments and
curbed wheat output. Last year, while La Nina gained strength,
19 named storms formed in the Atlantic, tying for the third-
most-active season on record with 1995 and 1887, according to
the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
