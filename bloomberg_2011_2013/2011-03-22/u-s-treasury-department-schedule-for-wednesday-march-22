The following is a reformatted
version of the U.S. Treasury Department’s daily release on the
schedule for Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials:  On Tuesday morning, Secretary Geithner will deliver opening
remarks at an Obama Administration Conference on ““Access to
Capital: Fostering Growth and Innovation for Small Companies,”
which will be held in the Treasury Department’s Cash Room. The
conference will bring together policymakers, entrepreneurs,
investors, academics, and other market participants to explore
how both the public and private sectors can help promote access
to capital at each stage of growth for a small company - from
seed capital, to growth equity, to accessing the public markets.  Following remarks by Secretary Geithner and Small Business
Administration Administrator Karen Mills, the Secretary will
moderate a panel discussion on “Pre-IPO Funding: Seed Capital,
Angel Investors, Venture Capital, and Growth Equity.”  Conference panels and opening remarks are all open press;
working breakout lunches are open to pen and pad correspondents
only. For the full conference agenda and live streaming during
