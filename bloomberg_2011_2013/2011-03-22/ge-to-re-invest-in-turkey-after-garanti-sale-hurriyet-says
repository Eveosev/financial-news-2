General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to
invest in Turkey again after selling 18.6 percent stake at
Turkish lender Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS for $3.78 billion,
 Hurriyet  said, citing GEâ€™s vice chairman John Rice.  GE may announce a new investment within two weeks in
infrastructure, Rice said, according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper. GE is planning investment in energy and railways as
well as seeking opportunities in neighboring countries with
Turkish partners, he said.  GE, which agreed to sell its Garanti stake to  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in November, had bought half of Ankara-
based Gama Enerji AS in 2007 and announced plans to invest at
least $3 billion over five years to build  power plants  in Turkey
and the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
