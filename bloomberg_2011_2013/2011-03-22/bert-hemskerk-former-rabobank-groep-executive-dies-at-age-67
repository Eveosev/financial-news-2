(Corrects spelling of “Heemskerk” in headline.)  Bert Heemskerk, the former chairman
of Rabobank Groep NV, the world’s biggest agriculture lender,
died today after a short illness, the bank said. He was 67.  Heemskerk died in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, the bank said
in a statement. He headed the Utrecht-based cooperative of local
independent lenders from November 2002 until June 2009. In 2007,
Rabobank, asked Heemskerk to guide the bank through the
financial crisis and he did so without taking state support.  “He discovered much to his own surprise that cooperative
banking really does exist,” Piet Moerland, who succeeded
Heemskerk in 2009, said in the statement.  Heemskerk, who was born in Noordwijkerhout in 1943,
previously worked for  ABN Amro  and Van Lanschot NV and held
positions in  Tokyo , Dubai and  London . He is survived by his wife
and eight children, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
