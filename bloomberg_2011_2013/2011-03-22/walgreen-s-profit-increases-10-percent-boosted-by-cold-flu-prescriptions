Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, reported a 10 percent gain in second-quarter
profit, helped by demand for flu-related prescriptions.  Net income rose to $739 million, or 80 cents a share, in
the period ended Feb. 28, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company
said today in a statement. Analysts anticipated 80 cents,
according to the average of estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Walgreen, led by Chief Executive Officer Greg Wasson,
benefited as more people fell ill from colds and the flu later
in the season than a year ago. The company filled one in five
retail prescriptions in the U.S. for the first time in history
last quarter, Wasson said in the statement.  The shares rose $1.06 to $41.97 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. They had gained 7.7 percent this
year before today.  Second-quarter sales advanced 8.9 percent to $18.5 billion,
helped by its April acquisition of  Duane Reade , which operates
stores in the New York area. Profit a year earlier was $669
million, or 68 cents a share.  The chain agreed this month to sell its pharmacy-benefit
management business for $525 million to focus on its network of
7,700 stores. Walgreen plans to complete the sale of the unit
that negotiates drug prices for corporate and government
insurance plans by June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
