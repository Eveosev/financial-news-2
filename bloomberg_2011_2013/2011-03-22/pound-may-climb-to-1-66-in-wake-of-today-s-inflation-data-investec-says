The pound may advance to $1.66 if
it closes above $1.64 after U.K. inflation data today renewed
speculation the  Bank of England  may raise  interest rates ,
according to Investec Plc.  Consumer prices accelerated to the fastest pace in more
than two years in February, adding to pressure on the central
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The minutes of the BOE’s March
decision will be published tomorrow.  “If we see a close above $1.64, the pound could come into
its own a little bit and especially given that we’ve got MPC
minutes tomorrow and we’ve got the U.K. budget, which can throw
the pound around,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the
corporate and institutional treasury desk at Investec in London.
“If we get this break through $1.64, $1.66 is potentially a
near term target.”  The U.K. currency appreciated to $1.6401, the strongest
level since Jan. 19, 2010, before trading at $1.676 at 12:49
p.m. in  London . Against the euro, sterling strengthened 0.4
percent to 86.85 pence.  Sterling last reached $1.66 in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
