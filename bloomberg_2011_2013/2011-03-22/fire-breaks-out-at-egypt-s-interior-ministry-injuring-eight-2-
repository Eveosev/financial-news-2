A fire broke out in an Interior
Ministry building following protests in Cairo today, injuring
eight people.  The Egyptian army surrounded the ministry earlier in the
day to prevent demonstrating police officers and civilian
employees of the ministry who were demanding benefits including
wage increases from storming the complex.  The cause of the blaze wasn’t immediately clear. Fire
trucks and ambulances rushed to the scene and firefighters were
seen evacuating people from inside the smoldering building.  Most of those injured suffered smoke inhalation and all
were in stable condition, according to the official Middle East
News Agency, which cited Sherif Zamer, head of the Health
Ministry’s critical-care unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
