The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
declined to comment on a report suggesting the People’s Bank of
 China  will boost returns on yuan funds deposited with the city’s
clearing bank.  China’s central bank plans to raise yuan clearing interest
rates in Hong Kong to help develop the city’s market for the
currency, Reuters reported today, citing unidentified people.  “The interest rate payable on RMB funds deposited with the
People’s Bank of China by the RMB Clearing Bank is determined by
the PBOC,” Anissa Wong, a spokeswoman at the HKMA, wrote in an
e-mailed response to questions. “The HKMA does not comment on
whether an increase of such interest rate is being considered by
PBOC.” RMB is an abbreviation of renminbi, an alternative name
for China’s currency.  An increase would prompt BOC  Hong Kong  (Holdings) Ltd., the
sole clearing bank for yuan in the city, to raise the deposit
rate it offers to other lenders and lead to higher returns on
customers’ holdings of the currency.  BOC Hong Kong said it was unaware of any planned increase
in the rate.  “We don’t know the source of information regarding the
Reuters report,” spokeswoman Angel Yip said. “BOCHK hasn’t
received any information or instruction on the clearing interest
rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
