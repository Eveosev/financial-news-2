Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures
gained after commodities rose and the dollar dropped against the
euro, fueling demand for alternative investments.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in June
rose 0.9 percent yesterday, signaling benchmark indexes may
rebound in Moscow after the Micex index of 30 stocks closed at
its lowest level in five months on May 12. Contracts on OAO
Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer, gained 0.9 percent
while those on OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest, rose 0.7
percent. OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, rose 1
percent.  “RTS stock-index futures turned higher as key commodities
rose after the dollar gave back gains,” Yan Gloukhovski, a
trader at Alforma Capital Markets, the New York branch of
Russia’s Alfa Bank, said via e-mail. “The structure of the
rebound is likely to favor domestic names in steel, retailers
and financials.”  The U.S. currency slipped from the highest level versus the
euro since April 1. Some investors buy oil and other commodities
when the dollar weakens against the euro and sell them when the
dollar strengthens. Oil retreated earlier when the  International
Energy Agency  cut its global demand estimate for this year by
190,000 barrels a day, or 0.2 percent.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
rose 0.1 percent yesterday. The index rebounded after dropping 9
percent last week, the steepest weekly decline since December
2008. Russia is the world’s largest energy exporter and a
producer of metals including nickel, palladium and aluminum. Oil
and natural gas account for a quarter of Russia’s economic
output.  Commodity Volatility  “The extent of volatility in this commodity rout decreased
the appetite for the sector and investors are likely to have a
more defensive stance into the summer,” Gloukhovski said.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 0.8 percent, to settle at
$98.97 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.
Prices were up 31 percent from a year ago.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 0.2 percent. Lukoil’s American
depositary receipts dropped 1.3 percent. Gazprom’s ADRs fell 2.6
percent. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel’s ADRs rose 1.6 percent.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  increased 0.5 percent to 1,348.65 after
dropping as much as 0.8 percent to 1,332.03. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  also gained 0.5 percent to 12,695.92,
rebounding from a 0.7 percent loss earlier.  The dollar weakened 0.4 percent against the euro to $1.4246
after increasing to $1.4124 earlier. The Dollar Index, which
tracks the currency versus six major peers, lost 0.2 percent to
reverse an early gain.  Russia’s ruble-denominated Micex Index lost 1.5 percent
yesterday, falling to 1,630.78, the weakest level since Dec. 1.
The dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 2.3 percent to 1,864.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
