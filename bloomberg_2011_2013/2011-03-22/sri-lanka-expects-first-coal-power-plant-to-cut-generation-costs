Sri Lanka ’s first coal-fired power
plant, scheduled to be opened today by President Mahinda
Rajapaksa, is expected to generate cheaper electricity as the
economy expands after a three-decade civil war.  The plant at Norocholai, north of the capital  Colombo , was
built with a $450 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of
 China  and will add 300 megawatts to the national grid, the
government said on its  website . The second phase is scheduled to
be completed by 2014 at a cost of $891 million and will have a
capacity of 600 megawatts, it said.  “This project will result in saving a considerable amount
of foreign exchange and reduction in the cost of power
generation,” according to the statement. It will “contribute
toward the expansion of the industrial sector as well as other
development sectors.”  Sri Lanka’s $42 billion economy may grow 8.5 percent in
2011 and 9 percent in 2012 from an estimated 8 percent expansion
in 2010, according to the central bank. The island’s electricity
demand is growing at about 8 percent a year.  The island nation, which imports all the fuel it needs,
gets about 47 percent of its electricity from oil-fired plants
and the rest from large hydro-power projects. The cost of
generating power using coal is about half that of an oil-fired
unit, the government has said.  Sri Lanka last year awarded its first contract for low-
sulfur coal from  Indonesia  for about $70 a metric ton for the
Norocholai project.  The country’s current power generation capacity is 2,818
megawatts, of which 1,059 comes from private producers,
according to the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board. Maximum
demand is 1,960 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
