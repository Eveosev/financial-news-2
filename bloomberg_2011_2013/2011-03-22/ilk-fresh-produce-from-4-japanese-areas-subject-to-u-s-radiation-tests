Milk and fresh produce from four
regions of  Japan  closest to radiation leaks from a damaged
nuclear power plant will be barred from the U.S. as regulators
step up safeguards against potential food contamination.  The products from the Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma
prefectures in Japan are affected by the  Import Alert  issued
yesterday by the  Food and Drug Administration . Food believed to
be from these areas will be detained at the U.S. border unless
the importer can verify the products came from other regions of
Japan, the FDA said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The agency has  assured  U.S. consumers it was taking action
such as using radiation tests to protect against food
contaminated from Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant, which has leaked radiation into vegetables and
seawater. The ban issued yesterday strengthens the agency’s
monitoring efforts and complements measures put in place by
Japan, the FDA’s statement says.  “FDA will continue to flag all entries from Japan in order
to determine whether they originated from the affected area,”
the agency said in its statement. “FDA will test all food and
feed shipments from the affected area.”  Japanese authorities barred the export of milk and
vegetables from the four areas on March 21, the FDA noted in the
alert. The agency said it’s working with the Japanese government
to identify health risks.  Less Than 4%  Japanese food imports represent less than 4 percent of the
food that enters the U.S. Products already in the country are
safe to eat because they left Japan prior to the earthquake and
tsunami that triggered the nuclear crisis, the FDA said March 17
in a statement.  The paucity of Japanese  milk products  and fresh produce in
U.S. stores means the FDA’s actions aren’t “going to have
really any meaningful impact on the U.S. consumer,” said
Benjamin England, chief executive officer of  FDAImports.com LLC ,
a Columbia, Maryland-based company that consults with importers
of food, drugs and medical devices. The agency took action to
shield itself from criticism from Congress and the news
media, England said.  “That’s about all it does,” he said.  The FDA employs more than 900 investigators and 450
analysts to inspect and review incoming food and works in
conjunction with  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  to monitor
imports, according to a  statement  on radiation safety on the
agency’s website.  The agency should do more, said Representative Rosa DeLauro
of  Connecticut , the ranking Democrat on the spending
subcommittee that approves the FDA’s budget.  “I strongly urge the agency to act swiftly to set aside
for radiological testing all food imports from Japan,” she
wrote yesterday in a  letter .  To contact the reporter on this story:
