Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  will
amend a $957 million deal with German affiliate Lehman Brothers
Bankhaus AG, a bondholders group said.  A prior agreement committed Lehman to paying a $100 million
penalty if its own bankruptcy plan wasn’t confirmed by Dec. 31,
the group, including Paulson & Co. and the California Public
Employees’ Retirement System, said yesterday in a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in  New York .  The Paulson-Calpers group has proposed a rival liquidation
plan for Lehman. Thus “it seemed potentially inappropriate”
for Lehman to commit itself to “prosecuting a particular plan
when it is entirely unclear what plan or plans or provisions
thereof are in the best interests” of the debtors, the group
said in the filing.  Lehman has said it aims to confirm its $61 billion payment
plan by Nov. 17, after creditors vote by Oct. 14. The vote will
be “contentious,” Lehman said in court papers.  Lehman has been buying discounted loans and mortgages from
Bankhaus while negotiating the amount it owes the bankrupt
affiliate. The $957 million deal was challenged on March 17,
when Lehman’s defunct brokerage,  Lehman Brothers Inc ., said it
had an ownership interest in the notes and might want a say if
they’re sold.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
