France ’s chemical production, from
industrial gases to fertilizers and glues, may rise by 3 percent
this year as European economies continue to recover from the
crisis, according to the nation’s chemical industry federation.  “The start of 2011 is rather good,” Olivier Homolle, who
chairs the  Union des Industries Chimiques  and oversees BASF SE’s
operations in France, said in an interview. “2011 should
positively add to the foundations of 2010, which was a year of
very significant recovery.”  Production of chemicals in France rose 11 percent in 2010
after slumping 9.4 percent the previous year, Homolle said.
Combined with rising prices, the revenue of French and foreign
chemicals makers based in the country rose 14 percent last year
to 77 billion euros ($109 billion), he said. That includes a
positive contribution from exports minus imports of 5 billion
euros, he said.  The French  chemical industry , which employs 171,000 people,
must improve its infrastructure, from pipeline connections to
port operations, and build bigger plants to be more competitive,
he said. Otherwise, the industry may see further job losses in
coming years, after already shedding 4,000 posts in 2010,
Homolle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
