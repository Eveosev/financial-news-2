Bank of Montreal Chief Executive
Officer William Downe said  TMX Group Inc. (X) ’s C$3.2 billion ($3.3
billion) combination with  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  will
benefit Canada.  “In the long run, the combination of these exchanges is
good for Canada, it’s good for employment, it’s good for capital
formation and I think it’s good for our national brand,” Downe,
58, said today in an interview in  Vancouver .  The London exchange owner agreed Feb. 9 to buy the Toronto
Stock Exchange owner in an all-stock transaction that will give
LSE shareholders 55 percent of the combined company, and TMX
investors the rest. Bank of Montreal’s investment banking
business is advising Toronto-based TMX on the transaction.  “Markets are becoming more and more global, and in an age
of virtual communication, broadening the reach of origination
and distribution of equities makes an enormous amount of
sense,” Downe said.  Canada ’s banks, united on most policy issues, are divided
on whether to support the proposed sale of the country’s main
stock exchange.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank
and  National Bank of Canada  are among the detractors of the
transaction, concerned about job cuts and loss of regulatory
control. Royal Bank of Canada, which supports the deal and
advised LSE, has said the takeover offers companies on the
exchange a broader pool of investors.  Downe, who was in Vancouver for his bank’s annual investor
meeting, said he “hadn’t noticed” the division among Canada’s
banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
