Syria  will sign within weeks a
contract for exchanging different types of wheat with Ukraine,
the head of Syria’s General Establishment for Cereal Processing
and Trade said.  The two countries’ governments will agree to swap a
quantity of Syrian hard wheat for Ukrainian soft wheat to ensure
the preferred mixture for bread eaten in the Arab country,
Suleiman Al Nasser said in a telephone interview today.  “We will get preferential prices from Ukraine as it is
government-involved deal,” said Al Nasser, the establishment’s
general manager.  Officials of the two nations have yet to specify the
volumes of wheat to be traded, nor have they announced a date
for the contract signing, he said.  Syria may produce 4 million metric tons of wheat in the 12
months starting July 1, up from 3.6 million tons a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a report posted on
the website of its  Foreign Agricultural Service  on March 21.  The Middle Eastern country may import 1 million tons, down
from 1.2 million tons a year earlier, according to the website.
Ukraine is one of Syria’s regular wheat suppliers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
