The ruble gained for a fifth day
against the dollar, advancing to its strongest level in more
than two weeks, on speculation violence in the Middle East will
continue to disrupt crude deliveries.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 28.2440 per
dollar by the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, bringing its five-day
increase to 2.1 percent. The ruble strengthened 0.1 percent to
40.0700 versus the euro.  Tension in the Middle East and North  Africa , including
 Libya , Africa’s third-largest crude producer, is adding a
premium, or extra risk cost, of $15 to $20 a barrel to Brent oil
prices, Societe Generale SA said in a report yesterday. London-
traded Brent oil, used to calculate the price of Urals,  Russia ’s
chief export blend, rose 0.4 percent to $115.36 a barrel after a
0.9 percent gain yesterday, while in  New York  the May oil
contract advanced 1.1 percent to $104.25.  Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 28.4190 per dollar
in three months, down from 28.5795 on March 21. The contracts
provide a guide to expectations of currency moves and interest
rate differentials.  Gains against the dollar and the euro left the ruble at
33.5657 against the central bank’s target currency basket, the
strongest level since March 10. The basket is used to manage
swings that hurt Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by
multiplying the dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to
ruble rate by 0.45, then adding them together.  Brent will average $109 a barrel this year, up from $98, on
expectations of an “extended shutdown” of Libyan oil supplies,
SocGen analysts led by  Michael Wittner  said in their March
monthly commodity review dated yesterday.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, Ana Monteiro  To contact the reporters on this story:
