Two booming industries have taken
hold in  Tennessee  in recent years: auto manufacturing and
illegal  methamphetamine  production. One is driving robust
 population growth .  The suburban Nashville counties of Williamson and
Rutherford, both benefiting from Nissan Motor Co. investment,
led Tennessee in population increases over the last decade,
according to  U.S. Census  data released last week. Rural counties
in Tennessee experienced slow growth or declines and, in some
cases, saw a rise in criminal industry -- illustrated by a
record number of law enforcement raids on meth labs in the past
year.  “Everything from Nissan has been good,” said former
Smyrna mayor and current city councilman Paul Johns. “They pay
good. It’s caused people to buy bigger houses, to drive better
automobiles. We’re kind of lucky.”  Williamson County’s population rose during the past decade
by 44.7 percent to 183,182 from 126,638, 2010 Census data show.
It was trailed only slightly by nearby Rutherford County, which
grew by 44.3 percent to 262,604 from 182,023.  Williamson is home to the North American headquarters of
Nissan. The city of Smyrna in Rutherford hosts a $2.5 billion
Nissan auto factory, which began production in 1983 and was
expanded in the early 1990s. The Japanese automaker also plans
to build its electric car, the  Leaf , in Smyrna and a separate
factory to produce batteries.  $1 Billion Plant  Further south near Chattanooga, the German automaker
 Volkswagen AG (VLKAY)  is constructing a $1 billion plant where it will
produce the Passat later this year. The factory will employ
2,000 people, with a projected 9,500 more jobs coming from
companies that supply the plant, according to  Scott Wilson ,
spokesman for Volkswagen Group of America.  The population of Hamilton County, home to the factory,
grew over the last decade by 9.3 percent to 336,463 from
307,896, census data show.  Tennessee’s population grew 11.5 percent to 6,346,105 in
2010 from 2000, data show. White, non-Hispanics grew 6.5 percent
to 4,800,782 in 2010 over the last decade. The percentage of
Hispanics more than doubled to 290,059 in 2010 from 123,838 in
2000. The number of blacks rose 13.1 percent 1,049,391 in 2010.
The Asian population grew 61 percent to 90,311 last year,
according to the census.  Whites now account for 75.6 percent of Tennessee’s
population. Blacks are 16.5 percent; Asians are 1.4 percent and
Hispanics, 4.6 percent, according to census data.  Solar Power  Nine of the state’s fastest-growing counties are in
suburban Nashville,  Memphis , Knoxville and Chattanooga, the data
show.  In addition to auto-company investments, Tennessee has
benefited over the past three years from the growth of solar
power. The state landed more than $2 billion in total investment
from Hemlock Semiconductor Corp., of Hemlock,  Michigan , and
 Wacker Chemie AG (WKCMF) , a German company.  The economic outlook is not as bright in some rural parts
of Tennessee where population growth was either slow or dropped
since 2000, census data show. Those are also areas that state
law enforcement has found illegal trade -- notably
methamphetamine production -- soaring over the last four years.  Meth Capital  In 2010, Tennessee law officers seized a record 2,082
methamphetamine labs, up 45 percent from the 1,437 labs closed
in 2009, according to the state’s Methamphetamine  Task Force ,
which helps coordinate law enforcement effort to combat the
illegal drug trade by creating a database of offenders and
assisting in training and evidence collection.  By comparison,  Missouri , which ranked first in seizures in
2009, had 1,960 labs raided in 2010, according to the task
force.  That means Tennessee “likely” will rank as the meth
capital of the  United States , said Tommy Farmer, director of
Tennessee’s meth task force.  “Is that the dubious distinction we want?” he asked. “I
don’t think so.”  Police seized 155 meth labs in McMinn County in 2010, the
most of any county, according to the task force. McMinn, a
largely rural county in southeastern Tennessee, saw its
population increase over the last decade by 6.6 percent to
52,266 from 49,015, according to the census. Campbell County,
also rural, had 116 lab seizures. Its population increased by
only 2.2 percent over the last decade from 39,854 to 40,716,
according to the Census.  ‘Big Issue’  In contrast, police captured a total of 22 meth labs in
Tennessee’s fastest growing -- and much larger -- counties of
Williamson and Rutherford.  “Meth is a big issue and that’s primarily a dynamic of the
terrain of Tennessee,” said Deborah Woolley, president of the
 Tennessee Chamber  of Commerce and Industry.  Much of the state’s industry is in the flatlands, with the
Great Smoky Mountains and other remote, hilly regions left with
higher poverty and drug use, Woolley said. “Your challenge is
the mountains, the hills, the terrain, which just isn’t
conducive for large manufacturing,” she said.  Meth costs taxpayers millions each year for  law
enforcement , cleanup of hazardous chemicals, hospital costs to
treat burns victims when labs explode and foster care for the
children whose parents are arrested, said Farmer. In 2010 alone,
Tennessee placed 484 children in foster care following lab
seizures, he said.  Higher Unemployment  While Tennessee has been successful in recruiting billions
in new investment, its unemployment rate of 9.6 percent is
higher than the national average of 8.9 percent. The fast-growth
counties are faring better, with Williamson’s unemployment at
6.7 percent and Rutherford at 8.8 percent. The two counties with
the highest number of meth seizures have unemployment higher
rates than the state average: 12.8 percent in McMinn and 13.4
percent in Campbell.  Rural areas far from the interstate highways suffer because
of poor transportation and less-educated workers, said Randy
Gustafson, director of the state data center at the University
of Tennessee in Knoxville.  Meth “is more of a symptom than a cause,” of the slower
economy in rural Tennessee, he said. “For the most part, the
people who are engaged in that are unemployed, unskilled and
desperate because they have no opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
