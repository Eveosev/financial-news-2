Exact Holding NV (EXACT)  Chief Executive
Officer Martijn Janmaat will step down a year after he was
appointed CEO as a contract extension didn’t fit with his
personal agenda, the Dutch business-software maker said.  “Over the past months we have realized important changes
to drive profitable organic growth and I strongly believe in the
company’s future and chances,” Janmaat said in a statement on
Delft, Netherlands-based Exact’s website today. “I also
realized that an extension of my contract does not fit with my
personal objectives and agenda going forward.”  Janmaat was named CEO, replacing Rajesh Patel, for a one-
year period initially. Exact aims to nominate a successor before
Aug. 31, the company said in today’s statement.  Exact has advanced 13 percent in Amsterdam trading since
Janmaat’s appointment was announced in July last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
