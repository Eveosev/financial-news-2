OptionsXpress Holdings Inc.
investors filed three lawsuits challenging  Charles Schwab
Corp. (SCHW) ’s plan to buy the retail options brokerage for about
$1 billion in stock, claiming the board failed to get the best
possible price.  The trio of lawsuits, filed yesterday and today in
 Illinois  state court in  Chicago , where OptionsXpress is based,
claim the company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties to
shareholders. Each complaint seeks a court order blocking the
transaction.  Schwab, the largest independent broker by client assets,
announced the deal in a statement jointly issued yesterday by
the San Francisco-based company and OptionsXpress.  The agreed-upon $17.91-a-share value of the transaction
“substantially undervalues the company and is merely an attempt
by Schwab to acquire OptionsXpress for a bargain during a
temporary downturn in the economy,” according to one complaint.
OptionsXpress closed March 18 at $15.33 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  The plaintiffs in each case seek class-action, or group,
status on behalf of all OptionsXpress investors who were
allegedly harmed in the transaction.  Named as defendants in each of the complaints are
OptionsXpress Chairman and co-founder James A. Gray, Vice-
Chairman and co-founder Ned W. Bennett, and six other directors.
Schwab, too, is a defendant in each case.  Greg Gable, a spokesman for Schwab, said it was against
company policy to discuss pending litigation and declined to
comment. Patrick Van De Wille, an outside spokesman for
OptionsXpress, didn’t immediately reply to after-hours voice-
mail and e-mail messages seeking comment.  The cases are Thomas v.  OptionsXpress Holdings Inc. (OXPS) ,
11ch10898, Page v. OptionsXpress Holdings Inc., 11ch10845, and
Kolton v. Gray, 11ch10657, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court,
 Chancery Division  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
