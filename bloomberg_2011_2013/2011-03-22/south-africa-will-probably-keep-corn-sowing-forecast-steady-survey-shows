South Africa  will probably leave
its estimate for this season’s corn plantings unchanged, a
survey showed.  South Africa’s  Crop Estimates Committee  may on March 24 say
that farmers will sow 2.38 million hectares (5.9 million acres)
with corn this season, unchanged from its previous forecast,
according to the median estimate of nine traders surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Projections ranged from 2.37 million hectares to
2.38 million hectares.  Corn plantings will probably fall 13 percent this season
from a year earlier, the committee said on Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
