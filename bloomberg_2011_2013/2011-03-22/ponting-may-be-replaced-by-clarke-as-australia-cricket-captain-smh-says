Ricky Ponting ’s nine-year reign as
Australia captain may end this week, with cricket officials in
the country weighing whether to replace him before a tour of
Bangladesh next month, the  Sydney Morning Herald  reported.  Vice-captain  Michael Clarke , 29, may be promoted after last
month leading Australia to a 6-1 rout of England in their one-
day international series, the newspaper said. The 36-year-old
Ponting missed the matches with a broken finger.  Ponting was the captain as England in January won an Ashes
Test series in Australia for the first time in 24 years. England
took the final Test by an innings and 83 runs in Sydney to win
the best-of-five contest 3-1, Australia’s worst series loss
since 1988-89.  India  hosts Australia in the quarterfinals of the  World Cup 
in Ahmedabad on March 24. Australia has won the past three
editions of the tournament, dating back to 1999. Pakistan on
March 19 beat Australia in group play by four wickets to end the
three-time defending champion’s 34-match unbeaten run in the
tournament. Australia’s previous loss in the competition came in
1999, also against Pakistan.  The World Cup final is scheduled for April 2. Australia
begins its three-game tour of Bangladesh on April 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
