Japan  will have to import more meat
after a deadly earthquake and tsunami this month that was the
country’s worst disaster since World War II, according to the
 U.S. Meat Export Federation .  Flooding from the tsunami hit the Tohoku region, which
produces about 16 percent of Japan’s pork, 12 percent of its
beef and 15 percent of poultry, according to Philip Seng, the
export federation’s chief executive. Japan was the largest
importer of U.S. pork and the third-largest buyer of U.S. beef
last year, government  data  show.  “All those operations have been severely impacted, and so
we see there’s going to be a shortage, obviously, when you take
that much out of the production in Japan,” Seng said in an e-
mailed audio statement. “There is going to be a need to bring
in more meat products.”  Beef shipments may climb this year to 153,000 metric tons
(337.3 million pounds) valued at $790 million, up 23 percent
from 2010, and pork exports may climb to 447,000 tons, valued at
$1.7 billion, up 3 percent, according to the federation. Those
forecasts are unchanged from the Denver-based group’s estimates
before the earthquake, said Joe Schuele, a spokesman.  “Increased need for exports could take us over those
targets,” Schuele said today by telephone. “Right now, we
think it’s more prudent to just hold our forecasts steady.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
