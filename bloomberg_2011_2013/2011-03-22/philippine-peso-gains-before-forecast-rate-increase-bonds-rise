The Philippine peso rose the most
in six weeks on speculation the central bank will increase its
benchmark interest rate from a record low this week to curb
inflation.  The currency reached a one-week high before the central
bank meets to review its overnight borrowing rate on March 24.
Ten of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect a quarter of a
percentage point increase to 4.25 percent, one predicts a half a
percentage point rise and four forecast no change. Consumer
prices rose 4.3 percent in February from a year earlier, after a
revised 3.6 percent gain in January.  “We expect the central bank to start a cautious rate-
tightening cycle later this week,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a
Singapore-based economist at  Barclays Capital . “A stronger
currency would help against imported price pressures.”  The peso strengthened 0.5 percent to 43.333 per dollar as
of the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , the strongest since March 10,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has rallied 1.3
percent since March 17.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas hasn’t raised its benchmark
rate since August 2008. The central bank will consider the
impact of the crisis in  Japan  on the economy at its rate-setting
meeting, Governor Amando Tetangco said March 18.  Five-year peso bonds gained after the government sold $1.5
billion of dollar notes today, more than the $1 billion
originally planned. The yield on the 7 percent note due January
2016 dropped 12 basis points, 0.12 percentage point, to 5.88
percent, the lowest since Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter for this story:
