U.S. five-year Treasuries fell for
a fourth day as stock markets gained in  Asia  and  Europe , eroding
demand for the safest assets.  Yields on the U.S. note due February 2016 rose one basis
point to 2.04 percent as of 8:44 a.m. in  London . U.S. 10-year
yields were little changed at 3.33 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
