The aircraft carrier USS  George
Washington  yesterday left the Japanese port of Yokosuka, about
175 miles (280 kilometers) south of a crippled nuclear plant, as
a precautionary measure.  “Moving the USS George Washington is a precaution given
the capabilities of the vessel and the complex nature of the
disaster,” the 7th Fleet said in a press release. “The forward
deployed carrier is scheduled to remain in the local waters off
 Japan .”  U.S. Navy ships and helicopters have been involved in
rescue efforts following the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and
subsequent tsunami that hit Japan’s Tohoku region on March 11.
Radiation detected on U.S. aircrews operating near Fukushima
prompted the relocation of some ships on March 14.  “We’ve seen nothing that rises to the level that would be
harmful to human health,” Commander Jeff Davis, a Seventh Fleet
spokesman, said in a phone interview from Yokosuka, about 30
miles south of  Tokyo .  The battle to prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power station entered its 12th day as reports increased
of radiation contamination at sea and on land. Radiation levels
found so far in food aren’t harmful, Japan’s Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano said at a press conference yesterday.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. said fuel rods at the plant have
been damaged, releasing five kinds of radioactive material and
contaminating seawater for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
