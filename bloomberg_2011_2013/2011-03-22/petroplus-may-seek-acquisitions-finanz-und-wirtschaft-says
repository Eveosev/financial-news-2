Petroplus Holding AG,  Europe ’s
largest independent refiner, may seek to buy oil processing
installations, Finanz und Wirtschaft reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Vettier.  “I don’t rule out further acquisitions,” Vettier said in
an interview published on March 23. “It was important for
Petroplus from the beginning to seek critical mass above buying
other companies. With more than 600,000 barrels a day of
through-flow capacity we’ve long since reached that and so we’re
happy with our progress.”  Any refinery acquisition must help increase profitability
to keep the company competitive, according to Vettier. Europe
has overcapacity and 20 of its 110 crude-processing
installations may “disappear” in the next 10 years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
