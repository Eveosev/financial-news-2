China â€™s yuan forwards strengthened
for a fifth day after the central bank raised reserve
requirements for banks and set a record reference rate for the
currency.  The 12-month non-deliverable forward gained 0.04 percent to
6.4340 per dollar as of 9:28 a.m. in  Hong Kong , reflecting bets
the yuan will strengthen 2 percent in a year. The daily
reference rate was set 0.06 percent stronger at 6.5592.  Editor: Andrew Janes  To contact the reporter on this story:
