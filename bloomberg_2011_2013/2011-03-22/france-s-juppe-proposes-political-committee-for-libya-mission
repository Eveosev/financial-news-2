French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe
proposed a political steering committee among countries involved
in the military operations in  Libya .  “I’ve proposed to our British colleagues, who are in
agreement, to create a political-steering operation that would
unite the foreign ministers of the states involved as well as
the  Arab League ,” Juppe told lawmakers today in Paris,
according to Agence France Presse.  Discussions about such a panel are ongoing and details will
not be made public until agreement has been reached, a
spokeswoman for the U.K.’s Foreign Office said in a telephone
interview.  Juppe said the first meeting could be in Brussels,  London 
or Paris, and followed up with regular gatherings.  He reiterated that the military command of the mission
should use the planning capabilities of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization without being dubbed a NATO mission, which
might deter participation by non-member Arab states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
