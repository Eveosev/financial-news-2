The following is a list of
companies that may have unusual share-price changes in U.K. and
Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses and prices are
from the last market close.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 23.38 points, or 0.4
percent, to 5,762.71. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  dropped 0.4
percent while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated 0.6 percent.  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  : The Dublin-based,
government-controlled lender said it will pay a coupon due today
on a 400 million euro ($567 million) lower tier 2 bond. The
stock declined 0.5 percent to 19.9 euro cents.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC LN): The London-
based producer of metals in  Kazakhstan  said full-year profit
more than doubled as prices rose, spurring the company to expand
abroad. The shares fell 1.2 percent to 898.5 pence.  Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO)  : The mining company with operations
in Ukraine said the 2011 financial year has “started well with
continued strong demand” for its products. The stock advanced
0.1 percent to 402.5 pence.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  :  Europe ’s biggest oil
company found natural gas after drilling wells on shale deposits
in  China ’s Szechuan province, said Ceri Powell, the company’s
executive vice president of international exploration. The
shares gained 0.3 percent to 2,180 pence.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  : The U.K.’s third-largest
supermarket owner said sales slowed more than analysts
anticipated in the fiscal fourth quarter as the threat of
government cuts and higher fuel costs weighed on consumers.  Revenue at stores open at least a year, including value-
added tax and excluding gasoline sales, rose 1 percent in the 10
weeks through March 19. That was less than the 3.6 percent
increase in the third quarter and missed the 2.1 percent median
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares
fell 0.9 percent to 354.3 pence.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO LN): The world’s third-largest mining
company increased its holding in Australia’s Riversdale Mining

statement. The shares fell 1.1 percent to 4,013.5 pence.  Smiths Group Plc (SMIN)  : The world’s biggest maker of
airport-security scanners reported a 15 percent increase in
first-half operating profit to 239 million pounds ($390
million). Analysts at Deutsche Bank AG estimated 232 million
pounds in so-called headline operating profit. The stock
retreated 2 percent to 1,307 pence.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  : Macintosh Retail Group NV
intends to sell its BelCompany stores to Vodafone for 120
million euros, the Dutch company said. Vodafone fell 0.9 percent
to 174.5 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
