Irish and Greek two-year notes
sank, leading the securities of  Europe ’s most indebted nations
lower, on concern European Union leaders are struggling to find
an immediate solution to the region’s fiscal crisis.  The losses left Irish two-year notes yielding more than
those that mature in 10 years, while Greek two-year yields
jumped by the most since March 9. EU finance chiefs settled
yesterday on how to enable a permanent rescue fund to lend 500
billion euros ($712 billion) as of 2013, while remaining divided
over how to get the current stopgap fund to its full capacity.  “They haven’t really reached an agreement on the current
mechanism,” said Elwin de Groot, a senior market economist at
Rabobank Groep in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “It’s small steps
at a time. There’s still a lot of uncertainty.”  The yield on the Irish two-year note surged 88 basis points
to 10.13 percent as of 1:41 p.m. in  London , after reaching 10.18
percent, the most since 2003, when Bloomberg began collecting
the data. That pushed the shorter-dated security’s yield to 24
basis points above the 10-year bond.  Greece ’s two-year yield
advanced 41 basis points to 14.85 percent, after climbing to
14.91 percent.  The cost of insuring against an Irish default with credit
default swaps rose 33 basis points to 620 basis points.  German bonds fell after European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  repeated yesterday that he may raise
interests rates as soon as next month.  The 10-year bund yield rose four basis points to 3.27
percent, while the yield on the two-year note was little changed
at 1.73 percent.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 0.5
percent since the end of February, compared with a return of 0.5
percent for Treasuries, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Irish debt lost 1.5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
