The population in Detroit plunged
25 percent during the last decade, falling to the lowest level
since 1910, according to 2010 Census figures.  The number of city residents fell to 713,777 last year,
compared with 951,270 in 2000, the  U.S. Census Bureau  said today
in  Washington . The white population plunged 44.4 percent and the
number of black residents fell 24 percent.  “It’s not just white flight anymore, it’s black movement
to the suburbs,” said  William Frey , a demographer at the
Washington-based  Brookings Institution . “Part of it is younger
people leaving. The city isn’t where they want to be anymore.
There are opportunities in the suburbs.”  Today’s figures showed that the number of Asian residents
fell 18.6 percent to 7,436 in Detroit, while the Hispanic
population gained 3.2 percent.  The white population fell to 55,604 and the number of black
residents declined to 586,573. The city-wide decline translates
to 65 residents leaving every day from 2000 to 2010.  Detroit ’s overall population has fallen steadily since
1950, when it peaked at 1.8 million. Michigan’s population fell
0.6 percent in the last decade to 9,883,640, census data show.
Michigan is the only state in the U.S. to lose population in the
past decade.  ‘Rough Times’  “The city’s had some rough times before in terms of
population,” Frey said. “It actually lost more people in the
1970s. They’ve lost half of their white population for each of
the last four censuses.”  Foreclosures have contributed to decline, as recently as
last year. Detroit ranked third in the U.S. for homes
repossessed by lenders, according to RealtyTrac Inc., the
Irvine, California-based data provider.  The white and black flight from Detroit outpaces similar
declines in  Cleveland , Pittsburgh and  St. Louis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
