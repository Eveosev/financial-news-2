Turkish companies had $9 billion of
orders in  Libya  over the next two to three years and may lose
the business due to the military intervention there, Milliyet
said citing Ersin Takla, head of a Turkish-Libyan business
group.  Libya had invited some Turkish firms back to the country
after winning battles against opposition forces and they were
awaiting confirmation from the government in  Turkey  that it was
safe to return, Takla said, according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper.       Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
