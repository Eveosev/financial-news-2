European stocks rose, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index heading for its longest winning streak in
more than a month. Asian stocks gained and U.S. index futures
were little changed.  Sanofi-Aventis SA fell 0.6 percent after terminating its
plan with Merck & Co. to combine the companies’ animal health
businesses. Rio Tinto Group, the second-largest iron ore
exporter, dropped 0.3 percent after saying  Japan ’s earthquake
may affect the company’s iron ore expansion plans. Baloise
Holding AG climbed 0.8 percent after reporting higher profit.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 0.1 percent to 272.64 at 8:10 a.m. in
 London . The index tumbled the most in eight months last week
after Japan’s March 11 earthquake damaged cooling systems at an
atomic power plant, causing the worst nuclear accident since
Chernobyl. The benchmark has gained 3.9 percent over the
previous three trading days amid signs that Japan will avoid a
nuclear meltdown and as the U.K., the U.S. and  France  began an
air campaign over Libya.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
