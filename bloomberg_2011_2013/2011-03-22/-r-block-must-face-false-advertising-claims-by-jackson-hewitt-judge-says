H&R Block Inc. (HRB)  lost a bid to get a
lawsuit dismissed that was brought by  Jackson Hewitt Tax Service
Inc. (JTX) , the second-largest U.S. tax preparer, accusing its
competitor of making “false and misleading” claims about
errors in returns prepared by Jackson Hewitt.  Jackson Hewitt alleged that its larger rival made a
“highly material and false and disparaging advertising claim”
that it “found errors in two out of three Jackson Hewitt tax
returns,” according to the complaint.  In a one-page order today, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in Manhattan wrote that Parsippany, New Jersey-
based Jackson Hewitt should be allowed to seek further evidence
on the issues and that “plaintifff has alleged sufficient
allegations to survive the motion to dismiss” by H&R Block.  The claims were made in connection with the “Second Look
Review” service of H&R Block, the biggest U.S. tax preparer,
which reviews customers’ past tax returns prepared by other
companies, according to the complaint.  The suit asks the court to bar H&R Block from making the
allegedly false claims, plus unspecified damages.  “H&R Block stands behind our advertisements and will
vigorously defend our claims,” Kate O’Neill Rauber, a
spokeswoman for  Kansas City , Missouri-based H&R Block, said in a
statement.  The case is Jackson Hewitt Inc. v. H&R Block Tax Services
LLC, 11-cv-00641, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
