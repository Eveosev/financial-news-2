Datang International Power
Generation Co., a unit of  China ’s second-biggest electricity
producer, said profit rose 76 percent last year as demand for
power gained in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net income climbed to 2.47 billion yuan ($377 million), or
0.2031 yuan per share, from a restated 1.4 billion yuan, or
0.1192 yuan, a year earlier, according to a statement today in
line with domestic accounting standards. That compares with a
mean estimate of 2.2 billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey of 15
analysts.  “China’s economic growth will remain positive in 2011,
increasing the country’s electricity,” Datang said in the
statement. Datang Power plans to increase sales by more than 15
percent this year.  China’s economy  expanded 10.3 percent in 2010, the fastest
pace in three years, boosting power demand by businesses and
households. Datang increased generation 26 percent in 2010
because of higher capacity and demand, it said in January.
Electricity use in China may rise 9 percent to 4.5 trillion
kilowatt-hours this year, the National Energy Administration
said Jan. 28.  Demand for thermal and hydroelectric power generation may
be supported by slower growth in nuclear energy following damage
to  Japan ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami, Yang Fan, an analyst at Citic Securities Co., wrote
in a report March 17. China temporarily stopped approving new
nuclear projects and said it’ll review safety at existing
plants.  Datang, part of China Datang Corp., generates all of its
electricity at coal-fired, hydroelectric and wind power
stations. It is part of a group building the Ningde nuclear
project in  Fujian province , according to its website.  The company’s shares rose 2 percent to HK$2.75 in  Hong Kong 
trading today before the earnings announcement. The stock has
fallen 0.4 percent this year compared with a drop of 2 percent
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
