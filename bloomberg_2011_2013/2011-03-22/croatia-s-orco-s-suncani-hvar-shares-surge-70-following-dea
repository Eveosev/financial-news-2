Shares of  Suncani Hvar d.d. (SUNHRA)  surged
70 percent in the last three days following an agreement last
week between the resort’s joint shareholders  Orco Property Group (ORC) 
SA and the  Croatian government .  The Adriatic Sea resort’s stock opened today at 69 kuna
($13) per share on the Zagreb stock exchange, the highest since
November 2008, after the parties reached an agreement on March
15 to capitalize their loans and ease the Suncani Hvar’s debt
burden.  Luxembourg-based Orco signed an agreement with the Croatian
Privatization Fund five years ago to transform 10 socialist-era
hotels on the trendy Hvar island into a five-star resort. Orco
invested 355 million kuna ($68.5 million) in the resort, and
took loans worth 390 million kuna to renovate it. Orco owns 55
percent of the resort, while the state has 31 percent.  “The ownership structure between the two shareholders will
remain unchanged” following the capitalization, Marija Hrebac,
head of Orco projects in  Croatia , said in a phone interview
today.  The agreement, in which the shareholders’ loans equalling
41.2 million kuna will be swapped for equity, has to be
confirmed by the shareholders’ general assembly, scheduled for
April 29 in the capital city Zagreb, Hrebac said.  As part of the agreement, Croatia said it will “increase
its efforts” to help clear the property’s land deeds, some of
which have not been updated since World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
