U.K. government bonds extended a
decline after inflation accelerated at a faster pace than
analysts estimated and Britainâ€™s budget deficit unexpectedly
widened.  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose seven basis points to
3.60 percent as of 9:33 a.m. in  London  and the two-year note
also increased seven basis points, to 1.29 percent.  U.K. inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in more than
two years in February, with consumer prices rising 4.4 percent
from a year earlier, exceeding the 4.2 percent median estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net borrowing last month was 11.8 billion pounds ($19.3
billion) in February, compared with analyst estimates for 7.2
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
