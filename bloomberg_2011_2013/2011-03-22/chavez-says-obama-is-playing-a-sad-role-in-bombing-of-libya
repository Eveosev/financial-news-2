U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s
intervention in Libya clashes with his status as a Nobel Peace
Prize winner, Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said.  “The president of the United States is playing a sad role
and meanwhile his government is already involved in five wars
and is now opening a new front of war and bombs,” Chavez said
in comments carried on state television.  The U.S. and its allies bombed targets belonging to forces
loyal to Colonel  Muammar Qaddafi  for a third day after the
United Nations Security Council approved a resolution to enforce
a no-fly zone over Libya.  Chavez, who has compared the Libyan leader to Latin
American liberation hero Simon Bolivar, offered to mediate
earlier this month in the Libyan crisis that has divided the
North African country and sent  oil prices  surging.  Chavez criticized Obama’s speech in Santiago, Chile, saying
it left a “lot to be desired as regards to the seriousness of
the U.S. Government.”  “Venezuelan demands that imperial aggressions end, the
bombs and death against and innocent people and that a UN
commission be named to go to Libya to negotiate, and end to the
fire to end the civil war and that the Libyan people define
freely their own destiny,” Chavez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
