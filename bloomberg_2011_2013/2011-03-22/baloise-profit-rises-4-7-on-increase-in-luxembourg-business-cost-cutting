Baloise Holding AG (BALN) ,  Switzerland ’s
third-largest insurer, said full-year profit rose 4.7 percent as
earnings from Luxembourg increased and it cut costs.  Net income climbed to 433.4 million Swiss francs ($480
million) from 414.1 million francs a year earlier, the Basel-
based company said today in a statement. The mean estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 458 million francs.  Baloise said it’s almost half way through a program to add
200 million francs to annual earnings by 2012. The insurer will
continue to target a return on equity of 15 percent, it said.  “The result includes some one-offs but underlying earnings
trends appear quite sound,” Stefan Schuermann, a Zurich-based
analyst with Vontobel, said in a note to investors. “Pretax
profit of 607 million francs is solid.”  Baloise rose 0.7 percent to 95.75 francs as of 9:50 a.m. in
Zurich trading, valuing the company at 4.79 billion francs. The
stock has gained 5.2 percent this year.  The business volume in Luxembourg rose 32 percent to 1.27
billion francs after Baloise acquired Fortis Luxembourg IARD SA
and sold more investment-type  life insurance , the company said.  The insurer’s combined ratio, or spending on claims and
costs as a percentage of premiums, worsened to 95.2 percent from
94.4 percent a year earlier after Baloise booked 84 million
francs of charges for mainly weather-related claims in excess of
400 million francs.  ‘Economic Uncertainty’  “Baloise anticipates continued volatility in the financial
markets and general economic uncertainty,” the company said in
the statement. “Baloise is therefore cautious in its
forecasts.”  The company plans to keep its dividend unchanged at 4.50
francs a share.  Premium income at Baloise’s Swiss unit, the company’s
biggest, increased 4.8 percent to 4.09 billion francs last year.
Baloise said it has appointed Michael Mueller to head the unit,
replacing Olav Noack who left “owing to differences of opinion
regarding leadership issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
