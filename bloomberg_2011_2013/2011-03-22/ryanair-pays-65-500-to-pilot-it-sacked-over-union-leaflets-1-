Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  agreed to pay
40,000 pounds ($65,500) to a pilot sacked for distributing
trade-union literature to cabin crew during a flight, the
British Airline Pilots’ Association said today.  Captain  James Anderson  filed an unfair dismissal claim
after he was fired by Ryanair,  Europe ’s biggest discount
airline, for “gross misconduct” following the incident. The case
was settled prior to an employment tribunal hearing in London.  “We regard this as a significant victory, as a wonderful
result,” John Stembridge-King, Balpa’s head of organization,
said outside the hearing.  Ryanair had said that Anderson, 45, endangered passenger
safety by handing the leaflets to flight attendants while the
plane was en route from London’s Stansted airport to Majorca.
Balpa said it planned to tell the tribunal the plane was on
autopilot, and that it was safe for the pilot to talk with crew.  Dublin-based Ryanair said it’s “very pleased” with the
settlement, which was equivalent to less than one day of legal
fees when it had expected the hearing to last three days.  “We wish our former pilot every success for the future,”
Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
