Mali, the landlocked West African
nation, is developing a 14,000-hectare (34,600-acre)
plantation to grow rice and help the country achieve self-
sufficiency in  food production , said President Amadou Toumani Toure.  The project, near the town of Soala located 500 kilometers
(311 miles) from the capital, Bamako, will cost 19 billion  CFA
francs  ($39 million) and will create 45,000 jobs, he said on
state-owned television Sept. 10. Grass for animal feeding will
also be planted, Toure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
