OAO Gazprom management board agreed
today to increase its 2011 capital-spending target to as much as
1.3 trillion rubles ($43 billion), Interfax reported, citing
unidentified person at the Russian natural gas producer.  The plan for this year’s spending target was raised from
816 billion rubles to a range of 1.2 trillion rubles to 1.3
trillion rubles, the Moscow-based newswire said. The decision
has yet to be approved by Gazprom’s director board, Interfax
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
