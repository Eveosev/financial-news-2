The  California  Public Employees
Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension plan, agreed
to spend more of its money on infrastructure in the state.  The fund’s 13-member board voted today to invest up to $800
million in public and private projects involving transportation,
energy, natural resources, utilities, water and communications
in California during the next three years.  Calpers already planned to use about 2 percent of its
$225.4 billion portfolio on developing such things as airports,
roads and utilities including  power plants  as a way to hedge
against inflation. Of that, three-fifths will be invested in the
U.S. Of that domestic portion, 20 percent will be used
California.  “We are prepared to increase our investments in
infrastructure with our first and foremost goal being on
investment returns, and a secondary goal of supporting essential
community services that are crucial to continued economic
development, a safe environment and healthy schools and
communities,”  Rob Feckner , the board’s president, said in a
statement.  Calpers in July said it earned a return of 20.7 percent in
the 12 months through June, its best result in 14 years, led by
gains in stocks and private equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
