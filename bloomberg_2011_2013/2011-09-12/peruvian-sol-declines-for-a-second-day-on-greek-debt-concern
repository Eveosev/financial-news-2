Peru’s sol fell for a second day as
concern  Greece  is moving closer to a debt default hurt demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol dropped 0.2 percent to 2.7335 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:41 p.m. New York time, from 2.7272 on Sept. 9.  Officials in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government
are debating how to shore up German banks should Greece fail to
meet budget-cutting terms of its aid package, three coalition
officials said Sept. 9. Greece’s chance of default in the next
five years has soared to 98 percent as Prime Minister  George Papandreou  fails to reassure international investors that his
country can survive the euro-region crisis.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.44 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.25 centimo to
116.67 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
