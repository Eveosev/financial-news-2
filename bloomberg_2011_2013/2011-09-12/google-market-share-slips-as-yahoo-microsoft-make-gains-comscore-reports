Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s share of online
searches in the U.S. slipped during August from July, while
rivals Yahoo! Inc. and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  gained, according to
research firm ComScore Inc.  Google had 64.8 percent of U.S. searches last month, down
from 65.1 percent in July, according to  ComScore . It was the
second-straight month of decline, following no change in June.
Yahoo climbed to 16.3 percent, up from 16.1 percent, rising for
a second month in a row. Microsoft, meanwhile, increased to 14.7
percent from 14.4 percent.  Yahoo and Microsoft teamed up last year in the search
market, providing a bigger threat to Google’s dominance. Under
the companies’ 10-year  agreement , Microsoft handles Internet
queries for Yahoo pages. Microsoft, which released a revamped
search engine named Bing in 2009, also has rolled out a
multimedia advertising campaign to attract users and is
bolstering results by displaying data from Facebook Inc.  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , continues to
enhance its own features. In June, the company unveiled a
feature called Instant Pages that gives users of its Chrome
browser quicker connections from links on query results. The
change is designed to cut 2 to 5 seconds from the process.
Google got most of its $29.3 billion in revenue last year from
search advertising.  Google’s shares rose $5.27 to $530.12 at 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yahoo fell 22 cents $14.26,
while Microsoft climbed 15 cents to $25.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
