A unit of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
was fined by the Central Bank of Ireland for breaching rules on
counterparty risk assessment.  Goldman Sachs Bank ( Europe ) Plc was fined 160,000 euros
($218,000), the Dublin-based  central bank  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company incorrectly calculated its
regulatory  capital requirements  between July 16, 2008 and Dec.
17, 2010, the central bank said.  “The reliance on automated systems should be tempered by
adequate oversight to ensure that systems and controls are, and
continue to be, comprehensive and proportionate,” Peter Oakes,
director of enforcement at the central bank, said in an e-mail.  The error in working out the counterparty risk capital
requirement didn’t result in any breach of the capital adequacy
ratios, the central bank said. No counterparties were impacted.
Goldman Sachs has taken remedial action to fix the breaches and
the matter is closed, the central bank said.  The firm disclosed the errors in calculations to the
central bank on Dec. 13, according to today’s statement.  “We are pleased this matter has been resolved,” Joanna Carss, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, in  London , said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
