Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures rose in  New York  after the euro rebounded
from a six-month low, increasing the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment to the  U.S. dollar .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 43.5 percent at 3 p.m. in New York,
down from 43.6 Sept. 9.  Oil for October delivery rose 95 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
settle at $88.19 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the first gain in three days. Prices have fallen 3.5 percent
this year and rose 0.9 percent last week.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $90 calls, with 2,401 lots changing hands. The options
fell 6 cents to 79 cents a barrel. October $83 puts, the next-
most active contract, dropped 45 cents to 31 cents a barrel with
2,015 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  October options expire Sept. 15.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $80 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,479 lots changing hands. They rose 6
cents to 39 cents a barrel. The next-most-active options,
October $86 puts, advanced 40 cents to $1.54 a barrel on volume
of 5,305.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
50,936 contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 46,630 and
December $50 puts with 46,566.  To contact the reporter on this story:
