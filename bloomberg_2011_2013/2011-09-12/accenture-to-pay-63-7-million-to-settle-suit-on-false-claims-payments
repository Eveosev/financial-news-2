Accenture LLP agreed to pay the
U.S. about $63.7 million to resolve charges tied to false claims
for payment under numerous information-technology services
contracts with U.S. agencies, the  Justice Department   said .  The accord ends a whistle-blower lawsuit against the
technology consulting firm filed under seal in federal court in
Little Rock, Arkansas in 2004. The U.S. joined the case in 2007.  “Accenture has agreed to resolve allegations that it
received kickbacks for its recommendations of hardware and
software to the government, fraudulently inflated prices and
rigged bids in connection with federal information technology
contracts,” the Justice Department said today in a statement.  Accenture LLP is a U.S.-based unit of Dublin-based
 Accenture PLC (ACN) , which employs more than 223,000 people in
120 countries, according to its  website . It had revenue of $35.4
billion for the year ended Aug. 31, 2010, according to Bloomberg
data.  Accenture, in a statement, denied any wrong-doing.  “Accenture’s alliance agreements with IT vendors were
disclosed in proposals made to our U.S. government clients,”
the company said. “Accenture remains confident that our
agreements and dealings with our alliance partners and vendors
were appropriate and lawful.”  The case is U.S. ex rel Rille v. Accenture LLP, 04-cv-985,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Arkansas  (Little Rock).  To contact the reporter on this story:
