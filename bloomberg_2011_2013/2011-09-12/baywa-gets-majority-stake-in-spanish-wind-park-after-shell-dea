BayWa AG (BYW) , the German agricultural
products and building-materials maker, more than doubled its
holding in Spain’s La Muela wind park after buying a stake from
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   BayWa, based in Munich, now holds 73 percent of the 99-
megawatt project, compared with 33 percent previously, Marion
Danneboom, a company spokeswoman, said today by telephone,
without disclosing financial terms.  BayWa said Aug. 4 it would invest 250 million euros ($341
million) in its renewable-energy division to develop and sell
solar, wind and biogas plants to investors in  Europe , the U.S.
and North Africa. The company targets renewable-energy sales of
1 billion euros a year in the “medium term,” Danneboom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
