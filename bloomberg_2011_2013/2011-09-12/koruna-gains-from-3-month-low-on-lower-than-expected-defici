The koruna advanced from its
weakest level in more than three months against the euro as a
report showed the Czech current-account deficit widened less
than estimated.  The koruna appreciated 0.3 percent to 24.467 per euro as of
10:27 a.m. in Prague. Last week it slid to the weakest since
June 2. The advance pares this quarter’s loss to 0.5 percent,
the second-smallest among nine emerging-market currencies of
East Europe and  Africa  tracked by Bloomberg, behind the
Icelandic krona.  The Czech current-account deficit reached 12.8 billion
koruna ($1.11 billion) in July, lower than a gap of 20 billion
koruna predicted in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists. A
deficit represents money the  Czech Republic  has to borrow
overseas to pay for the goods and services it imports and to
finance investment not covered by local savings.  The smaller-than-predicted widening of the deficit “could
help the Czech koruna to recover some of the Friday losses
against the euro,” BNP Paribas SA emerging-market strategists
including Bartosz Pawlowski in  London  wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
