Umeme Ltd.,  Uganda â€™s main power
distributor, is planning an initial public offering in which its
shares will begin trading on the stock exchanges of Uganda and
neighboring Kenya, Business Daily reported.  The company, which has yet to obtain regulatory approval,
plans to have the listings by March, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing Managing Director Charles Chapman.   Actis Capital Ltd., the London-based private-equity firm,
took control of Umeme in November 2009, Business Daily said.  Umeme holds a 20-year distribution concession in the East
African nation until 2025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
