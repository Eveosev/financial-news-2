Refining margins for  fuel oil  and
gasoil in  Asia  rose amid speculation that refinery maintenance
in Russia will limit supplies. Profits from making naphtha fell.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 37 cents, or
6.2 percent, to $5.59 a barrel at 11:31 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The spread, which
measures refining losses from the fuel, was at the narrowest in
more than two weeks.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps fell $19.50, or 2.9 percent, to
$645.50 a ton, PVM data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was at $10 a ton, rising 25 cents from a week
earlier.  About 1.3 million to 1.4 million barrels a day of crude
refining capacity in  Russia  may be shut for maintenance from
September, Priya Narain Balchandani, a Singapore-based analyst
at Standard Chartered Plc, said in a Sept. 8 report.
“Extraordinarily high refinery turnarounds” will strengthen
the fuel oil crack in the near term, she said.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
