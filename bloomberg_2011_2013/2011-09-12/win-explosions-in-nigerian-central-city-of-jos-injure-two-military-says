Two people were wounded in twin
bomb attacks late yesterday in  Nigeria ’s central city of  Jos , a
region racked by violence between Christian and Muslim ethnic
groups, a military spokesman said.  “Two people were wounded, but no death was recorded,”
Charles Ekeocha, a spokesman for the military  task force  in the
area, said today by phone from the city. The explosions took
place in the Plateau state capital’s West of Mines open-air
site, a popular area with bars and shops.  Nigerian authorities blame Boko Haram, a militant Islamic
group inspired by  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a wave of
bombings and killings since last year. The group claimed
responsibility for the Aug. 26 suicide car-bomb attack on a
United Nations building that claimed 23 lives and wounded 71 in
the capital, Abuja, and multiple blasts on Christmas Eve in Jos
that killed 80 people.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
