India ’s rupee tumbled the most in
15 months as a government report showed industrial production
grew in July at the slowest pace in almost two years.  The currency slid for a sixth day, the longest losing
streak in a month, as the statistics office said factory output
rose 3.3 percent from a year earlier, after an 8.8 percent gain
in June. The median forecast of 26 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 6.2 percent increase. The rupee slid past
47 per dollar for the first time since August 2010 as global
funds favored the dollar’s relative safety over emerging-market
assets on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  “The data showed  India’s economy  is slowing and it does
seem that there is further downside in growth momentum,” said
 Manik Narain , a foreign-exchange strategist in  London  at UBS AG.
“We think the rupee could come under further pressure in the
near term.”  The rupee fell 1.4 percent to 47.215 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the steepest drop since June 1, 2010. The currency
earlier touched 47.23, the weakest level since July 22, 2010. It
has lost 5.3 percent this year, the worst performance among the
10 most-traded Asian exchange rates.  Dollar Strength  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six major trading partners, climbed to the highest
level since February.  Germany ’s government is preparing plans to
shore up the nation’s banks in the event that Greece defaults on
its debt, three coalition officials said on Sept. 9.  “The rupee’s performance is driven by the dollar’s
strength against major currencies,” said J. Moses Harding, an
executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 47.73 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 47.11
on Sept. 9. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
