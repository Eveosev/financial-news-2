Italian officials have held talks
with Chinese counterparts about potential investments in the
euro regionâ€™s third-largest economy, an Italian government
official said.   The purchase of Italian bonds by  China  was not the focus of
the talks, which took place in the past few weeks, the official
said on condition of anonymity. A spokesman for Italian Finance
Minister  Giulio Tremonti  declined to comment.   The Financial Times earlier reported that Italy aims to sell
``significant'' quantities of bonds and stakes in strategic 
companies to China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
