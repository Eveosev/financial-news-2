Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, said prices for its DeKalb brand of corn seeds
will rise next year by an average of 5 percent to 10 percent
because of improved performance and higher production costs.  The price increase reflects higher-yielding genetics and
more sales of biotechnology, including the newest insecticide-
producing crops, Executive Vice President Brett Begemann said
today on a conference call. Monsanto also needs to recoup
payments to seed growers, which are rising with corn prices, he
said.  Higher prices will help the St. Louis-based company achieve
its goal of boosting earnings 13 percent to 17 percent a year,
Begemann said. Monsanto gained share in U.S. corn this year and
didn’t lose share in soybeans, he said. The company hasn’t
gained in those markets in three years. Monsanto this year
lowered prices after farmers increased purchases from DuPont
Co.’s Pioneer unit.  Monsanto will have enough seed for next year after
overcoming drought and other weather issues through contracts
with growers in a wide geographic area, Begemann said. It also
plans to raise seed in  Latin America , he said. The higher cost
of production is within the company’s assumptions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
