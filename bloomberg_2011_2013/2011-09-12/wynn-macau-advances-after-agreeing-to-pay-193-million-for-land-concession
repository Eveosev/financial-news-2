Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , Asia’s second-
largest casino company by market value, said it has agreed to
pay the Macau government 1.55 billion patacas ($193 million) as
a premium for 51 acres in the Chinese city.  The land concession contract allows the construction of a
resort on the 51-acre Cotai property that can include gambling
and retailing,  Wynn Macau  said in a  statement  to Hong Kong’s
stock exchange today. The rent was set at 6.17 million patacas a
year, it said in the filing.  The contract may allow Wynn Macau to open a new casino in
2015 at the earliest, Karen Tang, an analyst at Deutsche Bank
AG, said in a note to clients today. Still, the company may face
“downside risks” as the slowing economies in Europe and the
U.S. may hurt China’s manufacturing business in southern
 Guangdong province  from where many high-stake players come, Tang
said.  Wynn Macau fell 4.1 percent to close at HK$23.70 in Hong
Kong as the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  slid 4.2 percent. The
stock earlier gained as much as 3.6 percent in morning trading
before slumping as much as 10 percent in the afternoon.  Rival casino operators also plunged today. Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. declined 9.2 percent, the most since
Aug. 19, to close at HK$15.82. MGM China Holdings Ltd. dropped 8
percent and  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  fell 4.3 percent.  Casino gambling revenue in the former Portuguese colony of
Macau  rose  47 percent to 173 billion patacas in the eight months
through August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
