Russia ’s RTS futures rose,
indicating the measure may rebound from a one-month low, as the
board of metals producer OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel said it may buy
back shares at a $57 premium, offsetting concern that  Greece 
will default and deepen the global economic slowdown.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September rose 1.1 percent to 158,590 yesterday. The RTS Index
in Moscow lost 3.6 percent, its biggest decline in three weeks,
to 1,566.64, the lowest level since Aug. 11. The 30-stock  Micex
Index (INDEXCF)  lost 1.7 percent to 1,493.19, a one-week low. The
Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index of Russian companies traded in New
York fell for a third day, sliding 0.1 percent to 280.1246. The
Micex may climb 1 percent at the start of trading, according to
 Alfa Bank .  Norilsk, the world’s largest nickel producer, may offer
$306 a share to buy as much as $4.5 billion of stock back on the
market, the Moscow-based company said in a statement on its
website on Sept. 8. Concern Greece may be on the verge of not
being able to fulfill debt repayments was also muted by
speculation  China  is in talks to invest in  Italy , the euro
region’s third-largest economy.  “Norilsk’s buyback helped to offset the decline as their
buyback is being closely watched by investors,” Yan Gloukhovski, a trader at Alforma Capital Markets, the New York
branch of Alfa Bank, Russia’s biggest private lender, said in a
phone interview. “The focus, though, is on  Europe , so anything
that alleviates the European debt situation becomes the main
driver for the market.”  Gazprom, CTC Media  Italian officials have held talks with Chinese counterparts
about potential investments, an Italian government official said
on condition of anonymity. A spokesman for Italian Finance
Minister  Giulio Tremonti  declined to comment. Euro-area
countries must avoid an “uncontrolled insolvency” in Greece
because it is likely that this would affect all other countries,
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said in an interview with rbb-
Inforadio today.  American depositary receipts of Norilsk surged 4.6 percent
to $25.30, the highest level since Aug. 3. On the Micex, the
stock gained 2.1 percent to 7,542 rubles, the equivalent of
$248.60. Norilsk’s board will consider the buyback at a Sept. 13
meeting, the statement last week said. They may offer $30.60 per
depositary receipt.  OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas exporter,
pared an earlier decline of as much as 2.5 percent to close down
0.5 percent at $11.01. Crude oil for October delivery advanced
1.1 percent to settle at $88.19 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Urals crude, Russia’s chief export oil
blend, was little changed at $114.23 after earlier dropping as
much as 1.7 percent.  Volatility Falls  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , the U.S.-listed Russian television network,
plunged the most in almost two years after the Moscow-based
company cut its forecast for revenue growth to 15 percent from
20 percent because of lower-than-anticipated audience share. CTC
plunged 14 percent to $11.70, a two-year low.  A reduction in advertising spending by Russian consumer
companies because of the country’s slowing economy was behind
the forecast revision, Gloukhovski said.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, gained 0.7 percent to $31.28, while the
Bank of New York Mellon Russia ADR Index dropped for a third
trading day, losing 0.3 percent.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the index futures fell, dropping 3.4 percent to 50.68 points.
One index point equals $20.  The Micex has slumped 12 percent this year and trades at
5.6 times analysts’ earnings estimates. That compares with a 20
percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index, which trades at 9.5
times estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 11.4 times
estimated earnings, and  India ’s BSE India Sensitive Index has a
ratio of 14.  The euro traded at $1.3678 as of 1:10 a.m. Hong Kong time,
from $1.3679 yesterday, when it touched $1.3495, the weakest
since Feb. 16. Russia’s ruble weakened 0.7 percent to 30.2750
per dollar in Moscow, the weakest level since January, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
