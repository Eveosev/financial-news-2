China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068) , a meat
processor, fell to its lowest close in two years in Hong Kong
trading as a statement addressing a newspaper report about its
tainted pork products failed to allay investor concerns.  Shares of China Yurun, the nation’s second-biggest listed
food processor, fell 5.2 percent to HK$13.42 at the close, the
lowest since September 2009, after tumbling 22 percent last
week. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 4.2 percent today.  “Food and beverage shares are very sensitive,” said
Masahiko Ejiri, a Tokyo-based  fund manager  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees $41 billion, including shares in
Hong Kong-listed companies. “Once they lose their reputation,
it’s difficult for us to invest in them again. It becomes hard
for us to see them in the same way.”  National Business Daily reported that some of China Yurun’s
pork products contained an illegal additive, citing an
unidentified employee. China Yurun, based in the eastern city of
Nanjing, issued a statement on Sept. 9 saying a single hog from
a supplier tested positive for the substance and was destroyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
