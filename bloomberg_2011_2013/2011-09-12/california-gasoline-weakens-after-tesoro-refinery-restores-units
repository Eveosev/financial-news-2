California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  weakened for the first time in three days after  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO)  said its Wilmington refinery was operating at targeted
rates following a power failure last week.  The premium for Carbob in Los Angeles narrowed 6.5 cents to
a premium of 14.75 cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:06 p.m. East Coast
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 10.05 cents to $2.883 a gallon.  Tesoro’s 97,000-barrel-a-day Wilmington refinery, south of
Los Angeles, restored units affected by the Sept. 8 power
failure, Mike Marcy, a spokesman for the San Antonio-based
company, said in an e-mail. The refinery reported a spill
yesterday of diethanolamine, used to remove sour gases from
liquid hydrocarbons, from a corroded line at the plant.  “The line was blocked in and repairs have been
undertaken,” said Marcy, who is based in Martinez,  California .
“There has been no impact on plant operations or upon Tesoro’s
ability to meet contracted regional product supply
commitments.”  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  fell 9.5 cents to
11.75 cents over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, was
unchanged at 24.25 cents a gallon over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
