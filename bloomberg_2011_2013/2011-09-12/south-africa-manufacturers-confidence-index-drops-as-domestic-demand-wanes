South African manufacturing
business confidence dropped in the third quarter as domestic
demand weakened and export orders fell, the Bureau for Economic
Research said.  The index fell to 36 from 51 in the second quarter, the
bureau, based at the University of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town ,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “After improving for two consecutive quarters, demand
conditions deteriorated notably” during the quarter, according
to the statement. “The rate of growth in domestic sales and
order volumes declined sharply, and came in well below what
manufacturers had expected.”  Manufacturing output, which makes up 15 percent of the
economy, contracted 6 percent in July from a year earlier, the
statistics office said on Sept. 8. The South African Reserve
Bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a 30-year
low of 5.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
