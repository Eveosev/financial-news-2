Croatian tourist arrivals rose 5.2
percent in July from a year ago, the Zagreb-based  statistics
office  said today in a statement on its website.  Tourism accounts for about 20 percent of gross domestic
product in the Adriatic Sea nation. It boosts consumption,
creates jobs and is vital to the government’s effort to narrow
its budget gap, forecast at 4.3 percent for 2011.  “Though the arrivals are on the rise, the real success of
the tourist season is measured by revenue and the global crisis
caused tourists to spend more carefully,” Zdeslav Santic, chief
analyst at Societe Generale - Splitska Banka d.d., said before
the data release.  Revenue from tourism may grow as much as 8 percent this
year, boosting the economy in the third quarter, Santic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
