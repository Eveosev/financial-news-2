Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind turbine
maker, won its first two orders in  Romania  and plans to set up
an office in the country to benefit from growth in the market.  The company sold eight 2.5-megawatt turbines and signed
service accords for two wind farms that will produce power this
year, Hamburg-based Nordex said in a statement today. Romania
has the potential for more than 3,000 megawatts of wind energy
capacity by the end of 2015, the turbine maker said.  “Our target is to achieve a significant market share,”
Lars Bondo Krogsgaard, Nordex’s chief sales officer, said in the
statement. “We plan to set up a branch in the coming months.”  Nordex, with a market value of almost 300 million euros
($400 million) also sees rising sales in Bulgaria and especially
 Poland , where it has connected 93 megawatts of capacity to the
grid and will install another 50 megawatts this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
