Spanish home sales declined the
most since April 2009 as austerity measures and  Europe â€™s highest
 unemployment rate  crimped demand for property.  The number of transactions fell 34.8 percent from a year
earlier, the fifth straight decline, the National Statistics
Institute in Madrid said today. That follows a 22.9 percent drop
in June.  Spain  is working through an excess of 700,000 unsold homes
left over from the debt-fueled housing boom. The highest
unemployment rate in Europe, at 21 percent, is curbing demand
for houses while banks are reining in lending amid a surge in
bad loans and higher borrowing costs.  Home sales fell 40.8 percent in the second quarter from a
year ago after declining 30.5 percent in the first three months
of the year, the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Housing
said on Sept. 8.  The number of Spanish mortgages for home purchases
decreased 42 percent in June from a year earlier, the sharpest
decline since January 2009, the National Statistics Institute
said on Aug. 29.  As part of efforts to reduce the stock of unsold property,
the government has lowered value-added tax on new homes to 4
percent from 8 percent for the remaining four months of the
year. The move is the second attempt to spur purchases with tax
incentives, after a plan to give Spaniards a year to buy houses
and lock in tax breaks prompted an eight-month increase in home
purchases that ended after the incentive was removed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
