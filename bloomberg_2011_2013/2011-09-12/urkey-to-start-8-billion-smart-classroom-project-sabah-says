The Turkish government will call an
auction this week for the first phase of an $8 billion project
to equip classrooms with smart boards and provide tablet devices
for students,  Sabah  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Bidders will be invited to provide 85,000 smart boards for
classrooms and 3,500 printers, scanners and other equipment in
the first phase, the newspaper said.  Locally made products will get preference, though their
prices may be as much as 15 percent higher than those of
foreign-made ones, to encourage international smart equipment
companies to manufacture in  Turkey , Sabah said.  The project, called Fatih, is to be completed in four
years, the newspaper said, adding that the aim is to supply 15
million tablets to schoolchildren in the second phase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
