JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said the U.S. should consider
withdrawing from the Basel group of global regulators and that
new international capital rules are “anti-American,” according
to the Financial Times.  “I’m very close to thinking the United States shouldn’t be
in Basel anymore,” Dimon said in an interview, the newspaper
reported today. “I would not have agreed to rules that are
blatantly anti-American.”  Dimon, 55, who leads the most profitable U.S. lender, has
criticized regulators for new global  capital requirements  under
Basel III and U.S. rules being formulated under the Dodd-Frank
Act. In June, Dimon took an unusual step in pressing Bernanke in
a public forum on whether regulators have overreached in reining
in the banking system and are slowing economic growth.  Dimon said that moves by the 27 member-states of the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision  to impose an additional charge
on the largest banks go too far, according to the FT. He also
criticized global liquidity rules as unfair, saying that
regulations view European covered bonds as highly liquid while
they discount U.S.-backed mortgage securities.  “Our regulators should go there and say, ‘If it’s not in
the interests of the United States, we’re not doing it,” Dimon
said, according to the newspaper.  Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
