TechCrunch blog founder Michael
Arrington, following a clash with parent company  AOL Inc. (AOL) , is
leaving to work on a new venture fund.  Erick Schonfeld will succeed Arrington as the top editor of
the technology-news site, AOL said today in a statement.  AOL, the New York-based Internet company struggling to
replace shrinking Web-access revenue with advertising sales,
bought TechCrunch in September 2010 as part of a broader effort
to acquire content. Arrington, writing on  TechCrunch  last week,
said that AOL wasn’t giving the blog the “editorial
independence” promised at the time of the acquisition.  AOL, in its statement, said that it has invested in
Arrington’s new venture fund. Arrington has raised $20 million
from AOL and venture capital firms including  Sequoia Capital ,
two people familiar with the plan said this month.  AOL, based in  New York , fell 3 cents to $14.75 at 4 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has dropped 38 percent
this year.  After the acquisition of TechCrunch, Arrington said he
planned to stay at AOL for at least three years. AOL paid $25
million for TechCrunch, people familiar with the matter said at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
