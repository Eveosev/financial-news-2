Nakheel PJSC, Dubai’s biggest
developer, told creditors it wrote down 78.6 billion dirhams
($21.4 billion) from the value of its real estate as property
prices in the emirate crashed.  The Dubai government-owned company wrote off 301.4 million
dirhams in the first half of last year, 73.8 billion dirhams in
2009 and a further 4.44 billion dirhams in 2008, according to
its Islamic bond prospectus issued last month and obtained by
Bloomberg News. After the write-offs, the company’s share
capital dropped to 10.6 billion dirhams in June 2010 from 87.1
billion dirhams in 2008. Nakheel declined to comment.  Dubai’s property market had one of the world’s biggest
reversals of fortune following the global credit crunch three
years ago, with Deutsche Bank AG saying  home prices  slumped 64
percent since their peak in mid-2008. Nakheel was forced to
reduce staff and halt work on projects including the man-made
islands of Deira and Jebel Ali.  Dubai World, Nakheel’s former parent and one of the
emirate’s three main state-controlled holding companies, roiled
global markets in November 2009 when it sought to stop
repayments on about $25 billion of debt. The company signed an
agreement with its creditors in March to restructure the debt.  Nakheel had a profit of 58.9 million dirhams in the first
half of 2010 compared with a loss of 13.4 billion dirhams a year
earlier, according to the prospectus. The company had a loss of
76.6 billion dirhams in 2009 and a profit of 505.3 million
dirhams in 2008, according to the document.  Liabilities  The company said Aug. 24 it would issue 3.8 billion dirhams
of Islamic bonds to its contractors and suppliers as the last
step in restructuring $16.1 billion of liabilities. Nakheel
plans to issue an additional 1 billion dirhams of the bond as
part of the 8.5 billion dirham program that it has set up.  The bonds, known as sukuk, pay a profit rate of 10 percent
and are being used to pay 60 percent of what’s owed to
contractors and suppliers. The remaining 40 percent is being
paid in cash.  Nakheel has total assets of 77.5 billion dirhams as of end
of June 2010. Emaar, Nakheel’s competitor and developer of the
world’s tallest tower in Dubai, has assets of 61.9 billion
dirhams across 15 countries, according to the company’s
financial statement ending June 2011.  To reduce costs, the developer cut its workforce to 986 in
March 2011 from 3,818 in October 2008, according to the
prospectus. It’s also delaying some projects such as the
Waterfront and Palm Deira.  Nine Projects  Nakheel expects to spend 7.4 billion dirhams this year and
another 1.4 billion dirhams in 2012 to complete nine projects
across Dubai, according to the prospectus. Nakheel said Aug. 24
it plans to complete building 7,982 homes in the 12 months
ending December 2012. The value of its properties under
construction was 52.3 billion dirhams at the end of June 2010.  Dubai’s property prices are expected to drop further as
54,000 homes will come onto the market from 2011 to 2015, Jones
Lang LaSalle Inc. estimates. That’s about 15 percent to 20
percent of the existing supply, according to the real-estate
broker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
