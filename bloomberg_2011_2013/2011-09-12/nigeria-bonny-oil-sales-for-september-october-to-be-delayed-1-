Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light
crude for export in September and October will be delayed by as
many as 17 days, a revised loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News showed, after Royal Dutch Shell Plc declared force majeure.  Three shipments will be deferred to October from September,
and two to November from October, the plan showed. One extra
shipment was added to the October plan, while two were dropped.  As a result, exports for September will be reduced to three
cargoes from six, while October shipments will be unchanged at
eight lots, according to the schedule. All consignments are
950,000 barrels each.  The changes in programs came after Shellâ€™s Nigerian unit
declared force majeure on its Bonny Light crude exports on Aug.
23 after several pipeline attacks. Force majeure is a legal
clause that allows a company to miss scheduled deliveries
because of circumstances beyond its control.  Exports of 18 main grades from  Nigeria  for October were
raised to 69 cargoes totaling 2.07 million barrels a day, from
2.04 million barrels a day originally planned, according to the
plan. September shipments were revised to 2.06 million barrels a
day from 2.23 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
