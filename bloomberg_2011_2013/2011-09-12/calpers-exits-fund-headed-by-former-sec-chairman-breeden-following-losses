The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the nation’s largest pension, is winding down
a European fund managed by former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Richard Breeden after it lost $71.5 million.  Calpers, with assets of $225.4 billion, is the third public
pension to sever ties with a Breeden fund in the past year. In
2010, New York City’s civil employees’ pension voted to dissolve
a partnership with Breeden that bought stakes in U.S. companies
and pressed for management changes to boost stock prices.
Maryland’s State Retirement and Pension System ended its
relationship with Breeden about a year ago,  Michael Golden , a
spokesman for the fund, said today in an e-mail.  Breeden Capital Management, based in Greenwich,
 Connecticut , and Calpers agreed to close Breeden European
Partners ( California ) LP by year-end,  according to a document 
reviewing second-quarter performance that was included in the
fund’s Investment Committee meeting agenda today. Calpers’s $300
million investment in Breeden’s European fund was valued at
$228.5 million as of June 30, according to Calpers.  “Breeden  Europe  is in the process of executing an orderly
liquidation of the portfolio and expects to exit all positions
by year-end,” the Calpers document said. Calpers began
investing in Breeden’s European fund in 2009.  Calpers remains an investor in Breeden’s U.S. fund, which
has returned 9.61 percent this year through June 30, or 3.59
percentage points better than the  Standard & Poor’s 500 .  Wayne Davis , a Calpers spokesman, declined to comment on
Sept. 9.  Richard Breeden  didn’t immediately respond to a
telephone call seeking comment today.  Losses Mount  Breeden European Partners lost 16.8 percent for the year
ending June 2010,  according to Calpers . The fund has lost 2.59
percent this year through June 30, compared with a 9.59 percent
gain for a benchmark European index, according to Calpers.
Edward Storey, an analyst with Breeden European, left the fund
during the second quarter, Calpers said.  Breeden, 61, was chairman of the SEC from 1989 to 1993
under President  George H.W. Bush . Under his leadership, the
commission expanded shareholder rights by requiring more
disclosure in proxy statements of executive pay and making it
easier for dissidents to nominate directors to corporate boards.  After the SEC, Breeden was chairman at accounting firm
Coopers & Lybrand and was the court-appointed monitor for
WorldCom Inc., the telecommunications company that imploded
after an accounting scandal. He opened Breeden Capital
Management in 2005.  Stung by Zale’s  Breeden’s transition to  money management  hasn’t been
smooth. His U.S. corporate governance fund, which targets
companies with sales ranging from $500 million to $10 billion,
has lost 0.9 percent since its inception in June 2006, according
to Calpers records. The fund’s objective is to outperform the
 S&P 500  by 10 percent over the long term, the Calpers documents
said.  Breeden’s U.S. fund was stung by investments in  Zale Corp. (ZLC) ,
the Irving, Texas-based jeweler. Zale’s annual revenue declined
25 percent to $1.62 billion for the year ending July 2010, from
$2.15 billion in the year ending July 2007, before the
recession, according to company filings.  New York City  The jeweler’s fortunes have rebounded over the last year as
revenue increased 7.8 percent to $1.74 billion because of higher
same-store sales. Zale’s net loss for the year ended July 31 was
$112.3 million, or $3.50 per share. Breeden was Zale’s biggest
shareholder as of June 30, holding about 6 million shares, or
18.5 percent.  New York City’s Employees Retirement System  voted to
terminate its investment in Breeden’s U.S. fund in May 2010. The
value of the city’s $136.5 million investment was $110.57
million as of March 31, according to the latest data available
from the  New York  City comptroller’s website.  Breeden’s European Fund used an investment process similar
to that of its U.S. counterpart, buying shares of poorly
performing or undervalued companies and then identifying
strategies to boost return to shareholders. Breeden European had
13 investments as of the second quarter, according to Calpers,
which didn’t disclose the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
