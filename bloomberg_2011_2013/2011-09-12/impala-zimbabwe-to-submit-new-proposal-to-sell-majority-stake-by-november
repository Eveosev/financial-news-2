Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s
Zimbabwean unit, in a dispute with the government over a law to
increase black ownership of the nation’s mining industry, said
it will submit a new proposal to sell a majority stake in the
company by November.  “A proposal was made and it’s all part of negotiations
with the government,” Muchadeyi Masunda, deputy chairman of
 Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) , said by phone today from the capital,
Harare. “I am not aware of any violent objections to it.”  Zimbabwe, which has the world’s second-largest reserves of
platinum and chrome after  South Africa , ruled all foreign or
white-owned companies must submit plans to sell 51 percent of
their local assets to black Zimbabweans by Sept. 25.  The first proposal by Zimplats, a unit of the world’s
second-largest platinum producer, failed to meet the ownership
laws and may result in the company having its mining license
revoked, Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  said on
Sept. 7.  Impala, based in Johannesburg, is the biggest investor in
Zimbabwe’s mining industry and could invest as much as $10
billion increasing production, Chief Executive Officer David Brown said on Aug. 25. Selling 51 percent of Zimplats “just
does not work,” he said on Aug. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
