Morgan Stanley said it may lower
its year-end forecast for the euro after the currency declined
to less than the bank’s $1.36 prediction, as the  European
Central Bank  damped the outlook for interest rate increases.  The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to suffer from
“reputational issues” after  Juergen Stark  quit its executive
board last week and this will likely be “unhelpful” for the
single currency, analysts including  Hans Redeker , head of
foreign-exchange strategy, wrote in a client note today.  Europe’s common currency may slump to about $1.3055 if it
weakens to less than a “support level” at $1.3440, the
analysts wrote. A support level is a price where bids may be
clustered.   The euro lost 0.4 percent to $1.3603 as of 10:12 a.m. in
London, after falling to $1.3495, the weakest since Feb. 16. It
slumped 3.9 percent last week, the biggest drop since the five
days through Aug. 13, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
