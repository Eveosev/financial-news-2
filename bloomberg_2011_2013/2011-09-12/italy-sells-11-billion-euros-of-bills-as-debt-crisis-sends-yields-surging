Italy  sold 11.5 billion euros
($15.6 billion) of Treasury bills as demand waned and borrowing
costs rose amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 7.5 billion euros of one-year
bills at an average yield of 4.153 percent compared with 2.959
percent the last time securities of similar maturity were sold
on Aug. 10. Demand was 1.53 times the amount on offer, compared
with 1.94 times at the previous sale.  The Treasury also sold 4 billion euros of 3-month bills.
The yield was 1.907 percent, up from the 1.034 percent the last
time such securities were sold on March 10. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 1.86, compared with 2.42 at the previous sale.  Italy’s borrowing costs have dropped from a euro-era high
since the  European Central Bank  began buying the nation’s debt
on Aug. 8. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond has fallen
more than 100 basis points since reaching a record 6.4 percent
Aug. 4 on concern Italy would become the next victim of the
region’s debt crisis.  Today’s auction comes as the Chamber of Deputies prepares
to give final approval this week to a 54 billion-euro austerity
package. The plan, passed by the Senate last week, was first
announced on Aug. 5 in exchange for the ECB bond purchases.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds over benchmark German bunds rose nine basis points to 372
basis points as of 10:29 a.m. in  Rome , compared with a euro-era
record of 416 basis points on Aug. 5.  Italy still faces 75 billion euros of maturing bills this
year and needs to sell about 80 billion euros of bonds to pay
for redemptions and the  budget deficit . The biggest test comes
this month when about 46 billion euros of bonds mature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
