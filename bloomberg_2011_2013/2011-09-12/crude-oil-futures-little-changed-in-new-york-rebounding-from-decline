Crude oil rose for the first time
in three days in  New York  as the euro rebounded from a six-month
low, increasing the appeal of commodities as an alternative
investment to the  U.S. dollar .  Crude advanced as the euro and equities erased losses
caused by concern that Europe’s debt crisis will limit economic
growth after the Financial Times reported that Italy was in
talks with a Chinese investment firm to buy bonds. The price
difference between West Texas Intermediate futures traded in New
York and Brent in  London  shrank the most in three weeks.  “Oil held in positive territory even after the euro and
the equity markets came under pressure, indicating there’s a
little underlying strength in WTI today,” said Gene McGillian,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
Connecticut. “The Brent-WTI spread made an all-time high last
week at above $27 and is now taking about $3 out of it.”  Oil for October delivery gained 95 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $88.19 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures traded between $85 and $88.95 a barrel today.
Prices have fallen 3.5 percent this year.  The European common currency was little changed at $1.3658
at 3:55 p.m. in New York after erasing an intraday drop of 1.2
percent to $1.3495, the lowest intraday level since Feb. 16.  Brent Slips  Brent oil for October settlement slipped 52 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $112.25 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  Exchange.  The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $24.06
to U.S. futures, the narrowest spread since Aug. 29 on a
settlement basis. The differential shrank $1.47 a barrel today,
the most since Aug. 22. The spread reached a record $27.22 in
intraday trading on Sept. 6.  “Part of it is the spread trade,”  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said of the
rally in New York futures. “The entire appetite for risk trade
seems to be based on the idea that the economy looks so bad
right now that it can’t possibly get any worse.”  Oil in New York dropped as much as 2.6 percent in intraday
trading and equities and the euro plunged on speculation that
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is preparing for a Greek debt
default.  A plan for jobs growth announced by President  Barack Obama 
on Sept. 8 failed to boost confidence in the U.S., the world’s
largest economy. The same day, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  also disappointed investors by stopping short of
announcing new stimulus measures.  Economic Outlook  “Crude’s simply reflecting views about where the economy
is going,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at
Deutsche Bank AG in Washington. “On days when economic
indicators are good, crude goes up, and on days when indicators
are bad and people think Greece is going to default, it goes
down.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,161.05 at 3:57 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 0.5 percent to 11,049.43.  Oil markets are likely to tighten during the rest of this
year and into 2012 after the final release of crude from the
U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. research note e-mailed today. The bank maintained its
2012 Brent oil price forecast at $130 a barrel.  Libya  will be able to restore most of the oil production
halted during fighting against  Muammar Qaddafi  in six months,
and resume full capacity in 18 months, according to a report
today from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Libyan production plunged to 45,000 barrels a day last month
from 1.59 million in January, before the conflict, according to
Bloomberg estimates.  OPEC Forecasts  OPEC “marginally” lowered estimates for global oil
consumption in 2012, and trimmed its 2011 assessment by 150,000
barrels a day, in a monthly report today.  Prices also increased after failing to breach an $85 a
barrel support level during the day’s intraday decline.  “Crude’s got a base here around $85,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a Chicago-based senior marketing strategist at  MF
Global Holdings Ltd. (MF)   Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on oil last week while
increasing those on gasoline. The funds and other large
speculators reduced wagers that prices will rise, with the
number of futures and options combined falling by 5,780, or 3.6
percent, to 155,837, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders report. Bets motor fuel will
rally increased by 13 percent, the data showed.  In London, money managers raised bullish bets on  Brent
crude  by 12 percent in the week ended Sept. 6, according to  data
from ICE Futures Europe .  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 660,423
contracts as of 3:57 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 677,483
contracts Sept. 9. Open interest was 1.49 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
