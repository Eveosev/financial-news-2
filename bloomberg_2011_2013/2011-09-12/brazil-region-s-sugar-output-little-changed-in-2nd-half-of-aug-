Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, was little changed
in the second half of August, industry association Unica said.  Production of the sweetener in the two-week period totaled
2.96 million metric tons,  Unica  said today in an e-mailed
statement. Ethanol output fell 18 percent to 1.74 billion liters
(458 million gallons) from 2.12 billion liters a year earlier.  Farmers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol is produced, harvested 40.5 million
tons of sugar cane, down 3.8 percent from a year ago, Unica
said.  Brazil,  Latin America ’s biggest economy, is the world’s
largest sugar producer, accounting for more than half of global
exports, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The
harvest in Brazil usually runs from March through November.  Farmers have reaped 338.1 million tons of cane in the
harvest so far, a drop of 11 percent from the same period a year
earlier. Mills in the region have produced 20.4 million tons of
sugar this year, down 9.4 percent from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
