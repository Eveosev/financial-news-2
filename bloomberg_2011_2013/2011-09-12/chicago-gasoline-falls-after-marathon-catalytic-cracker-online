Chicago  gasoline weakened after
Marathon started a fluid catalytic cracker at its Catlettsburg
refinery in Kentucky.  The unit was shut after a leak caused a fire at the
240,000-barrel-a-day plant Aug. 17, according to a filing with
state regulators. Refineries also will switch to winter-grade
fuel this month and will leave an oversupply of the current
summer grade, Steve Mosby, vice president of ADMO Energy LLC, a
supply consultant in Kansas City, Missouri, said Sept. 6.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
weakened 4.25 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in New York at 1:10 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
5.44 cents to $2.7966 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York  Harbor narrowed 0.88 cent to a
premium of 7 cents a gallon.  Total SA had a “blowout” in the coker at its Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery, causing coke dust to be released, according to
a filing with the National Response Center.  Regular gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  held unchanged at a
discount to futures of 2.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
