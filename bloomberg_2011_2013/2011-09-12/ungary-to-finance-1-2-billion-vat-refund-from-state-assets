Hungary ’s government is planning to
repay 250 billion forint ($1.2 billion) in value-added tax to
businesses this year without using budget reserves, the  Economy
Ministry  said.  “The transaction will be funded from state assets instead
of the state budget,” the ministry said today in an e-mailed
update to the government’s economic plan.  The government will have to refund the money after the
European Union’s Court of Justice decided on July 28 that
Hungary has “failed to fulfill its obligations” under the EU
directive on VAT and ordered the Cabinet to pay the costs.  The government will consider selling part of its stake in
refiner Mol Nyrt. to ensure that revenue is on target in 2012,
the ministry said on July 28 after the verdict was published.  To contact the reporter on this story:
