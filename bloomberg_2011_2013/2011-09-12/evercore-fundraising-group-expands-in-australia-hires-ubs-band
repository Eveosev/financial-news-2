Evercore Partners Inc.’s teamed up
with an Australian firm to help private-equity firms raise money
in the region, and hired Jennifer Band from UBS AG to bolster
the team that advises buyout firms based in  Europe .  Evercore signed an exclusive affiliation with Phoenix
Capital Advisory, founded by two former Lehman Brothers
executives, to help attract private-equity clients in  Australia 
and  New Zealand  as well as develop relationships with large
investors there, according to a statement today.  New York-based Evercore’s is bulking up its fundraising
offerings as leveraged-buyout firms are seeking more than $170
billion this year for new funds, more than what they sought in
2006 at the height of the private-equity boom, according to
research firm Preqin Ltd. Nearly half of all private-equity fund
managers plan to raise capital in 2011, according to a survey by
Rothstein Kass, an advisory firm.  Buyout funds “are focused on attracting institutional
investors with capital that is ready to be deployed, and in
today’s challenging environment, Europe,  Asia  and Australia have
become important sources of funds,” Richard Anthony, chief
executive officer of Evercore Private Funds Group, said in the
statement.  The group initiated its expansion into Asia earlier this
year with the appointment of William Lee, based in Evercore’s
Hong Kong office. Phoenix Capital Advisory was founded in 2009
by Matt Wormald and Mark Jackson.  Band, who joins from UBS’s private funds group, will be
responsible for European-based project management and
origination, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
