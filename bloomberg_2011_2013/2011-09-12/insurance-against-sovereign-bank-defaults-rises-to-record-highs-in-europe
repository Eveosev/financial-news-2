The cost of insuring European
sovereign and bank debt rose to records on speculation  Germany 
is preparing for a default by  Greece  while French lenders may be
downgraded because of their holdings of the country’s bonds.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments soared 17 basis points to 353 at
5:30 p.m. in London. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers increased 14 basis points
to 314 and the subordinated index jumped 15 to 550, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government is debating how to
support German banks should Greece fail to meet budget-cutting
terms of its rescue package, three coalition officials said
Sept. 9. Swaps on BNP Paribas SA,  Societe Generale  SA and  Credit
Agricole  SA, France’s largest banks, surged to all-time highs on
bets they’ll have their ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service
this week.  “The situation in Greece is just the initial problem,”
said Alberto Gallo, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc in London. “Our economists expect a hard default is likely
by year-end. We are focused on the consequences of that for
European banks.”  Sovereign Records  Credit-default swaps on  Portugal , Greece,  Italy  and France
surged to records, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. Portugal jumped 79 basis points to 1,213,
Italy rose 40 basis points to 503 and  France  was up 11 at 189.  It now costs $5.7 million upfront and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, up from $5.5
million in advance Sept. 9.  Swaps on Societe Generale were 53 basis points higher at
443, Credit Agricole increased 41 to 331 and BNP Paribas rose 31
basis points to 306, according to CMA.  Moody’s placed the three banks’ ratings on review in June
to examine “the potential for inconsistency between the impact
of a possible Greek default or restructuring and current rating
levels,” the rating company said at the time. Downgrades are
likely as the review period concludes, said the people with
knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential.  “It would not be a surprise if Moody’s downgraded Italy
and a couple of French banks” this week,  Gary Jenkins , head of
fixed income at Evolution Securities Ltd. in London, wrote in a
note to investors.  Bonds Fall  SocGen’s 1.25 billion euros of 4 percent, April 2016 senior
unsecured bonds declined 0.28 cent to 98.31 cents on the euro,
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show. The Paris-based lender’s 1
billion euros of 4.196 percent subordinated perpetual notes
dropped 2.4 cents to 54.1 cents on the euro.  BNP’s 2 billion euros of 3.75 percent, senior unsecured
bonds due in November 2020 fell 0.91 cents to 99.66 cents on the
euro, after climbing to a closing-day record of 100.56 cents on
Sept. 9, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The bank’s
375 million euros of 5.2 percent subordinated securities due
September 2017 declined 0.87 cents to 100.14.  Swaps on U.K. banks rose to records as plans to strengthen
consumer lenders may cost as much as 7 billion pounds ($11
billion) to implement, a government-appointed commission said.
Contracts on Barclays Plc’s senior debt climbed 30 basis points
to 290, while swaps on Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc notes
increased 26 basis points to 394, CMA prices show.  Corporate Risk  The cost of insuring corporate debt rose to the highest
levels in 2 1/2 years, according to JPMorgan. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings was
up 6.5 basis points at 198.5 after rising as high as 204.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 22.5
basis points to 797.5 after earlier touching 811.5, the highest
since May 2009. An increase signals worsening perceptions of
 credit quality .  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
