University of Texas  sophomore Case
McCoy, brother of Cleveland Browns quarterback and former
Longhorn Colt McCoy, is one of two quarterbacks running the
Texas offense in practice this week, after leading the team on a
game-winning fourth-quarter touchdown drive last weekend.  McCoy and David Ash, a freshman, have replaced Garrett
Gilbert atop the Longhorns quarterback depth chart, Texas
spokesman John Bianco said in an e-mail. Gilbert threw two
first-half interceptions in the Longhorns’ 17-16 win over
 Brigham Young University  on Sept. 10 and was replaced by McCoy
and Ash, who combined for 58 yards passing and 39 yards rushing.  McCoy was 2-3 for 34 yards in an eight-play, 52-yard drive
that ended in a touchdown, giving  Texas  a 17-16 lead with 8:46
remaining in the game. Texas travels to  Pasadena  to play the
 University of California, Los Angeles  on Sept. 17.  Gilbert led the Longhorns to a 5-7 record last season, the
team’s first losing season since 1997. He won the starting job
again in camp this summer and is 15-31 with two interceptions
and one touchdown in two games this season.  Colt McCoy was a four-year starter at Texas and graduated
as the school’s all-time leader in wins (45) and passing
touchdowns (112). Ash, from Belton, Texas, 60 miles north of
Austin, lists Colt as his sports hero in his biography on the
university’s athletics website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
