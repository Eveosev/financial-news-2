Chilean economists estimate the
central bank will keep its key  interest rate  unchanged at 5.25
percent this year and lower the rate next year for the first
time since July 2009, the bank said today in a survey.  Policy makers will cut their benchmark rate to 5 percent by
February 2012, according to the median estimate of 65 economists
in the survey published on the bank’s website today. The central
bank kept borrowing costs unchanged in July and August after
raising rates for five straight months.  Chile’s interest rate is at “relatively stable” levels
and is unlikely to increase to 5.75 percent or 6 percent in 2011
as policy makers had estimated in the first half of the year,
bank President Jose De Gregorio told the Senate Sept. 7.  “The differential between what we anticipated some months
ago and what we’re anticipating now is de facto monetary
easing,” he said after the bank published its quarterly
inflation and growth forecasts. “It’s not a rate cut but is the
suspension of an increase.”  The central bank put off plans to raise rates further on
expectations of weaker global growth, which would slow  Chile ’s
economy and reduce inflationary pressures, he said.  Policy makers cut their 2011 inflation estimate to 3.3
percent on Sept. 7 from the 4 percent they forecast in June.
Economists also reduced their December inflation forecasts to
3.3 percent today from 3.6 percent in last month’s survey.  Inflation Target  The central bank targets 3 percent inflation, plus or minus
1 percentage point, over 24 months. The two-year interest-rate
swap yield in pesos rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.59 percent at 8:04 a.m. New York time.  Economists kept unchanged from the August poll their 2011
growth forecast of 6.5 percent. The central bank on Sept. 7
reduced the upper limit of its 2011 estimate to 6.75 percent
from 7 percent in June.  Economists reduced their 2012 growth estimate to 4.7
percent from 5 percent in last month’s survey.  Chile’s peso fell 0.8 percent to 473.30 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:02 a.m. New York time. The peso will trade at 470 in November,
according to today’s survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
