More companies expect reinsurance
prices in the six countries that comprise the Gulf Cooperation
Council to stabilize or advance over the next two years,
according to a survey by the  Qatar Financial Centre Authority .  Twenty two of 24 firms surveyed in June and July by the
authority said prices will remain stable or increase in the
region. That compared with 29 percent that forecast stable or
increasing prices in a survey conducted by the authority earlier
this year. The GCC consists of  Saudi Arabia , Bahrain, Qatar,
Oman,  Kuwait  and the  United Arab Emirates .  “This turnaround is primarily driven by global
developments such as the spate of major insured catastrophe
losses in the first half of 2011,” the report said.  Qatar aims to be a regional hub for reinsurance, asset
management and captive insurance companies, as part of the
country’s bid to diversify its economy away from oil and gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
