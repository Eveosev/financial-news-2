Serena Williams  was issued a code
violation, and may be fined, because of her “verbal abuse” of
the umpire during her loss in the U.S. Open women’s final today
to Samantha Stosur.  Williams berated umpire Eva Asderaki after having a point
taken away from her in the first game of the second set for
yelling out during the point.  The USTA said in a statement that tournament referee Brian
Earley will announce tomorrow whether Williams will be fined for
her outburst.  It will be up to the Grand Slam committee director to
determine whether the outburst violated Williams’s probation for
threatening a lineswoman who called a foot fault on her at the
2009  U.S. Open . She could face a ban if she violated the terms
of her probation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
