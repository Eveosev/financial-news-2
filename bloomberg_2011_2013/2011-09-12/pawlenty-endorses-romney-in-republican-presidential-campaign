Former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty , who dropped out of the Republican presidential race on
Aug. 14, has endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney
for the nomination.  Pawlenty, 50, made the announcement on an appearance on  Fox
News  and in a  message  to Romney supporters.  In a news release this morning naming Pawlenty the national
co-chairman of his campaign, Romney described his former rival
as “an advocate for lower taxes, reduced spending and an
environment where jobs can be created.”  The Republican candidates are preparing to debate today in
 Florida , the second such gathering in less than a week.  “Alone among the contenders, he possesses the unique
qualifications to confront and master our severe economic
predicament,” Pawlenty said of Romney in his message. “His
abiding faith in our country’s exceptional historical position
as a beacon of freedom will make him the most important leader
in a world that depends upon a strong America to stay at
peace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
