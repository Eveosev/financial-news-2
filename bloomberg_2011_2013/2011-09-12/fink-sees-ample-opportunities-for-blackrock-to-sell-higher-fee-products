BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Laurence D. Fink,
chief executive officer of the world’s biggest asset manager,
said the firm has “ample opportunities” to expand products
that charge higher fees, such as private equity and active
stock-picking.  “We’re improving our mix shift toward higher-fee
businesses,” Fink said today at the Barclays Capital 2011
Global Financial Services Conference in  New York . Products that
garner higher fees represent 65 percent of the firm’s revenue,
while only accounting for 35 percent of assets, Fink said today.  BlackRock’s active stock-picking, alternative investments
such as private equity and real estate, and its iShares
exchange-traded funds account for about $1.3 trillion in assets,
Fink said. Those assets have had 7 percent average growth since
the first quarter of 2010, Fink said.  BlackRock was co-founded in 1988 by Fink, who has since
built the firm through a series of acquisitions including the
December 2009 purchase of  Barclays Global Investors . The firm
manages $3.66 trillion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
