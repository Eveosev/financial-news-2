Gasoline fell to a four-week low on
speculation that  Greece  is nearing default, threatening the
financial stability of  Europe  and raising concern that fuel
demand growth will slow.  Prices sank as France’s three largest banks tumbled on
concern that Moody’s Investors Service will cut their ratings
because of their Greek holdings. The MSCI World Index slid 1.8
percent at 10:51 a.m. in  New York . Europe’s recovery is
“fragile” and sovereign-debt levels will keep rising through
2012, the European Commission said today.  “It looks as if the worries about European banks and
exposure about Greek default knocked the equities down,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. "And gasoline has really corrected coming
off the weak demand over the summer.’’  Gasoline for October delivery fell 4.24 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.7286 a gallon at 10:51 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the third consecutive decline. Prices
touched $2.7064, the lowest intraday level since Aug. 10.  Gasoline demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
fell 3 percent in the week ended Sept. 2 to an average 8.96
million barrels a day, the lowest level since May 6, the Energy
Department reported Sept. 8.  The October contract’s premium over November futures
narrowed to 2.59 cents from 3.61 cents on speculation that
supply is adequate to meet immediate demand.  “Post Labor Day, you would expect gasoline demand to drop
as it typically does,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of
trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  Heating oil for October delivery dropped 3.47 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.9511 a gallon on the exchange. Prices touched
$2.9275, the lowest intraday level since Aug. 23.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, declined
0.6 cent to $3.649 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
