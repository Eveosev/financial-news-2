Nigeria ’s naira slipped to its
weakest in almost three months against the dollar at a currency
auction after the central bank cut dollar supply to the lowest
level in more than three weeks.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest oil producer
declined 0.1 percent to 153.27 naira per dollar at the auction,
its weakest level since an auction on June 22. It retreated 0.2
percent to 155.40 naira per dollar in interbank trading by 3:29
p.m. in Lagos, the lowest since Sept. 8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $350 million, compared with $362.7
million demanded by lenders, the 18th straight auction it failed
meet demand, the Abuja-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement.  Africa ’s biggest oil producer has used foreign-currency
reserves to keep naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 naira per dollar at its bi-weekly auctions to help
check inflation.  “The naira reacted to the reduction in dollar sales by
central bank, which fell short of ‘moderate’ demand by
dealers,” Usman Onoja, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Lovonus Trust and Investment Ltd., which trades in currencies,
said in a phone interview from Lagos.  The central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi, said on Sept. 7
the bank doesn’t have to meet demand at every currency auction
as long as the naira exchanges in the band.  To contact the reporter on this story:
