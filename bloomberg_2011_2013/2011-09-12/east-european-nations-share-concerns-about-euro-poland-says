East European nations outside the
euro area share “a number of concerns” over how the debt
crisis and the currency bloc’s response to it could affect their
membership prospects, according to  Poland , the current holder of
the rotating European Union presidency.  “We wanted to discuss current developments and shared a
number of concerns,” said Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, European
Affairs Minister for Poland, said today after a meeting of EU
officials in Brussels.  Bulgaria, the  Czech Republic ,  Hungary , Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland and  Romania , which committed themselves to adopt the
common currency when they joined the EU in 2004 and 2007, met on
the sidelines of the bigger EU meeting. The debate in the 17-
nation euro area over how to strengthen fiscal rules to help
tackle the sovereign-debt crisis should involve central and east
European nations, Dowgielewicz said.  “I think that what matters is that those countries take an
active part in the discussion,” he told reporters in Brussels.
“You can’t restrict the debate on the future of the euro only
to euro-zone countries.”  Poland holds the rotating EU presidency until the end of
this year.  To contact the reporter:
