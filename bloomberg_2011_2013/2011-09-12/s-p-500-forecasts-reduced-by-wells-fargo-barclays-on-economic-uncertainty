Wells Fargo & Co .’s Gina Martin Adams and Barclays Plc’s Barry Knapp cut their forecasts for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index this year, citing economic
uncertainty and a potential decline in earnings estimates.  Adams, the New York-based equity strategist at Wells Fargo,
reduced her year-end price forecast for the S&P 500 by 10
percent to 1,250. Knapp, the head of U.S. equity strategy,
lowered his to 1,325 from 1,450. Adams also cut her projection
for combined profit by companies in the benchmark equity measure
in 2011 and 2012.  The combination of  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and
weakening U.S. economic data has pushed the S&P 500 down as much
as 18 percent from its high this year in April. Strategists at
Wall Street firms from UBS AG to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have
slashed their forecasts for the benchmark U.S. equity measure
since the beginning of August. In the same period, analysts that
cover stocks in the  S&P 500  have lifted their profit estimates
0.4 percent to $99.88 a share.  “Micro profit forecasts are likely to play catch-up to
soured macro data in coming weeks,” Adams and Peter Chung, an
analyst at the firm, said in the note. “While bottom-up
forecasters are holding relatively strong to their convictions
for strong profits growth to continue, our models suggest
earnings growth is likely to reflect the recent economic
slowdown over the next few quarters.”  Weekly Losses  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,162.27 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The index lost 1.7 percent last week, its sixth drop in
the past seven weeks.  Combined earnings by companies in the equity measure will
be $93.50 a share in 2011, down from an earlier estimate of
$94.40, Adams said in a note dated today. She also lowered her
estimate for profit in 2012 to $98.70 a share from $103.50.
Knapp kept his predictions for profit by S&P 500 companies at
$96 a share in 2011 and $105 in 2012.  “With roughly three quarters behind us, the risks to 2011
earnings are somewhat limited and we’re comfortable with our
forecast,” Knapp wrote in a note dated Sept. 9. “However, 2012
is a different story.”  While Knapp still says S&P 500 profit will increase 9.4
percent in 2012 from the prior year, analysts’ expectations for
growth have slowed. Financial companies are among the biggest
risks to the Barclays earnings estimate for 2012, he said.  Public Policy  “We remain bullish,” he wrote. “Continued public policy
uncertainty and the impact of slowing earnings momentum were
significant factors in our decision to cut our 2011 year-end
price target to a still optimistic 1,325.”  Technology, industrials, materials and consumer-
discretionary stocks will lead the 15 percent rally from the S&P
500’s close on Sept. 9 to Barclays’s year-end forecast, Knapp
said. Consumer staples and utility companies will lag behind, he
said.  Adams said her profit forecasts for financials and energy
companies diverged the most from the average estimate of company
analysts. She raised her recommendation for consumer staples and
consumer-discretionary stocks to “overweight” and utility
stocks to “market weight.” She lowered her ratings for
technology companies to “market weight,” while also
downgrading industrial, energy and material companies to
“underweight.”  Recommended Shift  “We are recommending a shift to a more defensive  asset
allocation ,” Adams wrote. Declining commodity prices have
allayed concerns that consumer companies will face margin
pressures due to higher input costs, she said.  While the move to “overweight” on discretionary stocks
may seem contrary to Wells Fargo’s shift to recommending
defensive groups, the group won’t suffer as much as other
industries in an economic slowdown, Adams said. Industrial and
commodity companies would be vulnerable to a slowdown, according
to San Francisco-based Wells Fargo.  “Energy, materials, and industrials nonetheless have among
the most difficult earnings comparisons but highest expectations
for growth over the next several quarters,” Adams wrote. “As
the consensus works to catch up to the economic reality, we
expect earnings downgrades are likely to weigh on these
segments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
