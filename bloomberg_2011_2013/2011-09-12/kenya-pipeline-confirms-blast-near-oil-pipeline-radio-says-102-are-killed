An explosion at a slum in  Kenya ’s
capital, Nairobi, following a spill from an oil pipeline burned
“a number of people,” Kenya Pipeline Co. said. Capital FM, a
closely held broadcaster, said one of its reporters counted at
least 102 dead bodies.  The blast occurred after oil leaked from a broken valve on
the pipeline and drained into Mukuru in the east of the city,
where people gathered to scoop up the fuel, a spokesman for
Kenya pipeline said in a phone interview. The spokesman couldn’t
immediately confirm the death toll.  “We are collecting information about the fire incident and
we will provide the details later,” police spokesman  Eric
Kiraithe  said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
