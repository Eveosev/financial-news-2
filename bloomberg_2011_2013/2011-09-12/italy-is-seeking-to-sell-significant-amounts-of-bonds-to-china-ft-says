 The Italian government is making
approaches to China with the aim of selling the cash-rich Asian
country “significant” quantities of Italian bonds and
investments in strategic companies, the Financial Times
reported.  China Investment Corp. Chairman  Lou Jiwei  was in Rome last
week for discussions with Italian Finance Minister  Giulio
Tremonti  and Italy’s Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, a government
entity that has established an Italian Strategic Fund open to
foreign investors, the FT said, citing unidentified Italian
officials.  Italian officials met China Investment Corp. and the
country’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which
manages most of China’s $3.2 trillion foreign exchange reserves,
in Beijing two weeks ago, the newspaper also said, while Italy’s
Head of Treasury,  Vittorio Grilli , met Chinese investors in the
Chinese capital in August, the FT reported.  Further negotiations are likely to take place soon, the FT
said, citing unnamed Italian officials.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
