CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the U.K.
private-equity firm that owns a controlling stake in the Formula
One motor-racing series, may be named as a co-defendant in a
lawsuit alleging that  Bernie Ecclestone , the impresario of the
sport, paid bribes to facilitate its acquisition by CVC, the
London-based Times reported, citing an unidentified person close
to  Constantin Medien AG. (EV4)   The German media company, which owned a stake in Formula
One before the acquisition, has filed a claim in the London High
Court for $171 million in damages against Ecclestone, Stephen Mullens, his former lawyer, and Bambino Holdings, his family
trust, the newspaper said.  German prosecutors allege that Bayerische Landesbanken was
tricked into selling Formula One to CVC for less than it was
worth, and that Gerhard Gribkowsky, the state-owned bank’s chief
risk officer, received bribes, the Times said.  Ecclestone hasn’t been charged and denies all wrongdoing,
and it’s not alleged that CVC was aware of any bribes, the
newspaper said. Constantin Medien and CVC declined to comment,
it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
