Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  officials are
seeking the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in
efforts to salvage the company’s $39 billion sale of T-Mobile
USA Inc. to  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Handelsblatt  said, citing company
officials.  Merkel telephoned President Barack Obama in March to
express her support for the deal after it was announced,
Handelsblatt reported. Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer
Rene Obermann wants the two leaders to speak again, the
newspaper cited supervisory board officials as saying.  AT&T Inc. and Deutsche Telekom AG said they plan to contest
the U.S. government’s effort to block the acquisition, which was
announced Aug. 31.  Germany  owns 32 percent of Deutsche Telekom.  Deutsche Telekom spokespeople were unavailable at the
company’s Bonn headquarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
