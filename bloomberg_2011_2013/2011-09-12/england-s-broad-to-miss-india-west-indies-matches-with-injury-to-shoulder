England bowler  Stuart Broad  will
miss about six weeks, including cricket matches against  India 
and the West Indies, after tearing a shoulder muscle.  The player won’t be available for the final one-day
international with India this week in Cardiff, the Twenty20
series against the West Indies and the one-day portion of the
tour of India. He may return for the Twenty20 match scheduled
for Oct. 29 in Kolkata, the England and Wales Cricket Board said
today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
