  Sri Lanka  tied its rain-shortened
second cricket Test against  Australia  in Pallekele, giving the
hosts a chance to salvage a draw in the three-match series.  Sri Lanka, which was held to 174 in its first innings, was
on 317-6 in the final day when rain halted play. It was leading
the visitors by 80 runs after Australia declared on 411-7.  Tharanga Paranavitana, and Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar
Sangakkara scored half-centuries for the host, which will
attempt to tie the series in the last Test, which starts in four
days in Colombo. Australia claimed the opener in the series by
125 runs. It can move above Sri Lanka to fourth in the
International Cricket Council Test rankings by winning the
series.  Paranavitana and captain  Tillakaratne Dilshan  shared an 81-
run opening partnership before Dilshan slashed the ball to Shane
Watson at first slip off the bowling of Ryan Harris, who took
three wickets in the second innings.  Angelo Mathews was unbeaten on 11 and Suraj Randiv was on 4
when play was stopped.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
