Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin
America’s largest oil producer, said output fell to 2.427
million barrels a day last week after storm Nate caused a
decline in production at its largest field, Ku-Maloob-Zaap.  Daily output from the Ku-Maloob-Zaap deposit has dropped to
737,000 barrels on average so far this month, down from 849,000
in the first four days of September. The Mexico City based-
company, known as Pemex, produced 2.556 million barrels a day
last month, according to a preliminary production report.  Tropical Storm Nate, which is weakening, prompted Pemex on
Sept. 9 to evacuate 473 workers from five offshore platforms in
the  Gulf of Mexico  and to “defer” 178,700 barrels of crude
output from offshore facilities. The state-owned company also
closed temporarily its three crude export terminals.  The Mexican Navy yesterday found 9 out of 10 missing Pemex
contractors in a lifeboat. Three of the workers had died, Pemex
said. Some of the recued workers were employed by  Geokinetics
Inc. (GOK) , an oil exploration services company based in Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
