French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said bonds backed by the entire euro area may eventually
be an option, though they aren’t an immediate solution to the
region’s sovereign-debt problems.  “They can be a point of arrival, not a point of
departure,” he told journalists in Paris today. “The point of
departure” is reducing budget deficits.  Today’s plunge in the shares of French banks doesn’t
require an emergency response from the government, Baroin said.
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
slid more than 8 percent after two people with knowledge of the
matter said Moody’s Investors Service may cut the banks’ ratings
because of their Greek holdings.  “All the tools for liquidity provision are there,” Baroin
said, referring to a pledge by Group of Seven central bankers to
provide the liquidity that lenders need.  To contact the reporter on this story:
