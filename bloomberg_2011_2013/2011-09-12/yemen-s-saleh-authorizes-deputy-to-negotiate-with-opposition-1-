Tens of thousands of Yeminis
rallied in the capital, Sana’a, to protest President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s decision to authorize his vice president to
begin a dialogue with the opposition.  The opposition yesterday said it rejected any dialogue
before a power-transfer accord is signed, according to a
statement posted on the opposition’s website sahwa.net.  The protesters chanted “No decrees, no misleading until
the president leaves.”  The Gulf Cooperation Council-backed power-transfer plan is
aimed at halting months of unrest and the ensuing economic
decline in the Arab world’s poorest country, which has been used
as a base by al-Qaeda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
