First National Bank , the retail
banking unit of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , bought Finance Bank Zambia Ltd.
for 27 billion kwacha ($5.5 million), said Caleb Fundanga, the
Zambian central bank governor.  The central bank had followed “all legal processes” in
the sale, Fundanga told reporters in Lusaka, Zambia’s capital,
today.  Finance Bank was seized by the Bank of Zambia last year for
breaching financial laws and was then managed by FirstRand,
 South Africa ’s second-biggest banking group. Finance Bank has
about 1,000 employees and 39 branches. FNB already operates in
Zambia and has a presence in six other African countries
excluding South Africa and Zambia. A group of shareholders had
challenged the central bank’s decision to seize the lender and
sell it.  To contact the reporters on this story:
