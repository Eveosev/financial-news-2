Robert Ruyak, former chairman and
chief executive officer of dissolved Washington law firm Howrey
LLP, joined Winston & Strawn LLP as a partner in its global
litigation practice.  Ruyak, who will be based in the firm’s Washington office,
brings more than 35 years’ experience in commercial litigation
and investigations, Chicago-based Winston said today in a
statement.  “Recruiting a partner of Bob’s caliber and experience is
clearly a coup for Winston,” Chairman Dan K. Webb said in the
statement.  Ruyak was Howrey’s CEO from January 2000 until the firm
voted to dissolve in March. He is the latest of a group of
Howrey partners, associates and support staff to join Winston.  Adding Ruyak will help the firm expand its antitrust and
patent practices, Tom Mills, head of Winston’s Washington
office, said in the statement. Ruyak’s clients have included
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Verizon Communications Inc., AMR Corp.’s  American
Airlines , SAP AG, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific Corp.,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
