Daimler AG expects demand for
luxury cars to climb at a faster pace than the broader
automotive market in the next decade as the industry continues
to outperform the global economy.  The maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles also plans to ramp up
plans for fuel-cell powered cars, aiming to produce versions of
its B-class model on a large scale in 2014, a year earlier than
initially envisaged, Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said
in a speech at a Mercedes event ahead of the Frankfurt motor
show today.  Zetsche expects fuel-cell cars to be priced at the level of
hybrid models, which combine convention engines with electric
motors, “in the medium term,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
