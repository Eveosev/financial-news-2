Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  promoted Walter J. Scheller III to chief executive officer two months after
Keith Calder resigned from the post at the U.S. producer of
metallurgical coal.  Scheller, 50, was president of the company’s U.S.
operations, Birmingham, Alabama-based Walter Energy said today
in a statement. He joined the company in June 2010 from Peabody
Energy Corp., where he worked for four years. He has also worked
as an executive at CNX Gas Corp. and Consol Energy Inc. Scheller
replaces interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard.  Calder, who resigned as CEO on June 30, assumed the
position in April. He told the board of directors in a letter
that he was leaving due to differing opinions concerning
“management philosophy.” Calder was the CEO of Western Coal
Corp., which Walter Energy acquired in April for C$5.32 billion
($5.36 billion).  To contact the reporter and editor responsible for this story:
