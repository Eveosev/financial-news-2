Peru’s trade surplus jumped to its
widest since at least 2003 in July on rising prices for the
country’s copper, gold and zinc exports, the government said.  The Andean country’s trade surplus widened to $1.2 billion
in July from $500 million a year earlier and $985 million in
June, the country’s National Statistics Institute said in an e-
mailed report.  Exports rose 40 percent to $4.14 billion in July, the
agency said. Copper prices rose 32 percent in July from a year
earlier, while gold climbed 37 percent. Exports also gained on
demand for natural gas and fresh farm and fish products, the
agency said.  Import growth decelerated as demand for  consumer goods ,
wheat and  crude oil  eased. Imports climbed 19 percent to $2.9
billion, after climbing 41 percent the previous month.  Peru is the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer
and sixth-largest in gold. Metals account for two-thirds of
exports.  The Peruvian sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7285 per  U.S.
dollar  at 12:13 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
