Serbia ’s inflation rate fell to an
eight-month low of 10.5 percent in August on declining prices of
food and beverages and clothing and footwear, the statistics
office said.  Consumer prices were unchanged from the previous month, the
Belgrade-based office said today. The inflation rate was 12.1
percent in July.  Price pressures in Serbia, mainly led by food and fuel
prices, subsided in August on a favorable base effect, allowing
the central bank to cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a half-
point to 11.25 percent on Sept. 8.  “Inflation should continue to decline and return to the
inflation corridor in the first half of 2012,” central bank
Governor Dejan Soskic told a news conference in Belgrade today.
“Inflationary pressures remain stable and should reflect
declining inflation as it decreases to single digits in the
coming months.”                                   .”  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije targets inflation
at 4.5 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, this year
and 4 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, next year.
It sees the  consumer price index  falling to single digits by the
end of 2011 and within the target band by mid-2012.  Central bankers of Serbia and its Western Balkan neighbors
last week warned against a double-dip recession spilling over
from more developed European countries and affecting their
growth prospects, putting strain on their fiscal systems and
prompting concern over burgeoning public debt levels.  The IMF has already cut its growth forecast for Serbia to 2
percent from 3 percent in 2011 and reduced the outlook for next
year to a 3 percent rise from 4.5 percent because of slowing
exports.  The central bank sees the economy expanding 2.5 percent
this year, Soskic said today. Previously, the bank estimated GDP
growth of 3 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
