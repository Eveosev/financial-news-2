U.K. 10-year bonds jumped, driving
yields to an all-time low, as stock-market losses and
speculation  Germany  is preparing for a Greek default fueled
demand for the perceived safety of government debt.  Two-year yields also slid to a record, falling below 0.50
percent. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index sank 2.4 percent, after
sliding 3.7 percent last week. Gilts have risen with German
bunds and U.S. Treasuries amid mounting concern that divisions
among euro-area policy makers are thwarting efforts to solve the
region’s debt crisis and avert a Greek default. The pound
weakened for a third day against the dollar.  “The markets are really getting nervous and we’re seeing
moves from risky markets,” said Allan von Mehren, chief fixed-
income strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “Gilts are
still AAA rated and are still going to be considered among the
safest bond markets.”  The 10-year gilt yield slid five basis points to 2.21
percent at 4:22 p.m. in  London , after reaching 2.18 percent, the
lowest since at least January 1989, when Bloomberg started
collecting the data. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2020
rose 0.465, or 4.65 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,586) face amount,
to 112.525. Two-year yields were little changed at 0.54 percent,
after retreating to 0.49 percent.  The pound fell 0.4 percent to $1.5817 and was 0.2 percent
weaker at 86.19 pence per euro, after appreciating 0.8 percent
to 85.30 pence, the strongest level since March 3.  Refuge Bid  Gilts have returned almost 3 percent this month, compared
with 2.7 percent for German  government bonds  and 1.4 percent for
U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  British government debt outperformed as investors sought
refuge from the euro area’s debt crisis and on speculation the
 Bank of England  will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record low as the economic recovery falters. Policy makers kept
the rate at 0.5 percent last week and maintained the asset-
purchase program at 200 billion pounds.  Bonds of Europe’s most indebted countries fell today amid
concern the debt crisis is intensifying as growth slows. German
two- and 10-year yields dropped to record lows today. The euro
is under “existential threat,” Nobel laureate economist  Paul Krugman  wrote in the New York Times today.  Reports tomorrow will show that U.K. house-price declines
accelerated in August while the inflation rate quickened to 4.5
percent, more than twice the central bank’s 2 percent target,
according to Bloomberg surveys of economists. The government is
scheduled to release jobless claims data on Sept. 14.  Spread Narrows  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold 10-
year gilts instead of two-year notes narrowed six basis points
to 166 basis points, the least since March 2009. Declining
spreads signal investor preference for longer-dated securities,
which are more sensitive to the outlook for inflation. The
securities with shorter maturities react more to expected
changes in interest rates.  The pound has depreciated 5.3 percent in the past 12 months
against a basket of nine major peers, the second-worst performer
after the dollar, which fell 8.4 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
