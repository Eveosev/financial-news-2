Allied World Assurance Company
Holdings AG said proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder
Services Inc. recommended the insurer’s shareholders vote for a
planned merger with  Transatlantic Holdings Inc. (TRH)   “We remain firmly committed to the current terms of our
merger agreement and look forward to closing the transaction as
early as possible in the fourth quarter,” Scott Carmilani,
chief executive officer of Zug, Switzerland-based Allied, said
today in a statement announcing the proxy advisory service’s
decision. ISS recommended that Transatlantic shareholders vote
against the transaction last week.  The two companies have scheduled shareholder votes on the
proposed deal for Sept. 20.  Validus Holdings Ltd. (VR)  and  Warren
Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  have made unsolicited offers
for New York-based Transatlantic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
