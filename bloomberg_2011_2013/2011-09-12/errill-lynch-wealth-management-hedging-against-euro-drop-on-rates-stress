Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch Wealth Management unit in  Europe , the  Middle East  and
 Africa  hedged its exposure to the euro in portfolios because of
a rising probability that the currency will weaken.  “We continue to remain cautious on the euro, and have
taken the decision to hedge our currency exposure,”  Bill O’Neill , chief investment officer for EMEA, wrote today in an e-
mailed report. “A likely rate cut by the  European Central Bank 
on top of increased ECB bond purchasing and ongoing political
uncertainty, especially the balance between core and periphery,
remain headwinds for the currency.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3668 at 2:53 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
