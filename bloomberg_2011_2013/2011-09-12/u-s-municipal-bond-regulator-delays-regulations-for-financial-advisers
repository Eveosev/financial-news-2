The agency that oversees the U.S.
municipal bond market delayed proposed rules for financial
advisers until the Securities and Exchange Commission defines
who will be subject to the regulation.  Municipal advisers would face new regulations under the
Dodd-Frank Act that was passed more than a year ago. The
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board said it is putting its
proposed rules on hold until the SEC issues a legal definition
of municipal adviser.  The rulemaking board’s proposals must be approved by the
SEC. Before that happens, those with a stake in the outcome are
allowed to suggest changes to the regulators.  “We want to make sure that all potential municipal
advisers are on notice that they could be affected by our rule
proposals and have an opportunity to participate fully in the
SEC comment process,” MSRB Executive Director Lynnette Kelly Hotchkiss said today in a statement.  The delay affects proposed rules proscribing financial
advisers’ duty to their customers and a ban on political giving
to win business, the MSRB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
