Equity options prices surged
worldwide, driving the European benchmark index to the highest
level since January 2009, as investors speculated the Greek debt
crisis is intensifying.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against declines in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, gained 7.5 percent
to 53.55. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, climbed 6.9 percent to 41.18 at 11:42
a.m. in New York.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Volatility Index jumped
23 percent, the most since Aug. 19, to 38.77.  India ’s Nifty
volatility climbed 16 percent to 32.75.  Global volatility gauges have surged since the end of June,
with the VStoxx gaining 148 percent and VIX rising 150 percent,
on concern the European debt crisis is spreading and as U.S.
economic data show signs of weakness. Officials in Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s government are debating how to shore up German
banks in the event that  Greece  fails to meet term of its aid
package, three coalition officials said on Sept. 9. America
added no jobs in August, a report on Sept. 2 showed.  “We’re definitely in a spot where it doesn’t matter what
the news is, it’s all negative right now,” said Justin Wiggs,
who trades financial stocks at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in
Baltimore. “Until we break that negative feedback loop, people
are going to be scared to invest.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to
1,149.67 at 11:50 a.m. in New York, while the Euro Stoxx 50
Index tumbled 3.8 percent to 1,995.01, the lowest level since
March 2009. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.3 percent.  The most-active options on the Euro Stoxx 50 were September
1,900 puts, which have a strike price 4.8 percent below the
gauge’s current level, followed by the December 1,800 puts and
the September 2,000 puts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
most-traded S&P 500 contracts were September 1,150 puts, which
are right around the index’s level today.  The most-traded VIX options were the September 50 calls.
VIX futures expiring this month gained 3.5 percent to 39.90,
while those expiring in December rose 1.4 percent to 31.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
