Mozambique ’s central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged as economic growth in the
southern African nation slowed.  The standing lending facility rate was kept at 16 percent,
the Maputo-based Bank of Mozambique said in a statement on its
website today.  Mozambique’s economy expanded 6.8 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, after growing 8.1 percent in the
first three months of the year, according to the southern
African nation’s statistics office. Annual inflation in Maputo
accelerated to 7.9 percent in August from 7.7 percent a month
earlier, the agency said on Sept. 9.  The metical has gained 22 percent against the dollar this
year and was trading as high as 26.5750 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
