Sugar exports from  Brazil ’s Center
South, the country’s main producing region, will start falling
from October onwards due to limited supplies, according to
London-based broker C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd.  October shipments from the South American country, the
world’s largest producer of the commodity, will be less than 2
million metric tons, a drop of as much as 25 percent from
September, Czarnikow estimates. Brazil’s sugar cane output will
drop for the first time in a decade, according to industry group
Unica.  “Sugar exports from Brazil’s Center South will tail off
from October onwards, as shipments up to now have kept a similar
pace to last year and export availability is forecast to be
about 3 million tons less,” Czarnikow analyst Peter de Klerk
said in a telephone interview from  London  today.  Exports of the sweetener from the Center South are forecast
to be 20.3 million tons this year, down from 23.9 million tons
last year, Czarnikow estimates. The broker did not give exact
figures for October’s shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
