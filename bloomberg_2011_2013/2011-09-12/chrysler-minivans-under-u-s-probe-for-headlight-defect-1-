Chrysler Group LLC, the carmaker
run by  Fiat SpA (F) , faces an investigation by U.S. automotive-
safety regulators after 1,541 complaints about minivan
headlights that go out while driving.  The  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  said
today on its  website  that it’s probing 622,817 model-year 2005
minivans made by Chrysler, based in  Auburn Hills , Michigan,
after receiving reports of two crashes including one that caused
a minor injury.  Drivers have reported that the headlights turn off and
remain extinguished intermittently, usually with the vehicle in
motion, the regulator said. In one accident a minivan struck a
deer and in the other the vehicle drove into a ditch, according
to reports received by Chrysler, NHTSA said.  Vince Muniga, a spokesman for Chrysler, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail sent before regular business hours asking
for the company to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
