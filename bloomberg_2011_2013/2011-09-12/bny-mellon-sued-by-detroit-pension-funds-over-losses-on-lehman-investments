Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  was
accused in a lawsuit by Detroit pension funds of mishandling
their money invested in  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)   The pension funds allege in their complaint that BNY Mellon
encouraged them to join its securities lending program, under
which the bank would lend securities owned by the funds to
creditworthy borrowers. The funds viewed the program as “akin
to a conservative  money market account ,” according to the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in New York.  The bank invested in Lehman notes in 2006 on behalf of the
pension funds and continued to maintain the investments as
uncertainty surrounding Lehman grew, the funds said.  BNY Mellon, based in  New York , breached its fiduciary duty
to the pension funds for city employees, including police
officers and firefighters, they said in their complaint. The
funds seek to represent a group of investors that together lost
more than $1 billion in the notes.  Kevin Heine, a BNY Mellon spokesman, had no immediate
comment yesterday.  The case is General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit v. BNY Mellon N.A., 11-06345, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
