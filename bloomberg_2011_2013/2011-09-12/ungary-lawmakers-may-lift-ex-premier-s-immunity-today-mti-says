Hungarian legislators may lift the
immunity of former Prime Minister  Ferenc Gyurcsany  in a
parliamentary vote today, opening the way for criminal
proceedings against him, state news agency  MTI  reported.  Gyurcsany, who was premier for five years until 2009, is
facing abuse of power charges related to a real-estate
transaction to set up a casino, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
