Economists’ reductions to U.S.
growth forecasts throughout this year have increased the odds of
another dose of monetary stimulus from the  Federal Reserve .  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how monthly median growth
forecasts for 2011 through 2013 have been consistently cut. The
world’s largest economy is projected to grow 1.6 percent this
year, down from a forecast of 3.2 percent in February. Gross
domestic product for next year has been marked down to a current
2.2 percent from 3.3 percent earlier this year. The results are
based on 66 responses in the Bloomberg News monthly economic
survey.  The Fed meets Sept. 20-21 and may decide to replace some of
the short-term Treasury securities in its $1.65 trillion
portfolio with long-term debt in a bid to lower rates on
everything from mortgages to  car loans , according to economists
at Wells Fargo & Co., Barclays Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. Some analysts dub the maneuver “Operation Twist”
because it would bend long-term yields lower.  “The  U.S. economy  is in a bigger hole than policy makers
initially believed, and the Fed can’t seem to catch a break,”
 Rudy Narvas , senior economist at Societe Generale SA in  New
York , said in an interview. “We believe more stimulus through
operation twist and possibly QE3 are all very much in the
cards.”  Economic growth averaged 0.7 percent in the first half of
this year, the weakest since the final six months of the
recession that ended in June 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
