Turkish conmen who lured a Korean
tourist into an Istanbul bar promising free drinks, then handed
him a 7,400-lira ($4,136) bill, could face 15-year jail terms
for predatory fraud,  Haberturk  reported.  The two men approached the tourist as he was walking down
Istiklal Caddesi, Istanbulâ€™s main pedestrian thoroughfare, and
told him their grandfathers were killed fighting alongside South
Koreans in the  Korean War , the newspaper reported.  The men had dinner and drinks together, then left for
another night club; there, the tourist subsequently told the
police, three women joined his table and he was later handed the
bill, Haberturk said.  The conmen have been freed on 10,000 liras bail, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
