Pankaj Razdan, deputy chief
executive offer for financial services at  Aditya Birla Group ,
comments on the outlook for Indian equities. He spoke in an
interview with Bloomberg-UTV.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index tumbled 2.2 percent to
16,501.74 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the most since Aug.
18 and the lowest level in two weeks.  On outlook for markets:  “India’s structural story is great. Our growth is good and
we may see foreign fund inflows. India is under-owned by foreign
investors. The markets are affected by global problems. The
problem lies with Europe, not so much the U.S. Volatility will
continue till Europe’s problems last. India is still among the
cheapest markets given the earnings growth. Our debt-to-GDP
ratio is much lower than the U.S.,  Europe  and  China . I see a 13
to 14 percent nominal growth. India is amongst cheapest markets
given earnings growth.”  On outlook for inflation:  “We need to live with higher levels of inflation. We can’t
hope to live with 5 percent levels. The Reserve Bank of India
has done a good job of controlling inflation. Right now, RBI is
waiting for strong signs. It may still increase rates by 25
basis points. Small sections of the market believes the RBI will
pause.”  India’s central bank has raised borrowing costs 11 times
since the start of 2010 to damp living costs that are rising the
fastest among the so-called BRICS countries of Brazil, Russia,
China and  South Africa . The bank’s next policy announcement is
due on Sept. 16.  On stocks:  “Buying at 5,000 levels shows confidence in India. Given
growth, the consumption sector is expected to do well. The
consumer and infrastructure sectors are expected to do well.”
