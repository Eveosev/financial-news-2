Bunds gained for a third day,
driving 10-year yields down to a record, on speculation German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is preparing for a Greek default.  Greece’s two-year note yields climbed toward 70 percent
even after Prime Minister  George Papandreou  approved new
measures to help plug the  budget deficit . Italian bonds fell as
demand declined at a bill auction today. The cost of insuring
European sovereign debt from default rose to an all-time high,
according to credit-default swaps. Dutch, Finnish and Austrian
10-year yields dropped to the least since the euro was
introduced in 1999.  “Despite Greece announcing extra measures, the overriding
discussion in the market is about a potential default and
possible exit from the euro,” said Marius Daheim, a senior
fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich.
“This is pushing investors more into safe-haven territory.”  German 10-year bund yields slid two basis points to 1.75
percent at 4:27 p.m. in  London , after falling to a record 1.705
percent. The 2.25 percent security due September 2021 advanced
0.220, or 2.20 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,364) face amount, to
104.555. Two-year yields climbed four basis points to 0.43
percent after falling to 0.359 percent, the lowest since the
euro’s introduction.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slumped 2.4 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.5 percent. The Markit
iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments
jumped 15 basis points to 351 basis points. The euro fell to a
10-year low against the yen and the weakest since February
versus the dollar.  Greek Yields  Credit-default swaps on Greece, Italy and  France  surged to
records, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. Italy increased 38 basis points to 503 and France was up
12 at 190.  Investors have to pay $5.65 million upfront and $100,000
annually to insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, up
from $5.5 million in advance on Sept. 9, CMA prices show.  Greek two-year note yields jumped more than 12 percentage
points to a euro-era record 69.551 percent, after climbing 9.8
percentage points last week. Ten-year yields advanced 301 basis
points to an all-time high 23.56 percent, pushing the yield
difference, or spread, versus similar-maturity German bunds to
2,181 basis points, or 21.81 percentage points.  The decisions taken by European leaders in July to bail out
 Greece  “won’t suffice” to save the nation from default, Lars Feld, a German government adviser, said in an interview today
with Bloomberg Television. Feld said he sees a restructuring of
Greek debt by spring or summer of 2012.  New Measures  A new set of measures will help Greece meet deficit targets
of 17.1 billion euros in 2011 and 14.9 billion euros in 2012,
covering a 2 billion-euro shortfall for this year that has been
exacerbated by a deepening recession, according to Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos.  French 10-year bond yields dropped to a record low 2.444
percent, before rising four basis points to 2.52 percent.
Similar-maturity Dutch rates fell as low as 2.168 percent, while
Austrian yields dropped to 2.489 percent. Finnish 10-year yields
also declined to a euro-era low of 2.203 percent.  German, Dutch and Finnish bonds jumped last week and Greek,
Spanish and Italian bonds fell, on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
is intensifying. Group of Seven finance chiefs said after
weekend talks in Marseille, France, they would support banks and
buoy slowing growth. The euro is under “existential threat,”
Nobel laureate economist  Paul Krugman  wrote in the New York
Times today.  Currency Swaps  The premium European banks pay to borrow in dollars for 12
months through the swaps markets increased to the most since
December 2008, a sign lenders may be struggling to get funding.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars, as
measured by the 12-month cross-currency basis swap, fell to as
low as 78.75 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate,
or Euribor, indicating a higher premium to buy the greenback,
according to Bloomberg data. Basis swaps allow banks to borrow
in one currency, while simultaneously lending in another.  Italian bonds fell even as the  European Central Bank  was
said to buy the nation’s securities. The yield on the 10-year
bond rose 16 basis points to 5.57 percent. The nation’s two-year
yields jumped 36 basis points to 4.51 percent.  Spain ’s 10-year
rates advanced 17 basis points to 5.32 percent, and two-year
yields climbed 22 basis points to 3.82 percent.  Supply ‘Test’  Italy  sold 11.5 billion euros of bills today, while Spain
will auction securities due in 2019 and 2020 on Sept. 15.  “We’ve got some supply in Italy and Spain this week which
will be a test for the market,” said Philip Tyson, head of
interest-rate strategy at MF Global UK Ltd. in London. “It’s
going to remain very difficult.”  The Italian Treasury sold 7.5 billion euros of one-year
bills at an average yield of 4.153 percent, compared with 2.959
percent the previous sale of the securities on Aug. 10. Demand
dropped to 1.53 times the amount on offer, from 1.94.  The Treasury also sold 4 billion euros of three-month
bills. The yield was 1.907 percent, up from 1.034 percent the
last time such securities were sold, on March 10. The bid-to-
cover ratio declined to 1.86 versus 2.42.  Italy is scheduled to sell up to 4 billion euros of 4.75
percent notes maturing in September 2016 tomorrow. It also plans
to sell debt due in 2018, and two bonds due in 2020.  ECB Buying  Italian bonds pared losses as the ECB bought the securities
in the secondary markets, according to two people with knowledge
of the transactions. A spokesman for the Frankfurt-based central
bank declined to comment.  The ECB began purchasing Spanish and Italian bonds on Aug.
8 to curb a surge in yields as contagion from the debt crisis
that engulfed Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  spread to the
region’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  The ECB said today it settled 14 billion euros of bond
purchases in the week through Sept. 9, up from 13.3 billion
euros the previous week.  The ECB left  interest rates  on hold at 1.5 percent on Sept.
8. It has increased its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points
twice in the last six months, on April 7 and July 7, from a
record low 1 percent.  A Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps shows traders
are betting the ECB will lower its refinancing rate by 32 basis
points over the next 12 months. As recently as Aug. 1, they
forecast an increase of 25 basis points.  German bunds have returned 8.1 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Greek bonds slid 32 percent,
while Italy’s have declined 2.1 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
