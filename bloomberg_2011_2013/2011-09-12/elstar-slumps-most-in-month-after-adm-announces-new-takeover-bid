Elstar Oils SA (ELS) , a Polish producer
of edible oils and biofuels, fell the most in a month after its
majority owner agreed to sell the stake to Archer Daniels
Midland Co., ending a battle for control over the company.  Elstar slumped as much as 9.1 percent to 6 zloty, the
biggest intraday drop since Aug. 9. The stock traded 3.5 percent
lower at 6.37 zloty at 1:04 p.m. in Warsaw, valuing the producer
based in Elblag, northern  Poland , at 307 million zloty ($96
million). Its stock price has more than doubled from an August
low as ADM, the world’s largest grain processor, and  Bunge Ltd. (BG) 
competed to take over the company.  ADM yesterday raised the price in its bid to 6.5 zloty a
share from 5.5 zloty a share it proposed last month and signed a
deal with Chief Executive Officer Stanislaw Rosnowski, under
which the holder of a 51 percent stake agreed not sell his
shares to other bidders, Elstar said in a regulatory filing.  “The deal actually ends the whole battle,” Robert Maj, a
Warsaw-based analyst at KBC Securities, said by phone.  Bunge, the U.S. trader and processor of agricultural
commodities that already owns Polish vegetable oil producer
 Zaklady Tluszczowe Kruszwica SA (KSW) , offered to buy Elstar at 6.75
zloty a share, according to a statement by the broker managing
the bid on Sept. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
