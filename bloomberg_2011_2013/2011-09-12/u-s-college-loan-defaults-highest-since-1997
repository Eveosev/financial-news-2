Borrowers defaulted on federal
student loans at an 8.8 percent rate for fiscal 2009, up from 7
percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Education Department  said
today.  The statistic covers borrowers whose first loan repayments
were due during the year that ended Sept. 30, 2009, and who had
defaulted by Sept. 30, 2010. About 320,000 out of 3.6 million
borrowers in that group were in default, which the department
defines as being at least 270 days late on a payment. The
official 2009 rate fell slightly from an 8.9 percent estimate
released in May.  The rate at for-profit colleges, such as University of
Phoenix owner  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , rose to 15 percent in fiscal
2009, from 11.6 percent a year earlier.  “Borrowers are struggling in the economy,” Education
Deputy Undersecretary  James Kvaal  told reporters on a conference
call. “We do see a strong relationship between student loan
default rates and unemployment rates.”  The 2009 rate was the highest since an 8.8 default rate in
1997, while less than half the peak of 22.4 percent in 1990.  “Certainly, right now, things are tough, even for college
graduates,” said Lauren Asher, president of the nonprofit
Institute for College Access and Success in Oakland,  California .  The U.S. unemployment rate has been at 8.8 percent or
higher since April 2009.  Loan Amounts  The 2009 defaults represented about $2.4 billion, out of
$46.6 billion of loans to borrowers who faced their first
payments in that fiscal year, the education department said.  Most of the loans will be collected sooner or later, Kvaal
said. The government can require employers to withhold part of a
borrower’s paycheck, file lawsuits or use collection agencies,
and may recoup money from tax refunds or other government
payments.  Defaults understate the number of students who are facing
difficulty making loan payments, reflecting the “tip of the
iceberg in terms of borrower distress,” Asher said.  The statistics released today measure defaults over two
years after the borrowers begin to face repayment of  student
loans . The department plans to shift to a practice of measuring
defaults over three years, which likely will increase the rate,
Asher said.  The biggest impact of default is on students who face
damaged credit ratings, Asher said. “The consequences of
default are severe for borrowers and can affect them for a
lifetime,” she said.  For-Profit Colleges  Growth in for-profit colleges, which had disproportionately
high default rates, contributed to the rise in the default rate,
Kvaal said. More than 150,000 of the 320,000 2009 defaults were
at for-profit institutions, according to the department.  Default rates  among students at for-profit colleges have
led the Obama administration to increase regulation and Congress
and state attorneys general to conduct investigations.  Borrowers attending for-profit colleges defaulted at more
than twice the 7.2 percent rate for those at public colleges and
three times the 4.6 percent rate at private nonprofit
institutions, according to the Education Department.  Since the 2009 group of borrowers took out loans, the
Education Department has introduced a program that caps
repayment amounts based on income and family size. The income-
based repayment plan can help students handle their debts, Asher
said, though it’s not available after a borrower defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
