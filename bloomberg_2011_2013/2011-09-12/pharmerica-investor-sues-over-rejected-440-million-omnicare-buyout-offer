PharMerica Corp. (PMC) ’s rejection of
 Omnicare Inc. (OCR) ’s $440.8 million buyout offer unfairly
shortchanged shareholders, a pension fund said in a lawsuit.  Instead of seriously weighing Omnicare’s $15-a-share bid,
PharMerica directors adopted an  anti-takeover defense  to
maintain control of the Louisville, Kentucky-based pharmacy-
services provider, the  Louisiana Municipal Police Employees
Retirement System  said in the suit filed in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. The fund asked a judge to order
PharMerica’s board to properly consider the bid.  “While Omnicare has shown a strong commitment to acquire
PharMerica, Omnicare will not wait around forever,” the pension
fund said in the complaint filed Sept. 9. Without judicial
intervention, PharMerica investors “may lose out on the
opportunity to obtain a substantial premium on their
investment,” the fund said.  Omnicare, based in Covington,  Kentucky , began a tender
offer to buy PharMerica for about $440.8 million in cash to
seize a majority of the market to distribute drugs to nursing
homes, hospitals and hospices.  The deal would combine the country’s two largest
institutional pharmacies and might bring scrutiny from antitrust
regulators, A.J. Rice, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial
Group, said when the offer was first announced.  PharMerica won’t comment on the lawsuit, Meghan Stafford, a
company spokeswoman, said today in a telephone interview.  Poison-Pill Suit  PharMerica’s board rejected Omnicare’s offer Aug. 23 and
later adopted a so-called “poison pill” takeover defense
designed to make acquisitions of the company exorbitantly
expensive. Omnicare sued PharMerica in  Delaware  Chancery Court
on Sept. 7 seeking to have the defense invalidated.  The pension fund contends PharMerica’s directors are
violating legal duties to shareholders by refusing to negotiate
with Omnicare over the bid.  “Instead of using Omnicare’s strong interest as leverage
to negotiate for a higher price, the board has decided to hide
behind” the poison-pill defense, according to the complaint.
“PharMerica’s unreasonable response to the Omnicare offer
renders the poison pill an entrenching rampart.”  The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Collins, CA 6851, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
