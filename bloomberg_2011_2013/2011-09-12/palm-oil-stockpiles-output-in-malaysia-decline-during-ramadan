Palm oil  stockpiles in Malaysia,
the second-biggest grower, dropped for a second month in August
as output declined during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  Inventory of the edible oil, used mostly in food, fell 5.6
percent to 1.88 million metric tons from 2 million tons in July,
the  Malaysian Palm Oil Board  said in a statement today. That was
lower than the median estimate of 1.9 million tons in a
Bloomberg News survey of three analysts and two plantation
companies last week.  Falling inventories may help stem a decline in prices,
which have slumped 23 percent from a 35-month high of 3,967
ringgit ($1,308) a ton on Feb. 10, and raise costs for users
including Nestle SA and Unilever. Output fell to 1.67 million
tons in August from 1.75 million tons in July, while shipments
declined 2.7 percent to 1.69 million tons from a record 1.74
million tons in July, the board said.  “In the near term, there is some upside potential” for
prices,  Ben Santoso , a plantation analyst at HwangDBS Vickers
Research Sdn., said by phone from  Singapore  today. “If the
inventory goes down, then it helps.”  Palm oil for November delivery gained as much as 0.9
percent to 3,076 ringgit a ton and traded at 3,056 ringgit at
3:16 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . The commodity has increased 14
percent in the past year.  Exports Drop  The “export drop was slightly less pronounced than
production, so that naturally led to stockpiles dropping,”
Arhnue Tan, senior investment analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn.,
said by phone from Kuala Lumpur today. The data was “pretty
much within expectations, especially the drop in production,
since it was Ramadan month.”  Output in  Malaysia  and  Indonesia , the biggest growers,
usually declines during Ramadan, which began Aug. 1 and preceded
the Eid festival on Aug. 30 this year, as foreign workers head
home for the festivities or work shorter shifts. Harvest
typically peaks between July and October.  Production may rebound in September as workers return from
holidays and boost stockpiles, Tan said.  “Exports should be flat, I don’t see any festivals coming
up that could drive exports, except for Diwali, but that’s just
one country,” Tan said, referring to  India  where the majority
of the population is Hindu.  Production in Malaysia is forecast to reach 18.3 million
tons in the 2010-2011 season, compared with 17.8 million tons a
year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a
report dated Sept. 2. Stockpiles at the end of September are
expected to decline to 1.86 million tons as the outlook for
exports looked “bright”, it said.  Production totaled 12 million tons in the January-August
period, 8.2 percent more than a year earlier, while shipments
have gained 3.8 percent to 11.3 million tons, according to the
board data.  Exports fell 36 percent to 337,038 tons in the first 10
days of September from a month earlier, independent market
surveyor Intertek said on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
