Serena Williams  won’t be banned
from future U.S. Open tennis tournaments for verbally abusing an
umpire during yesterday’s final loss against Samantha Stosur.
Williams was fined $2,000.  The outburst, which came after Williams was penalized a
point for shouting during play, did not violate her probation
from a 2009 offense when she berated an umpire during her
semifinal loss to  Kim Clijsters , tournament referee Brian Earley
also said in a statement.  The announcement was made less than two hours before  Rafael Nadal  and Novak Djokovic were scheduled to play the men’s final
of the Grand Slam tournament at the National Tennis Center in
New York.  “This fine is consistent with similar offenses at Grand
Slam events,” the U.S. Tennis Association said in the
statement. “After independently reviewing the incident which
served as the basis for the code violation, and taking into
account the level of fine imposed by the  U.S. Open  referee, the
Grand Slam Committee director has determined that Ms. Williams’s
conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a
major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct.”  Down a set in yesterday’s match she eventually lost 6-2, 6-
3 to Stosur of  Australia , Williams, a 29-year-old American,
angrily reacted to chair umpire Eva Asderaki when she was given
a game-ending one-point penalty upon shouting “Come on!” after
hitting what she thought was a clean winner.  Stosur, the No. 9 seed, managed to get her racket on the
ball, leading the umpire to issue a code violation. Williams
criticized the umpire, and continued to berate her during a 90-
second changeover two games later.  Not Intentional  Williams, U.S. Open champion in 1999, 2002 and 2008, was
fined $175,000 and given a suspended ban from the tournament in
2009 after being issued a match-ending penalty in a semifinal
loss to Clijsters when she argued over a foot-fault call.  Williams said after yesterday’s match that she didn’t
intentionally yell out during play to interfere with Stosur and
that she didn’t know the rule that cost her a point. Marion Bartoli of  France  was similarly penalized against American
Christina McHale earlier in the tournament, also after yelling
“Come on!” during play.  “I thought it was a clear winner,” Williams said at a
news conference last night. “I thought it was like the hat-drop
rule, where if you drop a hat you kind of replay the point.”  ‘Out of Control’  After being told of the one-point violation, Williams
scolded Asderaki immediately and throughout the side change two
games later. The comments were picked up by microphones for CBS
Corp., which televised the match, and replayed several times.  “Aren’t you the one who screwed me over last time here?”
Williams asked Asderaki. “I promise you, that’s not cool.
That’s totally not cool.”  Williams won the next two games and took a 2-1 advantage
into the side change, when she spent most of the time talking to
Asderaki, with comments such as, “Don’t even look at me.”  “If you ever see me walking down the hall, look the other
way, because you’re totally out of control,” Williams said as
she sat in her chair next to Asderaki’s. “You’re a hater and
unattractive inside.”  Williams said afterward at the news conference that she had
no recollection of the comments and she had no idea what she was
referring to in bringing up an earlier episode with Asderaki.
Asked again if she confused the umpire with the one who
penalized her against Clijsters, she said, “I don’t know.
Maybe. Probably for sure.”  Handshake  Williams didn’t shake hands with the umpire or look at
Asderaki as she left the court after the 73-minute match, which
gave Stosur her first Grand Slam title.  Williams was one game from losing her 2009 match with
Clijsters when she received a foot-fault call on her second
serve at 15-30. She turned and verbally abused the lineswoman
who made the call and was given her second code violation of the
match, after smashing her racket at the end of the first set.
The penalty cost Williams a point and the match.  Two days later, Williams apologized to the lineswoman,
Clijsters, the USTA and tennis fans for what she called “my
inappropriate outburst.”  Williams, who missed the 2010 tournament due to injury, was
fined $175,000 in November 2009 for verbal abuse of the
lineswoman. The fine, handed down by a committee comprised of
officials from all four Grand Slams, included a provision that
it would be reduced to $82,500 if Williams didn’t have any more
major offenses through 2011. If Williams is found guilty of a
major offense in any Grand Slam, she would be suspended from the
U.S. Open, held annually in  New York , the committee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
