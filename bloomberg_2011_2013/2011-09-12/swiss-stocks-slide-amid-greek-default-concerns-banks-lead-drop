Swiss stocks declined for a second
day amid speculation that the German government is preparing for
 Greece  to default on its sovereign debt.  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) , the biggest Swiss insurer,
fell 4.3 percent. Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG, the
second-largest Swiss transport company, slipped 5.9 percent.
 Adecco SA (ADEN) , the largest supplier of temporary workers, dropped
2.9 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the 20 biggest and
most actively traded companies, decreased 2.4 percent to
5,303.14 at the 5:30 p.m. in Zurich. The benchmark measure rose
1.3 percent last week as the central bank set a ceiling on the
Swiss franc’s exchange rate for the first time in more than
three decades. The broader Swiss Performance Index lost 2.3
percent today.  “Volatility around the euro zone is rising to new heights
as the Germans may be preparing for a Greek default,” said
Witold Bahrke, a senior strategist at PFA Pension A/S, which
manages $45 billion, in Copenhagen. “The likelihood of the more
extreme scenarios like a disorderly Greek default, which people
didn’t really believe in before, is growing.”  Officials in German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government
are debating how to shore up domestic banks should Greece fail
to meet the budget-cutting terms of its aid package, three
coalition officials said on Sept. 9.  Banking Stocks  A gauge of European banks dropped 4.6 percent, for the
worst performance on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as two people
with knowledge of the matter said Moody’s Investors Service may
cut the ratings of the three biggest French banks -- BNP Paribas
SA, Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA -- this week
because of their holdings of Greek sovereign debt.  In Zurich,  UBS AG (UBSN) , the biggest Swiss lender, fell 2.4
percent to 10.30 francs.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the 121-year-
old Swiss wealth manager, dropped 3.3 percent to 28.50 francs.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. declined 2.9 percent to 37.49 francs.
 Europe ’s second-biggest re-insurer said in an e-mailed statement
that the current economic environment with “volatile stock
markets” poses a “significant challenge” to the industry.
Zurich Financial Services lost 4.3 percent to 159.50 francs as
insurers were among the worst performers in the Stoxx 600.  The cost of insuring corporate debt rose to the highest
level in 2 1/2 years, according to JPMorgan. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose
5 basis points to 197.  The benchmark index for European  stock options  climbed to
its highest level since January 2009. The VStoxx Index, which
measures the cost of protecting against a decline in shares on
the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, rose 7.5 percent to 53.55 in Frankfurt,
having earlier climbed as much as 13 percent.  Panalpina sank 5.9 percent to 76.20 francs. Adecco slipped
2.9 percent to 32.68 francs.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-
biggest cement maker, dropped 2.7 percent to 44.27 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
