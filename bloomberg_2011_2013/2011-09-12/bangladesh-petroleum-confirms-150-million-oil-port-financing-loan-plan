Bangladesh Petroleum Corp. hired
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc to
arrange a $150 million loan, Chairman Muqtadir Ali confirmed
today.  “The banks will organize a roadshow in Singapore on
Sept. 26 and Sept. 27 to raise the syndicated loan,” Ali said
in a phone interview from Dhaka today. The loan is being
guaranteed by the central bank and is not underwritten, he said.  The loan is a short-term oil and port financing and has an
average life of six months, Ali said. The loan pays a margin of
275 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
