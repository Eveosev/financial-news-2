Gold futures rose as mounting
European debt woes and the dollar’s drop spurred demand for the
metal as an alternative asset.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she won’t let  Greece 
go into “uncontrolled insolvency” as politicians try to limit
contagion to other euro members. Greece’s budget gap widened 22
percent in the eight months ended Aug. 31. The greenback fell as
much as 1 percent against a basket of six major currencies.  “Concerns about Greece have not abated,” Sterling Smith,
an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul , Minnesota, said
in a telephone interview. “The weaker dollar is also lending
support.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $16.80, or 0.9
percent, to close at $1,830.10 an ounce on the Comex at 2:01
p.m. in  New York . The price rose as high as $1,847.50 in trading
after the settlement. The metal has climbed 29 percent this
year, reaching a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  Greece’s perceived chance of default in the next five years
has soared to 98 percent, based on a standard pricing model of
credit-default swaps.  “The debt crisis of euro-zone peripherals remains the
dominant issue,”  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt, said in a report. “Gold should remain in
demand as a safe haven.”  Silver futures for December delivery gained 97.6 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $41.193 an ounce on the Comex. The price has
gained 33 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose $4.10, or 0.2 percent, to $1,813.50 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery climbed $17.15,
or 2.4 percent, to $728.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
