Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
Neel Kashkari said investors should buy equities because
valuations, income growth and dividends show the asset class is
attractive.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s price-earnings ratio sank
to a 28-month low of 12.2 last month, and then recovered to
12.5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The inverse of
that multiple, known as the earnings yield, shows income
represents 8 percent of the measure’s price, or 6.1 percentage
points more than the rate on 10-year Treasuries. That’s the
biggest gap since 2009, when the level was the highest in
Bloomberg data going back to 1962. The dividend payout is
exceeding bonds for the second period since the 1950s.  “Equities offer returns in three different ways: multiples
can expand, earnings can grow and through dividends,” Kashkari,
the head of global equities at Pimco, which manages about $1.3
trillion in assets, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness” with Margaret Brennan. “On all
three factors, equities look very attractive.”  S&P 500  earnings are poised to reach a record $99.88 a
share this year, according to the average of securities industry
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, after companies beat
projections for 10 straight quarters. Analysts have grown more
optimistic about earnings since the S&P 500 peaked on April 29,
driving their forecast up from $98.73 a share.  Earnings Growth  Between April 29 and Aug. 8, the S&P 500 fell 18 percent on
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread and U.S. economic
data weakened. The measure rose 3.1 percent since then through
Sept. 9. Analysts estimate companies in the gauge will see per-
share earnings rise 9.2 percent in 2011 from the prior year,
according the Bloomberg data. The measure’s dividend yield has
risen to 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent on Dec. 31.  “Volatility is here to stay,” Kashkari said in the
interview. Investors “need to be able to stomach that
volatility -- but if they do and they can, we think they’ll be
rewarded.” He said large corporations, especially those with
business in emerging markets, will have strong earnings growth
potential.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
benchmark measure of U.S. equity derivatives, jumped as high as
48 last month, its highest level since the  bull market  began in
2009, as investors sought protection from risky assets. It
closed at 38.52 on Sept. 9.  Kashkari, who joined  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco
in December 2009, was named head of global equities last week.
The firm, which has more than 90 percent of its assets in bonds,
has gathered about $4 billion in its stock funds since he joined
Pimco.  To contact the reporters on this story:
