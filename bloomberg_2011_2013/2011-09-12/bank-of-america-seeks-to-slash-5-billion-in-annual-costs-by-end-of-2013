Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, aims to cut about $5 billion in annual
costs by the end of 2013 as it implements a plan to restore
profitability and reverse the slide in its stock.  Savings will come from the first phase of the overhaul
known as Project New BAC, Chief Executive Officer  Brian T.
Moynihan  said in a presentation to investors today. He didn’t
specify the number of employees to be affected by job cuts.  “We can get out of things we don’t need to do, make the
company leaner, more straightforward, more driven,” Moynihan
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
