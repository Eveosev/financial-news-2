The trial of about 30 people
arrested on Sept. 8 during protests outside a court in  Angola ’s
capital, Luanda, is scheduled to start tomorrow, Radio Ecclesia
said, citing Deputy Police Commissioner Paulo de Almeida.  They face charges relating to allegations that they threw
stones at police vehicles, Ecclesia said.  The arrests occurred as hundreds of people demonstrated in
front of the court, where proceedings were taking place against
21 people who were detained after Sept. 3 protests against
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and power and water shortages
in  Africa ’s second-biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
