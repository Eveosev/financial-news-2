China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. (688) , a builder controlled by the country’s construction
ministry, fell to a four-month low in Hong Kong trading after
saying property sales in August declined 11 percent.  The Hong Kong-based builder plunged as much as 9.3 percent
to HK$14.02 and traded at HK$14.12 as of 1:37 p.m., heading for
its lowest level since May 18 on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Property sales last month decreased to HK$4.4 billion ($564
million), according to the company.  China plans to rein in residential prices in smaller cities
after limiting home purchases in metropolitan areas including
Beijing and  Shanghai . The People’s Bank of China has raised
 interest rates  five times over the past year and curbed lending
by boosting banks’ reserve requirements.  “We believe  China  Overseas Land & Investment’s September
sales should not be that strong, given the severely weakened
home buyer sentiment,” Jinsong Du, Wenhan Chen and Duo Chen,
research analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in an e-mailed
note today. “ We don’t expect a strong sales turnaround.”  Credit Suisse rated the stock “underperform” with a
target price of HK$13.00.  China’s August housing transactions rose 3.6 percent from
the previous month as developers started selling homes in new
projects on concern the government may impose more tightening
policies.  The benchmark one-year lending rate is 6.56 percent and the
one-year deposit rate is 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
