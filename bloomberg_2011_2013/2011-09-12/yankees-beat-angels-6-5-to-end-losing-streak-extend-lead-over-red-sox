The  New York Yankees  halted a
season-high four-game losing streak with a 6-5 victory over the
Los Angeles Angels.  The Yankees trailed 5-4 yesterday in Anaheim,  California ,
before scoring the go-ahead runs in the seventh inning on a
fielding error by Angels center fielder Peter Bourjos.  With Boston’s 9-1 loss to the  Tampa Bay Rays , the Yankees
extended their lead over the  Red Sox  atop the American League
East to 3 1/2 games. New York, which improved to 88-57, has 17
games left in the regular season.  Curtis Granderson and Robinson Cano hit home runs, while
Mariano Rivera picked up his 599th career save, moving within
two of Trevor Hoffman’s Major League Baseball record.  The Angels fell 2 1/2 games behind the AL West-leading
Texas Rangers, who beat the Oakland Athletics 8-1 yesterday as
C.J. Wilson pitched eight shutout innings.  Jose Valverde set a Detroit record with his 43rd save of
the season yesterday, helping the Tigers beat the Minnesota
Twins 2-1 for their ninth straight win. The Tigers (84-62) lead
the AL Central by 10 1/2 games and have their longest winning
streak since 1984, when they won the World Series.  The Milwaukee Brewers ended a five-game losing skid with a
3-2 win over the National League East-leading Philadelphia
Phillies. Ryan Braun drove in the go-ahead run in the seventh
inning for the Brewers, who lead the NL Central by six games.  The St. Louis Cardinals beat Atlanta 6-3 to complete a
three-game series sweep and pull within 4 1/2 games of the
Braves in the NL wild-card playoff race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
