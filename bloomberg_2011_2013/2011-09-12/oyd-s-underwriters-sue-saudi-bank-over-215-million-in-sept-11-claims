Members of Lloyd’s of  London ’s
Syndicate 3500 sued Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank and
other defendants seeking the recovery of $215 million in claims
paid to victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  National Commercial, Saudi Arabia’s largest lender, and
other Islamic banks and charities helped fund or channel funds
to Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network, which was responsible for
the attacks in  New York  and  Washington , lawyers for the
syndicate said in a complaint filed last week in federal court
in Pittsburgh.  “Absent the sponsorship of al Qaeda’s material sponsors
and supporters, including the defendants named herein, al Qaeda
would not have possessed the capacity to conceive, plan and
execute the September 11th attacks,” according to the
complaint.  The suit seeks recovery of amounts paid in settlement of
Sept. 11 aviation cases. The families of about 600 people killed
in the attacks sued National Commercial in 2002 seeking to
freeze the assets of the bank.  The case is Underwriting Members of Lloyd’s Syndicate 3500
