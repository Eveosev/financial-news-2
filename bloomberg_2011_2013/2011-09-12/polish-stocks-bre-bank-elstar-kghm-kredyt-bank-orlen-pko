Poland’s WIG20 Index tumbled 77.51,
or 3.5 percent, to 2,171.23 at 10:13 a.m. in Warsaw, heading for
the lowest close in two years.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, fell to
a two-year low, sliding 1.5 zloty, or 4.9 percent, to 29.4
zloty.  BRE Bank SA (BRE)  , a unit of Commerzbank AG, declined
15.4 zloty, or 6.8 percent, to 211 zloty and  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  , which Belgium’s KBC Groep NV plans to sell, sank 0.6 zloty,
or 4.6 percent, to 12.4 zloty.  Financial shares dropped across  Europe  on concern Greece
may be nearing a default on its sovereign debt and after two
people with knowledge of the matter said BNP Paribas SA, Societe
Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA may have their ratings cut by
Moody’s Investors Service this week because of their holdings of
the Mediterranean nation’s debt.  Elstar Oils SA (ELS)   fell the most in a month, sliding
0.29 zloty, or 4.4 percent, to 6.31 zloty after Archer Daniels
Midland Co., the world’s largest grain processor, made a new
offer to take over the Polish producer of edible oils and
biofuels. ADM increased the price in its bid to 6.5 zloty a
share from 5.5 zloty a share, fending off a competitive offer
from Bunge Ltd. ADM also signed a deal with Stanislaw Rosnowski,
under which the holder of a 51 percent stake in Elstar agreed
not sell his shares to other bidders.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, retreated for a second day, losing
9.6 zloty, or 5.7 percent, to 158 zloty. Copper fell to the
lowest level in three weeks on concern that Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis may reduce industrial metal demand.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, sank
1.55 zloty, or 4.3 percent, to 34.88 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) ,
the second-largest refiner, declined 1.26 zloty, or 4.7 percent,
to 25.66 zloty. Oil dropped for a third day in  New York , the
longest losing streak in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
