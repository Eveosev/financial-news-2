Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond mutual fund at  Pacific Investment Management Co .,
increased his holdings of Treasuries to the highest level since
December 2010 after underperforming a majority of his peers.  The $245 billion Total Return Fund raised government and
Treasury debt to 16 percent of assets last month from 10 percent
in July, according to data posted on the  Newport Beach ,
California-based company’s  website  today. Mortgage holdings
climbed to 32 percent from 25 percent. Cash equivalents and
money-market securities dropped to negative 9 percent from 15
percent, the lowest level since November 2010.  Gross had been reducing the fund’s vulnerability to
interest-rate swings and increasing its reliance on  credit
quality  since July 2010 by shifting from Treasuries to corporate
and non-U.S. sovereign debt, a strategy that backfired last
month. As the  U.S. economy  slowed and Europe’s debt crisis
worsened, investors sought the safety of Treasuries and sold the
bonds Pimco had bet on, leaving the fund trailing 89 percent of
competitors in August and 67 percent this year through Sept. 8,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Treasuries have returned 8.5 percent in 2011 in what would
be their best year since the depths of the financial crisis in
2008, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. A
rally in Treasuries today pushed the 10-year Treasury note yield
down to a record 1.877 percent. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note has dropped 189 basis points since its 2011 high
of 3.766 percent in February.  Credit Risk  Gross has been adding to his holdings of Treasuries since
April after eliminating them from the fund’s portfolio in
February. The fund is now having its worst year versus rivals
based on records going back to 1995.  Gross bet almost $11 billion in the second quarter on an
index of U.S. corporate credit risk, raised the amount of
insurance the fund provides on sovereign debt and put $1.3
billion into Italian Treasury bonds linked to inflation,
according to an August regulatory filing.  The Total Return Fund has returned 3.97 percent in the past
year, beating 32 percent of its peers, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s down 0.1 percent over the past
month, beating 19 percent of its competitors. The firm managed
$1.34 trillion in assets as of June.  The global economic crisis is leading to a possible
“developed economy” recession in the U.S. and  Europe , which may
be hard to alleviate,  Gross said in an investment note on Aug.
30. Investors should look to  Australia ,  Mexico ,  Brazil  and
 Canada , along with non-dollar currencies that have strong ties
to the Asian continent, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
