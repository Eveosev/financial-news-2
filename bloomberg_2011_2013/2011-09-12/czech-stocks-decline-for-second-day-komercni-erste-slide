Czech shares fell the most in a
week as speculation mounted that  Germany  is preparing for  Greece 
to default.  The PX gauge of 14 companies shed 3.7 percent to close at
947.1, its biggest one-day decline since Sept. 5, as banks and
commodity producers declined on concern Greece may be nearing a
default on its sovereign debt.  “Erste and Komercni that represent some 40 percent of the
weight in the index are dragging the benchmark down,” Martin
Krajhanzl, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS, said by phone in
Prague. “Central European Media is catching up with losses in
the U.S.”  The German government is debating how to shore up banks
should Greece fail to meet the budget-cutting terms of its aid
package, coalition officials said on Sept. 9. BNP Paribas SA,
Societe Generale SA and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  may have their
ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service this week because of
their holdings of Greek debt, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , a unit of France’s Societe Generale,
fell 150 koruna, or 4.5 percent, to 3,200 koruna in Prague.
Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  declined 31 koruna, or 5.8
percent, to 506 koruna.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV) 
lost 9.5 percent to 176.7 koruna in Prague trading.  Czech coal mining company New World Resources Plc tumbled
6.6 percent to 150.5 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
