The price gap between raw sugar for
October delivery traded in  New York  and the March contract
widened, indicating lower-than-estimated Brazilian supply and
less chance of a delivery from the  Philippines .  October sugar was 1.77 cents a pound more expensive than
March-delivery sweetener on ICE Futures U.S., more than double
the level of 0.8 cent on Aug. 31, data on Bloomberg showed. A
potential delivery of Philippine sugar curbed interest in
October futures, Lausanne, Switzerland-based broker and
researcher Kingsman SA said Sept. 1.  “Sugar has suddenly seen its structure firm up
substantially as the concern over Philippine sugar delivery has
faded somewhat,”  Michael McDougall , senior vice president at
Newedge Group in New York, wrote in a report e-mailed today.
“The trade realizes that Brazilian sugar availability is much
less than originally thought.”  Sugar from the Asian nation is of inferior quality to
sweetener from top global producer  Brazil , according to
Kingsman. The ICE October contract expires at the end of this
month.  Elevated premiums to obtain Brazilian sugar in the physical
market may spur interest in obtaining supplies from the country
on ICE, Kingsman said Sept. 9.  Sugar-cane output in Brazil’s Center South, the nation’s
main producing region, will fall for the first time in a decade,
according to industry group Unica. The nation’s harvest may be
completed in 2 1/2 months, with some mills finishing early
because of a lack of cane supplies, researcher F.O. Licht GmbH
said in a report on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
