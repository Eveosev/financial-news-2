Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to rise the most in almost two
months, after the government offered to buy back as much as 39.5
trillion pesos ($22 billion) worth of local debt as it seeks to
issue new securities maturing in August 2026.  The  Finance Ministry  on Sept. 9  announced its plan  to
repurchase peso bonds due April 2012, August 2012, April 2013,
November 2013 and May 2014, and offer in return peso debt due
October 2015, October 2018 and August 2026. The swap will be
carried out Sept. 20, according to a statement.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.29
percent at 2:08 p.m. New York time. That’s its biggest increase
on a closing basis since July 18. The bond’s price fell 0.636
centavo to 122.132 centavos per peso.  “Given the swap will result in a reduced supply of bonds
in the short end of the curve and more bonds in the long end,
the market is reacting accordingly with declines in longer-term
bonds,” said  Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA,
Colombia’s second-biggest bank.  Colombia’s local bonds and the peso are also dropping as
speculation  Germany  is preparing for a Greek debt default hurt
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets, according to
Perez.  The peso plunged 1.2 percent to 1,820.99 per dollar, from
1,798.80 on Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
