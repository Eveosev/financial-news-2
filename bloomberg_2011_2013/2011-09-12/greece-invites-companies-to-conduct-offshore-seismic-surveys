Greece   invited  companies to apply
to conduct non-exclusive seismic surveys in its western and
southern offshore areas.  The objective of the surveys is to ensure data acquisition,
processing and interpretation, including reprocessing and
interpretation of existing data, in accordance to the highest
present day oil and gas industry standards, the Athens-based
 Energy Ministry  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The data will assist in the evaluation of the hydrocarbon
potential of maritime areas to the west of the Greek mainland
and to the south of the island of Crete, according to the
statement. It will be used to promote a subsequent international
licensing round for oil and gas exploration and exploitation
which is targeted for 2012, the ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
