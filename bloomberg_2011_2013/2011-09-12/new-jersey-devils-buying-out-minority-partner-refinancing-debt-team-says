The  New Jersey Devils  are close to
buying out minority shareholder Brick City’s share of the
National Hockey League team and refinancing debt, the team said
in a press release.  The team said it was “confident a refinancing will be
completed shortly.”  The Devils reported that season ticket sales are up 130
percent over last year and that last week’s sale of single-game
tickets was 260 percent above last year’s numbers at this time.  Forbes magazine last year estimated the Devils were worth
$218 million, No. 11 in the league, down 2 percent from the
previous year.  Curt Ritter , a spokesman for CIT Group Inc., the Devils’
lead lender, declined to comment.  Jeffrey Vanderbeek, a former member of the executive
committee at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., took control of the
team in 2004 in a sale valued at $125 million, according to
Forbes.  Vanderbeek ran Lehman’s capital markets division from 2000
to 2002, then became head of global risk management, private
equity and strategy when the company was the fourth-biggest
securities firm by capital. He left in 2004 to run the Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
