Tanzania’s shilling weakened to a
17-year low against the dollar as commercial banks increased
demand for the U.S. currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second biggest economy lost
as much as 1.7 percent to 1,659.7 per dollar, the weakest since
October 1994, and traded 0.1 percent down at 1,634.5 by 12:44
p.m in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  “It is interbank trade that is influencing the shilling
movement today,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of
Commerce, Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone.
“More banks have been demanding dollars which caused the
shilling to depreciate sharply.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
