The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
pared its decline after a Financial Times report that Italy was
in talks with  China  about possible bond purchases.  The MSCI gauge dropped 2.4 percent to 968.66 at 4:06 p.m.
in  New York , after earlier falling as much as 3 percent. The
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index fund, which holds
developing-nation stocks and trades on U.S. exchanges, slipped
0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
