Diageo Plc (DGE) ’s Ghanaian unit received
approval from the West African nation’s capital market regulator
to raise 70 million cedis ($45 million) by selling stock to
shareholders to pay debt and invest in infrastructure.  Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL)  obtained consent from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Ghana Stock Exchange
for the offer, the company said in a statement published in the
Accra-based Business and Financial Times newspaper today.
Shareholders first approved the offer on June 14.  The offer runs from Oct. 17 to Nov. 14, and will sell about
46.7 million shares at 1.5 cedis each, it said.  “Proceeds from the offer will enable Guinness Ghana to
reduce its trade and interest-bearing debt and allow the company
to continue to invest in capital projects to take advantage of
growth opportunities in  Ghana ,” it said.  Guinness, which makes the stout beer in the West African
nation along with Star lager and other beverages, will spend 40
million cedis to pay down debt, Chairman David Harlock said on
June 14. Another 29 million cedis will be invested in
infrastructure, water supply and electricity at the company’s
plants, he said.  Guinness Ghana shares were unchanged at 1.57 cedis as of
11:41 a.m. in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
