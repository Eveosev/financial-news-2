China ’s renminbi may displace the
dollar as the world’s main reserve currency within a decade,
according to Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson
Institute for International Economics, based in Washington D.C.  Writing in the Financial Times, Subramanian said China has
almost caught up with the U.S. as an economic power, with an
economy about as large in terms of purchasing power and much
greater exports and overseas assets.  While that doesn’t make the rise of China’s currency
inevitable, it creates the conditions for it, he said.  China still has to carry wide-ranging policy reforms, but
the internationalization of the renminbi is being pursued in a
characteristically Chinese way -- micromanaged, interventionist
and enclave-based, Subramanian said.  The granting of greater but selective access to the
renminbi to some foreign entity or country, such as last week’s
initiative to promote  London  as an offshore trading center for
the currency, has become a frequent occurrence, he said.  China has a reason for turning the renminbi into a reserve
currency, namely that it offers a way out of the decades-old and
controversial growth strategy of keeping the currency
undervalued and the economy closed to foreign capital,
Subramanian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
