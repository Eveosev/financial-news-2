Samantha Stosur finally gave
Australian women a spot in a special place at the U.S. Open.  An engraved metal panel in the Court of Champions leading
toward the tournament’s main arena lists every singles winner
since the event moved to the National Tennis Center in  New York 
in 1978. Until yesterday, no Australian woman had made the list.  Stosur, a native of Brisbane in Queensland state, defeated
three-time champion  Serena Williams  of the U.S. 6-2, 6-3 to
become the first woman from her homeland to win the title since
Margaret Court in 1973.  “I didn’t start playing to break records or anything like
that,'' Stosur said in a news conference. ``My goal and dream 
since I started was to win a Grand Slam. Being an Australian
with that great history, and now to break that drought, is
obviously very special.”  Stosur, 27, won her first Grand Slam title and became the
first Australian woman to capture any of tennis’s four major
tournaments since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980 at Wimbledon.  Stosur, a former top-ranked doubles player, was in her
second major final, having lost to Francesca Schiavone of  Italy 
at the 2010 French Open championship match.  “If I was going to win, I didn’t think that I’d be able to
do it in 6-2, 6-3, that’s for sure,” Stosur said. “After that
first set I kind of sat down and I could feel my heart pounding
out of my chest and I thought, ‘OK, I’m a set up now, I’ve got a
chance to win one out of the next two.’”  Stosur’s first singles title in New York follows another
record-setting run at the year’s final major. Her three-set
victory against  Russia ’s  Maria Kirilenko  in the fourth round
featured the longest tiebreaker in women’s Grand Slam history at
32 points. It came a year after she played in the tournament’s
latest-finishing women’s match.  ‘Cracking the Ball’  Williams, a 13-time Grand Slam champion, took a 4-2 career
record against Stosur into the final, including a 6-4, 6-2 win
in mid-August in Toronto.  “She was cracking them today,” Williams, 29, said in a
news conference. “She definitely hit hard and just went for
broke.”  The last time an Australian took the  U.S. Open  women’s
crown was when Court claimed her record-extending 24th women’s
major singles title. The tournament was then held on grass at
the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York.  At least one Australian woman was in the U.S. Open final in
eight of the nine years from 1969 to 1977 -- Court in 1969 and
1970; Kerry Reid in 1972; Court and Goolagong in 1973; Goolagong
in 1974-76; and Wendy Turnbull in 1977.  None had been in the final since the tournament moved to
its present location with hardcourts in 1978.  Former Doubles Player  Stosur started playing tennis at age 8 when a friend gave
her a racket as a Christmas present. She joined the Australian
Institute of Sport at 16 and turned professional in 1999.  Stosur, who reached the WTA Tour’s No. 1 ranking in doubles
in February 2006, was sidelined for 10 months after getting Lyme
disease in July 2007 and didn’t return to the women’s circuit
until June 2008. She won her first WTA singles title in  Osaka 
the following year.  At last year’s French Open, she became the first player
since 2000 to beat  Justine Henin  and Williams in the same Grand
Slam tournament, and ended Henin’s 24-match winning streak in
Paris.  “It’s obviously hard to compare today to any other
match,” Stosur said. “I’ve played matches where I feel like I
played lights out, but to do it in these circumstances in this
kind of final against a player like Serena, for sure I’m going
to think it’s one of the best days of my career.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
