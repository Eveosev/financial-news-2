Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  named Dereke
Seeto to head an Asia-Pacific team that provides stock loans,
swaps and synthetic products to hedge funds, the second-largest
Swiss bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  As Asia-Pacific head of flow financing, Seeto will report
to Matt Pecot, the Zurich-based bank’s head of prime services in
the region. He will move to  Hong Kong  from Sydney, where he was
head of prime services for Australia.  Seeto’s new responsibilities will include the provision of
stock loans and enabling hedge funds to access markets such as
India and China via equity swaps and synthetic products without
actually owning the stocks, or so-called “delta one” services.  Seeto has spent his entire career of more than 10 years
with the bank, focusing on equity swaps and financing businesses,
the e-mail said.  Credit Suisse’s  Australia  prime services will be jointly
led by Richard Wright, Graeme Anderson and Andrew Walker, the e-
mail added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
