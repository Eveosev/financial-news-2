New Zealand Oil & Gas Ltd. (NZO)  rose to
a seven-week high in Wellington trading after the receivers of
29 percent-owned associate  Pike River  Coal Co. Ltd. agreed to an
NZ$80 million ($65 million) insurance payment.  The move will allow Pike River to repay about NZ$41.3
million to New Zealand Oil, the Wellington-based company said in
a statement sent to the stock exchange. The  stock  gained 3 cents
to 71 cents as of the 5 p.m. close in Wellington, the highest
since July 25.  External managers were appointed to Pike River in December
after the company said it was unable to repay loans after a Nov.
11 explosion killed 29 workers and closed the mine. Bank of New
Zealand Ltd. will be paid its NZ$23 million debt as first
ranking secured creditor while New Zealand Oilâ€™s secured debt
falls to NZ$14.7 million from NZ$53 million and its unsecured
debt drops to NZ$12.1 million from NZ$15 million.  New Zealand Oil agreed to support a voluntary early payment
to all unsecured creditors, whereby all will receive NZ$10,000
and 20 cents on the dollar thereafter, it said. About 243
creditors will be paid in full and 222 will get part-payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
