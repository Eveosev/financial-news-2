Ford Motor Co. (F) , through a finance
arm, plans to sell C$534 million ($535 million) in bonds backed
by auto loans as investors demand the highest relative yields to
own the debt this year.  The securities are being offered publicly in  Canada ,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set. The issue
includes C$479.9 million in top-ranked bonds, the person said.  The highest-rated asset-backed securities are yielding 102
basis points more than Canada’s sovereign bonds, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Canadian Asset-Backed Index.
That compares with 79 basis points, or 0.79 percentage point, on
Dec. 31.  The automaker has sold $2.5 billion of similar debt this
year in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
