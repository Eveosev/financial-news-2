A Turkish business delegation
arrived in Mogadishu to evaluate the cost of proposed projects
in Mogadishu, the Somalia capital, following a visit by Prime
Minister Recep Erdogan to the city last month.  The group of about 200 people includes engineers, doctors
and businessmen, Saed Qorshel, the minister of state for
transport, told reporters.  Erdogan in August proposed projects including the
construction of a road that links Mogadishu’s main airport to
the presidential palace, as well as building hospitals and
schools.  Mogadishu’s infrastructure has been shattered by a two-
decade-long civil war that began when the dictatorship of
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991, the last time the country
had a functioning central administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
