Euro Solar Parks Inc (ESLP)  signed a
preliminary agreement with the southern Serbia city of Vranje
for the development of a 150 megawatt solar power plant.  The New Jersey-based company plans to initially develop a
10 megawatt facility and expand it to 150 megawatts over the
next five years, the municipal government of Vranje said in a
 statement  today on its  website . A 30-hectare location near
Vranje was chosen for the facility.  The investor is “in final negotiations” with Serbian
authorities for a power-purchasing agreement that would
guarantee it a favorable rate for future electricity production
from the initial 10 megawatt capacity. Further output will be
exported to the European Union, according to the statement. It
didn’t specify the size of the investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
