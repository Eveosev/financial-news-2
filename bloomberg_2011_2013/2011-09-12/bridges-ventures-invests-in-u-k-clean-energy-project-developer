Bridges Ventures Ltd., a U.K.-based
venture capital company, invested in Ardenham Energy Ltd. to
allow the developer and installer of renewable power projects in
homes, farms and businesses to grow outside  England ’s southeast.  Bridges Ventures, based in London, spent 2 million pounds
($3 million) on Ardenham, the investor said on its  website .  “The move towards a low carbon economy will see an
increasing need for organizations that can help individuals and
businesses produce renewable energy,” Tom Fourcade, investment
director at Bridges Ventures, said in the statement.  Ardenham installs solar photovoltaic panels, heat pumps,
 wind turbines  and solar thermal systems in the U.K., which plans
to get 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.  “Ardenham Energy can now expand its provision and
installation of renewable energy projects beyond the South East
to a much wider market,” Harry Shepherd-Cross, a director of
the installer, said in the statement today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
