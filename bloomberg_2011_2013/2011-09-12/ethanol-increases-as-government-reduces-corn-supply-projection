Ethanol futures increased in
 Chicago  after the U.S. government reduced its outlook for the
nation’s corn supply, threatening higher production costs for
the biofuel.  Futures gained after the Agriculture Department said corn
production will total 12.497 billion bushels (317.4 million
metric tons), less than the 12.914 billion forecast in August.
The grain is used to manufacture ethanol in the U.S.  “Ethanol’s higher and that definitely has something to do
with corn,” said Jim Damask, a manager at BiofuelsConnect, a
Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy broker. “Ethanol is
up just because the feedstock’s up. Corn stocks are pretty
tight.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery advanced 1.7 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.781 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since Sept. 7. Futures have gained 41
percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.925 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
jumped 4.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.01, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.95 a
gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 2 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.825.  Corn for December delivery climbed 9 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $7.455 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
