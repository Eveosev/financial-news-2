The  New York Jets ’ 27-24 comeback
victory over the Dallas Cowboys last night on NBC drew the
highest overnight rating in the network’s six years of
broadcasting Sunday night National Football League games.  The Jets victory, in which the team rallied from a 24-10
fourth-quarter deficit, was seen in 16.9 percent of U.S. homes
in the top 56 metered television markets, NBC said in a
statement citing  Nielsen Media Research . It eclipsed a Sept. 20,
2009, game between the Cowboys and New York Giants and a 2010
game between the Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles, both of which
drew 16.5 ratings.  Last night’s game was also the highest-rated NFL primetime
game on an opening Sunday or Monday night in 15 years, trailing
the Sept. 2, 1996, opener between the Cowboys and Chicago Bears,
which was seen in 20.3 percent of homes, according to the
release.  The game’s three highest-rated metered markets were Dallas,
 San Antonio  and Austin,  Texas . NBC, part of  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , began
airing Sunday night NFL games in 2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
