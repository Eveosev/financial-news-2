The cost of shipping Middle East
crude oil to  Asia , the world’s busiest trade route for
supertankers, dropped to the lowest level since January as a
surplus of vessels remained.  Charter rates for very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, on
the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route declined 0.5 percent
to 45.12 Worldscale points, the lowest this year since Jan. 28,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. The ships can
carry as much as 2 million-barrels worth of cargo. Daily returns
remained negative for an 11th straight day, dropping to minus
$3,624.  “A persistent profusion of tonnage continues to dominate
the market, preventing any rise in rates,” according to a
report from SSY Consultancy & Research e-mailed today. SSY
Consultancy & Research is part of Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd.,
the world’s second-largest shipbroker.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a wider measure of crude
transportation costs, increased 0.9 percent to 678 points,
according to the exchange, which assesses freight rates on
international maritime routes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
