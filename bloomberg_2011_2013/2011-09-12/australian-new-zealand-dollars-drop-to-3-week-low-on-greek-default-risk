The Australian dollar dropped to
the lowest level in a month against its U.S. counterpart as
concern  Greece  may default encouraged investors to sell
higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie weakened after  Germany ’s officials said last
week that the government is preparing to protect the nation’s
banks in the event Greece misses a payment on its debt. Demand
for  Australia ’s currency was also curbed after data showed the
nation’s trade surplus was narrower than economists forecast.  “Unless there’s some major statements from the European
authorities about resolving the debt situation, I think the
euro, Aussie and kiwi will all fall this week,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, the nation’s biggest lender.  Australia’s dollar depreciated 1.6 percent to $1.0307 at
12:11 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0470 on Sept. 9, after touching
$1.0276, the lowest level since Aug. 12. The New Zealand
currency traded at 82.03 U.S. cents, compared with 82.21, after
falling to 81.19, the weakest since Aug. 11.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.8 percent. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index of stocks fell 2.3 percent, and the MSCI
World Index sank 1.6 percent.  Officials in Germany’s government are debating how to shore
up the country’s banks in the event that Greece fails to meet
the budget-cutting terms of its aid package and is unable to get
a bailout-loan payment, three coalition officials said Sept. 9.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  agreed on the “paramount” importance of
the euro for Europe and Germany, the German government said
after the two met in Berlin today.  Australia’s exports exceeded imports by A$1.83 billion
($1.9 billion) in July, compared with a revised A$1.82 billion
surplus in the previous month, the Bureau of Statistics said
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for a surplus of A$1.9 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
