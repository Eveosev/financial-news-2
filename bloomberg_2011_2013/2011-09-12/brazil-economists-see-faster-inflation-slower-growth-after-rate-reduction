Analysts covering the Brazilian
economy raised their 2012 and 2013 inflation forecasts for a
second straight week, in the expectation that the central bank
will continue to lower  interest rates  this year.  Consumer prices will rise 5.40 percent next year and 4.80
percent in 2013, according to the median forecast in a Sept. 9
 central bank survey  of about 100 economists published today. The
forecasts were up from 5.32 percent and 4.6 percent respectively
the previous week.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini  cut  Brazil ’s
benchmark interest rate a half point to 12 percent on Aug. 31,
after raising it at the previous five policy meetings, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global economy. The central
bank will cut borrowing costs a half point at each of its two
remaining policy meetings this year, the survey found.  Economists expect the benchmark Selic to end this year at
11 percent, and cut their forecast for the 2012 year end Selic
to 11 percent, from 11.88 percent.  “Market economists still have a lot of resistance to
buying the central bank’s scenario that the crisis in Europe can
bring down commodities prices enough,” said  Andre Perfeito ,
chief economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos.
“Domestic demand is much more important for inflation right now
than outside factors.”  Rate Cuts  Perfeito expects the central bank to cut borrowing costs a
half point at each of its three next policy meetings.  In a report published today, Morgan Stanley cut its
interest rate forecast. The banks expects the Selic to fall to
11 percent this year, and 10.5 percent in 2012, from a previous
forecast of 12.5 percent this year and next. The central bank
may now be pursuing a “dual mandate” targeting growth as well
as consumer prices, the report said. Morgan Stanley also raised
its 2012 inflation forecast to 5.9 percent, from 5.2 percent.  This year, consumer prices as measured by the IPCA index
will rise 6.45 percent, the survey found, from a week-earlier
forecast of 6.38 percent.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 10.560 percent at 12:11
p.m. New York time. The real weakened 1.4 percent to 1.6970 per
dollar.  The economists cut their estimate for this year’s economic
growth for a sixth straight week, to 3.56 percent from 3.67
percent a week earlier. The economists also cut their 2012
growth forecast to 3.80 percent, from 3.84 percent.  The central bank will cut its own 2011 growth forecast from
its current 4 percent, as a slowdown in developed nations hits
Brazil, Tombini said in a television interview last week.
Tombini did not say what the new target will be.  Slower Growth  “Our vision of the world economy, hit with a quarter of
the force it was during the 2008 crisis but for a longer period
of time, means slower growth,” Tombini said. “We’re not
talking about a global recession, we are talking about a
deceleration in the world economy with ramifications for the
Brazilian economy and for inflation.”  World stock markets lost $5 trillion between the central
bank’s July and August policy meetings, as  Europe  grappled with
a sovereign debt crisis and growth in the U.S. showed signs of
slowing.  Consumer prices rose 7.23 percent in the year through
August, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the bank’s
target range for a fifth straight month. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
