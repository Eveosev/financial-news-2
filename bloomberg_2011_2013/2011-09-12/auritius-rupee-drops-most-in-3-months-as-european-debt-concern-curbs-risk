Mauritius’s rupee declined the most
in more than three months against the dollar as concern that
 Greece  will default on its debt caused the euro to weaken,
cutting demand for riskier assets. Stocks declined.  The currency of the Indian Ocean island nation weakened as
much as 2 percent, the most since June 6, to 28.8 per dollar,
and traded 1.4 percent down at 28.65 by 2:24 p.m. in  Port Louis ,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the
euro, the rupee declined as much as 2.1 percent and trading 1
percent down to 38.011.  The euro dropped to the lowest level since 2001 against the
yen and slid to a six-month low against the dollar on
speculation German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is preparing for a
Greek default. Emerging-market stocks fell, driving the
benchmark index to its lowest in more than two weeks, and
commodity prices declined for a third day.  “Risk aversion” is “stepping up,” analysts led by
 Benoit Anne  at London-based Societe Generale SA, said in an e-
mailed note to clients today. “The euro is currently under
severe pressure,” and “this has triggered a massive shock to
global risk appetite.”  Europe  accounted for 63 percent of tourist arrivals to the
island for the January to July period, according to data from
the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority. Europe is the main
export market, with a share of 64.5 percent, the  Central
Statistics Office  said on Aug. 30.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.6725 to 27.8434
and the selling price rose to 29.1554 compared with 28.9864 on
Sept. 9, according to  exchange rates  published today on the Bank
of Mauritius’s website.  Mauritian stocks retreated for a second day, with the 38-
member SEMDEX gauge declining 0.1 percent to 1,929.03 by the
1:30 p.m. close, the weakest level since Aug. 22, led by
Mauritius Commercial Bank and the  State Bank  of Mauritius Ltd.,
the country’s largest lenders by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
