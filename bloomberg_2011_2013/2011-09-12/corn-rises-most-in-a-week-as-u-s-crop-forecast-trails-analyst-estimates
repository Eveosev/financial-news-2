Corn futures rose the most in a
week after the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s monthly forecast
on production trailed estimates by analysts.  Output will be 12.497 billion bushels this year, the USDA
said today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
projected 12.554 billion, on average. Last month, the agency
forecast 12.914 billion. Yields will drop to a six-year low, the
government said. Prices in the U.S., the world’s top exporter,
have jumped 56 percent in the past 12 months as adverse weather
eroded supplies.  “Supplies are going to be tight this year,”  Jerry Gidel ,
a market analyst at North American Risk Management Services Inc.
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Ethanol and
livestock producers were buying today because they are worried
the crop may get smaller” after the USDA reports harvest
results and acreage adjustments in October, he said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to close at $7.455 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since Sept. 2. Earlier, the price fell as much as 1.4 percent.  The average yield in 2011 will drop to 148.1 bushels an
acre from 152.8 bushels a year earlier, the USDA said. Last
month, the agency projected 153 bushels.  Reserve supplies before the 2012 harvest will be 672
million bushels, down from 714 million forecast a month earlier
and this year’s estimated 920 million, the USDA said. The
surplus as a percentage of consumption will fall to 5.3 percent,
the lowest since 1996, USDA data show.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
