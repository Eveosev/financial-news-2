    A complaint against David
Birnbaum, who was accused of fraud for allegedly posing as a
member of the Guggenheim family, was dismissed by a U.S.
magistrate judge in  Manhattan .  U.S. Magistrate Judge James L. Cott last week signed an
order dropping the complaint against Birnbaum, according to a
court filing entered today. U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra C. Freeman last month said the complaint should be dismissed if
there was no deferred prosecution, voluntary dismissal or
indictment by Sept. 9, according to a court filing.  Birnbaum, Catarina Pietra Toumei and Vladimir Zuravel were
accused of using the name of the Guggenheim family, which is
known for its wealth and philanthropy, to lure investors into
phony business deals. The defendants also allegedly tried to use
the Guggenheim name to enter business relationships with former
presidents George H.W. Bush and  George W. Bush , the Iraqi
Ministry of Oil and Coca-Cola Co.  Lawyers representing Birnbaum didnâ€™t immediately return
phone messages left seeking comment on the order. Carly
Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney  Preet
Bharara , declined to comment on the dismissal.  The case is U.S. v. Toumei, 11-Mag.-207, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
