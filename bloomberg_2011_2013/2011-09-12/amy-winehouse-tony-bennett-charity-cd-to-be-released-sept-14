Amy Winehouse ’s duet with  Tony Bennett , “Body and Soul,” is to be released as a single and
video on Sept. 14, which would have been her 28th birthday.  Proceeds will go to the Amy Winehouse Foundation charity,
according to an e-mailed joint statement today from the
singer’s publicists, management and Island Records.  The recording on March 23 in London’s Abbey Road studio
was the last Winehouse made before she died in July. The cause
of her death is still being investigated. A toxicology report
showed there were no illegal substances in the singer’s
system, and her father Mitch has said in interviews that she
had been trying to quit alcohol.  “We had a beautiful time in the studio and I knew that
Amy was very happy with how she performed that day,” said
Bennett, 85 in the statement. “I thought she was brilliant.”  The recording session was filmed by Dion Beebe and the
track will be included on Bennett’s CD, “Duets II,” to be
released in the U.S. on Sept. 20.  Winehouse, who shot to fame with “Rehab,” won five
 Grammy Awards  and sold more than 5 million albums, was found
dead at her home in north  London .  To contact the writer on this story:
