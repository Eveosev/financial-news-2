Omega Insurance Holdings Ltd. (OIH) , the
second-smallest publicly traded Lloyd’s of London insurer,
agreed to sell a quarter of the firm to Haverford (Bermuda) Ltd.  Haverford, run by Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings SA founder
Mark Byrne, will pay 83 pence a share for 25 percent of the
Lloyd’s insurer, Bermuda-based Omega said today in a statement.
That’s a 26 percent premium to Omega’s closing price of 66 pence
on Sept. 9.  Byrne will replace John Coldman as chairman for the firm
once the transaction has been completed, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
