Risks to economic growth in West
Africa’s eight-member monetary union “should be reduced by a
series of favorable factors,” said Jose Mario Vaz, Guinea-
Bissau’s finance minister and president of the  Council of
Ministers  in the region’s central bank.  Recovery in  Ivory Coast , the group’s biggest economy, as
well as increased agricultural production and improved public-
finance management may spur growth this year, he said at a
meeting of finance ministers from the member nations in Dakar,
Senegal, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
