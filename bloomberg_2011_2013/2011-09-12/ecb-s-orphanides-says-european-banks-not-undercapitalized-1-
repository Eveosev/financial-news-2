(Corrects first paragraph to insert “severely” in comment
in story published yesterday.)  European Central Bank Governing
Council member Athanasios Orphanides said the “suggestion that
European banks are severely undercapitalized is plainly wrong.”  “The reason is that banking institutions in the European
Union and the euro area have already raised tremendous capital
in the course of the 2010, even in the first quarter of 2011”
in preparation for stress tests carried out by the European
Banking Authority, he said in Nicosia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
