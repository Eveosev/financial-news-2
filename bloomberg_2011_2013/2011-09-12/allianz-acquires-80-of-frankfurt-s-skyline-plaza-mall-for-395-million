Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest
insurer, acquired an 80 percent stake in the Skyline Plaza
shopping center in  Frankfurt , the company said today.  Allianz will pay about 290 million euros ($395 million) to
buy the stake from ECE Projektmanagement GmbH and an affiliate
of  CA Immobilien Anlagen AG (CAI) , according to Roland Deger, an
Allianz spokesman. Vienna-based CA Immo, Austria’s second-
biggest real-estate developer, and Hamburg-based ECE will each
retain about 10 percent.  “This acquisition takes us a major step closer to our goal
of increasing the retail share in our portfolio,” Stefan Brendgen, chief executive officer of Allianz Real Estate
Germany, said in a statement on Allianz’s website.  Skyline Plaza, expected to open in the third quarter 2013,
will have 38,000 square meters (99,000 square feet) of retail
space, a 9,200-square-meter Meridian Spa and a 10,000-square-
meter roof garden with cafes and restaurants overlooking the
Frankfurt skyline, according to the statement.  Munich-based Allianz was advised by Chicago-based real-
estate broker  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) , Ernst & Young and law
firm Clifford Chance LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
