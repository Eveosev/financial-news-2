Guinness Nigeria Plc (GUINNESS) ’s full-year
net income through June rose 31 percent to 17.93 billion naira
($115 million) from 13.74 billion naira a year earlier, the
company said in a statement e-mailed today by the Nigerian Stock
Exchange.  Vetiva Capital Management earlier reported the profit as
26.2 billion naira, compared with 19.9 billion naira a year
earlier, which is the profit before tax. Revenue climbed to
123.6 billion naira, from 109.4 billion naira, the statement
said.  Guinness,  Nigeria ’s second-biggest brewer by market value,
will pay a dividend of 10 naira per share for the period, the
statement added.  “This is a good dividend payment,” Olamidun Laniyan, a
Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva, said by phone today. “It is
broadly in line with our expectations.” Guinness paid a
dividend of 8.25 naira per share last year, she said.  Guinness shares were unchanged at 228 naira by the 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos. The stock has gained 20 percent this year,
compared with a decline of 15 percent in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
