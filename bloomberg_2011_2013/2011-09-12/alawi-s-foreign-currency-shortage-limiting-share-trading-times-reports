Malawi’s shortage of foreign
currency is limiting the volume of purchases by foreigners on
the country’s stock exchange, the Daily Times reported, citing
John Kamanga, the bourse’s operations manager.  Foreign investors are concerned that they won’t be able to
repatriate profits, the Blantyre-based newspaper cited Kamanga
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
