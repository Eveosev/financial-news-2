Latviaâ€™s central bank bought 14.9
million lati ($28.6 million) for euros last week, the Riga-based
bank said today on its  website .  Latvia, like neighboring  Lithuania , is a member of the pre-
euro exchange-rate mechanism and pegs its currency to the euro.
Latvia keeps the exchange rate within a 1 percent band around
the target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
