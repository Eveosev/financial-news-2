India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
yields to a two-week low, on speculation the central bank will
halt interest-rate increases on signs the economy is slowing.  A government report will show today industrial output
increased 6.2 percent in July from a year, after an 8.8 percent
gain the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of 26
economists. The  Reserve Bank  of India, which boosted its
repurchase rate five times this year to 8 percent to damp
inflation, will next review policy on Sept. 16.  “The central bank may press the pause button this time,”
said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of fixed income and
currencies at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “Growth seems to
be losing steam and inflation may also slow.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.28 percent as
of 9:50 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the lowest level since Aug. 25.  India’s inflation rate, which has held above 9 percent so
far this year, may slip below 7 percent by March 2012, Planning
Commission Deputy Chairman  Montek Singh Ahluwalia  said Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
