Niger’s Prime Minister Brigi Rafini
said 32 Libyans, including three generals and  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
son Saadi, have arrived in the country since Sept. 2.  “Of these, we did not record anyone who is pursued by
international justice,” Rafini said during a meeting with
ambassadors serving in the West African nation. They are in the
country for “humanitarian reasons,” he said.  The crisis in neighboring  Libya  has had “negative
consequences” on Niger, including an influx of 200,000 African
migrants leaving the North African nation, Rafini said. He also
expressed concern about the flow of weapons into Niger from
Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
