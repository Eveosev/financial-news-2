Treasuries snapped a rally from
last week on concern benchmark yields that are within three
basis points of a record low will erode demand when the U.S.
sells $66 billion of notes and bonds in three auctions.  Ten-year yields, which guide consumer and company borrowing
costs, were 1.67 percentage points more than the top of the
 Federal Reserve ’s target range for overnight loans. The spread
matched the lowest level since 2008. The government is scheduled
to sell $32 billion of three-year notes today, $21 billon of 10-
year debt tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Sept. 14.  “Treasuries aren’t good value,” said Roger Bridges, who
oversees the equivalent of $15.6 billion of debt as the Sydney-
based head of bonds at Tyndall Investment Management Ltd., a
unit of  Japan ’s Nikko Asset Management Co. “Yields will rise
sooner rather than later.”  Ten-year rates were little changed at 1.92 percent as of
1:30 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader. The
price of the 2.125 percent note due in August 2021 was 101 25/32.  The record low of 1.8942 percent was set Sept. 9. U.S.
seven-year yields dropped to 1.3058 percent today in early Asian
trading, the least based on Federal Reserve data that began in
1969, before climbing to 1.34 percent.  Bridges said he has held a smaller percentage of Treasuries
than recommended by benchmarks that he uses to gauge performance.
Yields will climb as European officials address a debt crisis in
the region, he said.  Concern that  Greece  will default helped spur demand for the
relative safety of Treasuries last week.  Members of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government are
discussing how to strengthen German banks in case Greece fails
to meet the budget-cutting terms of its aid package and is
unable to get a bailout-loan payment, officials said Sept. 9.  Japan’s 10-year note yielded 1 percent, versus this year’s
low of 0.97 percent set Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
