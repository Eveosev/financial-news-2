Zimbabwe will establish a sovereign
wealth fund that will own 51 percent of each foreign and white-
owned company in the country, the  Zimbabwe Standard  reported
without saying where it got the information.  The fund will be modeled on state-owned funds in Singapore,
 China  and  Abu Dhabi , the Harare-based newspaper said on its
website. The fund will be controlled by the Indigenization and
Black Empowerment Ministry, the Standard said.  The ministry is in the process of forcing foreign and
white-owned companies in the country to dispose of 51 percent of
their shares so that the stakes can be held by black
Zimbabweans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
