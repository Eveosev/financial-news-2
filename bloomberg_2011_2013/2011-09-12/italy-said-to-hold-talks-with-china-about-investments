Italian officials have held talks
with their Chinese counterparts about potential investments in
the euro region’s third-largest economy, an Italian government
official said.  The purchase of Italian bonds by China was not the focus of
the talks, which took place in the past few weeks, the official
said on condition of anonymity, without specifying which assets
may be involved. A spokesman for Italian Finance Minister  Giulio
Tremonti  declined to comment. News of the Chinese interest comes
on the eve of a 7 billion-euro ($9.6 billion) bond sale.  Signs of contagion from the region’s sovereign debt crisis
threatened to engulf  Italy  and pushed the country’s bond-yields
to a euro-era record last month. Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s government rushed through a 54 billion-euro
austerity package to convince the  European Central Bank  to buy
its debt. More than 60 billion euros of European bond purchases
in the past five weeks has done little to shore up Italian debt.  The yield on the country’s 10-year bond rose 16 basis
points to a five-week high 5.57 percent today, almost 4
percentage points more than the yield on comparable German debt.  A report in the Financial Times today that China would buy
“significant” amounts of Italian  government bonds  helped U.S.
stocks reverse losses in the last 90 minutes, as concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis eased. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose
0.7 percent to 1,162.27 at the 4 p.m. close in  New York .  Treasuries Fall  Treasuries fell after the 10-year note yield reached a
record low. The euro trimmed its decline and was little changed
at $1.3645 and was down 0.5 percent versus  Japan ’s currency
after slumping as much as 2 percent to a 10-year low of 103.9
yen.  With a debt of 1.9 trillion euros -- more than Spain,
Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined -- Italy remains
vulnerable to any rise in borrowing costs as it refinances
maturing debt. The country still needs to sell about 70 billion
euros of debt this year to cover its deficit and finance
redemptions.  The report on  China  came on the eve of an auction of as
much as 7 billion euros of bonds maturing between 2016 and 2021.
The treasury is selling the debt to help pay for 14.5 billion
euros of bonds maturing on Sept. 15.  Italy sold 11.5 billion euros of Treasury bills today and
priced its one-year notes to yield 4.153 percent, up from 2.959
percent at the previous auction last month, as demand for the
securities dipped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
