BP Plc,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil
company, bought a cargo of ultra-low-sulfur diesel. The company
also purchased a  jet fuel  shipment at a lower price than the
previous session. Gasoline declined. Gasoil traded on London’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange fell.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded from $1,000 to $1,015 a metric ton, according to
a survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with Sept. 9
deals from $1,024 to $1,060. The trades are for Eurobob grade,
to which ethanol is added before being sold as finished motor
fuel, and are typically for 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s crack, or premium to Brent, was little changed
at $5.82 a barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude
and refined products broker.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent decreased to $3.53 a barrel
from $3.72 Sept. 9, PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  BP purchased as much as 20,000 tons of diesel from Cargill
Inc. at $32 a ton more than October gasoil, priced for delivery
to the French port of  Le Havre , according to a survey of brokers
and traders monitoring the Platts pricing window which ends at
4:30 p.m. in London. That’s in line with a trade on Sept. 9.  Litasco, OAO Lukoil’s trading arm, also bought a cargo at a
premium of $29.50 to October gasoil, priced for delivery to
Amsterdam, the survey showed. Barges of the fuel traded at
premiums of $22 and $23 to the gasoil contract.  BP bought as much as 30,000 tons of jet fuel from Morgan
Stanley at a premium of $70 a ton to October gasoil, priced for
delivery to Rotterdam, the survey showed. That’s $4 lower than a
deal on Sept. 9.  Gasoil for October delivery fell 0.6 percent to $933.50 a
ton as of 5:26 p.m.  London  time on the ICE exchange. The
September gasoil contract expired $19.25 lower at $920.25 a ton
as of 12 p.m.  Front-month gasoil traded at a premium to later-dated
contracts since Aug. 5, keeping the market in so-called
backwardation. That market structure signals near-term scarcity
or rising demand. The gap between October and November was at $2
a ton, compared with $3.25 a ton on Sept. 9.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, shrank to
$12.60 a barrel compared with $13.69 at 4:30 p.m. London time on
Sept. 9, ICE data showed.  Heating oil barges traded at a discount of $3 a ton to the
October futures contract, the survey showed. That compares with
a $2 discount on Sept. 9.  Residues  High sulfur fuel oil traded from $624.25 to $625 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts. The low-sulfur grade changed
hands at $641 a ton, the survey showed.  Refinery  Russian oil producer Lukoil aims to resume operations at
its Ukrainian refinery next year after deciding on how to ship
in crude supplies, Ekonomicheskie Izvestia reported, citing the
unit’s Chief Executive Officer Valery Chakheev.  Lukoil shut its Odessa refinery in October last year
because of low efficiency, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
