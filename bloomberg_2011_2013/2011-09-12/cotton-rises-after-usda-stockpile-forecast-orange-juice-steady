Cotton futures rose for the fifth
time in six sessions after a U.S. government report showed world
stockpiles will be smaller than previously forecast.  Orange
juice  was unchanged.  Global inventories of cotton on July 31 will total 51.91
million bales, down from the previous estimate of 52.66 million,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. World demand will
be 115.22 million bales, compared with the agency’s August
estimate of 115.18 million, the USDA said.  “For those of us who expected a bearish report, we were
pleasantly surprised,”  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at
Penson Futures in Atlanta, said in a report after the USDA
figures were released. “The reduction in world carryout is
friendly and possibly bullish.”  Cotton for December delivery climbed 0.42 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $1.1229 a pound at 2:35 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The fiber gained 5.6 percent last
week.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery were unchanged
at $1.687 a pound in New York. The beverage has gained as much
as 11 percent since reaching a five-month low on Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
