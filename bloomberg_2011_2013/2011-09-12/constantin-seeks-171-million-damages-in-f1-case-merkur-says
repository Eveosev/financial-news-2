Constantin Medien AG (EV4)  is suing
Formula One head Bernie Ecclestone and Gerhard Gribkowsky, the
former risk manager of Bayerische Landesbank, for $171 million
in damages, Muenchner Merkur reported, citing the complaint
documents filed in London’s High Court in July.  Constantin claims that BayernLB’s Formula One shares were
sold too cheaply because Ecclestone bribed Gribkowsky, according
to Merkur. The stock had a valuation of $2.8 billion when it was
sold for $814 million in 2005, Merkur cited Constantin Medien as
saying in the complaint.  Michael Evans , a spokesman for Ecclestone’s lawyers Herbert
Smith LLP, declined to comment.  Gribkowsky’s lawyer Ulrich Stuhlfelner at Graf von
Westphalen wasn’t immediately available to comment, according to
the switchboard at the  law firm  in Munich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
