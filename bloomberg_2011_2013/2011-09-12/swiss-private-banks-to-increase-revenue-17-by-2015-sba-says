Swiss private banks will increase
revenue by 17 percent over the next five years because of
inflows from clients in emerging markets, according to a report
by the  Swiss Bankers Association  and  Boston Consulting Group .  Revenue will rise to 29.8 billion Swiss francs ($33.7
billion) in 2015, from 25.4 billion francs in 2010, the
association said in the report published today.  “Assets from emerging markets will see strong growth and
gain in importance,” the report said. “Assets sourced from the
former core markets of western Europe and invested in
Switzerland will continue to decline.”  Swiss banks are seeking new ways to gain assets and boost
earnings as tighter regulation and a crackdown on  tax evasion  by
wealthy Americans and Europeans crimps profit margins. Banks
should focus on new clients in faster-growing economies rather
than those in traditional wealth centers and target ultra-high
net worth individuals, according to the report.  Private banking accounts for 43 percent of total Swiss
banking revenue, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
