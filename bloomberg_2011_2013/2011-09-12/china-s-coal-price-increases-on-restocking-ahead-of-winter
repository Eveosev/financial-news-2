(Corrects company name in second paragraph.)  China  coal prices rose in the past
two weeks as utilities restocked ahead of the winter.  Thermal coal in Qinhuangdao, China, was $148.62 a metric
ton as of Sept. 9, up 0.4 percent from two weeks earlier,
according to fortnightly data from IHS McCloskey, a researcher
based in Petersfield,  England . They fell in the previous four
two-week periods.  “Overall Qinhuangdao prices are supported by winter
purchase but since inventory levels are quite high the prices
found a temporary equilibrium,” Emmanuel Fages, a Societe
Generale analyst in Paris, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
