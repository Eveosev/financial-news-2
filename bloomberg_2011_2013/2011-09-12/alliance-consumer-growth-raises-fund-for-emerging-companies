Alliance Consumer Growth, a New
York-based private-equity firm, raised $40 million for its first
fund targeting emerging consumer-product companies.  The firm also announced investments in cleaning-product
company  KAS Direct LLC , which makes BabyGanics and PawGanics,
and pet-food maker The Honest Kitchen, according to a statement
to be released today. Julian D. Steinberg, 32, a managing
director at  Atlas Advisors  in New York and the son of financier
Saul Steinberg, helped co-found ACG earlier this year.  ACG will target private companies in the food, beverage,
personal care, household products and restaurant industries,
according to the release. Former Lessing Companies executives
Josh Goldin and Trevor Nelson also co-founded the firm,
according to its  website . Earlier investments made by the
founders include DenTek Oral Care Inc. and baby-food maker Plum
Organics.  “ACG takes advantage of a funding gap in the consumer
products landscape, providing capital and expertise for emerging
consumer companies with proven concepts to significantly
accelerate their growth trajectories while minimizing execution
risk,” Steinberg said in a telephone interview. “We see a
significant number of opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
