Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the U.K.
owner of the All Bar One pub chain, said it would reject a
possible 230 pence ($3.64) a share offer from Piedmont Inc.
because it “significantly” undervalues the company.  Piedmont, which owns 23 percent of Mitchells & Butlers,
said in a statement earlier today that it was considering an
offer for the remainder of the company after a previous proposal
was dismissed. That proposal was for 224 pence a share in cash
or stock, Mitchells & Butlers said in a statement.  Mitchells & Butlers posted a full-year loss in 2010 on
lower sales of beverages at its outlets. The company sold 333
pubs last year as part of a plan to reduce the number of drinks-
oriented budget pubs and expand chains that focus more on food.  “The proposal is being made to stabilize the business,”
Richard Farnsworth, a Piedmont spokesman, said today. Piedmont,
controlled by U.K. billionaire  Joe Lewis , is Mitchells &
Butlers’ largest investor.  Piedmont declined to comment on Mitchells & Butlers’
rejection of its possible 230-a-share bid, spokesman George
Hudson said by telephone today.  M&B rose 15.5 pence, or 7 percent, to 235.6 pence today in
London trading. The shares have declined 33 percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
