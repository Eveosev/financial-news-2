Two former U.S. Marines were
ordered by a judge to pay $246,000 for stealing the idea for a
boot-camp style fitness gym from  Pure Power Boot Camp .  Pure Power, started by former Wall Street trader Lauren
Brenner, won a trial claiming former employees Ruben Belliard
and Alexander Fell violated their duties as employees of the gym
by taking Pure Power’s business plan, start-up manual and
operations manual as part of a plan to open a competing gym 15
blocks away in  Manhattan .  U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz, who heard evidence
without a jury earlier this year, ruled today against the two
former Marines, who founded  Warrior Fitness Boot Camp .  “Belliard’s breach of loyalty was particularly egregious,
in the calculated nature of his disloyalty, and the lengths to
which he went to conceal his disloyal conduct,” Katz wrote in
his opinion.  Katz ruled that Belliard must forfeit the $55,197 he was
paid by Pure Power during the time he was planning to open
Warrior Fitness, and awarded $110,393 in punitive damages. Katz
said Fell must forfeit $40,177 in pay and assessed $40,177 in
punitive damages.  “Warrior Fitness will stay in business, and that’s what’s
important,” Carolyn Richmond, a lawyer for the gym, said in a
phone interview.  Katz dismissed most of Pure Power’s claims and declined to
uphold a 10-year non-compete clause against the ex-Marines,
Richmond said. Pure Power won only a fraction of the damages it
claimed in the suit, she said.  The case is Pure Power Boot Camp Inc. v. Warrior Fitness
Boot Camp LLC, 08-cv-04810, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
