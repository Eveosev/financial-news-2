Low temperatures may fall into the
30s to 40s Fahrenheit (minus 1 to 4 Celsius) in the U.S. Midwest
and East in the next 10 days, according to  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The cold periods will be brief, and because it’s September
the demand for natural gas and heating oil may be low, Rogers
said in a note to clients.  In his 6- to 10-day forecast, Rogers said Texas will
probably be warmer than normal while the East Coast has its
brush with cooler air. Temperatures that are seasonal and higher
will return to the entire U.S. from Sept. 22 to Sept. 26,
according to his 11- to 15-day forecast.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
