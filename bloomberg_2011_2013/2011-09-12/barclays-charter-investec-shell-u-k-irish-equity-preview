U.K. stocks dropped, extending last
week’s selloff for the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) , amid concern
Germany is preparing for  Greece  to default.  Antofagasta Plc led a retreat in mining companies as
commodity prices tumbled.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
declined 3.4 percent as credit-default swaps for the bank
climbed to a record.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  led a selloff among insurers.  The FTSE 100 lost 85.03, or 1.6 percent, to 5,129.62 at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London  as all but eight companies retreated.
The benchmark fell last week amid concern policy makers won’t be
able to stop  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis from spreading. The
FTSE All-Share Index and Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 1.6 percent
and 2.5 percent, respectively, today.  “What dictated direction was the only too familiar concern
about European debt,” said London-based David Jones, chief
market strategist at IG Index. “The belief that  Germany  is
getting ready for Greece to default has gathered steam over the
weekend and found momentum today.”  Officials in Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government in
Germany are debating how to shore up German banks should Greece
fail to meet the budget-cutting terms of its aid package, three
coalition officials said on Sept. 9. BNP Paribas SA, Societe
Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA may have their ratings cut by
Moody’s this week because of their holdings of the Mediterranean
nation’s debt, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Vowing to Avoid  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou , vowing to avoid a
default and keep the country in the euro, approved new measures
to help plug a budget gap as resistance builds at home and in
Europe to extending more aid to the European Union’s most
indebted nation.  Antofagasta dropped 3.1 percent to 1,249 pence, Vedanta
Resources Plc lost 2.35 percent to 1,330 pence and  Rio Tinto ,
the world’s second-biggest mining company, slipped 1.52 percent
to 3,510 pence.  Commodities fell to the lowest level in more than two weeks
amid concern slowing global economic growth may curb raw-
materials demand.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
sank 7.49 percent to 1,989 pence as gold and silver fell for a
second day.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  declined 2.26 percent to
6,910 pence.  RBS dropped to 20.77 pence as credit-default swaps insuring
the senior and subordinated bonds of  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and RBS rose
to records, according to CMA. Barclays slid 1.63 percent to
141.65 pence and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  lost 1.55 percent to
30.56 pence.  Insulate Units  Banks also fell as Britain’s government said it will force
lenders to insulate their consumer and investment banking units
by 2019. A panel recommended that banks build fire breaks
between their consumer and investment banks in a 360-page report
by the Independent Commission on Banking today. The plans will
cost as much 7 billion pounds ($11 billion), according to the
report.  Aviva dropped 4.46 percent to 289.2 pence as insurance
stocks posted the biggest losses among 19 industry groups in
Europe today. Prudential Plc slid 1.47 percent to 568 pence and
Old Mutual Plc slipped 1.16 percent to 110.4 pence.  Charter International Plc (CHTR)  paced advancing shares, climbing
6.59 percent to 857 pence after Colfax Corp. announced plans to
buy the company for 1.53 billion pounds.  Shareholders will receive 730 pence a share in cash and
0.1241 new Colfax shares for each Charter equivalent, giving a
total price of 910 pence, Colfax said in a statement. The offer
is 48 percent higher than Charter’s closing price on June 28,
the day prior to Melrose’s preliminary proposal.  Melrose gained 3.29 percent to 289.2 pence.  Yell Group Plc (YELL)  dropped 6.94 percent to 4.16 pence after the
Financial Times reported that the company has asked HSBC
Holdings Plc to create a committee to gather its banking
syndicate and renegotiate its covenants. The newspaper did not
say where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
