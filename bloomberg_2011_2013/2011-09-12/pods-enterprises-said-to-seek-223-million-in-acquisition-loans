PODS Enterprises, Inc. , the
portable moving and storage provider, is seeking $223 million in
loans to help fund an acquisition and refinance debt, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The financing will include a $198 million  term loan  and a
$25 million revolving line of credit, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private. A
portion of the term loan will available to draw after the
closing of the deal, the person said.  GE Capital Markets, the lending unit of  General Electric
Co. (GE)  is arranging the deal and will host a bank meeting on Sept.
15 in  New York .  An e-mail sent to Clearwater, Florida-based PODS seeking
comment wasn’t returned.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
