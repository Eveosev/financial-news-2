The premium European banks pay to
borrow in dollars for 12 months through the swaps markets
increased to the most since December 2008, a sign lenders may be
struggling to get funding.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars, as
measured by the 12-month cross-currency  basis swap , fell 7.3
basis points to 74 basis points below the euro interbank offered
rate, or Euribor, as of 9:14 a.m. in  London , indicating a higher
premium to buy the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The three-month basis swap was unchanged at 105 basis
points, matching the most since December 2008.  Basis swaps allow banks to borrow in one currency, while
simultaneously lending in another.  To contact the reporter on this story:
