Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  is talking to
potential partners to retain the Medium Extended Air Defense
System,  Financial Times Deutschland said , citing Scott Harris,
the U.S. company’s  Europe  chief.  Additional partners for the anti-missile system could be
NATO members, Patriot missile users or nations with security
interests outside Europe, Harris said, according to the German
newspaper. The Lockheed executive didn’t say which countries the
company is in talks with, it said.  The first goal is to finish the development phase to show
what the system can do, Harris said, according to the newspaper.
The Pentagon said in February that it would terminate Meads when
the current contract ends in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
