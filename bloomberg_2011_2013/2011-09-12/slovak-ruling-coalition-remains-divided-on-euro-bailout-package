Slovakia’s government still lacks
the parliamentary majority to push through measures
strengthening the euro-area’s bailout mechanism as one of the
ruling parties remains opposed to the package, Premier  Iveta
Radicova  said.  Radicova failed to convince SaS, a junior ruling party with
22 lawmakers, to support the measures, which include bolstering
the size of the temporary bailout fund and allowing it to
provide credit lines to distressed countries and buy their
bonds.  There is a possibility the four ruling parties will remain
split on the issue Radicova said at a press conference in Casta,
Slovakia, after a meeting with leaders of all coalition parties.  The eastern euro-area member plans to be the last one to
hold a parliamentary vote on the package, which must be ratified
by all countries. The  European Central Bank  and the European
Commission have called upon the countries to endorse the
measures as soon as possible to keep contagion from the debt
crisis, which started in  Greece , from spreading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
