Ghana ’s cedi weakened for the third
straight trading day against the dollar as companies bought the
U.S. currency to pay for imports of goods into the West African
nation.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 1.5479 per dollar, before
trading less than 0.1 percent down at 1.5412 per dollar as of
1:13 p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Demand for dollars is still coming from the commerce
industry for the import of goods ahead of year-end festivity
sales,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at the local unit
of Access Bank Ghana Ltd., said in a telephone interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
