Vietnam ’s five-year bonds declined
for a second day, pushing yields to a one-week high, as an
increase in money-market rates made it more expensive to buy
debt with borrowed funds.  The overnight interbank deposit rate rose to 12.56 percent
from 12.40 percent at the end of the last week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure has averaged 12.45
percent so far this month, up from 11.89 percent in August.  The yield on the benchmark five-year note added one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.49 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level since Sept. 5.  The dong was little changed at 20,817 per dollar as of 2
p.m. in Hanoi, from 20,831 on Sept. 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate 
at 20,628 today, unchanged since Aug. 23, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
