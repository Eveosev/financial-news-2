South Africa  may consider raising
Value Added Tax to fund a compulsory heath insurance plan, the
Times reported, citing Cecil Morden, National Treasuryâ€™s chief
director of tax analysis and policy.  An increase on the 14 percent VAT rate could be justified
because it is low when compared to the worldwide average of 16.4
percent, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Morden as
saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
