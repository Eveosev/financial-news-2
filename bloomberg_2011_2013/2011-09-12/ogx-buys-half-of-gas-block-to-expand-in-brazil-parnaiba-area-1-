OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA, the oil company controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista ,
bought 50.1 percent of an onshore exploration block near its
largest natural gas discovery in northeastern  Brazil .  OGX will become the operator of the BT-PN-1 block in
Brazil’s Parnaiba basin after buying three 16.7 percent stakes
from Imetame Energia SA, DELP Engenharia Mecanica and Orteng
Equipamentos e Sistemas, according to a regulatory filing today.
The company didn’t disclose how much it paid for the stakes in
the block.  Batista will use natural gas from the Parnaiba basin to
fuel plants being built by his thermoelectric power company  MPX
Energia SA. (MPXE3)  OGX, which plans to begin output from the
northeastern fields in the second half of 2012, controls seven
other blocks in the area.  The company declared in May that the Fazenda Sao Jose and
California deposits in Parnaiba, its two biggest gas
discoveriers, are commercially viable.  OGX fell 19 centavos, or 1.7 percent, to 10.72 reais at
10:31 a.m. New York time, after losing as much as 4 percent
earlier. Before today, It dropped 45 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
