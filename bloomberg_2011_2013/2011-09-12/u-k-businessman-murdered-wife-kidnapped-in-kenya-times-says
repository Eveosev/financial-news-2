David Tebbutt, the finance director
of U.K. book publisher Faber & Faber, was shot and killed by
intruders at a Kenyan beach resort who then kidnapped his wife
Judith, the London-based Times reported, citing Kenyan police.  Tebbutt, 58, and his wife, who is 55, arrived on Saturday
at the Kiwayu Safari Village on  Kenya â€™s Indian Ocean coast 30
miles from the border with Somalia; intruders believed to be
Somalian pirates from the Harakat al-Shahab al-Mujahideen group
arrived by speedboat, killing Tebbutt before making off with his
wife, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
