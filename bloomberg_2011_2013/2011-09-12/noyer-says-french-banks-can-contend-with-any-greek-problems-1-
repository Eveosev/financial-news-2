Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  said French lenders are capable of facing any Greek
response to sovereign-debt difficulties and have no liquidity or
solvency problems.  “Whatever the Greek scenario, and whatever provisions have
to be made, French banks have the means to face it,” Noyer said
in an e-mailed statement today. “French banks have neither
liquidity nor solvency problems.”  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
plunged today in Paris on a possible ratings cut by Moody’s
Investors Service, extending their more than 40 percent slide in
the last three months.  Noyer also said 5 trillion euros ($6.8 trillion) of
collateral is available in the euro system and the European
Central Bank is providing 500 billion euros of refinancing.
French banks have added 50 billion euros to their capital in two
years, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
