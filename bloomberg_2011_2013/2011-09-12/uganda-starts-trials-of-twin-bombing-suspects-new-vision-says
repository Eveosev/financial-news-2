Uganda  begins the trial today of 19
suspects linked to last year’s twin bombings in which 76 people
were killed while they were watching the final of soccer’s  World
Cup , the  New Vision  reported, citing the police.  Access to the trial at the International Crime Division of
the  High Court  will be restricted, the Kampala-based newspaper
said, citing Judith Nabakooba, the spokesman for the Uganda
police. Most of the suspects are foreign, it said.  The Somalia-based al-Shabaab group, which has pledged
allegiance to al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility of the bombings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
