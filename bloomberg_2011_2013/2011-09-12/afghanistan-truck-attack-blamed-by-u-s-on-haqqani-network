The Haqqani network of militants
based in  Pakistan  was responsible for a weekend attack on a
military outpost in  Afghanistan  that killed two Afghan civilians
and injured 77 Americans, according to the Pentagon.  “There is a very strong likelihood that top Haqqani
leadership supported and were aware of the attack,” spokesman
George Little told reporters at the Pentagon today.  The U.S. has been asking Pakistan to crack down on the
network, which conducts attacks in Afghanistan.  “This was not some guy with a suicide vest,” said Navy
Captain John Kirby, a spokesman for Admiral Mike Mullen, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “This was a large, large
vehicle with a large amount of explosive material, and you don’t
conduct that kind of attack without good resourcing, good
planning and a fair level of coordination.”  The driver of the truck, which was carrying firewood to
cloak the bomb, detonated the explosives about 5:30 p.m. local
time on Sept. 10 at the entrance to a coalition outpost in Sayed
Abad, in Wardak Province west of the capital, Kabul.  The coalition put the number of Afghan civilians injured at
fewer than 25. None of the injuries to American personnel at the
outpost was life threatening, the coalition said.  “Most of the force of the explosion was absorbed by the
protective barrier at the outpost entrance,” the coalition said
in a Sept. 11 statement. “The impact to the compound is readily
repairable and operations are continuing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
