Portuguese inflation eased in
August to its slowest pace this year.  Consumer prices climbed 2.8 percent from a year earlier
using a harmonized European Union measure, after a 3 percent
increase the previous month, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. The
increase in August was the smallest since December. Prices fell
0.4 percent on the month.  Using the statistics instituteâ€™s own methods, consumer-
price growth eased to 2.9 percent in August from 3.2 percent in
July. On the month, prices dropped 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
