Indian stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a two-week low, after the nation’s factory
output slowed and as speculation Greece may be nearing a default
escalated concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the nation’s biggest truck-maker, slid
4.3 percent after the group’s Chief Executive Officer Carl-Peter Forster resigned citing “unavoidable personal circumstances.”
India’s industrial output grew at the slowest pace in 21 months
as consumer demand wanes after record rate increases, and as the
threat of a global slowdown clouds the outlook.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,
the country’s top producer, fell 4.6 percent, pacing declines
among peers after the ministry lowered its forecast for
industry’s demand growth.  “The factory output numbers are disappointing and may
prompt the central bank to reconsider its stance on  interest
rates ,” said Kaushik Dani, a  fund manager  at Peerless Mutual
Fund. “Unfortunately, the markets are being hit by global as
well as local negatives, all at the same time.”  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index lost 365.23, or 2.2 percent,
to 16,501.74 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the most since
Aug. 18 and the lowest level in two weeks. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index on the National Stock Exchange of India slid 2.2 percent
to 4,946.80 while its September futures traded at 4,943. The
BSE-200 Index dropped 2.2 percent to 2,043.76.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 2.3 percent at 7:45 p.m.
in  Tokyo , headed for its lowest close since August 2010.  Austerity Package  Investors are valuing European banks at levels not seen
since the depths of the credit crisis in 2008 as concern over a
Greek default and debt contagion escalates. German lawmakers
stepped up their criticism of  Greece  last week, threatening to
withhold aid unless it meets the terms of its austerity package,
after an international mission to Athens suspended its report on
the country’s progress.  Group of Seven finance chiefs meeting in France over the
weekend vowed to support Europe’s banks amid growing concern
that the debt crisis is morphing into a banking crisis, and
doubts linger about the ability of some European lenders to
withstand a Greek default and its ripple effects.  “Markets remain concerned about the global scenario,”
Daljeet Kohli, head of research at India Nivesh Securities Pvt.,
said in a phone interview. “The situation in the euro zone and
the U.S. remains sticky.”  Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 3.3 percent
in July from a year earlier, following an 8.8 percent gain in
June, the government said in New Delhi today. The median of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg survey was for a 6.2 percent advance.  ‘Tricky Situation’  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has to
weigh the risks to growth posed by  Europe ’s debt crisis, a
faltering U.S. recovery against inflation when he makes his
policy decision on Sept. 16. Asian central banks from South
Korea to Malaysia kept borrowing costs unchanged last week as
they assess the global economy.  India’s central bank has increased its repurchase rate 11
times since the start of 2010 to damp living costs that are
rising the fastest among the so-called BRICS nations of  Brazil ,
 Russia , India,  China  and  South Africa .  Benchmark wholesale-price inflation probably quickened to
9.64 percent in August, from 9.22 percent the previous month,
according to the median estimate of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The government will release the data on Sept. 14.  India’s $1.7 trillion economy expanded 7.7 percent in the
three months ended June from a year earlier, the slowest pace of
expansion in six quarters. Slowing growth may prompt the Reserve
Bank to pause raising rates, Press Trust cited Finance Minister
Pranab Mukherjee as saying on Sept. 5. Earnings for 47 percent
of the 30 Sensex companies missed analyst forecasts in the June
quarter. That compares with 33 percent that trailed estimates in
the previous quarter, Bloomberg data show.  Return to Profit  Tata Motors tumbled 4.3 percent to 146.35 rupees, the most
since Aug. 19. Forster, 57, who helped the company’s Jaguar Land
Rover luxury unit turn to profit in the year ended March 31,
quit on Sept. 9 after less than two years as the global head of
India’s biggest automaker.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the largest lender, plummeted 4.6
percent to 1,863.40 rupees, its lowest close in two years.  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the largest private lender, sank 3.8 percent to
862.35 rupees.  Steelmakers retreated for a second day. Tata Steel lost 4.6
percent to 454.85 rupees.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  fell 3.1
percent to 521.65 rupees and  Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) 
dropped 3.7 percent to 107.95 rupees. Demand this fiscal year
will probably expand at half the pace forecast in May, G.K.
Basak, executive secretary of the steel ministry’s joint plant
committee, said Sept. 9.  Good-Conduct Bond  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the nation’s largest carmaker,
tumbled 3.2 percent to 1,068.25 rupees after Osamu Suzuki,
chairman of  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) , which owns 54 percent of Maruti,
said all workers will have to sign a good-conduct bond.  Maruti last month fired 23 employees and suspended 26 for
“deliberately causing quality problems in vehicles” and
prevented workers from entering its Manesar plant unless they
signed a legally binding pledge not to disrupt manufacturing.
Employees at the plant struck for 11 days in June to demand
better working conditions and recognition of a trade union
independent of the one now representing workers. The stock
closed at its lowest since July 13, 2009.  The Sensex has retreated 20 percent this year, the worst
performer in Asia. Companies on the gauge trade at 13.9 times
estimated profits, compared with 9.8 times for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index.  Overseas funds purchased a net 294 million rupees ($6.36
million) of Indian stocks on Sept. 8, raising total investment
in equities this year to 29.1 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the market regulator. They withdrew a net $2.1
billion in August, the most since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
