The  International Monetary Fund 
said Georgia’s central bank may have to raise  interest rates 
further after inflation accelerated to 13.9 percent in March.  “Inflation is hitting people, it’s hurting people, and so
the government and the central bank do need to respond,”  David Owen , the IMF’s director for Central Asia and the Middle East,
said today in an interview in the capital Tbilisi. Georgian
price growth has been driven mostly by commodity and fuel
prices, he said.  The  National Bank of Georgia  has maintained its benchmark
 refinancing rate  at 8 percent since February. The bank raised
the rate to 7.5 percent from 7 percent in October 2010, then
held it steady until the half-point increase in February.  The government’s efforts to lessen the impact of rising
prices on consumers include 30 million lari ($18.3 million) of
food vouchers, distributed in March, and coupons for free
electricity.  Georgia ’s $11.7 billion economy will probably grow 5.5
percent this year after a 6.4 percent expansion in 2010, Owen
said. The country’s economic crisis “was not as deep” as some
other countries in the region, largely thanks to international
aid received after a war with Russia in 2008.  The Black Sea country won pledges of $4.55 billion of
international aid, including $1 billion from the U.S., after the
war. Pledged aid has since increased to $5.1 billion, according
to the government.  Owen called on Georgia to reduce its  budget deficit  and
foreign debt to improve investor confidence and cut its
dependence on international aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
