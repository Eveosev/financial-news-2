The chief economist at the White
House said “faster growth is needed” for the U.S. to replace
jobs lost during the recession, after a Commerce Department
report showed the  U.S. economy  slowed in the first quarter.  “While the continued expansion is encouraging, clearly,
faster growth is needed to replace the jobs lost in the
downturn,”  Austan Goolsbee , chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, said in a statement.  The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the
quarter ended in March after a 3.1 percent pace in the final
quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department reported.  The department cited the biggest decline in government
purchases since 1983, compounded by rising gasoline prices that
slowed consumer spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
