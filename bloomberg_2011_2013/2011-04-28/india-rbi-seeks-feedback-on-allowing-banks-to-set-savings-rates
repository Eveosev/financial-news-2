India ’s central bank today sought
feedback on allowing banks to set savings deposit rates, the
only  interest rates  that are still regulated in the country.  The amount banks pay for the deposits has not changed since
March 1, 2003, the  Reserve Bank  of India said in a  discussion
paper  released on its website. The rate is now at 3.5 percent.  Savings instruments are a popular product and constitute
about 22 percent of the total deposits of commercial banks,
according to the paper. Annual inflation near 9 percent in India
has made returns on these deposits negative and “unattractive
vis-à-vis short term deposits,” the paper said.  A market-based interest rate “may be beneficial to
savers” and allow banks to introduce new products, according to
the paper, asking for feedback by May 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
