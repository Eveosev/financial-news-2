The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment, earnings, and hours report for
February released by  Statistics Canada .  Between February 2010 and February 2011, average weekly
earnings of non-farm payroll employees rose by 4.0% to
$874.83. In comparison, average weekly earnings increased
by 2.7% between February 2009 and February 2010.  Some of the 4.0% growth in weekly earnings between
February 2010 and February 2011 was attributable to a 0.9%
increase in the average number of hours worked per week.
In comparison, between February 2009 and February 2010,
average hours declined by 0.3%. The remainder of the year-
over-year earnings increase in February 2011 reflects a
number of other factors, such as wage growth and changes
in the composition of employment by industry, by
occupation and by level of job experience.  Average weekly earnings increased in every province
between February 2010 and February 2011. Growth was above
the national average in Alberta, Newfoundland and
Labrador,  Quebec  and Saskatchewan. Nova Scotia and Prince
 Edward Island  had the slowest growth.  Average weekly earnings by industry  Between February 2010 and February 2011, growth in
average weekly earnings was above the national average of
4.0% in 4 of the 10 industries with more than 700,000
employees. The fastest earnings growth was in
administrative and support services, while the slowest
occurred in retail trade and construction.  In administrative and support services, average weekly
earnings increased by 8.2% to $749.97 in the 12 months
leading to February 2011. This was the third consecutive
month with year-over-year growth at or above 8%. Year-over-
year growth was widespread across the industries in this
sector.  Weekly earnings in professional, scientific and
technical services continued their long-term upward trend,
rising by 5.9% to $1,229.26 from February 2010 to February
2011. Growth was higher than the sector average in
advertising and public relations; and in architectural,
engineering and related services.  Earnings were up by 5.4% to $964.59 in educational
services in the 12 months to February 2011, with the
fastest earnings growth in elementary and secondary
schools.  In wholesale trade, average weekly earnings increased
by 4.4% to $1,067.69 in February from the same month a
year earlier, continuing an upward trend observed over the
previous six months. Notable year-over-year growth was
recorded by  motor vehicle  and parts wholesalers.  Growth in average weekly earnings was also strong in
some of the smaller sectors. From February 2010 to
February 2011, the fastest growth among all sectors was in
transportation and warehousing, where earnings increased
by 8.6% to $928.13, continuing a steady upward trend that
started about a year ago. Growth in this sector was most
notable in postal services, support activities for
transportation, urban transit systems and rail
transportation.  Non-farm payroll employment by industry  Non-farm payroll employment rose by 23,600 (+0.2%) in
February. Compared with a year earlier, the number of
payroll jobs increased by 277,700 (+1.9%).  In manufacturing, payroll jobs increased for the third
month in a row, up 8,900 (+0.6%) in February. Gains
occurred in machinery manufacturing, chemical
manufacturing, and fabricated metal product manufacturing.
Between February 2010 and February 2011, payroll jobs in
manufacturing rose by 21,400 (+1.5%).  In construction, payroll employment rose by 5,300
(+0.6%) in February, the sixth consecutive monthly
increase. This gain was driven by utility system
construction, non-residential building construction and
building equipment contractors. Compared with 12 months
earlier, the number of payroll jobs in construction was up
33,600 (+4.1%).  The number of payroll employees in finance and
insurance rose by 5,200 (+0.8%) in February, mostly in
credit intermediation and related activities, such as
banking and sales financing. February's gain brings the
number of payroll jobs in finance and insurance to about
the same level as 12 months earlier.  Payroll employment rose by 5,200 in wholesale trade and
4,600 in retail trade (+0.7% and +0.2%, respectively),
with notable gains in clothing stores, machinery,
equipment and supplies wholesale, and electronics and
appliance stores. Compared with a year earlier, the number
of payroll jobs was up by 19,000 in wholesale and by
13,500 in retail.  Professional, scientific and technical services payroll
employment increased by 4,500 (+0.6%) in February, with
the gains coming mainly from architectural, engineering
and related services. Payroll jobs in the overall sector
rose by 16,800 from a year earlier.  The number of payroll jobs in mining, quarrying and oil
and gas extraction increased by 4,500 (+2.2%) in February,
continuing an upward trend that started in November 2009.
Gains occurred in support activities for mining and oil
and gas extraction; and in metal ore mining. Compared with
a year earlier, payroll employment in mining, quarrying
and oil and gas extraction rose by 29,000, or 16.3%, the
fastest growth rate of all sectors.  Increases in payroll employment in February were partly
offset by losses in health care and social assistance 
(-4,500) and in educational services (-4,100).  Hours worked and average hours worked by hourly and
salaried employees  Total hours worked by hourly and salaried employees
were unchanged in February compared with January. Compared
with 12 months earlier, total hours increased by 2.4%.  Average weekly hours worked by hourly and salaried
employees amounted to 33.0 hours in February, unchanged
from the previous month and up 0.9% compared with February
2010.  Note to readers  The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is
a business census of non-farm payroll employees. Its key
objective is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of
earnings, the number of jobs and hours worked by detailed
industry at the national, provincial and territorial
level.  Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates
from its monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a
household survey whose main objective is to divide the
working-age population into three mutually exclusive
groups: the employed (including the self-employed),
unemployed and not in the labour force. This survey is the
official source for the  unemployment rate  and collects
data on the socio-demographic characteristics of all those
in the labour market.  As a result of conceptual and methodological
differences, estimates of changes from SEPH and LFS do
differ from time to time. However, the trends in the data
are quite similar.  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  All earnings data include overtime pay and exclude
businesses which could not be classified to a North
American Industrial Classification System code.  Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total
weekly earnings by the number of employees.  Changes in average earnings can be influenced by a
number of factors. Changes in the level of earnings, the
number of payroll employees, and the number of hours
worked can have an impact. Other factors could include
compositional changes over time, such as changes in the
proportions of full-time and part-time work; proportions
of casual, senior and junior employees; the occupational
distribution within and across industries; and in the
distribution of employment between industries. Such
effects may apply differently within different provinces
and territories, and over time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
