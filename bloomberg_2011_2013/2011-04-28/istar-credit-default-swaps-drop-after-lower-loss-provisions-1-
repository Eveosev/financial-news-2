The cost to protect the bonds of
 IStar Financial Inc. (SFI)  dropped after the commercial real estate
lender said loan-loss provisions and impairments last quarter
fell 87 percent from a year earlier.  Credit-default swaps fell 1.9 percentage points to 3.8
percent upfront, according to data provider CMA. That’s in
addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $380,000
initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10 million of
iStar’s debt.  IStar recorded $12.3 million of loan-loss provisions and
impairments in the three months ended March 31, down from $95.4
million for the year-earlier period, according to a statement
today. The New York-based company also extended debt maturities
by arranging a $2.95 billion credit agreement to avoid
restructuring obligations.  “The successful refinancing of our credit facilities means
we can now also begin looking forward,” Jay Sugarman, IStar’s
chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement.  IStar has funded properties including the Trump SoHo hotel-
condominium building in lower  Manhattan .  The company’s $99.7 million of 5.85 percent notes due in
2017 rose 2.1 cents to 88.8 cents on the dollar as of 8:15 a.m.
in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Shares of IStar have risen more than 10 percent since the
company announced on Feb. 22 that it engaged JPMorgan Chase &
Co. to arrange the loans to refinance debt. The shares climbed
0.7 percent today to $9.26 as of 10:27 a.m. in New York.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
