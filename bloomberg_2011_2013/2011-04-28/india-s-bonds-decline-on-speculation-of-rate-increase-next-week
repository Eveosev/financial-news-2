India’s bond dropped, pushing
yields close to a two-month high, on speculation the central
bank will boost borrowing costs next week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may raise its repurchase auction
rate by 25 basis points to 7 percent when it meets on May 3,
according to 18 of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Four
forecast a 50-basis point increase. The monetary authority has
raised its overnight lending rate two times this year.  “Everyone will now wait for the policy,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “You may not see much movement in bonds until then.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due April 2021, the
most-traded government security, rose two basis points to 8.11
percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  India ’s food inflation accelerated to a three-week high,
adding pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates . An
index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural products rose
8.76 percent in the week ended April 16 from a year earlier, the
commerce ministry said in a statement in  New Delhi  today. The
gain in the previous week was 8.74 percent.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose three basis points to 7.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
