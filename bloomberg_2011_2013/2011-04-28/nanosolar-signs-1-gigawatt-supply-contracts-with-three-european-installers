Nanosolar Inc., a closely held
maker of thin-film solar products, received three contracts to
supply panels with the capacity to generate as much as 1
gigawatt of electricity.  The contracts were signed with Germany’s  Belectric Trading
GmbH , Paris-based  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN)  and  Plain Energy
GmbH  of Munich, according to a statement from  San Jose ,
California-based Nanosolar today.  The agreements range from three to six years and track
Nanosolar’s effort to expand its manufacturing capacity.
Nanosolar said this month that it would reach production
capacity of 115 megawatts of panels a year.  The panels have conversion efficiency of 10 percent to 12
percent, the ratio between the amount of solar energy they
receive and the amount of electricity that can be generated, the
company said.  “We look forward to achieving a very competitive levelized
cost of energy for our solar installations” with Nanosolar’s
panels, David Corchia, chief executive officer of  EDF Energies,
said in the statement.  Nanosolar said its “roll-to-roll printing process” will
help it reduce production costs to below 60 cents a watt
“within the next several years.”  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest thin-film solar
company, said in February that its panels cost 75 cents a watt
to produce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
