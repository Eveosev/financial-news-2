OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
gas producer, increased fourth-quarter profit 2 percent, beating
analyst estimates, because of higher prices and the sale of OAO
Novatek shares.  Net income rose to 315 billion rubles ($11.4 billion) from
309 billion rubles in the same period last year, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on the Moscow-based company’s
results released today. That beat the average estimate of 280
billion rubles from a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Revenue climbed 30 percent to 1.09 trillion rubles on
higher prices in  Europe  and at home as demand recovered.  “We continue to favor Gazprom in the long run,” Lev Snykov and Svetlana Grizan at VTB Capital said today in a note.
“On a short-term horizon we see several risks that might
negatively affect the stock’s performance.” Those include
possible delays in raising domestic regulated prices and faster-
than-expected increases in the gas extraction tax, they said.  Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, sold a 9.4 percent
stake in Novatek for 57.5 billion rubles in cash in December,
about 34 percent below market value, which has raised concerns
about the company’s transparency. The sale contributed to a 77.4
billion-ruble gain, which also relates to its remaining 9.99
percent in the country’s second-largest gas producer.  Rising Gas Price  Net sales of natural gas rose 27 percent to 686 billion
rubles in the fourth quarter, Gazprom said.  Rising  gas prices  compensated for an 11 percent decrease in
volumes to Europe, Gazprom’s key export market by revenue.
European contract prices are tied to crude and oil-product
prices with a lag of up to nine months, while the government has
mandated a gradual increase in regulated domestic rates to match
the profitability of exports.  Gazprom sold about 40 billion cubic meters of gas to
European customers, as well as liquefied natural gas to  Japan ,
 Korea ,  India ,  Taiwan  and  China  in the fourth quarter, it said
today. Volumes in the same period of 2009 amounted to about 45
billion cubic meters.  The average gas price for countries outside the former
 Soviet Union  jumped 19 percent from the year-earlier period,
reaching $326 per 1,000 cubic meters in the fourth quarter,
Gazprom said today. The average price for countries including
Ukraine and Belarus jumped 30 percent to $238. Domestic prices
rose 18 percent.  ‘Good Growth’  “We plan a good growth of export supplies in 2011 as
compared to 2010,” Igor Sorokin, deputy head of the finance
department, said on a conference call today.  Gazprom’s export unit expects to increase shipments abroad
to 151 billion cubic meters of gas this year, up from about 139
billion cubic meters of gas in 2010, Alexander Medvedev, head of
Gazprom Export, said earlier this week, mainly reconfirming the
previous guidance.  Gazprom sees gas prices for Europe climbing to $500 in
December as the Russian monopoly’s biggest export market sets
“records” on higher  oil prices  and recovering demand, Chief
Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said on April 25.  “In the first quarter of 2011, we expect to see a major
rebound in volumes as a result of the abnormally cold weather
and significant growth in spot prices,” VTB’s Snykov and Grizan
said on April 26.  Gazprom is paying higher gas extraction taxes after the
government raised the levy 61 percent this year to 237 rubles
per 1,000 cubic meters. The  Finance Ministry  is seeking to more
than double the rate to 529 rubles next year and 558 rubles in
2013, Vedomosti reported April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
