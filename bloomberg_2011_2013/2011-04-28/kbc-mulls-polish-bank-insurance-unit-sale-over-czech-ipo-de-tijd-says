KBC Groep NV (KBC)  is considering selling
its Polish banking unit  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  and insurance unit Warta
SA as an alternative to an initial public offering of a minority
stake in its Czech banking unit CSOB AS, De Tijd reported,
without saying where it got the information.  KBC has been planning an IPO for the CSOB stake, in line
with its agreement with the European Union, and to change the
original accord would need EU consent, the newspaper said. KBC
hasnâ€™t yet come to a decision, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
