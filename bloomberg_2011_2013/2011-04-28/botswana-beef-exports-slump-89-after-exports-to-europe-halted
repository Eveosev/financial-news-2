Beef exports from Botswana fell 89
percent in February after the country halted shipments to the
European Union, according to the Bank of Botswana.  Botswana’s beef shipments were 7.5 million pula ($1.2
million) in the month, compared with 66.3 million in January,
according to a statement from the Gaborone-based central bank.  The state-owned Botswana Meat Commission is working to
solve problems outlined in a January EU inspection, including
better identification of animals, said Phil Motsu, head of
veterinary services with the country’s Agriculture Ministry. The
commission wants to restart shipments to the EU by September, he
said today.  Botswana, which also exports meat to neighboring  South
Africa  and  Namibia , is looking for other markets in Africa and
 Asia , said David Felapau, the chief executive officer of the
Lobatse-based commission.  “We might change the volume that we put into the EU market
but we will never walk away from them completely,” he said by
phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
