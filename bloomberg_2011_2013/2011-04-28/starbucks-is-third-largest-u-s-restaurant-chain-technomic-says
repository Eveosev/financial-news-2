Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  has sprinted past
Burger King Holdings Inc. and Wendy’s/Arby’s Group Inc. to
become the third-largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales, says
industry tracker,  Technomic Inc.   Seattle-based Starbucks passed the milestone last year when
sales increased 8.7 percent to $9.07 billion, according to an
estimate by the Chicago-based firm. Technomic data include sales
from company stores and from store licensees.  In 2009, Starbucks was the fifth-largest U.S. restaurant
chain, says Technomic. Starbucks has about 11,000 stores in the
U.S. and about 5,600 international locations.  “There is no doubt that Starbucks has made a tremendous
comeback from a couple of years ago, when they were struggling
quite a bit,” said  Jack Russo , an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.
in  St. Louis . “As the economy recovers, people have a little
bit more money to spend on premium-type product. They should
continue to benefit from an improving economy.”  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  was the biggest restaurant chain with
$32.4 billion in sales, and Subway came second with $10.6
billion, according to a Technomic report this month. Burger King
and Wendy’s/Arby’s placed fourth and fifth, respectively.  Sales at the 500 largest U.S. restaurant chains  gained  1.8
percent to an estimated $234 billion last year, Technomic said.  Starbucks yesterday reported a 20 percent increase in
second-quarter profit as more customers visited the company’s
U.S. coffee shops. Sales at U.S. stores open at least 13 months
rose 7 percent during the quarter, the chain said.  The shares had increased more than fivefold since their
November 2008 low, compared with a 90 percent rise for
restaurant companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
McDonald’s gained 47 percent over the same time. Starbucks fell
31 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $36.88 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
