Namdeb , a diamond mining venture
between  De Beers  and the government of  Namibia , said it expects
to produce about 1.5 million carats of gems this year after
returning to profit in the previous 12 months.  Diamond output is likely to rise from 1.472 million carats
in 2010 in response to a recovery in demand as buyers restock
and as consumers increase spending on  luxury goods , Managing
Director Inge Zaamwani-Kamwi told reporters in Windhoek today.  OAO Alrosa and De Beers, the worldâ€™s two largest gem
producers, are boosting output to take advantage of prices that
returned to levels last seen in June 2008, before the global
credit crisis forced buyers to cut stocks. Demand may climb 8
percent this year, after rising 6.5 percent in 2010, Chaim Even- Zohar, head of industry group Tacy Ltd., said on April 4.  Earlier, Namdeb posted net income of 419 million Namibian
dollars ($63.3 million) for the 12 months to Dec. 31, compared
with a loss of 414 million Namibian dollars a year earlier.  Sales of diamonds rose 12 percent to 1.522 million carats
while revenue jumped almost 50 percent to 5 billion Namibian
dollars as rough stone prices recovered, Zaamwani-Kamwi said.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  owns  45 percent  of De Beers, according
to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
