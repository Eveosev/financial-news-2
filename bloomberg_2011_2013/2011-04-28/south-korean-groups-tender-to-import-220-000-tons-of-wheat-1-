Two South Korean feed-maker groups

notices and two industry executives.  The Korea Feed Association,  South Korea â€™s biggest grain-
buying group, is seeking to purchase 110,000 tons of wheat for
arrival in July and September, according to one of the notices,

110,000 tons of the grain for delivery in July and August, said
the executives who asked not to be identified because tender
