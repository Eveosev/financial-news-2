Oil rose to a 31-month high in  New
York  as the dollar weakened to its lowest level since 2008
against other major currencies and gasoline futures jumped.  Crude gained 10 cents as the Dollar Index, which tracks the
currency against six others, fell after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that the central bank will keep
record-low interest rates in place. Gasoline supplies dropped to
the lowest level since 2009 in a government report yesterday.  “We’re seeing the dollar edging lower, and that’s
providing some support for crude,” said  Matt Smith , a
commodities analyst for Summit Energy Services Inc. in
Louisville,  Kentucky . “The products, especially gasoline, are
also dragging crude higher.”  Crude for June delivery settled at $112.86 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest closing price since
Sept. 22, 2008. Oil has risen 5.7 percent in April and is poised
for an eighth consecutive monthly advance, the longest streak
since the contract began trading in 1983. Futures have gained 36
percent in the past year.  Brent futures for June settlement slipped 11 cents to
$125.02 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The Dollar Index fell to the lowest level since July 31,
2008. The index dropped 0.5 percent to 73.139, its eighth
consecutive daily decline. Weakness in the  U.S. dollar  boosts
the appeal of crude and other commodities as an alternative
investment. Earlier the index touched 72.871.  Dollar’s Decline  The dollar also declined on government reports that the
 U.S. economy  grew at a slower pace than forecast in the first
quarter and jobless claims unexpectedly rose to the highest
level in three months.  Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.8 percent annual
rate from January through March, less than the 2 percent
projected by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. U.S.
economic growth slowed from a 3.1 percent pace in the last three
months of 2010, according to the Commerce Department.  The U.S. economy missed first-quarter growth estimates as
 government spending  declined by the most since 1983. The U.S. is
the world’s largest oil-consuming country.  Jobless claims increased by 25,000 to 429,000 in the week
ended April 23, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. Economists projected they would decline to 395,000
from the 403,000 initially reported for the prior week,
according to the median of 38 estimates in a survey by Bloomberg
News. The government revised the prior week up to 404,000.  Jobless Claims  “People are looking at the unemployment numbers and are
saying that it justifies the Fed fighting unemployment through
low  interest rates  and the weak dollar,” said  Peter Beutel ,
president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy-advisory company in
 New Canaan , Connecticut.  Oil rose along with gasoline after the Energy Department
said yesterday showed that U.S. supplies of the motor fuel fell
2.51 million barrels last week to 205.6 million. The 10-week
streak of declines was the longest in four years. The driving
season, when demand peaks, begins on Memorial Day at the end of
May, and ends on Labor Day in early September.  Gasoline for May delivery climbed 1.04 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.4298 a gallon, the highest settlement since July
14, 2008. Futures have risen 47 percent in the past year.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 488,778
contracts as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 609,202
contracts yesterday, 20 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.58 million contracts, the
highest level in two weeks.  Thin Markets  “The markets are thin and they’re not 100 percent sold on
direction right now,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “We’re looking at two
consecutive holidays in  Europe . Nobody wants to commit yet, and
I don’t think that will happen until next week, when you have
new fund money at the start of the month.”  Financial markets in the U.K. and some other European
countries were closed April 22 and 25 for Good Friday and Easter
Monday. The U.K. has another public holiday tomorrow for the
wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and the U.K.
and a number of other countries including Germany and  China  will
be closed for a holiday on May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
