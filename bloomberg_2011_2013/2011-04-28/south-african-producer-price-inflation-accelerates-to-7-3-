The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a faster pace in March than
the previous month as fuel and food costs surged.  Producer prices increased an annual 7.3 percent after
gaining 6.7 percent in February, Pretoria-based  Statistics South
Africa  said on its website today. The median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.2 percent. Prices rose
0.9 percent in the month.  Crude oil has surged 24 percent in  New York  this year,
climbing above $100 a barrel and prompting the government to
raise gasoline prices by 5.1 percent on April 6 and 4.8 percent
on March 2. Rising producer costs may add to pressure on the
consumer-price inflation rate, which rose to nine-month high of
4.1 percent in February. The central bank aims to keep inflation
within a range of 3 percent to 6 percent.  “Producer inflation is likely to rise further in the
months ahead, pushed up mainly by higher commodity prices,”
 Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , South Africa’s fourth-largest lender, said
in a note to clients today. “The upside risk to our interest
rate forecast has increased over the past month, given the
persistent surge in food, oil and other commodity prices.”  The rand was at 6.6282 against the dollar as of 1:22 p.m.
in Johannesburg from 6.6068 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157, due 2015, was unchanged at 7.62 percent.  Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus left the benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 5.5 percent for a second meeting on
March 24, concerned that inflation may breach the target. Deputy
Governor  Daniel Mminele  said on April 16 the bank will monitor
the “second-round effects” of rising food and fuel costs on
the economy.  The price of white corn, a staple in  South Africa , has
jumped 27 percent on the South African Futures Exchange this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
