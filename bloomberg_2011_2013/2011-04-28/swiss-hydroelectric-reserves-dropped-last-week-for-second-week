Swiss hydroelectric reserves fell
for a second week last week, reducing the availability of water
to generate electricity.  Reservoir levels dropped 0.3 percentage point to 13.2
percent full in the week through April 25, the Bern,
Switzerland-based Swiss Federal Energy Office said today in an
e-mailed statement. They typically rise 0.1 percentage point in
the week, according to data kept since 1997.  Switzerland  relies on hydropower for more than half its
annual electricity consumption of about 55 terawatt-hours. Water
supplies typically fall from October to April during the winter
season and are replenished from May to September by rain and
melting snow.  Water levels on the Rhine River, which flows to the
Netherlands from the Swiss Alps, fell to a 17-month low today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
