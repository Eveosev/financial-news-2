Kenya ’s government lost an
estimated 1.6 billion shillings ($19.2 million) because of
illegal sugar imports in the 12 months through March, according
to the acting chief executive officer of the Kenya Sugar Board.  About 17,000 metric tons of sugar imported over the period
may have come from  Brazil  and not Egypt as registered on import
papers, Solomon Odera said by phone today. Egypt is part of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, meaning its
exports to Kenya don’t pay any duties.  Egyptian authorities are helping with the investigation
into the scam, Odera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
