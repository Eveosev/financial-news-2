Glenn Maguire , chief Asia economist
at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong , comments on odds of a one-
off revaluation in the yuan. He was speaking in a Bloomberg
Television interview.  The yuan strengthened 0.15 percent to 6.5015 per dollar as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.5003 earlier, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  “I think when we look at what exactly is causing China’s
inflation and liquidity problem, it appears to be capital
inflows and those capital inflows are determined primarily by
yuan expectations.  “The easiest way to stop that expectation is to do a one-
off revaluation of the currency or probably allow the currency
to weaken for a period before moving sideways in wider trading
bands. It’s a potential policy option for them.  “An interest-rate hike does little to siphon the quantity
of money out of the economy and the reserve requirement has only
drained the liquidity created by  China ’s vast pool of foreign-
exchange reserves. To get to the heart of China’s inflation
problem, they need to adjust the currency mechanism.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
