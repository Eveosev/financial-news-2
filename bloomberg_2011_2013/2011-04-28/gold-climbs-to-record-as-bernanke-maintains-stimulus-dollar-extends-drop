Gold advanced to a record after the
 Federal Reserve  pledged to keep interest rates near zero to
bolster the recovery, weakening the dollar and boosting demand
for precious metals as a store of value.  Immediate-delivery gold gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,533 an ounce, and traded at $1,530.13 at 1:46 p.m. in
 Singapore . Bullion for June delivery in  New York  rose as much as
1.1 percent to $1,534, an all-time high.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled yesterday that the
U.S. central bank will maintain monetary stimulus. The central
bank kept its target rate for overnight lending between banks at
zero to 0.25 percent, while ending $600 billion of bond
purchases on schedule in June.  “What’s behind gold’s rally is investors’ fear over the
dollar’s decline,” said Hwang Il Doo, a Seoul-based senior
trader at KEB Futures Co. “As long as the U.S. keeps  interest
rates  low, it’s perceived by the market to buy more gold.”  The dollar fell beyond $1.48 per euro for the first time
since December 2009 after the Fed’s pledge. The Dollar Index,
which tracks its value against six counterparts, declined for an
eighth day to the lowest level since July 2008.  Gold has gained 7.7 percent this year, extending a decade-
long advance, the best run since at least 1920, as the prospect
of currency debasement and accelerating inflation fuel investor
demand. Fighting in Libya and sovereign-debt turmoil in  Europe 
have also contributed to the rally this year.  Credit Suisse’s Call  Gold will reach $1,650 an ounce in the next 12 months as
investment demand increases on the back of low interest rates,
Credit Suisse AG said yesterday. Assets held in exchange-traded
products backed by gold stood at 2,069.98 tons yesterday,
compared with record holdings of 2,114.6 tons touched in
December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Gold remains in a stable uptrend,”  Tobias Merath ,
Zurich-based head of commodity research at Credit Suisse, wrote
in a monthly report yesterday. “We expect to see a renewed
increase in investment demand over the coming month.”  Gold futures in  Shanghai  rose to a record 318.56 yuan
($48.98) per gram. Cash silver strengthened 0.6 percent to
$48.1313 an ounce, gaining for a second day and approaching the
record $49.79 reached on April 25. Palladium was little changed
at $768.75 an ounce, while platinum fell 0.3 percent to $1,821
an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story;
