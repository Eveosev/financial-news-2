Corn futures tumbled the most
allowed by the  Chicago  Board of Trade after a government report
showed that demand is easing for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter. Soybeans fell from a two-week high.  U.S. exporters sold 348,969 metric tons of corn in the week
ended April 21, down 43 percent from a week earlier and the
smallest amount in  six months , the Department of Agriculture
said today. Prices doubled in the 12 months after adverse
weather limited the size of last year’s crop and demand rose for
livestock feed and grain-based fuel.  “Export sales are showing a little bit of a slowdown in
demand,” said Bill Gentry, a broker at Risk Management
Commodities Inc. in Lafayette,  Indiana . “We are seeing some
liquidation” of bets on higher prices, he said.  Corn futures for July delivery fell by the limit of 30
cents, or 4 percent, to close at $7.2925 bushel at 1:15 p.m. on
the CBOT, the biggest decline since March 15. The most-active
contract reached a 33-month high at $7.8875 on April 11.  The price also fell on forecasts for drier weather in
western areas of the U.S. Midwest in the next eight days that
may allow for increased planting, said  Dale Durchholz , senior
market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois .  About 9 percent of the crop was planted as of April 24,
compared with 46 percent a year earlier, the government said
this week.  “Worries about U.S. planting delays may have peaked,”
Durchholz said. “There is plenty of time to plant corn next
month, and people are going to be surprised by how many acres
farmers can plant in a short period.”  Soybeans fell as overseas and domestic demand eased,
Durchholz said. Futures for July delivery dropped 31 cents, or
2.2 percent, to close at $13.535 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier,
the price touched $14.005, the highest since April 11.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
