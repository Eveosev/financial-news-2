Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
 Roger Altman , said first-quarter profit rose 9.6 percent on an
increase in investment-banking revenue.  Earnings excluding certain items rose to $11.4 million, or
28 cents a share, from $10.4 million, or 26 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement. The
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
adjusted earnings of 25 cents.  Chief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein, 60, said earlier
this month that Evercore is in the second year of a five- to
eight-year recovery in mergers and acquisitions. The firm drew
about 80 percent of its revenue from investment banking last
year.  “Our core advisory business continued the momentum of last
quarter, advising on several of this year’s most prominent
transactions,” Schlosstein said in the statement.  Investment banking  pro-forma net revenue increased to $80.6
million from $72.9 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. Evercore earned advisory fees from 79 clients in the
quarter, up from 70 in the year-earlier period. Compensation
expenses for the investment-banking unit increased 17 percent to
$47.5 million.  Evercore’s pro-forma net revenue rose to $106.2 million in
the first quarter from $85.1 million in the year-earlier period,
the firm said.  Advisory Market Share  Evercore was the 11th-ranked financial adviser in the first
quarter, claiming a 9.6 percent market share of announced deals,
according to Bloomberg data. In the first quarter of last year,
Evercore was ranked 33rd, with 1.3 percent of the market share.  In the first-quarter, the company helped  AT&T Inc. (T)  with its
$39 billion announced takeover of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile
USA unit, this year’s biggest. Evercore also advised  Lubrizol
Corp. (LZ)  on its $9.2 billion sale to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. and advised  Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN) , the French
drugmaker, on its $20.1 billion purchase of  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ)   “These transactions and our improved backlog portend a
strong start to the year as the M&A market is strengthening,”
Altman, 64, said in the statement.  Investment management pro-forma net revenue more than
doubled to $25.6 million in the first quarter, and the unit
swung to a profit of $1.91 million compared with a loss of $2.8
million in the same quarter last year, according to the
statement.  Compensation Expenses  Evercore’s compensation expenses increased 26 percent to
$70 million in the first quarter, the firm said. Compensation
costs rose to 60 percent of revenue from 59 percent in the first
quarter last year.  The company declared an 18-cent quarterly dividend payable
June 10 to shareholders of record on May 27. The dividend is
unchanged from January.  Evercore rose 20 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $34.30 at 4:03
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They gained
0.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
