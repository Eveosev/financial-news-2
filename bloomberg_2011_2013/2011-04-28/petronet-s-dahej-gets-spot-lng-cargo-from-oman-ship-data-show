Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) ’s Dahej terminal
on  India ’s west coast received 62,000 metric tons of liquefied
natural gas yesterday, according to ship transmissions on
Bloomberg and vessel fixtures on shipping newsletter EXIM India.  The Ibra LNG arrived from  Oman , according to ship
transmissions captured by AIS Live on Bloomberg. The vessel was
last seen off the coast of Gujarat, near Dahej. Petronet is
India’s biggest importer of LNG and leases its terminal to other
companies.  India’s LNG imports may rise after natural gas production
dropped from a record last year. Output from the country’s
largest deposit is declining and fields are aging, Petronet said
April 20.  The company imported nine LNG cargoes from the  spot market 
in the year ended March 31 and will increase purchases this
financial year, Managing Director A.K. Balyan said April 20. The
company’s 10 million ton-a-year terminal at Dahej and used 9.5
million tons of capacity last year, he said.  Petronet imports 7.5 million tons of LNG a year from Qatar
under a long-term contract.  LNG is natural gas that’s chilled to a liquid, reducing it
to one-six-hundredth of its original volume at minus 161 degrees
Celsius (minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit), for transportation by
ship to destinations not connected by pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
