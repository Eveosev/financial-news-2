The construction of a new terminal
at  Kenya ’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is expected to be
completed by the end of 2012, Transport Minister Amos Kimunya
said.  The expansion will allow the airport to handle 9 million
passengers each year, from the current traffic of more than 6
million passengers, Kimunya told reporters today in Nairobi, the
capital.  The Kenya Airports Authority received a loan of 15.5
billion shillings ($186 million) in June for the expansion of
the airport, which serves as a hub for East Africa. The funding,
including a $6 million grant from the Luxembourg-based  European
Investment Bank , will also be used to expand an existing
terminal and install a new baggage-handling system.  The new terminal and a multistorey parking facility is the
second phase of the airport’s expansion, Kimunya said. In
September 2006, $40 million was spent to nearly double the
number of aircraft-parking bays to 43.  “We also have plans to construct a second runway to handle
the ever-increasing traffic,” Kimunya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
