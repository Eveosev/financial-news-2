The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
begin a 10 percent slump in June after the  Federal Reserve  ends
its bond-buying program, Credit Suisse Group AG’s Douglas Cliggott said.  “It’s probably going to get bumpy in the equity market
when the Federal Reserve stops growing its balance sheet,”
Cliggott, the Boston-based U.S. equity strategist at Credit
Suisse, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  The  S&P 500  has surged 30 percent since Aug. 26, a day
before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, that he was willing to act to boost growth. In
November, the central bank pledged $600 billion in bond
purchases through June. The benchmark measure for U.S. stocks
climbed 0.4 percent to an almost three-year high of 1,360.48 at
4 p.m. in  New York  today. The index rallied yesterday after the
Fed renewed its pledge to stimulate the economy.  Cliggott cited last year as an example of the potential for
declines after the Fed stops helping the economy through so-
called quantitative easing. The S&P 500’s price-to-earnings
ratio slumped to a low of 13.6 in July from a high of 18.7 in
March 2010, according to Bloomberg data. The S&P 500 now trades
at 15.6 times earnings.  “We don’t think we’ll get as severe a decline in P/E
multiples this time around,” Cliggott said. “But we do think
1.5 multiple points will come off the market and that will
translate into about a 10 percent pullback.”  Year-End Forecast  Cliggott forecasts the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks will
end this year at 1,250, the second-lowest prediction out of 13
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The average estimate is
1,400.  Investors will get the “best value” by buying companies
with the most market value and the highest dividends, according
to Cliggott. He said that accelerating inflation may curb U.S.
economic growth in the second half of the year. The Fed said
yesterday the increase is probably temporary.  “We’re getting both a downshift in  consumer spending  and a
downshift in business spending,” he said. “There’s a reason to
be optimistic that business spending will pick up because
companies have a lot of cash and continue to invest in
technology. The real $64,000 question is the American consumer.
It’s pretty uncomfortable with  oil prices  and food prices
climbing higher.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
