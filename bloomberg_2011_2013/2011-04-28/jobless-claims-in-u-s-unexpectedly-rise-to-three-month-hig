New applications for  unemployment
benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly rose last week to the highest
level in three months, a sign progress in the labor market may
be stalling.  Jobless claims increased by 25,000 to 429,000 in the week
ended April 23, the most since late January, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The government anticipates a
drop in unadjusted applications during the Good Friday holiday
week, something that didn’t happen this year, a Labor Department
spokesman said.  The report also showed the number of people on unemployment
benefit rolls and those receiving extended payments dropped, a
sign the jobless rate may fall in coming months. Companies have
been cautious about ramping up hiring until they see further
signs the recovery is self-sustaining, one reason why Federal
Reserve policy makers yesterday pledged to complete their asset-
purchase plan by June and keep borrowing costs near zero.  “It’s clearly disappointing,” said  Michael Feroli , chief
U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New York . “It may be
that the pace of improvement is slowing.”  The economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first
three months of the year, down from a 3.1 percent pace in the
fourth quarter, as  government spending  dropped by the most in 28
years, a report from the Commerce Department also showed today.  Shares Fall  Stock-index futures dropped after the reports and  Treasury
securities  rose. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
fell 0.2 percent to 1,349 at 8:56 a.m. in New York. The yield on
the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to
prices, fell to 3.32 percent from 3.36 percent late yesterday.  Economists projected claims would decline to 395,000 from
the 403,000 initially reported for the prior week, according to
the median estimate of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Estimates ranged from 375,000 to 410,000. The government revised
the prior week up to 404,000.  The holiday-shortened week usually causes unadjusted claims
to fall by about 18,500, a Labor Department spokesman said as
the data was released to the press. Instead, they rose by about
3,500, he said.  The temporary auto-plant shutdowns caused by the disaster
in  Japan  have led to some increase in claims, the spokesman
said. Nonetheless, the closures are not having “a huge
effect,” he said.  Average Climbs  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, rose to 408,500 last week from 399,250 the
prior week.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 68,000 in the week ended April 16 to 3.64 million,
the fewest since September 2008.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
76,400 to 4.165 million in the week ended April 9.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 2.9 percent from
3 percent the prior week, today’s report showed.  Forty-three states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while 10 reported an increase. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Claims, Payrolls  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  The economy added 196,000 jobs in April and the jobless
rate held at 8.8 percent, economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast the Labor Department will report on May 6.  The economy added 216,000 jobs in March, the most since May
2010, Labor Department figures showed April 1.  “The economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace
and overall conditions in the labor market are improving
gradually,” Fed policy makers said yesterday after their policy
meeting.  The jobless rate will still be 8.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to the median forecast of economists in a
separate Bloomberg survey this month.  Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. lender by assets,
has been cutting jobs in the mortgage-origination business as
demand falls for home loans.  Cutting Jobs  “We have been reducing head count by approximately 3,500
people,” Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said April
15 in a conference call with analysts and investors in the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank. “About 2,000 of those are
contractors in that business and about 1,500 are teammates.”  Some companies are turning more optimistic about hiring.
 Oak Brook , Illinois-based  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain by revenue, sought as many as 50,000 workers in
the U.S. during its National Hiring Day event on April 19.  “We do and have continued to hire through some of the
economic downturns, Donald Thompson, chief operating officer at
McDonald’s, said on an April 21 conference call. “We also
thought it would be a more unified way to get the message out
that McDonald’s is hiring.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
