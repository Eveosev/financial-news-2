International Paper Co. (IP) , the
world’s largest paper and pulp producer, reported first-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as a recovering  U.S.
economy  spurred demand for consumer and industrial packaging.  Net income was $342 million, or 78 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $162 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, the
Memphis, Tennessee-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings excluding some items were 74 cents, more than the 59-
cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer John Faraci said in an interview
that the U.S. economy “is growing at a frustratingly slow rate,
but it is growing.” The company’s global sales rose 10 percent
to $6.39 billion, exceeding the $6.36 billion average estimate,
as volumes increased for both consumer and industrial packaging.  “They materially beat expectations,” said Joshua Zaret, a
New York-based analyst at Longbow Research. “The standouts were
really consumer packaging and industrial packaging in an
environment of rising oil and input costs.”  Sales rose 3.6 percent to 715,000 short tons for consumer
packaging and 2 percent to 3.45 million tons for industrial
packaging, including containerboard.  The price of linerboard, a type of containerboard, averaged
$640 a ton in the quarter, 16 percent more than a year earlier,
according to data from Pulp & Paper Network LLC. Containerboard
producer inventories in the U.S. fell 7 percent in March, the
largest monthly drop since October 2007, Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts said in an April 15 report.  Shares Gain  International Paper rose 50 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
$30.48 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 12 percent this year.  Faraci said his expectations for continued U.S. economic
expansion are “pretty modest,” partly reflecting the effect of
rising oil prices. The U.S. accounted for 77 percent of the
company’s 2010 sales.  The first-quarter profit included expenses such as
restructuring and severance, as well as charges related to a
Scottish mill closed in 2009, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
