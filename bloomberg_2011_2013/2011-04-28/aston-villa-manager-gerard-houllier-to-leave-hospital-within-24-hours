Aston Villa manager  Gerard Houllier 
will be released from the hospital in the next 24 hours after
being treated for a heart problem.  Houllier, 63, was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
Birmingham on April 20 and tests revealed his chest pain was
caused by an inner wall tear of the descending aorta. He was
given the OK to go home after passing his latest scan, Villa
assistant manager Gary McAllister said on the Premier League
soccer club’s website.  “He is feeling fantastic,” McAllister, who’s been in
charge of the team in Houllier’s absence,  said . “The news from
the scan has convinced doctors he is fit enough to go home.”  McAllister will lead Villa, which is 13th in the Premier
League, in its game at West Bromwich in two days.  Houllier managed Liverpool from 1998-2004, winning the F.A.
Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup titles in 2001. That same year he
had open-heart surgery which led to a five-month break from the
game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
