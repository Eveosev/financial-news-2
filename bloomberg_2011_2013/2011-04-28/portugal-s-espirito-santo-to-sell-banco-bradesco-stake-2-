Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s
biggest publicly traded bank in market value, agreed to sell a
stake in  Brazil ’s  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  for 2 billion reais ($1.3
billion), improving its  capital ratios .  Cidade de Deus Companhia Comercial de Participacoes, a
holding company that controls 48 percent of Bradesco’s voting
rights, agreed to acquire 78 million ordinary shares, with 4.1
percent of the Brazilian lender’s voting rights, Espirito Santo
said.  The transaction will have a positive impact of 60 basis
points, or 0.6 percentage point, on the bank’s Tier 1 capital
ratio and 30 basis points on its Core Tier 1 ratio, Lisbon-based
Espirito Santo said today in a regulatory filing. The bank had a
Tier 1 ratio of 8.8 percent at the end of 2010 and a Core Tier 1
of 7.9 percent.  The Bank of  Portugal  said April 7 the country’s lenders
must have a core tier 1 capital ratio of 8 percent by year-end.
Portugal this month became the third euro-area state after
Greece and Ireland to succumb to the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis and request emergency aid.  Bradesco was Espirito Santo’s third-biggest investor as of
Dec. 31, with a 6.05 percent holding, according to the
Portuguese bank’s  website . Espirito Santo held 3.55 percent of
Bradesco’s capital as of Dec. 31, according to the Bradesco
 website .  The total amount sold by both Espirito Santo and ESAF -
Sociedade Gestora de Fundos de Investimento Mobiliarios SA fund
was 5.4 percent of Bradesco’s common shares for 2.8 billion
reais, according to a regulatory filing sent by Cidade de Deus
to the Brazilian securities regulator later in the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
