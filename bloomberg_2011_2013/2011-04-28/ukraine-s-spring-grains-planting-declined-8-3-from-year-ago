Planting of spring grains
in Ukraine fell 8.3 percent to 4.4 million hectares (10.9
million acres) as of yesterday, from 4.8 million hectares a year
ago, according to the country’s Agriculture Ministry.  About 56 percent of the spring grains for the 2011 harvest
have been planted, the Kiev-based ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Barley planting covered 2.65 million hectares. Corn
planting accounted for 816,000 hectares, or 26 percent of the
total forecast, the ministry said.  Sugar beet areas covered 493,000 hectares, compared with
435,000 hectares in the year-earlier period. Sunflower-seed
planting covered 1.09 million hectares, which accounts for 31
percent of the forecast, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
