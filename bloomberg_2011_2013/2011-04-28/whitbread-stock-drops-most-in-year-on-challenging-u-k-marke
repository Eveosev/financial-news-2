Whitbread Plc (WTB) , owner of the Premier
Inn hotel and Costa Coffee brands, fell the most in almost a
year in London trading as a decline in consumer sentiment in
Britain indicated retail spending may decline.  Whitbread dropped as much as 104 pence, or 6 percent, to
1,633 pence, the biggest intraday decline since May 7, and was
down 4.4 percent as of 9:43 a.m. in London.  U.K. consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in two
years as the government’s budget cuts began, according to
figures released today by GfK NOP Ltd. research group. Market
conditions “have become progressively more challenging,”
Dunstable, England-based Whitbread said today.  “It seems clear that the more difficult macroeconomic
environment is having an impact,” Wyn Ellis, an analyst at
Numis Securities in  London , said in a note today, adding
consensus pretax-profit estimates may be cut by 5 percent from
about 320 million pounds ($534 million). Whitbread’s
profitability may also be under pressure as prices for Arabica
coffee have more than doubled, he said.  Whitbread said earlier today that revenue in the year
through March 3 rose 12 percent to 1.6 billion pounds. Including
only outlets that have been open at least a year, sales advanced
6.6 percent. Net income jumped 39 percent to 223.3 million
pounds, and pretax profit rose 30 percent to 271 million pounds.  “Despite a more challenging consumer economy, we are
confident that we will continue to outperform, based on the
strength of our brands,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Harrison
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
