Canada’s hog herd was 1.4 percent
larger as of April 1 than a year earlier, as the country
exported fewer animals,  Statistics Canada  said.  The herd totaled 11.8 million hogs at the start of the
month, up from 11.7 million a year earlier, the government
agency said today in a  report . The breeding herd numbered 1.3
million sows, little changed from April 2010. About 1.4 million
hogs were exported in the first quarter, down 3.6 percent from
the year-earlier period, Stats Can said.  “We are retaining more hogs locally,” Victor Aideyan, a
senior risk-management consultant at HISGRAIIN Commodities Inc.
in  London , Ontario, said in a telephone interview. “We’re
shipping less. That explains the slight growth in the herd.”  The breeding herd “appears to have stabilized” after a
drop that began in the second quarter of 2007 and continued
until the first three months of 2010, the agency said.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.2 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at 96.5 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price dropped for the sixth straight
session, the longest slide since October 2008. Earlier, the
price touched 95.425 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since March 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
