India ’s food inflation accelerated
to a three-week high, adding pressure on the central bank to
raise  interest rates  next week.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products rose 8.76 percent in the week ended April 16 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a statement in New
Delhi today. The gain in the previous week was 8.74 percent.  The  Reserve Bank of India  may boost rates for the third
time in 2011 in the May 3 policy announcement, economists said.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays
Plc raised their forecast for rate increases this year after
benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to 8.98 percent
last month, stoked by food and manufactured products.  “The RBI will most likely hike rates again next week,”
said  Dharmakirti Joshi , Mumbai-based chief economist at Crisil
Ltd., a unit of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao may raise the central bank’s
repurchase rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 7 percent,
according to 17 of 21 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Four expect a half-point increase.  The Reserve Bank has boosted borrowing costs by 200 basis
points since mid-March 2010 in eight moves.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index fell 0.2
percent at 11.54 a.m. in Mumbai, while the yield on the 8.08
percent note due August 2022 gained three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.29 percent.  Fruits, Onions  Food inflation quickened as prices of fruits rose 28
percent from a year ago, today’s statement showed. Onions gained
11 percent and poultry costs climbed 12 percent.  Goldman Sachs estimated this month the  Reserve Bank  will
probably increase rates by another 1.25 percentage points in
2011, more than the half-point increase predicted earlier.
Standard Chartered forecast the repurchase rate will rise by 1
percentage point in six months, while Barclays predicted a 75-
basis point increase, compared with earlier estimates of 50
basis points.  Prime Minster  Manmohan Singh ’s government is betting on
normal rains this year to boost farm production and tame food
inflation, which averaged 18 percent in 2010.  The June to September monsoon rain, the main source of
irrigation in India, will be normal for a second year, the  India
Meteorological Department  said April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
