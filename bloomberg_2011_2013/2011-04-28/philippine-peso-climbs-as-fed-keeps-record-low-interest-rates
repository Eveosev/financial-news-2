The Philippine peso surged to a
five-month high on speculation demand for the dollar will wane
after the  Federal Reserve  said it will keep borrowing costs at a
record low. Bonds gained.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks advanced for
the first time in five days after the Fed left its benchmark
interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s
been since December 2008. The Philippine central bank may raise
borrowing costs again this year from 4.25 percent, Governor
Amando Tetangco said earlier this month.  “It seems to be a reality that the Fed will keep rates low
and that is weakening the dollar,” said Rafael Algarra,
executive vice president and treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in
Manila. “There will be more demand for higher-yielding
currencies including the peso.”  The peso rose 0.7 percent to 42.935 per dollar as of 4:15
p.m. in  Manila , the highest level since Nov. 8, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
currency against those of six major trading partners, dropped
0.6 percent to 73.051 and earlier reached 72.871, the lowest
level since July 2008.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas increased its benchmark rate in
March for the first time since August 2008 from a record-low 4
percent. Policy makers next meet to decide on interest rates on
May 5.  Benchmark three-year bonds advanced for a third day,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in three months, after
Moody’s Investors Service said today it may raise the
 Philippines ’ credit rating “sooner rather than later.”  Deficit Impressive  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.49 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. That was the lowest
since Jan. 14.  The government had a budget deficit of 26.2 billion pesos
($610 million) last quarter, less than the official target of
112 billion pesos, a government report showed yesterday.  The first-quarter budget shortfall data was “very, very
encouraging,” Christian de Guzman, assistant vice president of
Moody’s in  Singapore , said in a telephone interview. “It is
very impressive. There is a very strong case for an upgrade to
be made sooner rather than later.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
