OAO Sollers,  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s
Russian partner, said its loss last year narrowed as sales
advanced along with the domestic economy.  Net loss attributable to shareholders shrank to 1.8 billion
rubles ($65.4 million) from 5.3 billion rubles in 2009, Moscow-
based Sollers said in a statement today. Sales climbed 59
percent to 55.3 billion rubles in the period.  Ford Sollers, the planned 50-50 venture between Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford and Sollers,  Russia ’s second-largest
automaker, plans to manufacture Ford vehicles at plants near  St.
Petersburg  and in the Tatarstan region this year. Sollers’s
plant in Tatarstan can build 200,000 cars a year, while Ford’s
near St. Petersburg can assemble 125,000 vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
