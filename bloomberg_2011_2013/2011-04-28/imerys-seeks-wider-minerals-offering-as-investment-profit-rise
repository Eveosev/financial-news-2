Imerys SA (NK) , a French processor of
minerals, building materials and paper pigments, is seeking to
expand its offering of minerals and boost investments as
rebounding demand from steelmakers and builders lifts earnings.  “Regarding external growth, we want to widen our minerals
portfolios,” Chief Financial Officer Michel Delville said in a
telephone interview today. He cited wollastonite, used in making
products such as plastics, and bentonite as potential gaps in
Imerys’s mineral offering.  “We’re in a pickup phase” for investment and “we’re
cautiously optimistic” for 2011, the CFO said. The lack of
pickup in U.S. construction, the dollar’s drop and the rise in
energy and raw-material prices are adding to “uncertainties,”
he said.  The Paris-based company, which expects to complete the
purchase of the talc unit of Rio Tinto Plc. by mid-year, expects
a “further improvement in performance” in 2011 as  France ’s
construction market gathers pace and demand from makers of cars,
 machine tools  and electronics goods continues to grow in
emerging markets.  First-quarter sales rose 17 percent to 882.7 million euros
($1.3 billion), and operating profit excluding expenses climbed
37 percent to 116.4 million euros, Imerys said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
