Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to the
strongest level in more than 13 years on speculation the Federal
Reserve’s decision to keep its interest-rate target at a record
low will boost demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  retained a pledge to keep it
“exceptionally low” for an “extended period.” Taiwan’s
currency has appreciated 2.3 percent this month as exchange data
show overseas investors bought $2.9 billion more local shares
than they sold.  “The dovish comments coming out from Bernanke led to the
Taiwan dollar’s appreciation,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based
foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank.
“It’s mostly foreign investors buying the currency.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.5 percent to NT$28.760
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$28.672 earlier, the
strongest level since October 1997.  Government bonds  fell for a second day. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-active government
security, climbed one basis point to 1.09 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
