Citigroup Inc. (C)  hired Dmitry
Ankudinov as head of banking for Russia, replacing Alex
Waechter, who becomes head of banking for the Commonwealth of
Independent States region.  Ankudinov joined from Renaissance Capital, where he was a
senior banker supporting the investment banking, asset
management and consumer credit businesses, Citigroup said in an
internal memo seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a company
spokesman. Irackly Mtibelishvily, currently chairman of banking
for Russia, will add the CIS to his portfolio.  Citigroup is expanding as Russia begins a new round of
state asset sales and as competition for banking skills in
Moscow intensifies. Last month, the New York-based bank hired
four former Troika Dialog bankers, including  Kingsmill Bond , the
Moscow brokerage’s chief strategist.  “The CIS regional approach aligns the banking organization
with Citi’s other institutional businesses, allowing a more
integrated and effective delivery of advice, products and client
coverage,” James Bardrick, co-head of banking for  Europe , the
Middle East and Africa, said in the memo.  The CIS comprises former Soviet republics, excluding the
three Baltic republics and Georgia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
