Copper in New York rose for the
second time this week after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it will
maintain monetary stimulus, boosting the prospects for metals
demand.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of shares added as much as 1 percent
to the highest level since July 2008. The U.S. Dollar Index, a
six-currency gauge of the greenback’s strength, fell as much as
0.9 percent, heading for a fifth straight weekly drop. A weaker
dollar spurs demand for commodities as alternative investments.  Copper advanced “mostly on higher risk appetite, as
witnessed by the friendly equity markets and the pronounced
weakness of the U.S. dollar,” said Eugen Weinberg, the head of
commodity research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  Copper futures for July delivery gained 1.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to close at $4.2615 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York .  The Fed will maintain its record monetary stimulus after
ending $600 billion of bond purchases on schedule in June,
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday after policy makers
concluded a two-day meeting. The economy is recovering at a
“moderate pace,” and a pickup in inflation is likely to be
temporary, the central bank said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery fell $1 to $9,320 a metric ton ($4.23 a pound). The
exchange was closed on April 22 and April 25 for public holidays
in the U.K. It will be shut again tomorrow and May 2.  Aluminum, tin, zinc and nickel gained in London. Lead fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
