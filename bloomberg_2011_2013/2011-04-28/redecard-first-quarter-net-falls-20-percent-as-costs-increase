Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-
largest card-payment processor by market value, said profit fell
20 percent in the first quarter, as costs rose almost by half.  Net income fell to 281.3 million reais ($179.6 million)
from 352.6 million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based
company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The result was in
line with the mean estimate of 282.5 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of six analysts. The combined value of credit-
and debit-card transactions increased 30 percent to 51.6 billion
reais, and total cost of services rose 43 percent to 247.8
million reais.  “Redecard maintained an aggressive approach in the
quarter,” Banco Fator Corretora analysts Jacqueline Lison and
Mateus Renault said in an April 25 note. “The renegotiations
and greater volume captured by the Visa brand, which charges a
higher fee than Mastercard, continued to squeeze the company´s
operating margins.”  Redecard rose 0.7 percent to 22.55 reais in  Sao Paulo 
yesterday. The shares have risen 7.1 percent this year, while
Brazil’s Bovespa index has fallen 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
