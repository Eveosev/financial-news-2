Jordan  will reissue a tender to buy
100,000 metric tons of wheat next week because prices offered by
suppliers were too high, according to the Ministry of Industry
and Trade.  “The offers were not suitable, so we will issue another
tender next week that will close on May 10,” spokesman Yanal
al-Barmawi said by telephone from Amman. The grain “will go
into our strategic reserves, which are ample and can last us for
10 months,” he said.  The original wheat tender, announced by the ministry on
April 13, closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
