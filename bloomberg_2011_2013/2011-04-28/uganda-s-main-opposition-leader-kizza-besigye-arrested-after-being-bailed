Uganda ’s main opposition leader
 Kizza Besigye  of the Forum for Democratic party was arrested
today as he drove to a bank in city suburb, a day after he was
released on both bail and a bond on earlier charges of holding
an unlawful assembly, party spokesman Wafula Ogutu said.  “He was driving to his bank in Wandegeya to withdraw some
money when he was intercepted and blocked from proceeding,”
Ogutu said by phone from the capital, Kampala. “He isn’t
permitted to walk and when he tried to drive he was arrested
leaving us with a dilemma.”  Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said she didn’t have
