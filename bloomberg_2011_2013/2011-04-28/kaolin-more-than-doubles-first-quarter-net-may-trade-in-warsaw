Kaolin AD (6K1) , a Bulgarian company with
stakes in mining, refining and trading industrial minerals, said
first-quarter net income soared to 1.4 million lev ($1.06
million) from 668,000 lev a year ago.  Kaolin’s management will start preparations this month to
list stocks on an exchange abroad “most likely in Warsaw” to
attract more investors, the company said on its  website .  Overall sales rose 29 percent to 33 million lev in the
first three months of the year, led by demand in the ceramics
and paper industries, the company said.  The Senovo, Bulgaria-based company mines and produces
silica sand, kaolin, limestone and similar materials used in the
construction, glass and ceramics industries and has units in
Ukraine,  Turkey , Romania, Serbia and Albania. Its main markets
are in southeastern  Europe , northern Africa and the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
