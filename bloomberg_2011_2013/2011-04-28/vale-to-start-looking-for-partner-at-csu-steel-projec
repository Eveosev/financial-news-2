Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, said now is the “best moment” to look for a
partner for its CSU steel project in  Brazil .  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, will start the search after
securing the land and a license for the project in Brazil’s
Espirito Santo state, said Aristides Corbellini, director of the
company’s steel business. Vale will likely maintain at least a
25 percent stake in the project, Corbellini said today at an
event in Rio, declining to name possible partners.  Vale has a stake in a joint venture in Rio de Janeiro state
with ThyssenKrupp AG and is developing a 3 million-ton slab
plant in the Brazilian state of Ceara with Dongkuk Steel Mill
Co. and Posco. The CSU project will have the capacity to produce
5 million tons from an integrated steel-slab plant, set to start
in 2014.  Vale’s steel strategy is to hold “temporary minority
stakes” in new projects in Brazil with the goal of “being the
exclusive supplier of  iron ore  and pellets to the mills,” the
company said Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
