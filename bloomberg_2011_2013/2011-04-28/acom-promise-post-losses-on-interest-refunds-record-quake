Acom Co. and Promise Co.,  Japan ’s
two biggest consumer lenders, posted losses last year as
overcharged-interest repayments rose and it set aside additional
funds to cover bad-loans related to Japan’s record earthquake.  Acom’s loss for the year ended March 31 was a greater-than-
forecast 202.6 billion yen ($2.48 billion), compared with a 7.2
billion yen loss a year earlier, it said in a preliminary
earnings statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Promise,
partly owned by  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , swung to a
96 billion yen loss from a 14.6 billion yen profit, it said.  The magnitude-9 quake and ensuing tsunami that devastated
parts of northern Japan on March 11 forced Acom to set aside
10.1 billion yen for bad loans. The  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306)  affiliate on Nov. 9 had forecast an annual loss of
50.9 billion yen.  The disaster sent Japan’s factory output down by 15.3
percent in March from a month earlier, the biggest drop since
data began in 1953, and household spending dropped 8.5 percent
from a year earlier. The number of dead and missing totaled
25,920 as of 10 a.m. local time today, according to the
country’s  National Police Agency .  Japan’s consumer lenders are also coping with a four-year
crackdown on coercive lending that has resulted in customer
claims and lawsuits seeking repayment of overcharged interest.
Promise said today it booked provisions of 238 billion yen to
cover overpaid-interest repayments, as the September bankruptcy
of rival Takefuji Corp. spurred claims from borrowers.  Kyoto-based  Aiful Corp. (8515) , the nation’s third-biggest
consumer lender, said in a preliminary earnings statement its
net loss for the year narrowed to 32 billion yen from a loss of
295.1 billion yen a year earlier. The company booked a loss of
10 billion yen including 6.5 billion yen in bad-loan provisions
related to the earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
