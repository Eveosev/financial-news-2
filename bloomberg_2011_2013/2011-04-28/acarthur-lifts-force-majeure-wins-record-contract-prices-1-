Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , the world’s
biggest producer of pulverized coal used to make steel, lifted
force majeure and won record prices from customers because of a
supply shortage caused by floods in  Australia  last year.  The legal clause declared on output from its Queensland
mines on Dec. 3 was lifted today and the company is revising its
production estimate, Brisbane-based Macarthur said in a
statement. Force majeure is invoked by companies to miss
shipments because of circumstances beyond their control.  Heavy rain and flooding across the Australian state in
November through January inundated mines and crimped supply from
companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Rio Tinto Group and  Anglo
American Plc. (AAL)  Prices for coal used in steelmaking and power
generation rose to a record after the disruptions.  “It has been a challenging five months, but as we move
into a historically dry period, we expect to be back to full
production by the end of June,” Macarthur Chief Executive
Officer Nicole Hollows said in the statement.  Steelmakers will pay a record $275 a metric ton for three-
month contracts starting April 1, Macarthur said. Undelivered
tonnage for the flood-hit January to March quarter will extend
into the April to June quarter at the prior contract price, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
