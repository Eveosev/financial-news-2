Latvia’s budget deficit may narrow
faster than expected this year as the economy recovers more
quickly, Finance Minister Andris Vilks.  The shortfall may fall to 4 percent of gross domestic
product this year compared with an earlier estimate of 4.2
percent, Vilks said today at a conference in Riga. The deficit
may drop to about 2 percent in 2012 compared with the current
target of 2.5 percent, Vilks said.  The economy may expand about 4 percent in the first quarter
after growing 3.6 percent in the last three months of 2010, the
finance minister said. Consumer-price growth, which increased an
annual 4.2 percent in March, may average about 2 percent in
coming years, he said.  “Inflation is picking up faster than anyone expected,”
Vilks said. Recent tax increases are partly fueling the faster
inflation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
