Russia ’s 30-stock Micex Index
advanced for the first day this week as oil gained and OAO
Rosneft rallied after its first-quarter income beat analysts’
estimates.  The Micex fluctuated between gains and losses before
closing 0.3 percent higher at 1,749.65 by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow. 
Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, surged 1.6 percent after
net income rose 60 percent on higher Urals crude prices. OAO
Polyus Gold jumped 4 percent. OAO Severstal, the country’s
largest steel producer, tumbled 3.2 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index rose 0.6 percent to 2,028.94.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, climbed as much as 1.1
percent in  New York  and gold prices advanced to a record after
the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged yesterday to keep  interest
rates  near zero to bolster the economy. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch cut its recommendations on Russian steel stocks April 27,
saying prices had peaked.  Rosneft’s net income rose to $3.88 billion in the quarter,
compared with $2.43 billion a year earlier, the Moscow-based
company said today on its website. That beat the $3.8 billion
average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
