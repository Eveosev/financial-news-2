EFG-Hermes Holding SAE climbed the
most in more than a week after  Egypt â€™s biggest publicly traded
investment bank announced plans to buy back 5 million shares
yesterday.  The shares advanced as much as 2 percent, the most since
April 19, to 17.05 Egyptian pounds. They rose to 17 pounds at
10:48 a.m. in Cairo, trimming their loss this year to 50
percent. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 0.4 percent today.  Cairo-based EFG-Hermes said in the last 20 minutes of
trading yesterday that the board of directors approved the
buyback program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
