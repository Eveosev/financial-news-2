Colonial Pipeline Co., which
operates the largest line linking U.S. Gulf Coast refiners and
East Coast markets, said operations were affected overnight
after power losses in Alabama and  Tennessee .  “Line 2 is nearly back to normal and Line 1 is on its
way,” Steve Baker, a spokesman for the pipeline, said by e-
mail. Line 2 delivers distillate fuels such as diesel and Line 1
ships gasoline.  Schedules are being updated to reflect the impact of the
storm, the company said in a bulletin to shippers. No direct
damage has occurred on the system, Colonial said.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 3.91 cents to $3.4585 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:20 a.m.  Tornado watches were posted from Georgia to Maryland today
after a series of lethal storms tore through the U.S. Southeast.  The Colonial system delivers 2.3 million barrels per day of
refined petroleum products, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
