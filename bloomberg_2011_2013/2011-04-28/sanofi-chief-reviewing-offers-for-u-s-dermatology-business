Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN) , the French
drugmaker that bought  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ)  this month, said it’s
reviewing offers for its U.S. dermatology business.  “We are busy reviewing proposals from various groups,”
Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher said on a conference
call with reporters today. “We are probably about midway
through that process.” There has been “very strong interest”
in the business, he said.  The sale of the U.S. dermatology unit may bring in as much
as 300 million euros ($444 million), two people with knowledge
of the matter said April 14. First-round bids were submitted
earlier this month, they said.  Sanofi is selling a business that Viehbacher in 2009
described as too small. The company wants to focus on treatments
for diabetes, cancer and atrial fibrillation, or irregular
heartbeat. Paris-based Sanofi’s dermatology products include
Sculptra Aesthetic, a wrinkle product used to fill in deep smile
lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
