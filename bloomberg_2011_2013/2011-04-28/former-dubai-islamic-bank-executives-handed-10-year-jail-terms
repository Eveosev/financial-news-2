Two former executives of  Dubai
Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  and four businessmen were sentenced to 10
years in prison and fined a total of about $500 million after
being found guilty of trying to defraud the bank of the same
amount of money, according to a court press statement today.  The two former employees of Dubai Islamic Bank, the largest
Islamic lender in the United Arab Emirates, were arrested in
2008. Both are Pakistani nationals, the court said in the e-
mailed statement. The other defendants include two British
nationals and a Turkish national, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
