Doosan Infracore  Co. agreed to sell
its forklift unit to an affiliate and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  for
245 billion won ($230 million) to repay funds it borrowed to buy
 Bobcat  units.  The transaction will be completed by the third quarter,
Doosan Infracore, South Korea’s biggest construction-equipment
maker, said today in a filing. A  Doosan Corp. (000150)  unit will have a
51 percent stake in the venture buying the business, with
Standard Chartered Private Equity Ltd. holding the rest, it said.  Doosan Infracore has already raised 625 billion won from
selling assets, including a 20 percent stake in a Chinese unit,
as it works to repay the $3.9 billion it borrowed from banks for
the Bobcat deal in 2007. The company will also use some of the
sale money in its construction equipment and machine-tool units.  The Incheon-based equipment-maker gained 1.8 percent to
close at 28,550 won in Seoul trading before the announcement.
The stock has advanced 2 percent this year, compared with a 7.7
percent climb in  South Korea ’s benchmark Kospi index.  Doosan Infracore agreed to buy Bobcat units from Ingersoll-
Rand Co. for $4.9 billion in 2007. The deal was the largest
overseas acquisition by a South Korean company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
