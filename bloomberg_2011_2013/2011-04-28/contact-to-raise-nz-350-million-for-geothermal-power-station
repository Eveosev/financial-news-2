Contact Energy Ltd. (CEN) , New Zealand’s
biggest publicly traded energy company, plans a NZ$350 million
($280 million) share sale to existing holders to help fund a
geothermal power station on the central  North Island .  The electricity producer is offering investors one share at
NZ$5.05 for every nine held, a 13.8 percent discount to
yesterday’s closing price, Contact said in a statement today.
The funds will be used for growth opportunities, the first being
the 166 megawatt Te Mihi project, it said.  Sydney-based  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) , which owns 51 percent of
Contact, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, will take up
its full entitlement, the statement shows. Contact is developing
plants powered by steam from underground vents amid concerns
that hydro and wind-powered generation is too reliant on
changeable weather.  “We have committed to the construction of Te Mihi because
we believe geothermal is the most price-competitive source of
new electricity generation for  New Zealand ,” Chief Executive
Officer Dennis Barnes said in the statement.  Contact fell 1 cent, or 0.2 percent, to NZ$5.85 in
Wellington. The shares have dropped 4.3 percent this year,
paring the company’s market value to about NZ$3.7 billion.  Contact jointly appointed Craigs Investment Partners Ltd.
and Deutsche Bank AG as an underwriter and Goldman Sachs &
Partners New Zealand Ltd. as a second underwriter. The company
said in February it was planning a rights offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
