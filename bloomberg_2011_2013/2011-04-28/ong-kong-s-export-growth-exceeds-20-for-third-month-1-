Hong Kong ’s export growth
exceeded 20 percent for a third month even as Japan’s
earthquake clouds the outlook for demand within  Asia .  Overseas shipments rose 22 percent from a year earlier
to HK$281.5 billion ($36 billion), the government said on its
website today. That was more than the 20 percent median
estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Asia’s trade with Japan, Hong Kong’s third-largest
trading partner, will be hurt by the March 11 earthquake,
tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis, Financial Secretary
John Tsang said April 13. At the same time, a sustained
recovery in the U.S. and  Europe  will support exports, the
government said in today’s release.  “Export growth is likely to slow in coming months, as
the adverse impact of  Japan ’s earthquake disaster on global
supply chains has yet to feed through,” Joanne Yim, chief
economist at Hang Seng Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong, said before
today’s data. She expects an average 15 percent increase in
exports this year from 23 percent in 2010.  Imports rose 18.8 percent from a year earlier in March,
leaving a trade deficit of HK$40.1 billion, today’s report
showed.  Trade between Japan and Hong Kong reached $56 billion
last year, 6.8 percent of the city’s total, according to the
government-backed  Hong Kong Trade Development Council .  -- With assistance from Michael Munoz. Editor: Nerys Avery  To contact the reporter on this story:
