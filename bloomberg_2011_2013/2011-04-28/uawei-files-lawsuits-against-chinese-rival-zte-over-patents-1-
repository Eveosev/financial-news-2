Huawei Technologies Co., China’s
largest phone-network equipment maker, said it filed lawsuits in
three European countries against rival  ZTE Corp. (763)  for alleged
patent and trade-mark infringement.  The company filed lawsuits in Germany, France and Hungary
over a series of patents related to data card and high-speed
mobile Internet technology, Huawei said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “Huawei was compelled to initiate this action in order to
protect our innovations and registered intellectual property in
 Europe ,” Chief Legal Officer Song Liuping said. The company
aims to resolve the dispute through negotiation, he said.  ZTE and Huawei, both based in Shenzen, have expanded beyond
China into Asia and Africa. Huawei, the world’s second-largest
maker of equipment for mobile-phone networks behind Ericsson AB,
is looking to boost sales in Europe and the U.S. to further
close the gap with its Swedish rival.  Margrete Ma, a spokeswoman for ZTE, couldn’t immediately be
reached on her mobile phone and didn’t respond to an e-mailed
request for comment.  Huawei said it paid $222 million in 2010 in patent
licensing fees to use the technology of other companies. The
company this month settled a technology-secrets dispute with
Motorola Solutions Inc. over the use of its technology.  --Edmond Lococo in Beijing and  Jonathan Browning  in  London .
