BP Plc (BP/)  may begin restarting its
Texas City, Texas, refinery late today if a transmission line
that helps supply the plant with power is returned to service,
said a person with knowledge of the situation.  The 475,000-barrel-a-day refinery never lost steam during a
power failure late April 25, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public. The refinery
may begin restarting an  ultracracker  and a  fluid catalytic
cracker at  the plant between now and May 5, according to filings
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Three refineries with about 800,000 barrels a day of crude-
processing capacity were knocked offline or had units shut after
power failures in  Texas City  late April 25 and early April 26,
sending gasoline futures to a 33-month high in  New York .  Gasoline for May delivery increased 4.24 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.4618 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest level since July 14, 2008. Stockpiles
declined for the 10th week in a row, dropping 2.51 million
barrels to 205.6 million, the Energy Department said yesterday.  “Another draw in gasoline stocks is possible given this
week’s power outages on the US Gulf Coast that disrupted 750kbd
of refinery crude processing capacity earlier in the week,”
JPMorgan analysts led by Lawrence Eagles in New York wrote in a
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
