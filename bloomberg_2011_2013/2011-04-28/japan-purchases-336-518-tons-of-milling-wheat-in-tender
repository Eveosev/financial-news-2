Japan  bought 336,518 metric tons of
milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia  in a regular
tender today, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said.  Shipment is set from May 16 to June 15 for the Canadian
wheat, and from June 1 to June 30 for the other origins,
Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain-trade division said by
phone. The volume is more than double the 147,712 tons bought by
the ministry on April 14 after the government skipped a tender
last week, he said.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It bought 5.16 million tons through
regular tenders in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
