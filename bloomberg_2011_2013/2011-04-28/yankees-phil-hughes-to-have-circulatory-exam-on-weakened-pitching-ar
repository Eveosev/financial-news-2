New York  Yankees pitcher  Phil
Hughes  will see a medical specialist to determine if a blood-
vessel condition is causing a lack of strength in his throwing
arm.  Manager  Joe Girardi  said Hughes, a 24-year-old right-
hander, will be examined by St. Louis-based Robert William
Thompson, a specialist in Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Hughes had
seven hours of medical tests over two days in New York this
week.  The condition Thompson will check for occurs when pressure
constricts blood vessels traveling under the collarbone and atop
the rib cage, according to the website of the National
Institutes of Health. Symptoms include pain, numbness and
tingling in the fingers, neck and shoulders and weakness in the
hand muscles, according to the website.  Hughes, an 18-game winner for the Yankees a year ago, is 0-
1 with a 13.94 earned run average this season. He has complained
of weakness in his arm and shoulder since spring training and
cut a practice session short this week when he told coaches his
arm felt dead.  Girardi, speaking after last night’s 3-1 victory over the
 Chicago White Sox  in New York, didn’t say how long Hughes might
remain sidelined. The New York Times reported today that
pitchers diagnosed with the syndrome have missed months and some
never regained their pre-injury form.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
