Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s most profitable lender, said first-
quarter earnings rose 29 percent as the country’s economic
growth spurred lending and fee income.  Net income climbed to 53.8 billion yuan ($8.3 billion), or
0.15 yuan a share, from 41.5 billion yuan, or 0.12 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement today.
That exceeded the 51.1 billion yuan median estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Chinese banks led by ICBC are countering a slowdown in
credit growth by charging more for corporate and home loans
after the central bank raised  interest rates  four times since
October and reduced the money available for lending to curb
inflation. The banks are on course for 20 percent growth in
profits in 2011 and 2012, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  ICBC’s net interest income, which reflects the difference
in revenue from lending and the cost of deposits, rose 25
percent to 85.4 billion yuan in the first quarter. Net fee and
commission income from products and services such as credit
cards, wealth management and insurance sales rose 42 percent to
25.9 billion yuan in the year, according to the statement.  --Luo Jun. Editor: Chitra Somayaji  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
