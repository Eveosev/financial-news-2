Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
whose fees to advisers have exceeded $1.2 billion during its
bankruptcy, paid lawyers and managers $31.9 million in March.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
Bryan Marsal runs the defunct investment bank, made
$422.9 million in “interim management” fees for 30 1/2 months
of work, including $10.2 million last month, according to the
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Weil,
Gotshal & Manges LLP, based in New York, was paid $286 million
for acting as Lehman’s lead bankruptcy law firm through March,
including $6.1 million last month.  “Fees at this level suggest that the bankruptcy courts may
not be a practical solution for the largest financial
institutions,” said  Lynn LoPucki , a bankruptcy-law professor at
the University of  California ,  Los Angeles . The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which has said it could liquidate Lehman more
effectively, might be an alternative, he said.  Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, worked 64 hours in
December at $850 an hour, charging $54,400 plus $632 in
expenses, according to a separate filing in bankruptcy court
today. The Lehman CEO aims to raise $61 billion from the defunct
company’s assets to pay $322 billion in claims, giving creditors
18.6 cents on the dollar, on average.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the FDIC’s claim about
costs.  Brokerage Costs  Total administrative costs exceed $2.4 billion for the
Lehman bankruptcy, including separate liquidations of  Lehman
Brothers Inc ., the remnants of the brokerage, and Lehman
Brothers International Europe, the investment bank’s U.K. unit.  London-based LBIE paid its advisers $774 million in fees
through March 14. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the unit’s
administrators, paid themselves 325 million pounds ($540
million). The bank’s law firms, including London-based
Linklaters LLP, got $242 million as of March 14, the accounting
firm said in an April 14 report.  The bankrupt brokerage’s total administrative fees for the
first 24 months were $420 million, according to the SEC’s Office
of the Inspector General. Brokerage trustee James Giddens and
his law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP received about $121
million in fees through September, according to a March 31
 bankruptcy court  filing in Manhattan.  Most Expensive  The Lehman parent’s bankruptcy in Manhattan became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.’s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by LoPucki.  In the SEC filing, the Lehman parent and its affiliates
reported cash and investments of $23.2 billion as of March 31,
compared with $22.6 billion on Feb. 28.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman is
fighting for control of a $61 billion liquidation plan with a
group of bondholders including hedge fund Paulson & Co. and a
rival group of derivatives creditors that includes  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and Morgan Stanley.  Lehman creditors range from banks and  hedge funds  to the
 New York  Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Lehman filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
