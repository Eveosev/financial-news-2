Shire Plc (SHP)  reported a 24 percent
increase in first-quarter profit as doctors prescribed more of
the Vyvanse attention-deficit drug.  Earnings excluding some costs rose to $235.4 million from
$189.3 million a year earlier, Shire said today in a statement.
That missed the $244.8 million average estimate of 8 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg in the past 28 days. Shire, based in
Dublin with management offices in Basingstoke,  England , said
sales climbed 19 percent to $972.2 million.  Shire is getting more revenue from the Vyvanse and Intuniv
medicines, which are aimed at replacing sales of the Adderall XR
pill for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Generic
versions of Adderall reached the market in 2009. Sales of the
Replagal treatment for Fabry disease gained after delays in the
production of  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ) ’s competing Fabrazyme therapy.  Shire reiterated its forecast for 2011, saying product
sales are expected to grow “in line” with the pace set last
year, or about 16 percent. The drugmaker also said it expects an
increase in combined research and development expenses and
sales, general and administrative costs to “be at the upper
end” of a 10 percent to 13 percent range.  Shire shares fell 51 pence, or 2.7 percent, to 1,850 pence
in London trading. The stock has gained 20 percent this year,
including reinvested dividends.  Vyvanse Sales  Sales of Vyvanse increased 31 percent to $202.3 million
during the quarter. Shire has been relying on its human-genetics
unit to reduce dependence on attention deficit and hyperactivity
disorder products, which accounted for about 36 percent of sales
last year.  A virus contamination in 2009 at a Genzyme factory in
 Boston  cut the supply of Fabrazyme and Cerezyme for Gaucher
disease. The disruption boosted demand for Shire’s Replagal drug
for Fabry disease and Vpriv medicine for Gaucher disease. Fabry
and Gaucher diseases are rare genetic illnesses. Genzyme has
said it expects to return to normal output of Fabrazyme during
the second half.  Revenue from Replagal rose 55 percent to $105.4 million.
Sales of Vpriv climbed to $59 million from $5.8 million a year
earlier. The medicine won U.S. regulatory approval last year.
Shire said in November that Vpriv met the primary goal of a
late-stage study comparing it to Cerezyme in patients with type
1 Gaucher disease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
