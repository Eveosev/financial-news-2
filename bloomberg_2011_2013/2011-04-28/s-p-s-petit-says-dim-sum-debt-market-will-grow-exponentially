Michael Petit, managing director at
 Standard & Poor’s  in Singapore, comments on the development of
the offshore yuan-denominated debt market at a press conference
in Hong Kong today.  Sales of so-called dim sum bonds totaled 33.2 billion yuan
($5.1 billion) this year, compared with 25 billion yuan in the
last three months of 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  S&P launched a new credit-rating scale for issuers based in
greater  China , which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and
 Taiwan , today.  “We’ve been surprised, like everybody, by how fast this
offshore renminbi market has been taking off and we expect it to
increase exponentially for the next couple of years.  “What’s happening in the offshore renminbi market is that
the main driver for investment in the primary market appears to
be currency appreciation. Credit risk is not explored to a great
degree and that’s why you don’t have much secondary trading and
not much liquidity in that offshore market.  “We hope that just by producing a product that is tailored
to access the credit quality of these offshore renminbi
instruments, we will be able to facilitate investors to do their
credit risk homework.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
