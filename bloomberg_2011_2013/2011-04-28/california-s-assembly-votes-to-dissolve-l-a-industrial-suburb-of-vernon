The California Assembly approved a
bill that could dissolve an industrial suburb of  Los Angeles 
that has been beset by allegations of corruption for decades.  Assembly members approved a  bill  by Speaker John A. Perez,
a Los Angeles Democrat, that would establish a process to
disincorporate cities with fewer than 150 residents. Perez’s
office said the bill was aimed at  Vernon , a city with 96
residents, the smallest population in the state, and an
estimated 1,800 businesses that employ 55,000 people.  Vernon, established more than 100 years ago, is one of at
least three California cities set up specifically as
manufacturing hubs. If the bill is approved by the Senate and
signed by Governor  Jerry Brown , it would become an
unincorporated part of Los Angeles County.  Perez said the city has been ruled by a “clique” that has
mostly enriched itself.  “When a city’s population becomes so small, the burden of
monitoring government activities falls on the few, and no real
protections or accountability exist,” Perez said in a
statement. “That’s certainly the case in Vernon, where 60 years
of corruption have eaten away at the city’s foundation, creating
a real threat to the stability of the jobs and businesses that
have located there.”  Vernon leaders say  disincorporation  would cause businesses
to flee the 5.2-square-mile city southeast of Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
