The ruble climbed to a 28-month
high against the dollar as the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep
 interest rates  low to support U.S. growth, sending oil prices
above $113 a barrel.  The Russian currency added 0.7 percent to 27.5310 per
dollar by the 5 p.m. close of trading in Moscow, the strongest
since Dec. 18, 2008. Against the euro the ruble weakened for the
first day this week, dropping 0.3 percent to 40.75 per euro.  Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, gained as much as 1.1
percent to $113.97 a barrel in  New York , the highest since Sept.
22, 2008, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
yesterday renewed his pledge to stimulate growth in the  U.S.
economy  with low interest rates.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble at
33.4795, the strongest since March 10, against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket, which it uses to manage swings
in the currency that hurt the competitiveness of Russian
exporters.  The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together.  -- Editor: Alexander Nicholson  To contact the reporters on this story:
