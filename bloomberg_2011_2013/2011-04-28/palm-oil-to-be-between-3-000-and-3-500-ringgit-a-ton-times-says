Palm oil  may stabilize to between
3,000 and 3,500 ringgit a metric ton by the end of this year due
to steady global demand and strong crude  oil prices , which lifts
the appeal of vegetable oils as biofuels, Business Times
reported, citing Malaysian Palm Oil Association vice chairman
Boon Weng Siew.  Malaysia â€™s export earnings for 2011 may exceed the record
of 65 billion ringgit in 2008 if prices remain at this level,
according to the report.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
