Hulu Plus, the online subscription
television service, will become available on  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
Web-enabled Xbox 360 video-game consoles, adding a new outlet
for the company.  The Xbox service will start tomorrow, according to an e-
mailed statement from Los Angeles-based Hulu LLC, owned by
investors including  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC and
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal.  Hulu is expanding the number of consumer electronics
companies that offer its $7.99 a month service to reach a larger
audience. The subscription service offers full seasons of shows
such as ABC’s “Modern Family” and NBC’s “30 Rock” with fewer
ads than commercial television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
