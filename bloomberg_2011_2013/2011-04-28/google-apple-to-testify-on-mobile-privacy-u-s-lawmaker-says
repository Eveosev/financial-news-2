Google Inc. (GOOG)  has agreed to testify
at a May 10 Senate hearing about consumer privacy on mobile
devices, a U.S. lawmaker said today.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said yesterday it also would testify at the same
hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s privacy
subcommittee, headed by Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota
Democrat.  “I am pleased that both Google and Apple have accepted the
committee’s invitation to testify about consumer privacy issues
related to smartphones, tablets and other mobile technologies,”
Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said in a statement.
Leahy, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called
it “essential” to have “complete and accurate information
about the privacy implications of these new technologies.”  Apple and Google have been at the center of a debate about
whether mobile-phone location technologies breach privacy rules.
The companies’ practice of collecting data on customers can be
used to deliver targeted advertising and help users find nearby
services. Lawsuits have been filed against the companies over
the practice and members of Congress have filed legislation to
curtail it.  Apple said Monday it isn’t tracking customers’ locations
while acknowledging it gathers information about wireless gear
near a user’s handset. The iPhone saves information on Wi-Fi hot
spots and cellular towers near the device’s location and
accesses the data when users need it, Apple said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
