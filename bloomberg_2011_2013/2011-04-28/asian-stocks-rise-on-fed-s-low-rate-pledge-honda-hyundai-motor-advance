Asian stocks rose, driving the
regional benchmark index to the highest in almost two months,
after the Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to stimulate U.S.
economic growth with low interest rates and as companies from
 Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  to  Advantest Corp. (6857)  posted higher earnings.  Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker that gets about 45
percent of sales from  North America , gained 2.9 percent in Tokyo.
Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of memory-chip
testers, increased 5.6 percent. Hyundai Motor, South Korea’s
largest automaker, surged to a record.  Computershare Ltd. (CPU) , the
world’s No. 1 share registrar, jumped 7.7 percent in Sydney
after agreeing to buy the shareholder services business of Bank
of  New York  Mellon Corp.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index increased 1.1 percent to 139.32
at 8:34 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest since March 4. About the same
number of stocks rose and fell in the gauge. The measure climbed
2.2 percent last week after U.S. companies including Apple Inc.
reported increased profits, signaling the global economic
recovery is accelerating.  “We have a combination of low interest rates and strong
earnings,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist for AMP
Capital, which has almost $100 billion under management. “It’s
a pretty good cocktail for a good equity market.”  Nikkei, NZX 50  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.6 percent to the
highest level since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
Investors shrugged off a government report today that showed
Japan’s industrial production plunged last month after the
temblor led to shuttered factories.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.3 percent after the
nation’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at a
record low as the country recovers from its most devastating
earthquake in 80 years. South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.1
percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.3 percent,
erasing earlier gains of as much as 1 percent, on speculation
the government will raise interest rates as early as next week
to tame inflation.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index  slipped 0.4
percent, reversing gains of as much as 1 percent, as Chinese
developers dropped.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent.
In New York yesterday, the index rose 0.6 percent to 1,355.66.
 Federal Reserve  Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled the Fed will
maintain its record monetary stimulus after ending large-scale
bond purchases in June, while the need to contain inflation
means further easing is unlikely.  ‘Cheap’ U.S. Stocks  “The U.S. will continue its easing monetary policy, as was
expected,” said Toshio Sumitani, a strategist at Tokai Tokyo
Research Center. “Stocks in the U.S. are rising with support
from the easing policy, as they are cheap. Gains in U.S. stocks
are positive for other stock markets.”  The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008.  Bernanke reinforced the view of the Federal Open Market
Committee, which released its policy statement yesterday, that
borrowing costs are likely to stay low for “an extended
period.” The panel agreed to finish $600 billion of Treasury
purchases in June and said surging commodity prices will
probably have a transitory effect on inflation.  Honda, Hyundai  A gauge of consumer discretionary companies, which includes
electronics and car manufacturers, had the biggest advance among
the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Honda, Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, climbed 2.9 percent

world’s third-largest maker of mobile phones, added 1.9 percent
to 107,000 won in Seoul.  Hyundai Motor jumped 7.3 percent to 250,500 won, the
biggest jump since September 2009. The company said first-
quarter net income increased to 1.88 trillion won ($1.75
billion), compared with a revised 1.28 trillion won a year
earlier, as sales in China,  Europe  and the U.S. climbed.  The Commerce Department said yesterday that orders for U.S.
durable goods rose in March for a third consecutive month,
showing businesses intend to keep spending to update equipment.  Advantest added 5.6 percent to 1,597 yen in Tokyo after
saying it returned to profit in the year through March, posting
net income of 3.16 billion yen ($39 million). Sales jumped 87
percent.  Komatsu, China Coal  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-largest maker of
construction equipment, climbed 2.8 percent to 2,840 yen. The
company said fourth-quarter net income increased more than
threefold to 50.1 billion yen from 15.2 billion yen a year
earlier as Asia’s booming economies boosted demand.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest maker of industrial robots,
rose 1.4 percent to 13,450 yen. The company said full-year net
income more than tripled to 120 billion yen from 37.5 billion
yen a year earlier, with a 76 percent jump in sales.  China Coal Energy Co., the nation’s second-largest producer

Shareowner Services business to the Australian company for $550

state-controlled developer, dropped 3 percent to HK$13.66, while
China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, fell 2.2 percent to HK$15.14.
Henderson Land Development Co., a Hong Kong-based developer that
gets 16 percent of sales from China, lost 0.8 percent to
HK$53.15.  China may raise interest rates early next month, with the
“most likely” timing being May 2, following the May 1 holiday,
Credit Suisse Group AG said. The brokerage also expects one more
reserve ratio increase for banks “towards” late May after the
government releases April inflation and lending figures, analyst
Dong Tao, wrote in a report dated today.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased just 0.1 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with gains of 7.8 percent by
the S&P 500 and 2.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
