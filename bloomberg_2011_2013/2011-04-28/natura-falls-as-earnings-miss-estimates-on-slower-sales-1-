Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3)  fell the most
in nearly four months after  Latin America ’s largest cosmetics
company announced earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Natura declined 3.4 percent to 43.25 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, after falling as
much as 4.1 percent earlier, the largest intraday decline since
Jan. 6.  Net income climbed 6.3 percent to 150.5 million reais ($95
million), Natura said in a regulatory filing yesterday. That was
below the mean estimate of 161.8 million reais of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The share price decline is justified,” Renato Prado, an
analyst at Fator Corretora, said in a phone interview from his
office in  Sao Paulo . “The deceleration in the growth of net
revenue and Ebitda was too strong.”  Fator Corretora is reviewing its “neutral” rating on
Natura and probably will cut its December price target of 51.92
reais, Prado said.  Sales rose 13 percent to 1.15 billion reais, the slowest
pace since the second quarter in 2008, while earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization gained 8.4
percent to 264.1 million reais.  “For the market expectations, for the valuation levels the
stock has now, we expect more,” Prado said. Natura trades at
24.7 times earnings estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
