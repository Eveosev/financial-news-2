McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
biggest restaurant chain, said it hired 24 percent more people
than planned during an employment event this month.  McDonald’s and its franchisees hired 62,000 people in the
U.S. after receiving more than one million applications, the  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Previously, it said it planned to hire 50,000.  The April 19 national hiring day was the company’s first,
said Danya Proud, a McDonald’s spokeswoman. She declined to
disclose how many of the jobs were full- versus part-time.
McDonald’s employed 400,000 workers worldwide at company-owned
stores at the end of 2010, according to a company filing.  The number of applications for  unemployment benefits  in the
U.S. rose last week, a sign that progress in the labor market
may be fading. Jobless claims increased by 25,000 to 429,000 in
the week ended April 23, the most in three months, according to
data from the Labor Department in  Washington  today.  Earlier this month, McDonald’s said sales at stores open at
least 13 months climbed 2.9 percent in the U.S. after it
attracted more diners with items such as beverages and the
Chipotle BBQ Bacon Angus burger. The fast-food chain has about
14,000 stores in the U.S. and more than 18,000 abroad. About 80
percent of all McDonald’s stores are franchised.  McDonald’s rose 16 cents to $78.03 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 11 percent
over the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
