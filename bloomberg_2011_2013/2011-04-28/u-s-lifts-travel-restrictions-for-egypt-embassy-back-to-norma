The State Department announced
today that the U.S. embassy in  Egypt  will return to normal
functions and that non-essential staff and diplomats’ families
can return to the country.  Riots and protests that broke out in January led to the
ouster in February of Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  after
three decades in power. The volatile security situation caused
the State Department to winnow its staff at the heavily
fortified embassy in Cairo.  The travel alert, released in Washington, warned that the
situation is still not back to normal. “Given that Egyptian
security services have not yet fully redeployed, the department
alerts U.S. citizens planning to travel to Egypt to the
possibility of sporadic unrest,” the statement said.  It advised Americans to avoid all public demonstrations
“as even peaceful ones can quickly become violent and a
foreigner could become a target of harassment or worse.”  The security situation in tourist destinations such as
Luxor, Aswan and the Red Sea resorts, including Sharm el Sheikh,
continues to be calm, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
