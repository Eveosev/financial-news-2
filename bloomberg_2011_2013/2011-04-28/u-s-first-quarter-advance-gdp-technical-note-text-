Following is the technical note of
the Gross Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  This technical note provides background information about the source data and
estimating methods used to produce the estimates presented in the GDP news
release.  The complete set of estimates for the first quarter is available on
BEA's Web site at www.bea.gov; a brief summary of "highlights" is also posted
on the Web site.  In a few weeks, the estimates will be published in BEA's
monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business, along with a more detailed
analysis of the estimates ("GDP and the Economy").  Real GDP  Real GDP increased 1.8 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter of 2011,
following an increase of 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The
deceleration in real GDP in the first quarter reflected a sharp upturn in
imports, a deceleration in  consumer spending , a larger decrease in federal
 government spending , and decelerations in nonresidential fixed investment and
in exports that were partly offset by a sharp upturn in inventory investment.  Source data for the advance estimate  The advance GDP estimate for the first quarter of 2011 is based on source data
that are incomplete and subject to revision.  Three months of source data were
available for consumer spending on goods; shipments of capital equipment other
than aircraft; motor vehicle sales and inventories; manufacturing durables
inventories; federal government outlays; and consumer, producer, and
international prices.  Only two months of data were available for most other
key data sources; BEA's assumptions for the third month are shown in table A.
Among those assumptions are the following:  *    an increase in nondurable manufacturing inventories,
*    an increase in non-motor-vehicle merchant wholesale and retail
inventories,
*    an increase in exports of goods, excluding gold, and
*    an increase in imports of goods, excluding gold.  Prices  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3.8 percent in the
first quarter, following an increase of 2.1 percent in the fourth.  Excluding
food and energy, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.2
percent in the first quarter, following an increase of 1.1 percent in the
fourth.  Disposable Personal Income  Real disposable personal income (DPI) increased 2.9 percent in the first
quarter, following an increase of 1.9 percent in the fourth.  Current-dollar
DPI increased 6.9 percent, following an increase of 3.6 percent.  First-quarter DPI was affected by two large special factors.  Contributions
for government social insurance (a subtraction in the calculation of personal
income) were reduced by $105.4 billion, reflecting a 2-percentage point
reduction in the social security contribution rate for 2011 based on
provisions of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job
Creation Act of 2010.  This effect was partly offset by the expiration of the
Make Work Pay provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
which boosted first-quarter personal current taxes by $38.6 billion.  Annual Revision Scheduled for July 29  The GDP news release on July 29, in addition to presenting the advance
estimate of GDP for the second quarter of 2011, will present the annual
revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs). In addition to
the regular revision of estimates for the most recent 3 years and the first
quarter of 2011, GDP and some components will be revised back to the first
quarter of 2003. BEA's plans to undertake ``flexible annual revisions that
include revisions for longer periods than the traditional 3-year period were
described in the June 2008 Survey of Current Business,
www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2008/06%20June/0608_flexible.pdf.  In cases for which the estimates for the reference year (2005) will be
revised, the levels of the related index numbers and chained-dollar estimates
will be revised for the entire historical period, though the percent changes
will not be revised for periods before the first quarter of 2003.  The components that will be revised for longer time spans include the
following:  *       Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) will be revised back to 2003
to incorporate source data from  the 2007 Economic Census (specifically, final
data on merchandise lines) and data from the Census annual and monthly retail
trade and food services surveys and from the Census service annual survey
that have been benchmarked to the economic census. In addition, improved price
indexes will be used for deflation of PCE for property and casualty insurance.  *       The estimates of petroleum imports will be revised back to 2007 to
incorporate improvements in the seasonal adjustment methodology for real
petroleum imports, which will be derived by directly adjusting the petroleum
imports quantity data; currently, BEA seasonally adjusts the petroleum price
index and calculates seasonally adjusted real petroleum imports by deflation.  *       The estimates of private fixed investment, exports, and imports of
communication equipment will be revised back to 2003 to incorporate quality-
adjusted price indexes from the Federal Reserve Board. (During the 2010
NIPA annual revision, the Federal Reserve price indexes were incorporated only
back to 2007.)  In addition, the 2011 annual revision will incorporate the usual annual source
data for 2008 through 2010 that are more complete and more detailed than those
previously available, including:  Census Bureau annual surveys of manufactures, of merchant wholesale
trade, of retail trade, of services, and of state and local governments; BEA
international transactions accounts data; Federal government budget data;
Internal Revenue Service tabulations of tax returns for corporations and for
sole proprietorships and partnerships; and Department of Agriculture farm
income statistics.  The annual revision will also incorporate improvements to the presentation of
the estimates and refinements to estimating methodologies, including the
following:  *       In the personal income and outlays tables, the presentation of
government social benefits will be modified to focus on the largest and most
significant programs.  *       Starting with the first quarter of 2011, the quarterly and monthly
estimates of PCE for portfolio management and investment advice services will
be based on newly available Census quarterly services survey data on ``other
financial investment activities.  For many of the key series used to prepare the advance estimate of GDP,
including retail sales, unit automobile and truck sales and inventories,
manufacturers' shipments of nondefense capital goods (other than aircraft),
manufacturers' inventories of durable goods, federal defense spending, and
consumer, producer, and international price indexes, actual data are available
for all months of the quarter.  For the key series shown in this table, actual data for the third month of the
quarter usually are not available in time for inclusion in the advance GDP
estimate.  BEA makes assumptions for the source data that are not yet
available; assumptions for March 2011 are shown in the last column of the
table.  For most series shown, the data for February are preliminary and
subject to further revision. Occasionally, the data for earlier months are
also subject to revision.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted
at annual rates, and are published by the Bureau of the Census.  2010                          2011  Oct.      Nov.      Dec.      Jan.      Feb.      Mar.*  Private fixed investment:  Nonresidential structures:
