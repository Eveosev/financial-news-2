China ’s grain demand is in “tight
balance” with supply, and the market is more volatile because
of increased speculation and influences from the energy and
financial markets, an official at the state food reserves said.  Weather and “inelastic demand” for food will continue to
challenge the country’s grain supply, Yao Ruikun, vice president
of China Grain Reserves Corp., said in a statement summarizing a
company meeting posted on its subsidiary website Cngrain.com.
Globally, food consumption is growing faster than production,
while inventory-to-stock ratio is declining, Yao said.  China Grain manages state grain reserves.  --William Bi. Editors: Richard Dobson,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
