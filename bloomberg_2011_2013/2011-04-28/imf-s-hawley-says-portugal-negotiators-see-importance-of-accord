Negotiations for financial
assistance and related economic policies for  Portugal  will
continue as long as needed, an International Monetary Fund
spokesman said today.  “All parties involved understand the importance of
reaching agreement,” David Hawley, a senior adviser in the
fund’s external relations department, told reporters in
 Washington  today.  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates said this week that
the government is working “intensely” with IMF and European
Union officials on an aid package for the country. Portugal
would follow Greece and Ireland, which sought and received
international rescue plans last year.  Hawley also said that a team reviewing Greece’s progress
under conditions attached to a 110 billion-euro ($163 billion)
by the IMF and Europe will start work “early May.” Each IMF
review includes a debt sustainability assessment, he said.  Hawley said the IMF welcomes the  Federal Reserve ’s
reaffirmation that it will finish the $600 billion of Treasury
purchases in June as scheduled.  The decision “is appropriate in the view of the ongoing
recovery,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
