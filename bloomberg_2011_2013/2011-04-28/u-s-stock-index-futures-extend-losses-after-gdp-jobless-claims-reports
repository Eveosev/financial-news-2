U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses after government reports showed the economy grew less
than forecast in the first quarter and jobless claims
unexpectedly increased.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
slumped 0.3 percent to 1,347.40 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York ,
signaling the benchmark gauge of U.S. equities may retreat from
an almost three-year high. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
lost 30 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,611.  Gross domestic product rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate
from January through March after a 3.1 percent pace in the last
three months of 2010, the Commerce Department said. Economists
projected 2 percent growth, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey. Separate data from the Labor Department
showed first-time claims for  unemployment benefits  rose to
429,000 last week, above the median forecast for a decrease to
395,000.  Stocks rallied yesterday, sending the S&P 500 and Dow to
almost three-year highs, as the  Federal Reserve  renewed its
pledge to stimulate growth with low rates and said a pickup in
inflation is likely temporary. The Fed left its benchmark
interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent and retained a
pledge in place since March 2009 to keep it “exceptionally
low” for an “extended period.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 29 percent since Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  suggested on Aug. 27 that he would pursue a second
round of asset purchases to stimulate the economy, a tactic
known as quantitative easing.   Bernanke yesterday said the end of the Fed’s $600 billion
bond-buying program in June probably won’t have a
“significant” effect on financial markets or the economy, and
the central bank will likely continue reinvesting maturing debt
after June.  Benchmark indexes have set multi-year highs this week as
companies report rising profit. Earnings-per-share have beaten
estimates at 76 percent of the 245 companies in the  S&P 500  that
have reported quarterly results since April 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
