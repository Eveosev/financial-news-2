AO Halyk Savings Bank, controlled
by President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s daughter and son-in-law,
posted the biggest first-quarter profit among Kazakh banks.  Halyk’s net income rose to 7.4 billion tenge ($51 million)
from 5.9 billion tenge a year earlier, the Almaty-based central
bank’s financial oversight committee said in a monthly report on
its website. The figures are based on unconsolidated data
calculated in accordance with Kazakh accounting standards.  Halyk Bank said last month that 2011 profit may rise as
much as 24 percent to 45 billion tenge as lending increases and
the loan quality improves. The nation’s second-biggest bank by
assets on March 30 bought back most of a 19.8 percent stake the
government acquired in 2009.  The following table shows the three-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s six largest lenders, along with 14th-ranked
Temirbank, and their position as of April 1. The data from the
oversight committee are in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
