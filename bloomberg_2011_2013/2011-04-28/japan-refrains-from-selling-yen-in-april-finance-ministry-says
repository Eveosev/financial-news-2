Japan  refrained from selling the
yen this month after Group of Seven nations jointly intervened
in the markets in March to stem the currency’s gain.  The Ministry of Finance said today in Tokyo it didn’t sell
any yen between March 30 and April 26. It sold 692.5 billion yen
($8.5 billion) last month in its first currency intervention
since September.  The currency climbed to a postwar record of 76.25 per
dollar on March 17, prompting G-7 nations to sell yen in
foreign-exchange markets the next day. The yen had advanced on
speculation Japanese companies would repatriate assets to pay
for rebuilding in the wake of a magnitude-9 earthquake.  The yen traded at 81.73 per dollar at 11:01 a.m. in  London 
from 82.16 in  New York  yesterday. The currency was at 121.31 per
euro from 121.47.  G-7 finance chiefs said in a joint statement on March 18
they will “provide any needed cooperation” with Japan. The G-7
members hadn’t jointly intervened since September 2000 when they
sought to support the euro as it tumbled in its second year of
existence.  Japan unilaterally sold 2.12 trillion yen in foreign-
exchange markets from Aug. 28 through Sept. 28 as gains in the
currency threatened an export-led economic recovery. That was
its first intervention since 2004 and came as the yen neared its
previous postwar high of 79.75 per dollar set in April 1995.  The yen tends to strengthen during economic and financial
turmoil because Japan’s trade surplus makes it less reliant on
foreign capital. A stronger local currency makes the products of
Japanese exporters less competitive in overseas markets and cuts
the value of their earnings when repatriated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
