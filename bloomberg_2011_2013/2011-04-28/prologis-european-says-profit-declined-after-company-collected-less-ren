ProLogis European Properties (PEPR) , the
warehouse owner that received a bid from its biggest shareholder
last week, said first-quarter profit fell 27 percent after the
company collected less rent.  Net income fell to 12.3 million euros ($18 million) from 17
million euros a year earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said
in a statement today. Rental income fell 2.1 percent to 60.4
million euros. PEPR maintained its earnings guidance for 2011.  PEPR is reviewing an offer by ProLogis, the world’s largest
warehouse operator, that values the European company at 1.2
billion euros. The bid trumped an approach by APG Algemene
Pensioen Groep NV and  Goodman Group .  “Given the circumstances, these earnings are the least
important topic,” Ruud van Maanen, an Amsterdam-based analyst
at ABN Amro Group NV said before the results were announced.
“Looking at the fund’s situation, I would accept ProLogis’
offer and get out.” Van Maanen has a “reduce” recommendation
on the fund.  Under takeover rules in  Luxembourg , where PEPR is based,
ProLogis had to make a bid for all of the units after its stake
exceeded the 33.33 percent threshold. Both of the bids are less
than PEPR’s net asset value of 6.32 euros per ordinary unit as
of Dec. 31, based on EPRA guidelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
