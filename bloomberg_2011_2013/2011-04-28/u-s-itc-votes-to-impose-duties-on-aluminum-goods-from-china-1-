U.S. makers of most aluminum
products are being harmed by imports from  China , the U.S.
International Trade Commission ruled in a decision that will
lead to tariffs on those items.  The final ruling today sets antidumping duties of about 33
percent and countervailing duties for subsidies that will be as
much as 374 percent on importers from China. The products, used
for construction and incorporated into window and door frames,
accounted for $503 million of imports from China last year.  The commission excluded heat sinks, used in computers and
electronics, from the tariffs, according to a statement on the
independent agency’s  website .  A World Trade Organization panel ruled against the U.S.
practice of imposing both dumping and subsidy duties on Chinese
products last month.  “Against this backdrop, the U.S. side is imposing new
similar sanctions against Chinese products,”  Wang Baodong , a
spokesman for the Chinese embassy in  Washington , said when asked
about the duties on March 30.  The case was filed by a group of closely held companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
