The  Federal Reserve  is seeking to
improve neighborhoods blighted by abandoned properties and
foreclosures following the worst recession since the 1930s, Fed
Governor Elizabeth Duke said.  “Neighborhood stabilization efforts are critical, now more
than ever, as not all communities will be stabilized without
intervention,” Duke said today to the Fed-sponsored Community
Affairs Research Conference in Arlington, Virginia.
“Foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties threaten
neighborhoods nationwide.”  The Federal Open Market Committee yesterday said the
housing sector “continues to be depressed” and agreed to
finish $600 billion in Treasury purchases in June to stimulate
growth. The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008.  City and neighborhood leaders “have a hard time
determining such basic facts as the number of foreclosures,
investor purchases of distressed properties,” or even changes
in home values,  John Williams , president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, said in welcoming remarks.  Williams and Duke didn’t comment on the U.S. economic
outlook or monetary policy in their remarks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
