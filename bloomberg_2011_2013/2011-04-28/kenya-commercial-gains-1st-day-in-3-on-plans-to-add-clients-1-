Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
nation’s biggest lender by outlets, gained for the first trading
day in three after announcing plans to boost its number of small
business customers by 30 percent to 100,000 this year.  The stock added 50 cents, or 2 percent, to 25.75 shillings
at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  “The small- and medium-sized market is pretty much
untapped right now,” Vimal Parmar, head of research of Kestrel
Capital East Africa, said by phone from  Kenya ’s capital Nairobi
today. “Since pretty much 50 percent of Kenya’s businesses are
informal, this is a good opportunity for KCB.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
