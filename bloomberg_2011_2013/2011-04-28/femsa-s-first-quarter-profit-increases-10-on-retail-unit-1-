Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, the
owner of  Latin America ’s largest convenience-store chain, said
first-quarter profit climbed 10 percent, driven by sales gains
at its Oxxo unit.  Net income climbed to 2.19 billion pesos ($190 million)
from 1.99 billion pesos a year earlier, the Monterrey, Mexico-
based company said today in a filing to the Mexican stock
exchange. Sales, excluding the beer unit sold last year to
Heineken, rose 13 percent to 42.9 billion pesos, said Femsa, as
the company is known.  Profit was lower than a forecast of 3.1 billion pesos by
Lauren Torres, an analyst in  New York  with HSBC Bank Plc who
rates the shares “overweight.”  She estimated sales of
43.1 billion pesos.  Oxxo has benefited from a consumer-spending rebound in
 Mexico , where the  Finance Ministry  estimates the economy will
rise 4.2 percent. Same-store sales at the convenience store
chain climbed 20 percent in the quarter and the company added
195 new stores, Femsa said.  Femsa sold its beer unit in April 2010 for a 20 percent
stake in Heineken.  Oxxo had sales of 16.1 billion pesos, a 20 percent increase
from a year earlier. The retail unit reported operating income
of 777 million pesos, a 21 percent gain. The chain had 8,621
stores at the end of March.  Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the company’s soft-drink unit that
trades separately, reported yesterday that first-quarter profit
was 2.24 billion pesos, a 6 percent increase from a year
earlier. Sales rose 9.5 percent to 25.8 billion pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
