Mobistar SA (MOBB) ,  Belgium ’s second-
largest mobile-phone company, said first-quarter profit and
sales missed analysts’ estimates because of costs linked to its
television offering and regulatory service-charge limits.  First-quarter net income dropped to 53.1 million euros
($78.9 million) from 68.5 million euros a year earlier, the
Brussels-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell 9.3
percent to 125.2 million euros, short of the average estimate of
131.9 million euros in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 analysts.  Mobistar introduced satellite TV services in October in a
response to bundled offerings from Belgacom SA and  Telenet Group
Holding NV (TNET) , seeking to expand its fixed-line business as its
mobile earnings were under pressure from regulatory price cuts.
Mobistar gained an additional 7,322 customers for its Starpack
product in the first quarter and said in February it planned to
add about 50,000 this year.  “First-half results will likely be weak given the double
cut in MTR rates and the investments in Starpack,” Emmanuel Carlier, an analyst at ING Groep NV in Brussels who estimated
Ebitda of 127 million euros, wrote in a note this week. “As the
CEO quoted during a recent roadshow that he sees the guidance
rather as a commitment, we expect it to be reiterated.”  Mobistar declined after the earnings report, trading at
49.46 euros at 9:13 a.m. in Brussels, down 2.2 percent.  Handset Sales  The Belgian unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  maintained its
forecast for full-year net income of 220 million euros, plus or
minus 10 million euros. That compares with the 231.6 million-
euro average estimate in Bloomberg’s survey.  First-quarter service revenue, excluding the business
Mobistar acquired from Royal KPN NV in April 2010, fell 4.2
percent, accelerating from a 3.1 percent drop in the preceding
three-month period. Total revenue including handset sales rose
1.9 percent to 400.9 million euros, missing the 405 million-euro
average estimate in the survey.  Mobistar is losing 52 percent of its interconnection
revenue in the first half following an additional Jan. 1 cut in
the rate it charges other operators to handle calls on its
network. The cut in the so-called mobile termination rate will
reduce Ebitda by 30 million euros this year. Roaming regulation
will lower 2011 earnings by an additional 8 million euros.  “Without the impact of regulation, Ebitda would have been
139.4 million euros,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
