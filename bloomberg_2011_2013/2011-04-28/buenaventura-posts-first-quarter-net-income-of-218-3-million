Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, said first-quarter
profit increased 40 percent, its biggest gain in four quarters,
as higher metals prices offset falling gold output.  Net income rose to $218.3 million, or 86 cents a share,
from $156.4 million, or 61 cents, in the year-earlier period,
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts
expected profit of 94 cents a share on an adjusted basis, the
average of three estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Buenaventura sold gold for an average $1,387 an ounce in
the quarter, 25 percent more than a year earlier. Higher prices
offset lower output of gold, zinc and lead, said Imaru Casanova,
chief analyst at McNicoll Lewis & Vlak.  “Buenaventura is consistently putting out strong earnings
due to gold and silver prices,” Casanova, who rates the stock a
“sell” and doesn’t own shares, said by telephone before the
report was released. “Its exposure to copper through its stake
in the Cerro Verde mine is also a good thing these days.”  The company has a 19 percent stake in Phoenix-based
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Cerro Verde mine, which
contributed $63.9 million toward earnings, a 39 percent increase
from a year earlier. Income from Buenaventura’s 44 percent stake
in  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s Yanacocha gold mine slid 6 percent to
$48.1 million.  Revenue climbed 86 percent to $375.7 million, while
operating costs increased 51 percent to $17 million. Exploration
spending rose 35 percent to $10.6 million.  Silver Mine Strike  Gold production fell 14 percent to 242,076 ounces, while
zinc and lead dropped 65 percent and 28 percent, respectively,
Buenaventura said. Silver output rose 18 percent to 3.53 million
ounces. New York-traded silver futures gained 86 percent in the
period.  A 21-day strike at the company’s Uchucchacua silver mine
this month may hurt second-quarter earnings, Chief Financial
Officer Carlos Galvez said in an April 25 interview. The mine
produced 9.3 million ounces last year.  Gold futures for June delivery rose 14.1 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $1,531.20 an ounce today on the Comex in  New York 
after hitting a record of $1,538.80. Silver rose to a 31-year
high of $49.845 on April 25.  Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, rose $1.35, or 3.5 percent, to
$39.92 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The ADRs
have dropped 18.5 percent this year.  (Buenaventura will hold its quarterly conference call April
