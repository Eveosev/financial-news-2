Citadel LLC, the $11 billion hedge
fund run by  Ken Griffin , hired Jamil Nazarali and Matt Cushman,
former executives at  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) , to lead a new
effort in quantitative trading.  Nazarali, 43, and Cushman, 37, are set to join Citadel in
September and report to Griffin, said Devon Spurgeon, a
spokeswoman for Chicago-based Citadel. They will work with
groups across the firm including equities, currencies and high-
frequency trading, she said.  Quantitative  hedge funds , which use complex mathematical
models to pick investments, returned 2.1 percent this year
through March compared with an industry average gain of 1.6
percent, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. The funds rose
8.8 percent last year and 14 percent in 2009, data from the
Chicago-based research firm show.  Nazarali and Cushman resigned from Knight Capital in
February, the firm said that month. Nazarali was a senior
managing director responsible for Knightâ€™s electronic-trading
group, where Cushman was a managing director, according to a
statement from the  Jersey City , New Jersey-based firm.  Nazarali previously worked as a consultant at Ernst & Young
LLP and Bain & Co. Cushman, who has a doctorate in mathematics
from the University of Chicago, worked at a technology startup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
