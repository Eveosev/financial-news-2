Tropical Bank Ltd. , the Libyan-
owned lender seized by Uganda’s central bank last month, said
full-year profit almost doubled as deposits and loans grew.  Net income surged to 5.65 billion Ugandan shillings ($2.37
million) in 2010 from 2.98 billion shillings a year earlier, the
Kampala-based bank said in a statement published in the  New
Vision  newspaper today. Deposits grew 21 percent to 127.9
billion shillings, while loans climbed 53 percent to 84.4
billion shillings, it said.  Uganda took control of Tropical on March 25 to protect the
lender from sanctions imposed on  Libya  by the United Nations.
The UN measures were aimed at halting attacks by Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi ’s regime on protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
