AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker, said first-quarter profit rose 4.7 percent
and raised its earnings forecast after the company agreed to
settle tax and patent disputes.  Net income rose to $2.91 billion from $2.78 billion a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg in the past month predicted $2.77
billion, the average of 13 estimates. Earnings excluding some
items increased to $2.23 a share from $2.03 a year earlier,
beating the $2.15 average estimate of 16 analysts.  AstraZeneca raised its target for so-called core earnings
per share for the second time this year, to a range of $6.95 to
$7.25, after getting a $131 million benefit from the settlement
of patent disputes between its MedImmune unit and PDL BioPharma
Inc. That helped offset a decline in revenue to $8.29 billion
from $8.58 billion a year earlier, falling short of the $8.41
billion average estimate of 21 analysts. Sales of cholesterol-
lowering drug Crestor also missed estimates.  "The slight increase to guidance reflects management’s view
that the business is developing as per management’s
expectations," wrote Mark Purcell, an analyst with  Barclays
Capital  in  London , in a note to investors. "Nonetheless,
weakness in Crestor is slightly troubling given that AZ has
become increasingly reliant on that drug for financial
performance as other drugs have lost patent protection in
developed markets."  Crestor Sales  Crestor, the company’s best-selling drug last year, had
first-quarter revenue of $1.48 billion, up 14 percent from $1.3
billion a year earlier. That missed the $1.53 billion average
estimate of 8 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  AstraZeneca fell 68 pence, or 2.2 percent, to 3,029.5 pence
at 9:05 a.m. in London trading. Before today, the shares
returned 15 percent in the past year including reinvested
dividends, compared with an 8.8 percent return for the Bloomberg
Europe Pharmaceutical Index.  Generic competition and government price cuts reduced
revenue by more than $550 million, the company said.  "It looks like AstraZeneca’s top line and bottom line are
both coming under pressure," Navid Malik, an analyst with Matrix
Corporate Capital LLP, said in a telephone interview.  The drugmaker had raised its target for 2011 core earnings
per share in March as a result of a U.S. tax settlement and a
projected lower tax rate throughout the year.  Sales Forecast  AstraZeneca repeated its forecast that sales this year will
likely be flat or decline by a low single-digit percentage due
to increasing generic competition for breast cancer drug
Arimidex.  AstraZeneca has had setbacks with three experimental
products in the last year. The drugmaker on Jan. 27 lowered its
forecast for sales from new products. The company has said
previously that it expects 2014 revenue will be in the middle of
a $28 billion to $34 billion range.  AstraZeneca said this year that it plans to repurchase $4
billion in stock this year, after buying back $2.1 billion in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
