U.K. wheat, barley and rapeseed
will need “regular rainfall” in May to avoid crop difficulties
as conditions across the country are “very dry,” farm adviser
ADAS Holdings Ltd. said in a crop-development report.  Soil-moisture deficits in the driest regions in the east
exceed 80 millimeters (3.2 inches), ADAS said in a  report  on the
website of the Home-Grown Cereals Authority today. Crop
development is ahead of last year, the company said.  The U.K. is the European Union’s third-largest wheat grower
after France and  Germany . London-traded feed wheat for November
delivery has climbed 1.5 percent this month amid concern dry
weather will reduce yields.  “Delays in nitrogen availability and moisture stress mean
crops are shorter,” Wolverhampton, England-based ADAS said.
“Soil moisture deficits at the end of April are higher than in
recent years.”  The regional average soil-moisture deficit in the southeast
U.K., the country’s main  wheat growing region , was 77
millimeters at the end of April, compared with a five-year
average of 42 millimeters and the driest in at least six years,
ADAS said.  Disease levels are “generally low,” ADAS said. In wheat,
yellow rust fungus is a “major concern” because of a large
number of susceptible varieties, though “robust” fungicide
treatment has kept it “largely under control,” according to
ADAS.  Dry weather has caused “uneven” germination of spring
crops and slow uptake of nitrogen fertilizer, ADAS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
