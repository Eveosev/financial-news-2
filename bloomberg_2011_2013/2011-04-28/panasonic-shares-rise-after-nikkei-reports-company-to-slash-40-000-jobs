Panasonic Corp. (6752)  jumped the most in
three weeks in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei newspaper reported
the company plans to cut 40,000 jobs as part of a restructuring.  The shares gained as much as 2 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since April 7, to 994 yen. They traded 1.8 percent
higher at 9:40 a.m.  Panasonic, which has eliminated about 15,000 positions
since the financial crisis in 2008, plans to carry out the
reduction by the end of March 2013, mainly outside  Japan , the
report said without citing anyone. The job cuts would be the
biggest among Japanese manufacturers, the report said.  “We’re not the source of the report,”  Akira Kadota , a
Tokyo-based spokesman, said by telephone today.  Panasonic, which spent 664.8 billion yen ($8.1 billion)
purchasing stakes in Sanyo Electric Co. and Panasonic Electric
Works Co. last year, will hold a press conference at 5:10 p.m.
in  Tokyo  today to discuss its growth strategy. President Fumio
Ohtsubo will speak at the meeting, which will follow the
company’s earnings announcement at 3 p.m.  The company employs 380,000 people, the Nikkei report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
