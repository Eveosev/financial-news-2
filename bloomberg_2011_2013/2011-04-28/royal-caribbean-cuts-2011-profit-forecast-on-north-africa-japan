Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , the
world’s second-largest cruise operator, beat analyst estimates
in the first quarter. It lowered full-year forecasts, citing
political unrest in North Africa and the disasters in  Japan .  Quarterly net income rose 4.7 percent to $91.6 million, or
42 cents per share, from $87.4 million, or 40 cents, a year
earlier, beating the 14 cent average estimate of 23 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased almost 13 percent to
$1.67 billion from $1.49 billion.  Fiscal 2011 earnings will be $3.10 to $3.30 a share, down
from $3.25 to $3.45 previously expected, the Miami-based company
said today in a statement. Royal Caribbean said it has “largely
offset” rising fuel costs and the impact of currency exchange
rates. Analysts had predicted earnings of $3.19 a share, the
average of 32 surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The year started off with a roar -- strong bookings, low
costs and solid profits,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain
said in the statement. “Unfortunately, the events in Northern
Africa and Japan have turned what was shaping up as a
spectacular year into merely a very good one.”  The shares, rose 11 cents, to $39.82 at 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier
climbing as much as 6.5 percent.  Royal Caribbean operates the Royal Caribbean International,
Celebrity, Pullmantur, Azamara and CDF Croisieres de France
lines.  Carnival Corp. (CCL) , also based in Miami, is the biggest
cruise operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
