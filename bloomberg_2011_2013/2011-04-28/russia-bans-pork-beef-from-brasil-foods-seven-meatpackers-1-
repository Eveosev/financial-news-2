Russia  banned purchases of beef,
pork and some other products from eight Brazilian meatpackers,
including producer BRF-Brasil Foods SA, a Brazilian  Ministry of
Agriculture  official said.  The ban on some producers of the meat is "temporary," said
Luiz Carlos de Oliveira, director of animal products inspection
for  Brazil ’s Agriculture Ministry. “We’ll clarify doubts and
reaffirm to Russia that Brazilian meatpackers are able to
produce and export with high quality products,” he told
reporters today in Brasilia.  Brasil Foods, the world’s largest poultry exporter, hasn’t
yet been notified of the ban, said a press official who declined
to be identified because of company policy. The company, which
had 13 plants authorized to export to Russia, aims to work with
the Brazilian government to overturn the ban as soon as
possible, he said.  Russia’s health inspector authority said on its website in
a statement dated April 19 that purchases of meat from the
producers were banned because “quality and safety control
specialists at the plants were not familiar with the Russian
veterinary and sanitary requirements and norms.”,  Brasil Foods  shares fell 2 centavos to close at 31.63 reais
today in  Sao Paulo  trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
