Playtech Ltd. (PTEC) , a U.K.-listed
Internet-gambling software maker, said first-quarter gross
income gained 7 percent, led by its online-betting venture with
 William Hill Plc. (WMH)   First-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization will probably be at least 26.5 million euros,
($39 million), the Isle of Man-based company said in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service.  Playtech’s share of profit in the William Hill venture
gained 34 percent to 9.9 million euros, the company said.
Earlier this month, the U.S. charged founders of poker companies
still accepting bets in the country with  money laundering , a
step that should help their European rivals who have been losing
business to those companies.  “We have made a solid start to 2011,” Chief Executive
Officer Mor Weizer said in the statement. “We continue to
develop new sources of regulated market income.”  Playtech said “daily activity” for the first 23 days of
the second quarter is more than 1 percent ahead of the same
period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
