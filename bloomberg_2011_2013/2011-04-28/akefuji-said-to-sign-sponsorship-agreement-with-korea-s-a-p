Takefuji Corp. (8564) , the bankrupt
Japanese consumer finance company, agreed to be acquired by A&P
Financial Co., two people familiar with the negotiations said.  The companies plan to announce the agreement later today,
the people said.  Kyodo News  reported the agreement earlier.  Takefuji filed for  bankruptcy protection  in September with
434 billion yen ($5.3 billion) in debt, becoming  Japan ’s biggest
casualty of a four-year crackdown on coercive lending. Acquiring
Tokyo-based Takefuji would help the Seoul-based consumer lender
expand beyond South Korea.  The Korean company was selected as a preferred bidder for
the assets on April 11, among rival bids from  J Trust Co., a
Japanese financial services company, TPG Capital and two others.  To contact the reporters on this story:
