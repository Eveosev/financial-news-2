Japan ’s housing starts dropped the
first time in 10 months as the nation’s strongest earthquake on
March 11 sapped demand, halting the strongest recovery in the
real estate market in almost 15 years.  Construction companies broke ground on 2.4 percent fewer
homes in March from a year earlier, according a report released
today by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism in Tokyo. Housing starts were expected to fall 1.1
percent, based on the median estimate of 23 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Housing starts slid to the equivalent of
an annual 807,000 units in March, the lowest since July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
