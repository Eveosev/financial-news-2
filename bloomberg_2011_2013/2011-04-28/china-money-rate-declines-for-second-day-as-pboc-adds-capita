China ’s money-market rate dropped
for a second day on speculation the central bank’s biggest
injection of capital in three months will help ease a cash
shortage.  The People’s Bank of China added a net 241 billion yuan
($37 billion) of capital into the financial system this week,
the most since the five days through Jan. 21, according to Li Huaiding, a Shanghai-based bond analyst at Guosen Securities Co.
The central bank held off offering repurchase agreements for a
second week and sold 11 billion yuan of three-month bills.  “The capital injection is temporarily easing the cash
squeeze,” Li said. “But the liquidity situation may be tighter
in the second quarter than in the first quarter as the central
bank is draining more capital in the second quarter.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 66 basis points to 3.03 percent as
of 10:51 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
2.60 percent, the lowest since April 22.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.41 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due March
2021 gained three basis points to 3.91 percent, according to the
National Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
