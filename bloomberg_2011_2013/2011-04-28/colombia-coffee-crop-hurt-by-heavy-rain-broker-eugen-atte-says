Coffee crops in  Colombia , the
world’s second-largest grower of arabica beans, are being
damaged by heavy rains and mudslides, according to Hamburg-based
coffee broker  Eugen Atte GmbH .  “Several rural areas are reporting damages to coffee
plantations both due to coffee trees lost to landslides as well
as flowerings lost to intensive rains,” Atte said today in an
e-mailed report.  Floods, landslides and damaged bridges have isolated entire
towns, according to the report. “What is scarier is that,
according to weather experts, the worse rains are yet to come,”
the broker said.  Colombia’s domestic market was at a “standstill,” Eugen
Atte said. Coffee for May and June shipment was offered at a
premium of 22 cents a pound over the price of  New York  futures,
data from the brokerage showed.  Arabica coffee for July delivery advanced 2.8 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $2.992 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching $3.034, the highest since May 1997. The
commodity has more than doubled in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
