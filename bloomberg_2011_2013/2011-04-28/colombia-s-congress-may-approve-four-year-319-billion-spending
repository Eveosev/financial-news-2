Colombia ’s congress may approve
overnight a four-year economic development plan that involves
about 565 trillion pesos ($319 billion) of spending by the
government and private companies on health care, mining and
poverty reduction  The Senate and lower house tonight will reconcile separate
versions of the plan and then vote on the final bill, National
Planning Department Director Hernando Jose Gomez said in a
 statement .  The spending program, 60 percent of which will be funded by
the government and the rest by the private sector, aims to
reduce unemployment to single digits by 2014 from 13.2 percent
at present, boost housing and improve infrastructure.  It envisages economic growth of about 5 percent annually
over the next four years. In 2010, Colombia’s economy expanded
4.3 percent.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 1767.13 per dollar at 3:26
