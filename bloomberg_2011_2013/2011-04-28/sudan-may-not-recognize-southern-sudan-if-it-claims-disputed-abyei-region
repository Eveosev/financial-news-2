Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir’s
 National Congress Party  may not recognize  Southern Sudan ’s
independence if its constitution claims the disputed region of
 Abyei  as part of the south, the state-run SMC news agency said
today, citing senior NCP official Al-Derdiri Mohamed Ahmed.  A clause in Southern  Sudan ’s draft transitional
constitution says Abyei is part of the south. The charter would
take effect on July 9 when Southern Sudan becomes independent
and remain until a permanent constitution is written.  The draft constitution is being discussed by Southern
Sudan’s ruling party and opposition parties before being voted
on by the legislative assembly. Abyei accounts for less than
2,500 barrels of daily oil production, according to Sudan’s Oil
Ministry.  Abyei was supposed to vote in January to decide whether to
be part of the north or south. The plebiscite was postponed
because of disputes over who is eligible to vote. The Ngok Dinka
people, who consider themselves southerners, say they alone
should be allowed to vote in the region’s referendum.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration in  The Hague , in a 2009
ruling, set Abyei’s borders to the area around Ngok Dinka
settlements, largely excluding the pro-northern Misseriya ethnic
group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
