Safran SA (SAF) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
maker of  aircraft engines , said first-quarter revenue jumped 11
percent, boosted by defense products such as infrared goggles
and plane equipment such as landing gear and engine casings.  Sales climbed to 2.68 billion euros ($4 billion) from 2.43
billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding exchange-rate effects and
acquisitions, revenue rose 7.1 percent.  “The fundamental drivers of new aircraft demand remained
strong and our global civil aftermarket performed well,” Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Herteman said in the statement. “We
confirm our full-year guidance for 2011 and our renewed
confidence in our outlook for 2012 and beyond.”  The company, which builds commercial aircraft engines
jointly with  General Electric Co. (GE)  for Airbus SAS A320 and  Boeing
Co. (BA)  737 models, predicted in February that sales in 2011 will
increase by at least 5 percent, with operating profit rising at
least 20 percent. Those forecasts don’t take into account any
contributions from the planned purchase of L-1 Identity
Solutions Inc. or the acquisition of SNPE Materiaux Energetiques
completed this month.  Safran, which also makes security systems including
software for biometric identification and detection equipment,
has dropped 9.1 percent in Paris trading this year, valuing the
company at 10 billion euros. Shares of London-based  Rolls-Royce
Group Plc (RR/) , Europe’s largest jet-engine maker, have gained
4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
