Ofgem, the U.K. energy regulator,
shortlisted four bidders to own and operate more than 1 billion
pounds ($1.67 billion) of high-voltage transmission lines
bringing power to land from three offshore wind plants.  The contenders were reduced from eight that were listed in
January to own and run links to the wind-energy installations
off the English and Welsh coasts that have a combined capacity
of more than 1.4 gigawatts, Ofgem said today in a  statement .  Among the four finalists were a joint bid from Balfour
Beatty Capital Ltd. and Equitix Ltd. and an offer from a group
comprising Macquarie Capital Group Ltd., Barclays Infrastructure
Funds Management Ltd. and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)   The competition seeks to spur government plans for a U.K.
offshore wind industry. Ofgem will select the preferred bidders
as early as September, according to the statement. Those chosen
will control for 20 years cables linking the 576-megawatt Gwynt
y Mor wind farm, the 250-megawatt Lincs plant and the 630-
megawatt first phase of the London Array project.  Theyâ€™ll receive a stable, regulated income during that
period, Ofgem said. The cable connections are either already
built or being installed by the wind farm developers.  The winner for Gwynt y Mor will be picked later because its
construction is less advanced, Ofgem said. The other two
shortlisted bidders are National Grid Offshore Ltd. and a group
comprising Transmission Capital Partners Ltd. and International
Public Partnerships Ltd.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
