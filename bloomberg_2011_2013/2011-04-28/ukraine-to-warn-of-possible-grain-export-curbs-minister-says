Ukraine will give grain traders two
months’ advance notice if threats to “ food security ” make
export bans possible, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk
said.  The “grain market will be free,” he said today at a
meeting with Ukrainian representatives of the  World Bank , the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine in Kiev, according to a
statement on the ministry’s website.  Ukraine imposed quotas on exports of barley, wheat and corn
in October after Russia banned all outbound cereal shipments
following a drought that reduced harvests in both countries. The
curbs were needed to keep domestic prices from rising, Ukrainian
authorities have said. The government this week removed export
quotas for corn.  Ukraine will also start trading of grain futures,
Prysyazhnyuk said, without giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
