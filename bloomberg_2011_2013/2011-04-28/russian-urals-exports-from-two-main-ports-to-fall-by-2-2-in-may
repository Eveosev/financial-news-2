Russia’s two largest oil export
ports will cut daily shipments of Urals crude by 2.2 percent in
May from this month to 2.27 million barrels, according to a
final loading plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  Shipments from Primorsk in the  Baltic Sea  will reach 6.2
million metric tons. This is equivalent to 1.47 million barrels
a day, down 4.8 percent from this month.  Exports from Novorossiysk in the  Black Sea  will total 3.38
million tons, or 799,679 barrels a day in May, 3 percent more
than from April. The total volume is higher than 3.36 million
tons scheduled in the preliminary program released on April 26.  Russia will ship one 100,000-ton cargo of Urals for loading
from  Poland ’s Gdansk port in the Baltic Sea.  The world’s largest oil producer will also ship six cargoes
totaling 456,000 tons of Siberian Light from Tuapse in the Black
Sea. This is equivalent to 107,822 barrels a day, 42% more than
this month, the plan showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
