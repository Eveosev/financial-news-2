Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC) , an Australian
producer, cut its full-year profit forecast by as much as 20
percent because of reduced shipments to earthquake-devastated
 Japan .  Net profit after tax, excluding one-time charges, may be
A$70 million ($76 million) in the 12 months ending June 30, the
Sydney-based company said today in a statement. That compares
with its earlier guidance of between A$83 million and A$88
million.  Whitehaven was forced to defer coal deliveries to Japan
because of damage to coal handling and steel plants caused by
the earthquake and tsunamis that struck in March, the company
said. Shipping at a reduced rate may continue for the next few
months, it said.  Shares in Whitehaven declined 3 percent to A$6.52 at 10:51
a.m. Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange. It has gained
19 percent in the past year.  Total coal sales for the three months ended March 31 rose
11 percent, Whitehaven said.  The company put itself up for sale in October and said
today it expects to “shortly” consider if it will recommend
any takeover proposals to shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
