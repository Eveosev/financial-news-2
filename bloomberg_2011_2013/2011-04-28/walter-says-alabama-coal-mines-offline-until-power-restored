Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  said its No. 4
and No. 7 mines in Alabama will be offline until power is
restored after the South was swept by the worst day of tornadoes
and storms in the U.S. in 37 years.  “We expect production to resume as soon as all power is
restored and any related underground issues are resolved,” Walt Scheller, Walter’s president of U.S. operations, said in a
statement today. “We are uncertain how long it will take to
restore power to this facility.”  Both mines are in Tuscaloosa County, which suffered some of
the worst damage from the tornadoes. Walter said this month that
it plans to sell as much as 8 million tons of metallurgical
coal, used to make steel, from the operations this year.  At least 269 people have died in six states as a result of
the storms. As many as a million people were without power in
 Alabama , according to its governor.  Walter, based in Tampa,  Florida , said its Taft Choctaw
surface mine near Jasper, Alabama, incurred “superficial”
damage and that the storm cut power to the operation and its
dragline. The company said that it plans to sell 1.4 million to
1.6 million tons of thermal coal, used by  power plants , from its
surface mines.  The company had one injury at a surface mine that required
first aid treatment, it said.  Walter fell 59 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $133.65 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 45 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
