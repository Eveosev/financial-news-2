Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest operator
of U.S. nuclear power plants, agreed to buy  Constellation Energy
Group Inc. (CEG)  for about $7.9 billion, adding stakes in five
reactors in Maryland and New York.  Constellation shareholders will get 0.93 Exelon share for
each of their shares, according to a statement released today.
Based on Exelon’s closing stock price of $41.49 yesterday, that
values Constellation at $38.59 a share, a 12.5 percent premium.  “This merger creates the number one competitive energy
provider with one of the industry’s cleanest and lowest-cost
power generation fleets,” said Exelon Chief Executive Officer
John W. Rowe.  It will be Exelon’s largest transaction to date. The
company was formed by the merger of Peco Energy and Unicom in
2000, with the combined company then valued at $7.14 billion.  -Editors: Stephen Cunningham,  Will Kennedy .  To contact the reporters on this story:
