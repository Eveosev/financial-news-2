A tanker carrying crude oil loaded
at a rebel-held port in eastern  Libya  signaled that it is
heading for  Hawaii  after leaving Singapore without unloading its
cargo.  The Equator’s next destination will be Honolulu on May 18,
according to an AISLive Ltd. transmission compiled by Bloomberg.
It loaded crude oil from the Libyan port of Marsa al Hariga on
April 5 and is sitting 15.5 meters (50.9 feet) deep in the
water, compared with its maximum draft of 15.99 meters.  Ody Valatsas, Athens-based chartering manager of Dynacom
Tankers Management Ltd., operator of the vessel, declined to
comment. Oil companies will typically select multiple unloading
options for cargoes, meaning Hawaii may not be the Equator’s
ultimate destination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
