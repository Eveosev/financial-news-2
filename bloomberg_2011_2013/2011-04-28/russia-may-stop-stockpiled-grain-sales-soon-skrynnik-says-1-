Russia may stop selling stockpiled
grains through the main exchange soon because the sales have
reduced market prices by 10-15 percent, which was the
government’s aim, Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said
today.  The National Mercantile Exchange, where state trader United
Grain Co. offered stockpiled grain, reduced market prices,
Skrynnik said. The lowest price for stockpiled grain was fixed
at 6,000 rubles ($218) a metric ton on Feb. 4 when the sales
began, compared with market prices between 6,200 and 9,300
rubles, according to data from the National Grain Producers’
Union.  The daily stockpiled sales declined to 5,400 tons
yesterday, the lowest daily amount since they began, when 60,075
tons were sold to the market. Consumers bought the highest
amount, or 108,328 tons, on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
