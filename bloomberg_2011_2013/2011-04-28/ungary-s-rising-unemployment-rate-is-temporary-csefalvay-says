Hungary ’s jobless rate, which rose
to an 11-month high in the January-March period, is a temporary
result of the government’s attempts to restructure the labor
market, Economy State Secretary Zoltan Csefalvay said.  “When you’re in the middle of restructuring something,
that is the result,” Csefalvay told investors at a conference
today in Budapest. “We’re in the phase of implementing
regulation and laws, and step by step we will see an increase in
jobs.”  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  was elected last year on a
promise to create 1 million jobs in a decade in the country with
the European Union’s second-lowest employment rate. The
government has cut some corporate taxes and introduced a flat
personal income tax to boost growth and help meet that goal.  Unemployment increased to 11.6 percent from 10.8 percent in
the previous quarter,  the statistics office  in Budapest said
today in an e-mail. The first-quarter rate was the highest since
the February-April period of 2010, when it was 11.8 percent.  Accelerating economic growth in  Germany , Hungary’s biggest
export market, as well as traditionally rising employment rate
in the summer may reduce joblessness, Csefalvay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
