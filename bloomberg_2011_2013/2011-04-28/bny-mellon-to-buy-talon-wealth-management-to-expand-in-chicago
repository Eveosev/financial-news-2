Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the
world’s largest custody bank, agreed to buy Talon Asset
Management’s wealth management operations, adding more than $800
million in assets.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed in a statement today
from New York-based BNY Mellon. Senior Talon principals Terry
Diamond, Alan Wilson and Edwin Ruthman will assume leadership
roles in the Chicago office, where Talon is based.  The deal is adding to BNY Mellon’s $171 billion in private
client assets and will give the company better access to wealthy
families in the Chicago area, where it already employs 450
people in businesses such as asset servicing and treasury
services. The transaction is scheduled to be completed in the
second quarter.  “BNY Mellon Wealth Management had targeted  Chicago  as part
of its national and global expansion strategy,” Lawrence
Hughes, head of BNY Mellon Wealth Management, said in the
statement. “This transaction marks a significant step in the
company’s growth in the region and will enable us to offer a
whole new level of service to wealthy Chicago investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
