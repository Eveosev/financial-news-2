Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP) , the fourth-
largest producer of the metal, said fiscal third-quarter output
of platinum group metals jumped 18 percent as it restarted its
Everest mine in  South Africa , helping boost profit.  Net income for the three months through March rose to $25.3
million from $23.2 million a year earlier after output climbed
to 122,213 ounces, London-based Aquarius said in a statement
today. That puts production in the first nine months of the
fiscal year 75 percent ahead of the same period a year earlier.  Aquarius, whose mines in northern South Africa tap the
world’s richest platinum reserves, is set to increase output for
the first year in five as it restarts its Everest mine, closed
in late 2008 because of rain-induced subsidence.  The third-quarter result is “better than expected,” said
Louise Collinge, an analysts at Evolution Securities Ltd., in an
e-mailed note, adding that the March quarter is “normally
difficult” for South African miners. Mines usually take time to
restart after the December holidays.  Aquarius gained 3.7 pence, or 1.1 percent, to 344.2 pence
by the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in  London . Anglo Platinum
Ltd., Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and Lonmin Plc are the
largest platinum producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
