The Egyptian Co. for Mobile
Services headed for the biggest drop in more than a month after
reporting a 94 percent decline in first-quarter profit amid a
popular revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  and
interupted communication services.  The shares fell 4.2 percent, the most since March 23, to
142.11 Egyptian pounds at 11:59 a.m. in Cairo, extending their
decline this year to 14 percent. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose
0.3 percent today.  The mobile-phone operator, partly owned by France Telecom
SA and Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, said yesterday net income
dropped to 22.7 million Egyptian pounds ($3.8 million) from
353.6 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
