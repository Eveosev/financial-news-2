Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest owner
of business parks and warehouses, leased 64 percent less new
space in the U.K. in the three months through March compared
with the previous year as economic concerns make customers more
reluctant to expand.  New leases totaled 30,800 square meters (332,000 square
feet) compared with 86,700 square meters a year earlier, the
Slough, England-based company said today in a statement. In
continental  Europe , the figure fell to 73,900 square meters from
103,200 square meters.  “Occupier market conditions continue to be challenging as
issues such as sovereign debt worries, the austerity measures in
the U.K. and rising energy prices impact sentiment,” Chief
Executive Officer David Sleath said in the statement.  Rents for all U.K. warehouses and distribution centers fell
by 1.6 percent in 2010, compared with a 1.4 percent drop for
shops and a 1.5 percent gain for offices, according to research
group Investment Property Databank Ltd.  Segro agreed to start six development projects totaling
61,900 square meters, including a 32,300 square-meter campus in
 Italy  for Alcatel-Lucent SA,  France ’s largest telephone-
equipment maker. Tenants have agreed in advance to occupy all
the buildings, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
