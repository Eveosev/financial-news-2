India ’s  environment ministry  held
back approval for four Russian reactors to be set up in the
southern city of Kudankulam because disposing of water into the
sea may affect marine life, the Wall Street Journal reported.  A fresh risk assessment is needed following the Fukushima
nuclear accident, according to the report, which cited a panel
of the ministry.  Nuclear Power Corp. of India, the state-owned monopoly
atomic generator, plans to set up four Russian reactors of 1,000
megawatts each at Kudankulam in the state of  Tamil Nadu  in
addition to  two units  being constructed.  Shreyans Kumar Jain, chairman of Nuclear Power Corp.,
didn’t answer a call made to his mobile phone seeking comment.
India is reviewing environmental approvals for all coastal
nuclear power projects, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told
reporters in  New Delhi  when asked to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
