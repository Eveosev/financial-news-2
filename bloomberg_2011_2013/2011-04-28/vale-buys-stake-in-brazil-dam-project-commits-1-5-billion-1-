Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore miner, said it agreed to buy a stake in the Belo Monte
hydropower project in  Brazil ’s Amazon region and committed about
2.3 billion reais ($1.5 billion) of investments.  Vale’s board approved the purchase of as much as 9 percent
of Norte Energia SA, the company that will build and operate the
dam, from Gaia Energia & Participacoes SA, according to a
regulatory filing today. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale will
reimburse Gaia for expenditures made and assume its future
investment commitments.  “Vale is a large consumer of electricity and invests in
generation assets based on its consumption needs,” the company
said in the statement. Vale is “seeking to reduce operating
costs on a permanent basis and minimize price and supply risks.”  Vale fell 22 centavos, or 0.5 percent, to 46.05 reais in
 Sao Paulo  trading. The stock has lost 4.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
