Most farmers in Saskatchewan,
 Canada ’s biggest wheat-growing province, are “at least” two
weeks away from beginning to plant crops, the Saskatchewan
Ministry of Agriculture said today in a  report  on its website.  “A few localized areas” have begun fieldwork, the
ministry said. Most areas are too wet, and warm, windy weather
is needed to dry fields enough to support machinery, the agency
said. The report cited conditions from April 19 to April 25.  Pasture conditions for livestock were rated 55 percent good
to excellent, and 45 percent were in fair to very poor
condition, the agency said. Pastures and crop land is flooded or
inaccessible “in many areas,” the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
