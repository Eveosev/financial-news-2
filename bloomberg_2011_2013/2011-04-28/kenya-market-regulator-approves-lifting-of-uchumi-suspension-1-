Kenya’s  Capital Markets Authority 
approved the lifting of a suspension on trading in  Uchumi
Supermarket Ltd. (UCSP) ’s shares with conditions, according to a
statement e-mailed by the regulator today from Nairobi, the
capital.  The management of Uchumi, a Kenyan retailer, is required to
put in place a “risk mitigation strategy” before its shares
can begin trading on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange , Stella Kilonzo,
head of the Capital Markets Authority, said in the statement.  “Additionally, the Authority required undertakings from
key shareholders that they would not sell their shares for a
period of one year from the lifting of the suspension and re-
listing on NSE,” Kilonzo said.  Uchumi went into receivership in June 2006 with debts of
2.2 billion shillings ($26.4 million), of which 957 million
shillings was owed to Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. and PTA Bank
Ltd. The receivership ended on March 4 after most of the
company’s debts were cleared and others converted into shares.  The retailer will open an outlet in Tanzania’s capital,  Dar
es Salaam , “any time now,” Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ciano said April 21. The company will start a second branch in
Uganda’s capital, Kampala, in two months’ time and also plans a
business in the northern Ugandan city of Gulu, Ciano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
