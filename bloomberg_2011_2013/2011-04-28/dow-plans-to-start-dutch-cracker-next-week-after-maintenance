Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  plans to start a
cracker at its Terneuzen chemicals plant in the Netherlands next
week following planned maintenance that began last month.  “Completion for this turnaround is expected to happen
early next week,” Sue Breach, a U.K.-based company spokeswoman,
said today in an e-mailed statement. Cracker 1, along with other
chemical processing units at the facility, was shut in mid-March
for the work, Breach said.  The cracker is one of three on site with capacity to
produce 580,000 metric tons of ethylene a year. Dow’s Terneuzen
has a total capacity of 1.81 million tons a year, according to
the  Association  of Petrochemicals Producers in  Europe . Ethylene
is used to make plastics.  The crackers are flexible, able to use naphtha and liquid
petroleum gas as feedstock, according to Dow’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
