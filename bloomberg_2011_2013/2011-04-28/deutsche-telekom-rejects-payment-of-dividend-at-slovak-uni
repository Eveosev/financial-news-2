Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  rejected a
proposal for its Slovak unit to pay dividends totaling 258
million-euros ($382 million), igniting a conflict with the
country’s government, which seeks to narrow the  budget deficit .  Representatives of the German operator at today’s
shareholder meeting of Slovak Telekom AS voted against the
Slovak government’s proposal for a payout, the  Economy Ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement from Bratislava, Slovakia.
Deutsche Telekom didn’t give reason for the decision, the
ministry said.  The German company owns 51 percent of the unit, with the
rest held by the Slovak state. The Slovak government, which
wants to cut the budget deficit to 4.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year from 7.8 percent of GDP in 2010, plans to sell
its stake within two years.  “Slovak Telekom has enough funds from past profits, which
haven’t been paid to shareholders,” the ministry said.
“Slovakia now needs every euro. The vote reinforced our view
that Deutsche Telekom abuses its position of a 51 percent
shareholder.”  Sylvia Braunle, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, said
negotiations with the Slovak government over a dividend started
shortly before the shareholder meeting and that the Bonn-based
company made an “appropriate” offer. The offer still stands,
she said in an e-mailed statement without specifying.  Slovak Telekom’s consolidated net income dropped 17 percent
last year to 120.9 million euros as declining prices cut
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
