Ghana ’s currency strengthened as
offshore investors sought cedis to pay for bonds sold by the
 Bank of Ghana  yesterday.  The cedi traded at 1.4935 per dollar at 2:30 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, from a closing of 1.510 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect more gains in the cedi until the final
settlement date of May 2,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at
Barclays Bank  Ghana  Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.  Ghana sold 320 million cedis ($214 million) of three-year
