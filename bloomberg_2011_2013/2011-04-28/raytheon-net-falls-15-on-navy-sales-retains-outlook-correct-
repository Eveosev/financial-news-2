Raytheon Co. (RTN) , the world’s largest
missile maker, said full-year profit will remain unchanged from
earlier estimates after first-quarter profit fell 15.4 percent
because of weak sales to the U.S. Army and Navy.  First-quarter profit from continuing operations declined to
$383 million, or $1.06 a share, compared with profit of $453
million, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier, the company said. The
quarter’s profit was reduced by a 16-cent-per-share charge from
a canceled U.K. Border Agency order that is now in arbitration,
the company said.  The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for profit of $1.09 a share in the quarter. Sales remained
flat at $6.06 billion.  Full-year adjusted profit estimate will be in the range of
$5.50 to $5.65, remaining unchanged from the company’s forecast
made in January, Raytheon said. It includes the charge related
to the U.K. Border Agency program, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer Bill Swanson has said the company’s
businesses, spread over 8,000 programs, are less prone to
Pentagon budget cuts than rivals. He has also stepped up
acquisitions and targeted international sales to boost revenue.  Raytheon fell 51 cents or 1 percent to $49.25 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 6.3 percent this year, compared with the Standard &
Poor’s Supercomposite Aerospace & Defense Index, which has
increased 11.2 percent in the same period.  Budget Delays  Raytheon’s business was affected by the failure of Congress
to pass the 2011  defense budget  on time, the company’s chief
financial officer, Dave Wajsgras, said in a telephone interview.  “There were some delays in new orders and you don’t get
funded for new programs as the  Department of Defense  was
reprioritizing,” he said. “That affected Raytheon and other
companies.”  In the first quarter, Raytheon didn’t get about $500
million of bookings and about $200 million of sales because the
Pentagon was operating on so-called continuing resolutions. That
delayed programs and pegged defense spending at 2010 levels from
Oct. 1 until Congress approved the full-year 2011 budget this
month, Swanson said on a conference call today.  Larger defense programs that were put on hold because of
the budget delays may continue to face problems because a year’s
work must now be completed in six months, Swanson said.  Classified Sales  Raytheon saw a 26 percent increase in classified sales to
U.S. agencies, Swanson said on the conference call. Classified
sales refer to secret defense and intelligence programs that
aren’t disclosed in budget documents.  For the year, Raytheon expects classified program sales to
account for 15 percent of its total revenue, an increase of
about 10 percent to 12 percent compared with the previous year,
Swanson said. About one-third of that work is new programs, he
said.  Cyber security programs are “stronger than anything else”
in the classified programs, Swanson said.  International sales may account for 30 percent of its 2011
revenue, Swanson said.  The company expects total 2011 sales in the range of $25.5
billion to $26.3 billion.  Unit Sales  Three of the company’s five units had lower sales in the
quarter compared with the previous year.  Sales at the company’s  Integrated Defense Systems  unit,
which makes electronic systems for the U.S. Navy’s DDG-1000
destroyer, fell 8.8 percent to $1.22 billion and unit profit
fell 7.2 percent to $193 million because of lower U.S. Navy
sales, the company said without identifying the programs.  Revenue at the  Missile Systems  unit, the company’s largest
by sales, declined 2.4 percent to $1.33 billion and unit profit
remained flat at $155 million on lower sales of Standard
Missile-2, the Navy’s primary surface-to-air weapon, the company
said.  Network Centric Systems  unit sales fell 4.6 percent because
of lower sales to the U.S. Army, the company said. Unit profit
fell 1.8 percent to $160 million.  Space and Airborne Systems  unit revenue increased 15.5
percent to $1.27 billion, driven by sales to a U.S. classified
program and an international customer, the company said.  Intelligence and Information Systems  unit sales increased
2.7 percent to $750 million while the unit recorded a loss due
to the U.K. Border Agency program being canceled, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
