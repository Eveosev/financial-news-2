Egypt â€™s central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged to support economic growth
following the revolution that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak .  The Monetary Policy Committee left the overnight deposit
rate at 8.25 percent and the overnight lending rate at 9.75
percent, the central bank said in a statement on its website.
Five out of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast
the bank would leave the deposit rate unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
