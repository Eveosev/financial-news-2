Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose to the highest in more than seven months, data
from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, gained 0.6
percent to 23.2 million barrels in the seven days to April 27
compared with a week earlier,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Stockpiles were at the
highest since Sept. 8, when they reached 23.3 million barrels.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 13 percent to 9.5 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline dropped 8
percent to 11.4 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
