Gold may extend gains from a record
as the declining value of the dollar prompts more demand for the
metal as an alternative investment, a survey found.  Eighteen of 21 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 86 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Three predicted lower prices. Gold for June delivery was up 1.8
percent for this week at $1,530.60 an ounce by 12:59 p.m.
yesterday on the Comex in  New York  after climbing to a record
$1,538.80 earlier in the day.  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund in gold, are up 1.5 percent this month, heading for the
biggest monthly gain since August. The dollar fell to the lowest
since December 2009 against the euro yesterday after the  Federal
Reserve  kept borrowing costs at a record low. There will likely
be no tightening of policy “for a couple of meetings,” Fed
Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said in a press conference on April 27.  “So long as Bernanke is in charge, the dollar is going
down and gold is going up,” said Adrian Day, president of
Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis,  Maryland .  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of April 22.  The weekly gold survey started almost seven years ago and
has forecast prices accurately in 207 of 360 weeks, or 58
percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 18 Bearish: 3 Neutral: 0  To contact the reporter on this story:
