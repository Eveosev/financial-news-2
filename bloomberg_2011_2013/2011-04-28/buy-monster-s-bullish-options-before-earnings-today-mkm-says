Investors should buy bullish
 Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  options before the world’s largest
online-recruiting company reports results today because results
may beat the company’s forecast, MKM Partners LP said.  Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at Stamford,
Connecticut-based MKM, recommended buying a June $18 call while
selling a June $20 call, a strategy known as a call spread which
caps potential profit while reducing the cost of the
transaction. Monster slipped 0.6 percent to $17.50 as of 10:52
a.m. in New York.  Strugger cited Eric Handler, an MKM analyst who estimates
that Monster’s results will be “in line with to slightly
above” the company’s forecast of adjusted earnings of 1 cent to
4 cents per share. Monster “doesn’t have to put up heroic
numbers for the shares to outperform,” Strugger wrote in the
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
