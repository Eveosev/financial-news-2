Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY) , the Chilean
department-store operator that also has stores in  Peru , is
looking to begin operations in a third country to tap growing
consumer demand in Latin America.  “We haven’t defined which country yet,” Chairman Felipe Lamarca told reporters in Santiago after the company’s annual
general shareholder meeting. “We are looking at all of the
countries of the region and we won’t be crossing the oceans.”  Ripley has a total investment budget of $950 million for
the next three years, including $160 million for new stores,
Chief Financial Officer Juan Diuana said in an interview after
the meeting. Financing will come mostly from the company’s own
cash and some debt, Diuana said without elaborating.  Ripley hasn’t resumed conversations with Grupo Palacio de
Hierro SA for a partnership in  Mexico , Lamarca said. Ripley and
Palacio de Hierro agreed in June 2010 to end a partnership
originally announced in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
