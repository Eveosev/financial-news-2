Brazil  will auction 174 oil and
natural-gas exploration licenses in September, its first sale in
almost three years, Energy Minister Edison Lobao said.  The exploration rights will cover 123,000 square kilometers
(47,500 square miles) onshore and off the coast of northern
Brazil, including areas in deep waters, Lobao said today at a
press conference in Brasilia. The government expects to sign the
first contracts in December, he said.  “Brazil is one of the greatest exploration frontiers in
the industry right now, so oil companies should be very
interested,” Max Bueno, an analyst at Spinelli SA, said in a
telephone interview from  Sao Paulo . “It also has the advantage
that it’s not located in a politically unstable area.”  Oil companies including  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA have
expressed interest in the bidding round. Brazil aims to double
oil output to more than 5 million barrels a day by 2020 as
state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and other companies
develop the largest discoveries in the Americas in more than
three decades.  To contact the reporters on this story:
