What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as wet, cold weather delays
planting and early development of crops in the southern and
eastern U.S., increasing demand for remaining supplies from last
year’s harvest, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading
Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT as planting delays in the U.S. prompt farmers to
withhold sales of last year’s crop, Gerlach said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $3 to $4 higher per 2,000 pounds, and  soybean
oil  is expected to open up 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rains this week in parts of the U.S. and
 Europe  reduce stress on crops after dry, warm weather depleted
moisture reserves in soil, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
