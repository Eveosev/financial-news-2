Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, will start an alkylation unit at its Petronor refinery
in Bilbao, Spain, following maintenance.  “Today we will restart the alkylation unit AK3,”
the company said yesterday in a statement on the refinery’s
 website . “During this process there may be intermittent
flaring.”  Petronor said April 8 that it was proceeding to halt the
AK3 unit to carry out maintenance. Alkylation plants make
blending components for gasoline.  The refinery has the capacity to process 220,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is
a safety measure to prevent excessive pressure from building up
in processing units that are being shut or started.  To contact the reporters on this story:
