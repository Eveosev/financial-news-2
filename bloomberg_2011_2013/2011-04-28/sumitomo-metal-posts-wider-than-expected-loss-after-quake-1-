Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) ,
 Japan ’s third-largest steelmaker, posted a wider-than-expected
quarterly loss after last month’s record earthquake damaged its
biggest plant.  Net loss was 42 billion yen ($514 million) for the fiscal
fourth quarter ended March 31, the first loss in five quarters.
That compares with a profit of 7.7 billion yen a year earlier,
and is bigger than the 9.9 billion loss forecast derived from
its Jan. 28 estimate for the full-year. Sales fell 1.2 percent
to 357 billion yen in the quarter.  Sumitomo will spend about 100 billion yen to bring
production at the Kashima plant, which produces more than half
of Sumitomo Metal’s crude steel, back to “usual levels” by the
end of next month, it said today. The plant slashed output to 40
percent of the year-ago level in April and was the hardest hit
among major Japanese  steel mills  after the magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami struck Japan on March 11.  The company, which is planning to merge with  Nippon Steel
Corp. (5401) , booked a 62 billion yen charge related to the earthquake
last quarter and expects to take another 15 billion yen charge
this fiscal year, it said.  The steelmaker had a full-year loss of 7.14 billion yen,
missing its target to return to a profit. Sales totaled 1.4
trillion yen for the year ended March 31, 9.1 percent higher
than the previous year and 2.6 percent lower than its earlier
estimate.  Sumitomo Metal produced 3.13 million metric tons of crude
steel in the fourth quarter, less than its February estimate of
3.7 million tons.  The company shut its Kashima works in Ibaraki prefecture,
northeast of Tokyo, after the quake damaged blast furnaces, coke
gas holders and clashed cranes used to ship cargoes. It will
spend half of the 100 billion yen allotted to restore operations
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
