The Treasury Department’s $29
billion sale of seven-year notes may draw a yield of 2.698
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 9 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past nine monthly
seven-year debt auctions. The securities, which mature in April
2018, yielded 2.695 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due
by 1 p.m. New York time.  The last sale of seven-year notes, on March 30, drew a
yield of 2.895 percent. The auction’s bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand for the security by comparing the amount bid with
the amount offered, was 2.79. The average ratio for the past 10
offerings is 2.89.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 49.4 percent of the notes at last
month’s sale, compared with 49.7 percent at the February
auction. The average for the past 10 sales is 50.8 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.8 percent of the notes
at the last sale, compared with 4.5 percent in February. The
average for the past 10 sales is 7.8 percent.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  Today’s offering is the final of three sales of notes this
week by the Treasury. The department sold $35 billion of two-
year debt on April 26 at a yield of 0.673 percent. It auctioned
$35 billion of five-year securities yesterday at a yield of
2.124 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
