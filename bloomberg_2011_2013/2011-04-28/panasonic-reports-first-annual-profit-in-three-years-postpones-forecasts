Panasonic Corp. (6752)  reported its first
annual profit in three years, helped by sales of audio-visual
products and appliances.  Net income was 74 billion yen ($905 million) for the 12
months ended March 31, compared with a loss of 103.5 billion yen
a year earlier, the Osaka-based company said in a statement
today. Profit missed the 92 billion yen average of 11 analyst
estimates compiled in the past 28 days by Bloomberg.  The company delayed issuing an earnings forecast, citing
difficulties in making an estimate because of disruptions
following the March 11 earthquake  Panasonic had halted six domestic plants making products
including televisions, camera lenses, electronics materials and
display panels after the disaster. A liquid-crystal display
factory in Chiba prefecture, near  Tokyo , will restart by end of
this month, the last one to resume since the quake, the company
said this month.  Revenue rose 17 percent to 8.69 trillion yen, the company
said. Income at the main audio-visual products division
increased 32 percent to 114.9 billion yen in the 12-month period
from a year earlier. Profit at the appliances unit rose 40
percent to 92.3 billion yen.  Panasonic rose 2.4 percent to 998 yen at the 3 p.m. close
of trading in Tokyo, before the earnings announcement. The stock
has declined 13 percent this year compared with a 3.7 percent
drop for the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
