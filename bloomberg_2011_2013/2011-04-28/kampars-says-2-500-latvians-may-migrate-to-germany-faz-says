Latvian Economy Minister Artis Kampars said he expects between 1,000 and 2,500 citizens of the
Baltic state to migrate to  Germany  after rules on greater
freedom of labor take effect on May 1,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported.  Salary differentials between Latvia and Germany are
“huge” and won’t change “significantly” in the short term,
Kampars told the newspaper. Latvia will fulfill all Maastricht
criteria by 2012 and plans to introduce the euro in 2014, FAZ
reported, citing Kampars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
