Egyptian political leader  Mohamed ElBaradei  said former President Hosni Mubarak must face trial, a
demand of many of the protesters whose uprising ended Mubarak’s
three-decade rule.  “There is no other option,” ElBaradei said in an
interview with  Charlie Rose , according to a transcript. “I
think he will not be able to get away without being put to
trial.”  ElBaradei reiterated his intention to contest  Egypt ’s first
presidential elections since Mubarak’s ouster. He added that he
won’t run “unless I am satisfied that this is a free and fair
election.”  Among the politicians who have announced plans to run for
president, ElBaradei had a 25 percent “very favorable” rating,
behind Arab League chief Amre Moussa with 41 percent and
opposition activist Ayman Nour with 32 percent, according to a
survey by Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project whose
findings were released on April 25. ElBaradei has helped
reinvigorate an Egyptian opposition that forced Mubarak from
office in February after 18 days of mass demonstrations.  In the interview, the former director of the  International
Atomic Energy Agency  urged the West to engage  Iran . “Iran could
be a very positive force -- clearly in Iraq, clearly in
 Afghanistan , Syria, Lebanon, Gaza,” he said. “We need to find
finally a solution to the standoff between Iran and the West.
It’s a win-win situation.”  He also called for “somebody in the chain of command” in
the U.S. and U.K. to “be held accountable” for waging what he
said was “an illegal war that resulted in war crime” in Iraq.  To contact the reporters on this story:
