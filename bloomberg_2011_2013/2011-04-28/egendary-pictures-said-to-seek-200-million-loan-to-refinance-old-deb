Legendary Pictures , the producer of
“The  Dark Knight ” and “The Hangover”, is seeking a $200
million  term loan  to refinance debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the deal.  The company is proposing to pay 4.5 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate on the six-year loan,
said the person who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. Libor, a rate banks charge to lend to each other,
will have a 1.5 percent floor.  Legendary, based in Burbank,  California  and located on the
Warner Brothers lot, may sell the debt at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing the proceeds for the borrower
and boosting the yield for investors.  Lenders must let JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank arranging
the financing, know by May 12 if they will participate in the
deal, the person said.  There’s a $500 million line of credit as part of the
transaction, said another person with knowledge of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
