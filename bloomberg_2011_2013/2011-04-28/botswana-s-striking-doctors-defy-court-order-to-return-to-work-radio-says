Doctors and nurses in Botswana are
defying a court order to return to work, paralyzing the health
system in the world’s biggest diamond producer, the independent
Gabz FM radio station said, citing physicians.  An industrial court on April 26 ordered workers in the
health-care, power and water industries to end a strike over
wages that started on April 18. State employees want a 16
percent increase in salaries, while the state is offering 5
percent. Annual inflation was unchanged at 8.5 percent in March.  The government obtained the court order by arguing that the
unions had failed to maintain essential services operating at
the legal minimum of 30 percent.  Botswana has vowed to slash a  budget deficit  that widened
to about 10 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year
through March after a decline in diamond demand hit revenue and
sent the economy into recession. The economy expanded 7.2
percent in 2010 after contracting 4.9 percent in 2009, according
to the  Central Statistics Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
