Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR)  and  ReneSola
Ltd. (SOLA)  sank in  New York  after reporting sales of photovoltaic
panels have been slower than analysts expected.  Evergreen dropped 54 cents, or 26 percent, to $1.54 as of
10:221 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier it was down
as much as 34 percent, the largest intra-day decline since
October 2002. ReneSola’s American depositary receipts fell as
much as 78 cents, or 8.8 percent, to $8.07 a share. A close at
that price would be the lowest since Dec. 17.  Evergreen Chief Executive Officer Michael El-Hillow said
slower-than-expected sales may force the company to raise cash.
Marlboro, Massachusetts-based Evergreen held about $33 million
in cash and cash equivalents as of April 26, down from $38.5
million on April 2.  “Uncertainties regarding feed-in-tariffs and other subsidy
programs have substantially slowed the demand for solar panels
in 2011,” El-Hollow said in a statement yesterday.  Wunderlich Securities Inc. analyst Theodore O’Neill
downgraded the company today to “sell” from “hold.”  ReneSola said product sales slumped 15 percent in the first
quarter to $328.2 million, from $386.4 million in the fourth
quarter. For the second quarter, sales will be in the range of
$280 million to $300 million, less than the $337.1 million that
analysts had expected.  “We hold a cautious outlook for demand in  Europe ,
particularly due to the uncertainty and policy changes in
 Italy ,” the Jiashan, China-based company’s Chief Executive
Officer Xianshou Li said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
