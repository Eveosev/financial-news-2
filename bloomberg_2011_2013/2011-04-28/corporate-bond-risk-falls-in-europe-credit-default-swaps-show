The cost of insuring against
default on high-yield corporate bonds in  Europe  fell to the
lowest level in more than three years, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 5 basis
points to 356, the lowest since Jan. 2, 2008, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 9 a.m. in  London . The index is a
benchmark for the cost of protecting bonds against default and a
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1 basis point to 96.75, JPMorgan
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and
insurers declined 4 to 129 and the subordinated index was 11.5
lower at 221.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
