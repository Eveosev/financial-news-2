The  European Central Bank  said
Greece’s pension law could infringe the independence of the
country’s central bank,  Kathimerini  reported, citing an ECB
opinion.  A pension law passed last year could give political
appointees to the  Bank of Greece ’s governing council influence
in fixing staff pensions, which would compromise the bank’s
financial independence, Kathimerini cited the ECB as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
