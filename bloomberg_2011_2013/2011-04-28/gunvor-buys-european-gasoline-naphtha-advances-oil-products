Gunvor International AG bought
barges of European Eurobob-grade gasoline after prices declined
from a two-year high. Naphtha cargoes advanced to the highest
level since 2008.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate delivery traded for as much
as $1,171 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus bulletin board and
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time.
That’s the most since the Eurobob grade was introduced in
January 2010 and the highest for a comparable benchmark since
July 14, 2008. Barge lots are usually about 1,000 or 2,000 tons
in size and trade in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub.  Eurobob prices are up 43 percent since the start of the
year and have risen for eight consecutive months. The grade, to
which ethanol is added to make finished motor fuel, traded as
low as $1,156.25 a ton, compared with yesterday’s deals at
$1,122 to $1,143 a ton. Gunvor bought barges in the afternoon
session from Total after prices declined more than $10.  The gains followed outages at several refineries in the
U.S., Europe’s main export market, and a 2.5-million-barrel
decline in stockpiles reported by the Energy Department.  “Maintenance downtime in gasoline-producing fluid
catalytic cracker units is subtracting from supply and is not
expected to subside before month-end,”  Harry Tchilinguirian ,
head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London,
said yesterday in a note. “We may be in for another week or two
of declines or flat gasoline stock changes before the usual pre-
summer build-up.”  The product’s crack, or premium to Brent crude, shrank to
$11.56 a barrel, compared with $12.26 a barrel, according to
London-based brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Koch Industries Inc. bought a 12,500-ton cargo of naphtha
from Gunvor at $1,100, the highest since July 17, 2008. That’s
up from $1,082 a ton yesterday. The product is used in gasoline
and petrochemical production.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil barge discounts narrowed to $5 and $5.50 against May
gasoil on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, according to the
Platts survey. That compares with deals yesterday at $5.50 and
$6 less than the May contract. Morgan Stanley and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc sold barges to AOT Trading AG and Mabanaft AG.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges changed hands at a $15
premium against ICE futures. That’s narrower than transactions
for $17 more than ICE gasoil yesterday. BP Plc, Shell and OAO
Lukoil were sellers, while Total SA, Vitol Group, Mabanaft and
North Sea Group BV bought.  May gasoil futures advanced $4.25 a ton, or 0.4 percent, to
$1,028.50 as of 5:13 p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The fuel was the second-best performer in the
S&P GSCI Commodity Index this year after silver, and is up 35
percent.  Gasoil’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , was at $13.54 a
barrel at 4:30 p.m. London time compared with $13.61 yesterday.
Brent crude for June delivery rose 9 cents to $125.22 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $651 to $652.50 a ton,
increasing from $641.50 to $644 yesterday, the Platts survey
showed. The low-sulfur grade was discussed at $696.75 to $703 a
ton. The high-sulfur grade’s discount to its less polluting
equivalent narrowed to the least in a month as falling freight
rates spur shipments to  Asia .  Refineries  Preem AB,  Sweden ’s largest refiner, started a catalytic
cracker unit yesterday at its Lysekil plant following a halt for
maintenance and inspections, the Stockholm-based company said
today on its  website .  Repsol YPF SA,  Spain ’s biggest oil company, will start an
alkylation unit at its Petronor refinery in Bilbao, Spain,
following maintenance, the company said yesterday in a statement
on the refinery’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
