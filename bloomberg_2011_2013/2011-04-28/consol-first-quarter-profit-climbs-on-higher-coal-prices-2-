Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , a coal and
natural-gas producer, said first-quarter profit rose more than
analysts expected as prices increased five times faster than
costs.  Net income advanced to $192 million, or 84 cents a share,
from $100.3 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier, Pittsburgh-
based Consol said today in a statement. The company was forecast
to earn 78.5 cents, according to the average of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue surged 18 percent to
$1.5 billion from $1.22 billion.  The company, led by Chief Executive Officer, J. Brett Harvey, 60, plans to expand capacity at its Baltimore export
terminal and will reopen its Amonate mining operation in
 Virginia  by next year to take advantage of global demand for
steelmaking coal.  “It was a good quarter,” said Jim Rollyson, an analyst at
Raymond James Financial Inc. in Houston. “Metallurgical coal’s
been their biggest driver.  On the growth side all of their
focus seems to be on the met side.”  Consol rose $2.10, or 4.1 percent, to $53.09 in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain since March
17. The shares have gained 20 percent in the past year.  Price Increases  Average realized prices for the company’s coal increased
about $10 per ton, while the costs to mine it increased about
$2, Consol said.  The company explored selling the Amonate property and
allowed prospective buyers to visit the operation, which has 240
million tons of metallurgical reserves, as recently as November.  “With the rapidly improving market for the met coal
produced by Amonate and with the industry’s M&A activity
creating some distraction for potential buyers, we now believe
that a reopening of the mine will yield the best value for our
shareholders,” Consol said.  The company will spend less than $100 million to bring the
mine back online and expects to produce about 400,000 tons in
2012 and 800,000 tons annually by 2015.  Margins from that operation could reach $100 per ton,
Consol said. A “major” U.S. steelmaker is testing
metallurgical coal from Consol’s Bailey operation in
southwestern  Pennsylvania .  Baltimore Terminal  Consol said it will expand capacity at Baltimore by 2
million tons to 16 million tons a year and that it will spend
about $10 million to upgrade rail capacity. It’s also studying
the feasibility of expanding beyond 16 million tons.  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  and  CSX Corp. (CSX)  are the railroads that
serve the  terminal .  A possible second phase of expansion that would boost
capacity to as much as 34 million tons of coal a year is
dependent upon Consol securing new long-term business in  Asia 
and  Europe , Bob Pusateri, executive vice president of sales and
marketing, said on a conference call with analysts and
investors.  Consol said it plans to export about 10.2 million tons of
coal this year, up from 6.8 million a year ago, and that it’s
“close” to securing agreements with customers in  India  for
thermal coal.  The company said April 13 that it sold 17.2 million tons of
coal this quarter, the highest level since the fourth-quarter of
2008. About 1.5 million tons of that is of the steelmaking
variety.  Second-Quarter Output  Second-quarter production is expected to be between 14.75
million and 15.25 million tons, it said, and that’s affected by
moving six so-called long-wall operations, which employ a
machine with a shearer that cuts thick chunks from a seam of
coal as hydraulic lifts supporting the roof of the mine.  Consol has said it plans to sell between 60 million and 62
million tons of coal this year. For both 2012 and 2013, the
company expects to deliver between 59.5 million to 61.5 million
tons of coal.  The company produced 35.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas
during the quarter and said that it plans to produce between 150
and 160 Bcf for the year.  Natural  gas prices  averaged $4.389 per million British
thermal units during the quarter on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , 13 percent higher than a year earlier.  Consol bought Dominion Resource Inc.’s gas exploration and
production business and the rest of CNX Gas to expand and
capitalize on its Marcellus Shale holdings last year.  The Marcellus field is a gas-bearing formation in
Pennsylvania,  West Virginia , New York and  Ohio . Shale gas is
locked in non-porous rock that made the reserves inaccessible
until new drilling technologies were perfected in the 1990s.  To contact the reporters on this story:
