The  European Central Bank  will have
to raise  interest rates  higher than investors expect to curb
price pressures in the single-currency zone, said Andrew Bosomworth, a  fund manager  at Pacific Investment Management Co.  “The ECB’s benchmark rate is still too low in light of
economic growth and inflation expectations,” he wrote in a
guest commentary for  Germany ’s  Boersen-Zeitung . “We believe the
ECB has to raise interest rates higher than markets expect to
damp increasing inflation pressure in the euro region.”  At the same time, there’s a risk that debt-strapped
economies will slide deeper into recession if the ECB proves to
be “too conscientious,” Bosomworth wrote in the Frankfurt-
based newspaper. The risk of a Greek insolvency is “real,” he
said.  “Pimco still won’t invest capital in smaller peripheral
euro countries because the yields don’t compensate enough for
the risk,” according to Bosomworth. “We prefer Spain and
 Italy . There, we approach the markets carefully because an
uncontrolled insolvency in a different country could lead to a
strong increase of volatility.”  In addition, Pimco is “careful in the positioning at the
front end of the European interest-rate curve” as official
borrowing costs will rise further, he said.  While no single central bank can fight commodity price-
driven inflation by itself, a concerted effort may be able to
restrain costs, Bosomworth wrote. The surge in raw-material
prices correlates “in an unsettling way” with quantitative
easing in the previous years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
