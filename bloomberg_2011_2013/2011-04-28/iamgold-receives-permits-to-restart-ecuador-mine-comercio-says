Iamgold Corp. (IMG) , a Toronto-based
mining company, received government approval from  Ecuador  to
restart operations at its Quimsacocha gold, silver and copper
mine in the southern part of the country, El Comercio reported.  Iamgold will wait until it has “more clarity” on how much
the government will ask the company to pay in mining royalties
before it restarts operations, the Quito-based  newspaper  said
today, citing a company statement.  Ecuador halted all mining operations in 2008 pending the
approval of a new mining law. The law was passed by the nation’s
congress in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
