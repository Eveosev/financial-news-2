Natural gas futures jumped to the
highest price in more than three months after a government
report showed a smaller-than-forecast stockpile increase.  Gas rose for the first time in four days after the Energy
Department said inventories increased 31 billion cubic feet in
the week ended April 22 to 1.685 trillion. Analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg showed a gain of 38 billion. A separate
survey of Bloomberg users showed an increase of 37 billion.  “This is a quite bullish number for this time of the year
and it’s mostly because of the hot weather in the South,” said
 James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy
research firm in  London , Arkansas. “We are getting in a range
where supply and demand are more balanced.”  Natural gas for June delivery advanced 16.3 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $4.571 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement price for a
front-month contract since Jan. 24. The percentage gain is the
biggest since March 25. Prices have risen 4.2 percent this
month.  The five-year average inventory change for the week is an
increase of 65 billion cubic feet, department data showed.
Stockpiles were 0.6 percent below the five-year average, the
first deficit since the week ended Feb. 25.  Stockpiles were 11 percent below levels a year earlier, the
widest year-on-year deficit since Aug. 8, 2008.  Southern Heat  Last week’s hot weather in the South and cold weather in
the North increased demand for gas for heating and power
generation, according to Carl Neill, an energy consultant at
Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.  The weather will be moderating next week, with below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. East, Midwest and South from May 3 to
May 7, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  The high in New York on May 6 will be 59 degrees Fahrenheit
(15 Celsius), 8 below normal for the day, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Dallas  will have a high of 73 degrees on May 3, 8 degrees
below normal. The city had a high of 87 degrees on April 24.  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department. Residential consumers
account for about 20 percent.  A drop in nuclear power after severe storms in the South
may boost demand for natural gas-powered electricity, Williams
said.  U.S. nuclear-power output fell to the lowest level in more
than 10 years after the storms, according to a report today from
the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  and data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nuclear Power  Nuclear power generation nationwide decreased 2,605
megawatts, or 3.6 percent, from yesterday to 70,283 megawatts,
or 69 percent of capacity, the lowest level since Oct. 26, 2000,
according to the NRC report and Bloomberg data. Twenty-nine of
the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  The  Tennessee Valley Authority  shut all three reactors at
Browns Ferry, located 84 miles (135 kilometers) north of
Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee border, after
thunderstorms and high winds damaged offsite power supplies, the
NRC said.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
378,656 as of 3:01 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 315,000. Volume was 159,107 yesterday. Open interest was
927,600 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
924,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
