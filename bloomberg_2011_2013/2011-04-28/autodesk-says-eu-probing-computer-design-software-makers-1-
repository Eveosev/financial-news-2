Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) , the biggest maker of
engineering-design software, said European Union antitrust
regulators are investigating producers of computer-aided design
software.  “We are aware that the commission is reviewing the CAD
industry and we’ll certainly provide anything the commission
requests,” Greg Eden, a spokesman for the San Rafael,
California-based company, said today in a telephone interview.  Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the European Commission in
Brussels, declined to comment.  Autodesk, the developer of software used in bridge design
and the special effects in the movie “Avatar,” generated
revenue of $1.95 billion in the year ended Jan. 31.  Competition among technology companies is “particularly
important because the dynamism in this industry is an asset for
the whole economy,” the EU’s antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia,
said in November.  The EU’s executive last year started investigating
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  after
receiving complaints from smaller rivals.  Investigations under former EU antitrust commissioner
Neelie Kroes resulted in 1.68 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in
fines against  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and a record 1.06 billion-euro
penalty against  Intel Corp. (INTC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
