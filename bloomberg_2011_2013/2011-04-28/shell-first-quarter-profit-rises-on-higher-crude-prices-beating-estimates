Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest oil company, said profit rose 30 percent in the first
quarter as crude prices gained and refining earnings doubled.  Excluding one-time items and inventory changes, Shell
earned $6.3 billion compared with $4.8 billion a year earlier.
Analysts expected $6.2 billion, according to the mean of nine
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Production slipped 3 percent to
3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day and was in line with
last year’s output once asset sales are excluded.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  aims to bolster output
to 3.7 million barrels a day by 2014 on projects such as the
 Pearl gas-to-liquids  and  Qatargas 4  liquefied natural-gas
ventures in the Middle East. Last month, he pledged a further $1
billion in cost cuts after weaker margins caused earnings to
miss analyst estimates at the end of 2010.  “Shell has delivered a top-end set of first-quarter
figures,” said Lucy Haskins, an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
London.  Shell’s Class A shares rose 0.6 percent in London to close
at a record 2,322.5 pence at 4:30 p.m. local time.  Net Income Gains  Shell’s net income rose 60 percent to $8.78 billion, or
$1.42 a share, from $5.48 billion, or 89 cents, in the year-
earlier period. Revenue increased to $109.9 billion from $86
billion a year ago.  BP Plc (BP/)  said yesterday adjusted profit fell 4 percent on
lower output after the sale of more than $24 billion in assets
to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico  oil spill .  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
the world’s biggest company, reports earnings later today.  Brent oil averaged $105.52 a barrel in the first quarter,
36 percent more than the year-earlier period. Shell’s adjusted
refining profit rose to $1.65 billion from $778 million last
year because of higher utilization rates at some of its plants.  Shell reversed a seven-year drop in production last year
after starting projects in  Brazil ,  Nigeria ,  Canada  and the Gulf
of Mexico. The company plans to invest $100 billion in projects
in four years through 2014 to maintain output growth through the
end of the decade. Start-ups contributed to 230,000 barrels a
day of output in the first quarter, the company said today.  “We continue to make good progress in implementing our
strategy, improving near-team performance, delivering a new wave
of production growth and maturing the next generation of growth
options for shareholders,” Voser said in a statement.  Pearl GTL, Qatargas 4  Shell will start  Pearl gas-to-liquids  and  Qatargas 4 , two
of 20 new projects that it expects to add 800,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day to production by 2012. LNG volumes rose 4
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  “Shell is getting their main capital projects ramping
up,” said  Jason Gammel , an analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd. in
 London . “It’s all execution for them now. We’re looking for a
couple of good earnings quarters to drive the stock price.”  Shell sold $3.2 billion of assets in the quarter, including
gas fields in Texas as well as producing fields in Canada,
Pakistan and the U.K.  Refining margins improved to $11.02 a barrel in the first
quarter from $9.98 in the last three months of 2010, according
to BP’s refining marker margin published on April 14. Shell said
that refinery availability improved to 92 percent in the first
quarter from 89 percent a year earlier.  BP expects production to fall 11 percent to about 3.4
million barrels a day of oil equivalent this year, partly after
delaying projects in Alaska and the  Gulf of Mexico  following the
worst oil spill in U.S. history.  Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said the company
had lost between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels a day of production
in the first quarter because of the Gulf of Mexico drilling
moratorium imposed after the spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
