Iraq’s President Jalal Talabani is
scheduled to visit Tehran next month to hold meetings with top
Iranian officials and to attend an anti-terrorism conference,
the state-run  Fars  news agency reported, without citing anyone.  Talabani will attend the two-day International Conference
on Campaign Against Terrorism that’s being held in the Iranian
capital on May 14 and 15, Fars said. He will also discuss
“mutual cooperation” between the two countries, according to
the report, which was published late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
