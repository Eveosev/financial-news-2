Africa Israel USA, billionaire Lev Leviev’s U.S. real estate unit, sold the top floors of the
former New York Times building in midtown  Manhattan  to
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  for $160 million.  The fifth through 16th floors of the property, at 229 West
43rd St., were sold as an office condominium, New York-based
Africa Israel USA said in a statement today.  The company had been seeking a buyer since July 2010 for
the space, which was initially marketed for a luxury hotel or
residential condominiums. A rebounding office market made the
340,000 square feet (3,200 square meters) attractive to non-
hotel investors, Tamir Kazaz, chief executive officer, said in
an interview.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm, “gave
us an offer that we could not refuse,” Kazaz said. “Their
offer financially was better than any offers we had on the
table. Also, we felt very strongly that Blackstone is capable of
closing quickly.”  Kazaz estimated the deal, which also includes a portion of
the fourth floor, could be completed within six weeks.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone,
declined to comment.  The New York Times had its headquarters in the property
from 1913 through 2007, when it moved to a new  office tower  on
Eighth Avenue. The newspaper company sold the 43rd Street
building to Tishman Speyer Properties LP for $175 million in
2004, and Africa Israel paid $525 million for it in April 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
