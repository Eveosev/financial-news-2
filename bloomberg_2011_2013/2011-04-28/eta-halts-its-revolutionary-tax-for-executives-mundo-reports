Basque terror group ETA has stopped
demanding that business executives in the Basque Country and
Navarra regions pay a so-called revolutionary tax,  El Mundo 
said, citing the businesses associations there.  The business associations from Navarra, CEN, and the Basque
Country, Confebask, confirmed they had received a letter from
ETA saying it was ending the revolutionary tax as a consequence
of the cease fire announced in January, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
