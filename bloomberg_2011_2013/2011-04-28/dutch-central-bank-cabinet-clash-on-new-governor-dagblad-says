Lex Hoogduin, the Dutch Central
Bank’s favorite candidate to succeed Nout Wellink as president,
may lack support of the government, Het Financieele Dagblad
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  and Finance Minister Jan Kees de
Jager don’t automatically want the bank’s favorite to succeed
Wellink and are considering candidates from outside of the bank,
the Dutch newspaper cited the people.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
