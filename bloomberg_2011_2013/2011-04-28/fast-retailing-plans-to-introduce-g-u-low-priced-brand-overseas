Fast Retailing Co. plans to
introduce its low-priced g.u. brand outside  Japan  as  Asia ’s
biggest clothing chain seeks to expand international sales.  “We want to offer our g.u. brand overseas,” Osamu Yunoki,
president of the company’s GOV Retailing Co. unit, told
reporters today in Tokyo. The clothing chain may target emerging
markets, he said.  Fast Retailing will open a flagship store for its  g.u.  line
in Tokyo tomorrow as the Yamaguchi, Japan-based retailer aims to
reduce reliance on its main Uniqlo brand, which makes up more
than 80 percent of the company’s sales. The g.u. brand features
T-shirts that sell for 490 yen ($6) and jeans for 990 yen.  The company plans to add about 50 g.u. outlets a year to
reach a target of 200 stores with annual sales of 50 billion yen
by August 2013, Chief Executive Officer  Tadashi Yanai  has said.  The Tokyo store opening was delayed after the March 11
record earthquake in Japan, which left about 26,000 people dead
or missing. Fast Retailing also owns the Theory, Comptoir Des
Cotonniers and Princesse tam.tam brands.  Inditex SA, the world’s largest clothing retailer, also
postponed opening its first Bershka store in Japan to this
month.  Fast Retailing rose 1.4 percent to 12,710 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 0.7
percent since March 10, the day before the earthquake, compared
with a 5.6 percent drop in Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
