Estonian Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  said the central bank’s supervisory board improperly
treated Deputy Governors Marten Ross and Rein Minka when it
rejected a bid to extend their terms this week.  “This isn’t proper behavior,” Ansip said at a news
conference today in Tallinn, the capital. “One could say
politely that the board wants new blood and new ideas. The way
it happened, to find out ‘we’re short of votes in favor,’
doesn’t fit with the contribution from these men.”  Eesti Pank’s supervisory board on Tuesday rejected both
candidates, who had been nominated by Governor  Andres Lipstok ,
in a secret vote that wasn’t unanimous, the central bank said
yesterday. Chairman Jaan Mannik said yesterday he would prefer
nominees with “significant international experience.”  Ross was “instrumental” in helping  Estonia  meet the
qualifications for joining the euro on Jan. 1, Ansip said.
Minka, in charge of coordinating the transition to the euro from
the kroon, was responsible for a flawless changeover, he added.  Lipstok became a voting member of the European Central Bank
council when Estonia adopted the euro. His term ends in June
2012. Ross and Minka have served as deputy governors since 2000
and joined the central bank in 1992, shortly after Estonia
regained its independence from the  Soviet Union .  To contact the reporters on this story:
