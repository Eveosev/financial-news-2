Sugar-cane crushing in  Brazil ’s
Center South, the country’s main producing region, started in
almost 60 percent of the mills, according to researcher and
broker  Kingsman SA .  The remaining facilities should start operations by mid-
May, the Lausanne, Switzerland-based brokerage said in an e-
mailed report today. Industry group  Unica  said on April 20 that
crushing was under way in 40 percent of the Center South’s 335
mills.  Brazil will crush 568.5 million metric tons of cane this
year, up 2.1 percent from the previous harvest, Unica estimated.  Favorable weather over the past few days and the increasing
number of mills in operation should help increase ethanol
availability soon, Kingsman said. A shortage of the biofuel in
the South American country has led millers to prioritize ethanol
production over sugar.  Research firm Datagro yesterday cut its estimate for the
amount of cane to be used for making sugar to 46.2 percent from
47 percent. The remainder is used to make ethanol.  Datagro left its estimate for sugar output in Center South
for the current harvest little changed at 35.15 million tons,
against the prior 35.1 million tons. Ethanol output will come to
25 billion liters (6.6 billion gallons), up from February’s
estimate of 24.2 billion liters, it said.  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery fell $5.80, or
0.9 percent, to $620.70 a ton by 10:38 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London , the lowest since April 19. Raw sugar for July delivery
slid 0.24 cent, or 1 percent, to 22.72 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
