Byron Trott’s BDT Capital Partners
LLC agreed to help provide $110 million to a Texas energy
investment firm run by Bobby Tudor, a former colleague at
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   BDT, founded by Trott in 2009 and based in Chicago, teamed
with former  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  Chief Executive Officer Claiborne Deming to buy debentures in Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., TPH
said today in a statement. Some of the debt is convertible into
a minority equity stake, the firm said.  Tudor is chairman and CEO of Houston-based  TPH , a broker-
dealer and investment bank he formed in 2007 that provides
advisory and underwriting services in the energy industry. Tudor
had been a partner at New York-based Goldman Sachs, where Trott,
a vice chairman, arranged some of the biggest purchases by
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Chairman Warren Buffett, including the
$4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings Inc. in 2008.  “The experience and quality of our partners in this
transaction are as important as the capital they provide,”
Tudor said in the statement. Deming is an immediate past
chairman of the National Petroleum Council who will serve on
TPH’s board, according to the statement.  BDT oversees $2 billion and specializes in closely held
companies, acquiring a majority stake in grill-maker  Weber-
Stephen Products Co.  in December. Terms weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
