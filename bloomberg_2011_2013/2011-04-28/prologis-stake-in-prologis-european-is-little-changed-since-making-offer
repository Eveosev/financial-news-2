ProLogis (PLD) , the world’s largest
investor in warehouses, failed to increase its stake in  ProLogis
European Properties (PEPR)  after making a bid for the fund last week.  Prologis has received for tender or purchased in the open
market 8,818 ordinary units in the Luxembourg-based fund known
as PEPR, according to a statement yesterday. That would bring
its stake to 39 percent. At the time of the bid, on April 22,
ProLogis owned 38.9 percent of the units.  ProLogis offered 6.10 euros for each ordinary unit of PEPR,
valuing the fund at 1.2 billion euros ($1.8 billion). Denver-
based ProLogis made the bid on April 22, after rejecting an
approach for PEPR from APG Algemene Pensioen Groep NV and
 Goodman Group . PEPR is  Europe ’s biggest warehouse operator.  “It makes sense for investors to wait until PEPR’s
independent board members present their opinion, which should
only be a matter of days,” Jean-Yves Devloo, an Amsterdam-based
analyst at ING Groep NV, said by telephone. “That’s one of the
few things that could lead to a revised bid.”  ProLogis, PEPR’s largest shareholder, also offered 6.10
euros for each convertible preferred unit. Under takeover rules
in  Luxembourg , ProLogis had to make a bid for all of the units
after its stake exceeded a 33.33 percent threshold.  PEPR is reviewing the offer and will come with a “reasoned
opinion on that in as short a timeframe as possible,” Chief
Executive Officer Peter Cassells said yesterday.  Fir Tree Partners, a New York-based investment firm that
owns 4.3 percent of ProLogis European, said on April 27 that
ProLogis’s tender offer undervalues the closed-end real estate
fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
