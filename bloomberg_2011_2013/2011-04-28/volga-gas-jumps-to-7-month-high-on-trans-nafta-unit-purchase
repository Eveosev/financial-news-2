Volga Gas Plc (VGAS)  climbed to a seven-
month high after the company agreed to buy Trans Nafta’s
Gazneftedobycha unit, resolving a dispute between the two energy
companies.  The shares jumped as much as 14.3 percent and traded up
11.2 percent at $144 by 12:41 p.m. in London, their strongest
level since Sept. 22.  Volga Gas, a London-listed oil and gas explorer focused on
 Russia , agreed to buy the gas-processing unit for 30 million
rubles ($1.1 million), according to a regulatory filing today.
The agreement resolves a dispute over ownership and upgrades to
the unit, opening the way for production at Russia’s Vostochny
Makarovskoye field to start by the beginning of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
