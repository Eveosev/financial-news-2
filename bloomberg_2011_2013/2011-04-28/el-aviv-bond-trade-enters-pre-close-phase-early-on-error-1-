Tel Aviv bond trading entered the
pre-closing phase early today due to a technical problem, the
stock exchange said.  “The closing auction will take place as usual randomly
between 4:23 p.m. and 4:28 p.m.,” the bourse said in a
 statement posted on its website .  “Traders can place sell and buy orders but no actual
execution will be done until the closing auction,” Gil Chen,
head of the fixed-income desk at IBI-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
