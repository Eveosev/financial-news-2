Preem AB,  Sweden ’s largest refiner,
started cracking units at its Lysekil plant following a halt for
maintenance and inspections.  Preem started a catalytic cracker yesterday, the Stockholm-
based company said today in a statement on its  website . A mild-
hydrocracker resumed operations on April 21 after a catalyst
replacement, according to the release.  The company said March 28 that it would halt the catalytic
cracker on the following day for regulatory inspections. The
hydrocracker was idled on April 3. Catalytic crackers are used
in gasoline production. Mild hydrocrackers convert heavy gasoil
to produce mainly diesel.  The refinery on Sweden’s west coast can process about
220,000 barrels of crude a day. A major maintenance turnaround
is scheduled for the third quarter of 2013, Preem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
