Hopewell Highway Infrastructure
Ltd. (737) , controlled by  Hong Kong  billionaire Gordon Wu, will sell
its second yuan-denominated bond in Hong Kong as credit
conditions tighten in  China .  The company hired Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. for the
sale, and the proceeds will be used to develop its Western Delta
Route project and fund new investments, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  The operator of expressways in China’s Pearl River Delta
sold 1.38 billion yuan ($212 million) of bonds with a coupon of
2.98 percent in July 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, the first sale by a non-bank Hong Kong company.
China’s central bank this month raised the amount of deposits
lenders must set aside to the highest in at least two decades.  “In light of the tightening of the credit market” in
China, the sale will broaden the financing sources of the
company’s joint venture in the nation, Managing Director Thomas
Wu said in the statement.  The company hasn’t determined the fund-raising size, said
Sukyi Yau, a public-relations representative at  APCO Worldwide ,
which was hired by Hopewell Highway.  Sales of yuan-denominated bonds totaled 33.2 billion yuan
this year, compared with 25 billion yuan in the last three
months of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
