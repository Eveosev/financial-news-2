Ecuador’s Economic Policy Minister
Katiuska King said the government’s proposed securities exchange
law is ready to be debated by lawmakers.  King, speaking at an event in  Quito  today, said the
government plans to submit the legislation to congress before
the end of June. The bill, which has been delayed at least twice
this year, was originally scheduled for presentation to
lawmakers in February.  Ecuador’s government says securities rules need to be
rewritten to bolster investor confidence and increase trading,
as well as ease potential integration with regional bourses. The
proposed law has sparked concern that regulators plan to
restrict some corporate bond sales, reducing access to credit,
Monica Villagomez, executive president of the Bolsa de Valores
de Quito, said in an April 14 interview.  “This proposal has been widely discussed in public and is
now ready to be debated in the assembly,” King said. The law
“will give space for an alternative to financial markets and
will generate more and better guarantees” for investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
