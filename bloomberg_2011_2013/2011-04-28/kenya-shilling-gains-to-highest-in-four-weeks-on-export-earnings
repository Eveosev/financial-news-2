Kenya ’s shilling appreciated to the
strongest level in four weeks against the dollar as coffee
climbed to a 14 year high boosting export earnings.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy gained 0.4
percent to 83.36 per dollar at 5:13 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, the highest since April 1. It closed at 83.65
yesterday. Arabica coffee rose 1.5 percent to $3.009 a pound at
10:13 a.m. in New York, and earlier reached $3.034, the highest
level since May 1997.  “We have been receiving good inflows from agriculture,”
Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said
in a phone interview today. “The shilling is rising on the back
of these inflows” as companies receive payments in foreign
currency and buy supplies in local funds.  Kenya, east  Africa ’s biggest economy, is the world’s
biggest grower of black tea and Europe’s largest source of cut
flowers. Agriculture accounts for 25 percent of Kenya’s gross
domestic product, with tea, coffee and horticulture being its
main source of foreign exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
