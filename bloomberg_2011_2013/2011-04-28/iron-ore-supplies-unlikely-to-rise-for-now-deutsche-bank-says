Seaborne supplies of  iron ore  are
unlikely to rise for now even after  India ’s Karnataka state
lifted a ban on exports of the steelmaking ingredient, Deutsche
Bank AG said.  India is the world’s third-largest iron-ore exporter, and
Karnataka shipped about 20 million metric tons of the commodity
last year. The state barred overseas sales in July to boost
supplies to local steelmakers. Outbound sales could resume as of
April 20, India’s top court ruled this month.  “There will not be significant increase in export volumes
from India and with monsoon period looming next month, spot
market will likely remain tight for next couple of months at
least,” Thomas Baldwin, an iron-ore, freight and steel trader
with Deutsche Bank in  London , said in a note yesterday.  Shipments can be disrupted by India’s June-to-September
monsoon season, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the
country’s annual rainfall. The price of Indian iron ore shipped
to the Chinese port of Qingdao has risen 6 percent in the past
year.  China  is the world’s biggest iron-ore consumer and
accounted for 46 percent of global crude steel output in March,
according to the World Steel Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
