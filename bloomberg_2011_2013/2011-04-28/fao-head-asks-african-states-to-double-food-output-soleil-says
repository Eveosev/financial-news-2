Global  food production  needs to
rise 70 percent by 2050 to feed a projected population of nine
billion people, said the director-general of the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization, Jacques Diouf, Senegal’s le
Soleil reported.  Developing nations will have to double their agricultural
output by the century’s mid-point, Diouf said in a speech in the
Senegalese town of Saint Louis, according to the Dakar-based
newspaper.  The percentage of foreign development aid devoted to
agriculture has fallen to 5 percent, from 19 percent in 1980, le
Soleil reported, citing Diouf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
