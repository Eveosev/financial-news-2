Japan ’s 10-year bonds rose for a
third week after a report showed industrial production fell by a
record, demonstrating the effect of last month’s deadly
earthquake and tsunami on the nation’s economy.  Ten-year yields reached the lowest level in five weeks on
speculation evidence the economy is weakening will prompt the
Bank of Japan to keep interest rates near zero and maintain
asset purchases to spur growth. Demand for bonds increased as
the bank cut its gross domestic product growth forecast for the
year ending March 2012 to 0.6 percent from 1.6 percent yesterday.  “The economic data were really bad, which is supportive of
bonds,” said Jun Fukashiro, a  money manager  who helps oversee
about $16.6 billion at Toyota Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo .
“The BOJ is likely to maintain its comprehensive monetary
easing for a long time.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 fell one
basis point to 1.2 percent this week at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The yield was the
lowest since March 24. The price gained 0.086 yen to 100.881. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery rose 0.30 to 140.05
this week at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The contracts reached
140.08 yesterday, the highest since March 17. Japan’s markets
are closed for a public holiday today.  Factory Output  Japan’s factory output fell 15.3 percent in March from
February, the biggest drop since data began in 1953, and
household spending sank 8.5 percent from a year earlier,
government reports showed yesterday.  The data “make it difficult to sell bonds,” said Shinichi Horikawa, who helps to manage the equivalent of $12.2 billion at
Mitsui Sumitomo Kirameki Life Insurance Co. “The earthquake’s
impact is very big, and I’d like to see more data to gauge the
whole effect.”  The central bank maintained a 30 trillion yen ($368
billion) credit program and a 10-trillion yen asset-purchase
fund, while keeping the benchmark interest rate at a range of
zero to 0.1 percent yesterday.  The  Bank of Japan  has injected a record amount of cash in
the money market and doubled its asset-purchase program since
the March 11 earthquake that has killed or left missing almost
26,000 people. Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  last week unveiled a 4
trillion yen spending package for relief efforts and indicated
that tax increases may be needed to fund stimulus.  Japan’s sovereign-rating outlook was cut on April 27 to
“negative” by  Standard & Poor’s  which said the nation’s
reconstruction needs will likely add to what’s already the
world’s biggest debt load.  To contact the reporter on this story:
