Malawi plans to increase production
of paprika, a spice made from dried red peppers, to about 75,000
metric tons this year as prices rise, the Guardian reported,
citing the Paprika Association of Malawi.  The spice is currently selling for about 250 kwacha ($1.66)
a kilogram (2.2 pounds), up from 200 kwacha last year, largely
because of low supplies, the Lilongwe-based newspaper said,
citing Lawrence Chikhasu, the associationâ€™s president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
