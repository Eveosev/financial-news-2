Shareholders in  Global Investment
House KSCC (GLOBAL) , Kuwait’s biggest investment bank, approved today
cancelling a plan to raise its capital by 100 million dinars
($364 million).  “This is merely a routine procedure since the resolution
automatically expires after a year if not implemented,”
Chairwoman and Managing Director Maha al-Ghunaim said at
Global’s shareholder meeting in  Kuwait City .  Shareholders in May last year approved increasing the
company’s capital to a total of 231.2 million dinars.  The capital wasn’t raised in time due to “circumstances in
the region, the crisis in the Middle East,” al-Ghunaim said.
“We decided to postpone it for another time,” she added.  Global, which is restructuring $1.73 billion of debt, had a
net loss of 73.2 million dinars in 2010, down from 148.8 million
dinars a year earlier.  In December 2009, Global agreed with its 53 creditors to
alter terms of debt payments. Global last year made $178.3
million principal repayments on its restructured bank debt.  Global shares rose 5.4 percent to 49 fils in Kuwait trading
today. The stock has fallen 5.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
