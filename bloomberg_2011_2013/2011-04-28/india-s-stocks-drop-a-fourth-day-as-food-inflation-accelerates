Indian stocks dropped for a fourth
day after food inflation accelerated to a three-week high,
adding pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the nation’s biggest developer, dropped to a one-
month low. An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products rose 8.76 percent in the week ended April 16 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a statement in  New
Delhi  today. The gain in the previous week was 8.74 percent.
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest household products maker,
declined 1 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
162.84, or 0.8 percent, to 19,285.85, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. Stocks also slid on
concern rising commodities prices will fuel inflation and hurt
company earnings. Metal and oil prices rallied after the  Federal
Reserve  renewed its pledge to stimulate U.S. economic growth
with low interest rates.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.9 percent to 5,783.80 and its May futures settled at
5,811. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.9 percent to 2,382.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
