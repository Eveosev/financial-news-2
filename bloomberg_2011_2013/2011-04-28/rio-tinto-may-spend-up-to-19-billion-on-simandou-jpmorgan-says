Rio Tinto  Group’s Simandou iron ore
project in Guinea may cost as much as $19 billion to develop,
based on the cost of BHP Billiton Ltd.’s comparable expansions
in Western Australia, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  “Assuming similar capital intensity as BHP’s recent
Pilbara investment which, given Simandou is greenfield in nature
may prove to be optimistic, implies $17 billion to $19
billion,” analysts led by Fraser Jamieson wrote in a report
dated yesterday.  The Simandou project in the west African nation will
require more than $10 billion of investment,  Sam Walsh , chief
executive officer of Rio’s iron-ore unit, said in a  statement  on
April 23. Rio said last month it had already spent $700 million
on the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
