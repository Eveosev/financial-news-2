(Corrects first paragraph and headline of story published
April 28 to show Lehman was marketing credit default swaps on
municipal securities.)  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  hired
Morgan Stanley to market a portfolio of credit default swaps on
municipal securities valued at as much as $675 million to
“monetize” the assets for creditors, the bankrupt securities
firm said.  The swaps, which are bets on the default of the bonds of 14
municipalities, were valued by Lehman’s special financing unit
at $375 million to $675 million between October 2009 and March
2011, and are insured by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., according to a
court filing yesterday.  Lehman Brothers Special Financing, the unit, holds the
securities as part of a swap agreement, the company said. The
municipal securities have a “notional” value of $8 billion,
making the swap agreement difficult to sell to a single
investor, it said.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will try to auction the portfolio to
investors, earning an unspecified percentage of the proceeds as
fees, Lehman said. It will be entitled to a minimum fee of $2.5
million if the transaction fails, it said.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
