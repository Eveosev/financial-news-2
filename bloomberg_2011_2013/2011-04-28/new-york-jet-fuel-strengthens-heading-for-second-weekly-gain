Jet fuel in  New York  strengthened,
heading for a second week of gains, as Colonial Pipeline Co.
froze nominations on the largest line linking U.S. Gulf Coast
refiners and East Coast markets.  The Colonial freeze covers Cycle 25 on gasoline and
distillate lines because of “a combination of nominations being
very high and impact from the tornadoes knocking out power and
reducing flow rates,”  Steve Baker , a spokesman for the
pipeline, said by e-mail. More than 200 people died in storms
that also caused power outages across the Southeast late
yesterday.  The premium for spot jet fuel in New York Harbor versus
heating oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose 1 cent to 17 cents a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg at 1:50 p.m. It was the strongest level since March
31. Prompt delivery fell 0.91 cent to $3.3843 a gallon.  Jet fuel inventories on the East Coast slipped 294,000
barrels to 9.59 million barrels last week, according to the
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
