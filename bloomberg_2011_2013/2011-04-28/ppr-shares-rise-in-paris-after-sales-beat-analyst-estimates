PPR (PP)  SA, owner of the Gucci fashion
brand, advanced in Paris trading after reporting first-quarter
sales that beat analysts’ estimates and saying it’s confident of
surpassing its 2010 financial performance.  The stock climbed as much as 2.2 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in more than a month, and traded at 120.80 euros,
a 2 percent advance, as of 9:20 a.m. in Paris. PPR has risen
16 percent in the past year, valuing the maker of $725 covered
gladiator sandals at 15.3 billion euros ($22.7 billion).  Revenue from continuing operations rose 9.1 percent to
3.71 billion euros, the Paris-based company said yesterday in a
statement after markets closed. The average estimate of four
analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for sales of 3.61 billion
euros. Excluding acquisitions and currency moves, luxury-goods
sales climbed 22 percent even as revenue from these products
declined 7 percent in  Japan , PPR said.  PPR’s luxury division is “the key highlight,”  Antoine Belge , an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc who rates PPR
“overweight,” wrote in a note after the release. He said the
results “back up our thesis that the Gucci brand will catch up
with best-in-class in 2011 and that  Bottega Veneta  and
Balenciaga would confirm their rising star status.”  Overall sales increased 24 percent at Gucci, PPR’s largest
luxury brand, and 38 percent at its Bottega Veneta leather goods
and clothing unit. The Balenciaga brand had “vigorous double-
digit sales growth,” PPR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
