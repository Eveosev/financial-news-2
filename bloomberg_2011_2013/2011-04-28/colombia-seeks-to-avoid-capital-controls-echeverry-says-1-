Colombia ’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the government will seek to avoid using
 capital controls  as a measure to ease gains in the peso.  Echeverry, who spoke during a breakfast in Bogota, said if
the government maintains a prudent fiscal policy it can avoid
using capital controls. Gains in the peso over recent weeks were
caused by a flow of dollars brought into the country by
companies making tax payments through April 25, Echeverry said.
Any decisions on the peso will be made after April, he said.  “As much as we can maintain an austere policy, we will
avoid imposing capital controls,” Echeverry said.  The peso’s 6.3 percent rally in the last month -- the
fourth-best performance against the dollar among 25 major
emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg -- has sparked
speculation the government will announce further measures this
week to curb the advance.  The central bank may announce at its monetary policy
meeting tomorrow that it will boost the amount or extend the
duration of its daily dollar purchases, according to analysts
including Daniel Lozano at Bogota-based brokerage Serfinco SA.  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 1,767.13 per  U.S.
dollar  -- its strongest level since July 2008 -- from 1,775.00
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
