Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, rose to its highest in a week
after saying its fleet size will double in four years.  The stock advanced for the second day, rising 0.7 percent,
or 25 cents, to 36 shillings at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi
today, its highest level since April 20.  Kenya Airways plans to expand its fleet to 60 planes within
the next four years, Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni told
reporters in Nairobi today.  “If they increase capacity in an orderly way to meet
demand in the market they are serving, then they will be doing
very well,” Eric Musau, an analyst with African Alliance
Securities Kenya Ltd., said by phone from the capital Nairobi
today. “Investors are also probably quite positive” on the
outlook for full-year earnings, he said.  First-half profit surged 63 percent from a year earlier as
sales increased, the company said Nov. 5. Kenya Airways is
expected to report a “strong” profit increase when the company
releases full-year results as early as next month, Musau said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
