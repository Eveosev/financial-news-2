Valero Energy Corp.â€™s Corpus
Christi refinery in  Texas  lost power and flared gases yesterday,
according to a filing with the National Response Center.  A transformer unit failure caused the  power outage , which
led to a release of gases at about 7:20 p.m. local time, the
filing showed. About 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of carbon
monoxide and 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide were released.  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substance in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  Bloomberg News could not immediately verify whether the
information in the filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
