Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it will
take charges of more than $600 million this year and next after
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  raised taxes on
North Sea oil profits.  Shell will set aside $150 million for the rest of this year
after a $60 million charge in the first quarter, Chief Financial
Officer Simon Henry said on a conference call with journalists
today. The tax change will cost about $400 million next year.  Osborne last month raised the levy on oil production profit
to 62 percent from 50 percent to pay for a  tax cut  on gasoline
for consumers. He also said he’s considering reducing tax relief
for dismantling operations, known as decommissioning. That would
cost Shell another $500 million in charges, Henry said.  “Tax in the North Sea is primarily a driver of investment
decisions,” Henry said. He declined to estimate how much less
Shell will invest in the region, saying they’re still
considering the matter.  BP Plc (BP/) , the second-biggest European oil company after
Shell, said yesterday it took at $683 million one-off deferred
tax adjustment in the first quarter because of the North Sea tax
increase. It will take an additional $400 million charge if tax
breaks on decommissioning are cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
