U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened
as the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and Brent widened for the third consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased 23 cents to $12.60 a barrel at 1:08 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 65 cents to
$14.50 a barrel at 12:26 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 50
cents to $15.25 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 20 cents to $6.85 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium strengthened 80 cents to $7.35.  Thunder Horse’s premium lost 30 cents to $10 a barrel over
WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 75 cents to $4.75
a barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount widened 3 cents to $3.20 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $10.55 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$15.60 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
