Corn futures fell the most in six
weeks after a government report showed that demand is easing for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  U.S. exporters sold 348,969 metric tons of corn in the week
ended April 21, down 43 percent from a week earlier and the
smallest in  six months , the Department of Agriculture said
today. Prices have doubled in the past year after adverse
weather limited the size of last year’s U.S. crop and demand
rose for  animal feed  and fuel.  “Export sales are showing a little bit of a slowdown in
demand for U.S. crops,” said Bill Gentry, a broker at Risk
Management Commodities Inc. in Lafayette,  Indiana . “We are
seeing some liquidation” of bets on higher prices, he said.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 26 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $7.3325 bushel at 10:57 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would be the biggest decline since
March 15. Yesterday, the most-active contract dropped 1.7
percent, the most in a week.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
