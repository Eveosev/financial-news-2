Sorouh Real Estate PJSC, Abu
Dhabi’s second-biggest property developer by market value, said
first-quarter profit fell 50 percent, missing analysts’
estimates, as rising development costs hurt margins.  Net income dropped to 64.3 million dirhams ($18 million),
or 2 fils a share, from 129.7 million dirhams, or 5 fils, a year
earlier, the company said in a  statement  today. The average
estimate of five analysts was for a profit of 187 million
dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sorouh’s cost of sales jumped 55 percent to 339.9 million
dirhams from a year earlier as the company’s focus shifted to
delivering completed properties rather than selling land to sub-
developers. Profit margins on land sales last year were about 65
percent to 70 percent, Chief Financial Officer Richard Amos said
today in an interview. The margin on completed projects is about
20 percent.  Sorouh delivered about 25 percent of its commercial space
in the Sun and Sky Towers to buyers and will start handing over
keys of residential units on May 3. The developer plans to
complete more than 3,500 housing units in the two years through
2012 and a similar amount in the following two years, Amos said
on April 17. The company receives a final payment from buyers
when properties are delivered.  Sorouh, which reached a record high 10.48 dirhams in March
2008, fell 4.7 percent to 1.41 dirhams as of 12:40 p.m. in  Abu
Dhabi  trading today. It has dropped 36 percent in the past year,
cutting the company’s market value to 3.7 billion dirhams.  ‘Exciting Pipeline’  “The business is in strong financial health and is well-
funded to continue to deliver an exciting project pipeline into
the market to meet the growing demand for quality units,”
Managing Director Abubaker Seddiq Al Khouri said in the
statement.  Sorouh had 43 million dirhams in recurring income from
leasing properties in the first quarter and the company forecast
that the amount would triple in the next two to five years. The
developer sold four new units during the quarter and leased 23
properties, mostly in the Sky and Sun Towers, Amos said.  Abu Dhabi, the capital of the  United Arab Emirates , has
suffered a 45 percent decline in property values since the
market peaked in mid-2008, forcing developers to write down
asset values. Sorouh has 2.35 billion dirhams of outstanding
debt due in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The developer has 965 million dirhams in cash and has 1
billion dirhams of undrawn credit lines available. Sorouh’s
total bank borrowings amount to 1.7 billion dirhams,
representing a debt-to-equity ratio of 27 percent, according to
the statement.  Revenue for the first quarter rose to 452 million dirhams,
from 430.7 million a year earlier as Sorouh completed sales of
units in the Sun and Sky Towers and Golf Garden, it said. Its
assets are valued at 6.3 billion dirhams, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
