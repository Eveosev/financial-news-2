The  New York Mets  may post a net
loss of as much as $70 million this year after losing $50
million in 2010, Fortune reports.  The Major League Baseball team’s debt is almost $625
million, about $200 million higher than previously believed,
Fortune said on its website, citing a potential minority
investor who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  About $100 million of the liability includes money still
owed to former players, including Bobby Bonilla, who last played
for the team in 1999 and is owed $1.2 million annually through
2035, Fortune said.  “We will neither confirm nor deny the confidential details
of any potential deals during the course of our ongoing
negotiations for a sale,” the team said in an e-mailed
statement.  The Mets’ owners, the Wilpon family, received a $25 million
loan from  Major League Baseball  in November and are trying to
sell a stake of between 25 percent and 49 percent in the team.
They’re seeking to retain control of the franchise while
covering losses and fighting a $1 billion lawsuit tied to the
 Ponzi scheme  created by Bernard L. Madoff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
