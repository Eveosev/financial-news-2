Unions at  Public Power Corp SA (PPC) ,
Greece’s biggest electricity producer, will hold rolling 48-hour
strikes next month if the government of Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  proceeds with plans to reduce its 51 percent stake.  “We don’t want power blackouts,” said Nikos Fotopoulos,
the president of the Genop union, to reporters in Athens today.
“But whenever there’s a strike in any sector there is always
disruptions.”  Greece’s government said on April 15 it will reduce its
holding in PPC next year to 34 percent as part of plans to raise
50 billion euros ($71.6 billion) by 2015 from state-asset sales
and reduce the country’s debt. The state will retain control of
the company. Laws on the state asset sales plans are due in
Parliament on May 15.  Fotopoulos said strikes would begin a week before the law
is introduced to parliament if the sale of  Public Power  is
included. The company’s employees “don’t trust” government
pledges it will retain control of management, he said, pointing
to a previous pledge to do the same at  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA. (HTO)  The government also plans to
reduce its 20 percent stake in Hellenic Telecom.  For Related News and Information:
