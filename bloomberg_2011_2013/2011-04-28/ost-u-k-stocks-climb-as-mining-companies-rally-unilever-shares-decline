projections.  The FTSE 100 rose less than 0.1 percent to 6,069.9 at the

their usual momentum, we’re set to see the agenda being
dominated by earnings news from a number of the banks.”  Standard Life jumped 3.2 percent to 226.1 pence after

demand for corporate pension products in the U.K. That beat the

up from 5 percent estimated in March.  The Dublin-based company, which owns ad agencies including
Young & Rubicam and  Ogilvy & Mather , reported a 7 percent gain

estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  International Power Plc (IPR)  rallied 3.3 percent to 330.6 pence
after the U.K.-based utility said first-quarter sales rose 9
percent from a year earlier to 4.05 billion euros ($6 billion).  Unilever dropped 2.4 percent to 1,942 pence after the
world’s second-biggest consumer-goods company reported first-
quarter sales that missed estimates and said profitability will
drop in the first half.  Underlying sales growth, which excludes the effect of
acquisitions, disposals and currency fluctuations, was 4.3
percent. That missed the median estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News for a 4.4 percent gain.  AstraZeneca, Shire  AstraZeneca retreated 3.5 percent to 2,990 pence after

average analyst estimate.  Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering drug that was
AstraZenenca’s best-selling medicine last year, had revenue of

analyst projection of $1.53 billion.  Shire Plc (SHP)  lost 2.7 percent to 1,850 pence. The drugmaker
reported a 24 percent increase in first-quarter profit to $235.4
million as doctors prescribed more of the Vyvanse attention-

analyst forecast.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  dropped 3.3 percent to 1,680 pence even after
reporting a 12 percent increase in full-year revenue to 1.6
billion pounds ($2.7 billion). The pub company said in a

than that achieved in the fourth quarter of 2010/2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
