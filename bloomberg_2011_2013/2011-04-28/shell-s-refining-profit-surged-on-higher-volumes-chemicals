Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s profit from
refining in the first quarter surged 112 percent from a year
earlier because of higher utilization rates at some of its
plants amid rising prices for oil-products and chemicals.  Downstream earnings excluding identified items rose to
$1.65 billion compared with $778 million a year ago,  Europe ’s
largest oil company said today in a statement. Including
identified items, the earnings were 57 percent higher at $1.17
billion, said the company, which is based in  The Hague .  Earnings reflected higher margins and “higher refinery
intake volumes, due to lower planned and unplanned maintenance
activities,” according to the statement. The volume of oil
processed by its refineries increased 1 percent to 3.03 million
barrels a day in the quarter, Shell said.  Yesterday, BP Plc reported its refining and marketing
profit, on a replacement cost basis, climbed to $2.08 billion
from $729 million in the same quarter of 2010 because it was
able to use cheaper West Texas Intermediate oil at some of its
refineries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
