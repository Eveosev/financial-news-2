German stocks climbed, sending the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  to the highest level in more than three
years, after unemployment dropped to a 19-year low and  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  reported better-than-estimated earnings.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s largest, jumped 4.8 percent, the
most in almost a year.  Merck KGaA (MRK)  advanced 3.6 percent after the
drugmaker posted a 78 percent increase in first-quarter profit.
 SAP AG (SAP)  slid 5.7 percent after earnings missed analysts’
projections.  The DAX rose 1 percent to 7,475.22 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in  Frankfurt , the highest since January 2008. The gauge has
soared 15 percent from this year’s low on March 16 as corporate
profits spurred speculation the global economic recovery is on
track. The broader HDAX Index gained 0.9 percent today.  “It’s fair to say on balance that earnings are stronger
than expected,”  Nick Nelson , a London-based equities strategist
at UBS AG said on Bloomberg Television. “We are seeing the
profit cycle mature, revenues are coming in strong but in some
cases, margins are coming under a little bit pressure.”  Stocks climbed after German unemployment fell below 3
million, increasing the likelihood that household spending will
boost economic growth. The number of people out of work dropped
a seasonally adjusted 37,000 to 2.97 million, the lowest level
since June 1992.  Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank rallied 4.8 percent to 43.79 euros. The bank
reported a 17 percent increase in first-quarter profit to 2.1
billion euros ($3.1 billion), beating the average analyst
estimate of 1.8 billion euros, on record earnings at the
consumer-banking and asset-management units.  Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause reiterated the bank
doesn’t need to raise more capital and is “sufficiently
capitalized” amid tougher regulations. He was speaking on a
conference call with analysts today.  Merck gained 3.6 percent to 71.55 euros after the company
reported a 78 percent jump in first-quarter profit to 341.1
million euros as last year’s acquisition of U.S. biotechnology
equipment supplier Millipore Corp. boosted sales.  Core earnings, excluding costs such as writedowns and
merger expenses, were 2.03 euros a share, beating the average
analyst estimate of 1.78 euros.  SAP slumped 5.7 percent to 43.09 euros, the biggest drop
since October 2009. The largest maker of business-management
software reported a smaller-than-expected increase in profit on
costs of last year’s acquisition of Sybase Inc.  First-quarter net income rose 4.1 percent to 403 million
euros, missing an average analyst projection of 496 million
euros. Operating profit based on non-IFRS accounting rules
gained 26 percent to 779 million euros, trailing the 833
million-euro estimate.  Hugo Boss AG (BOS)  preferred shares rallied 3.1 percent to 66.40
euros after the clothing designer reported first-quarter net
income of 81.9 million euros, beating the average estimate of
73.2 million euros in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
