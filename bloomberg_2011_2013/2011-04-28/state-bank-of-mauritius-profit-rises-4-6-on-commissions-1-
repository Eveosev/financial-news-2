State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the
Indian Ocean island nation’s second-largest lender by market
value, said profit in its third quarter through March increased
4.6 percent as fee and commission income surged.  Net income rose to 445.6 million rupees ($16.2 million)
from 426 million rupees a year earlier, the Port Louis-based
lender said in a statement published on the Stock Exchange of
Mauritius’s website today. Net fee and commission income leaped
47 percent to 241.3 million rupees.  “Domestic credit demand in Mauritius is expected to pick
up on the back of improved economic outlook, stronger corporate
earnings and improved business confidence,” the company said.
Still, interest margins will however remain under pressure due
to “persisting excess liquidity.”  Interest income climbed to 1.2 billion rupees in the third
quarter from 1.18 billion rupees the year earlier.  Nine-month profit increased 4.6 percent to 1.6 billion
rupees, while revenue was little changed at 3.64 billion rupees.  The company’s loan book grew 16 percent to 51.8 billion
rupees in the nine months through March, while deposits
increased 8.7 percent to 66.9 billion rupees.  State Bank  of Mauritius said it plans to expand its
international business with a focus on  India  as “prospects for
the economy and the banking sector continue to be bright.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
