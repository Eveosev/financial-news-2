Treasuries advanced, pushing 10-
year note yields to a one-month low, as U.S. growth slowed more
than forecast and unemployment claims unexpectedly rose a day
after the  Federal Reserve  said the economy is recovering at a
moderate pace.  U.S. government securities headed for their biggest monthly
gain since August as investors reduced bets that policy makers
will raise interest rates by early next year. The Treasury plans
to auction $29 billion of seven-year debt today in its third and
final note sale this week.  “Higher Treasury prices are being supported by GDP growth
slowing to within 2 percent and the claims numbers still high,
which adds fuel to the fire,” said  Thomas Tucci , head of U.S.
government bond trading at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit in New York, one of 20 primary dealers that trade
with the central bank.  Ten-year note yields dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.31 percent at 11:09 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They reached 3.30
percent, the least since March 23. The price of the 3.625
percent security due in February 2021 gained 3/8, or $3.75 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 19/32.  Yields on 30-year bonds fell three basis points to 4.42
percent. Earlier they rose two basis points to 4.48 percent
after the Fed raised its inflation estimate yesterday.  Seven-Year Auction  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 2.685 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.895 percent at the
previous sale of the securities on March 30. The offering is the
final of three note sales this week totaling $99 billion.  Investors bid for 2.79 times the amount offered last month,
versus an average of 2.89 for the past 10 auctions. Indirect
bidders, a category that includes foreign central banks, bought
49.4 percent of the securities, compared with an average of 50.8
percent at the past 10 offerings.  Gross domestic product rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate
from January through March after a 3.1 percent pace in the
fourth quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department said today in
 Washington . Economists projected 2 percent growth, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Government
spending  fell at a 5.2 percent annual pace, the biggest drop
since 1983.  Initial claims for  unemployment benefits  increased by
25,000 to 429,000 in the week ended April 23, the most since
late January, Labor Department data showed. Economists in
another Bloomberg survey forecast a drop to 395,000.  ‘Long Way’  “The claims number was very poor and has caught the
attention of the market,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “There was hope that we
would see genuine improvement on the jobs front, and it
underscores that we still have a long way to go.”  U.S. government securities have handed investors a 0.7
percent return this month, the most since August, and the first
gain since January, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data. An index of  government bonds  around the world gained 0.6
percent in the period, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
risen 2.3 percent.  The central bank decided yesterday to finish $600 billion
of Treasury purchases in June, as scheduled, and reiterated that
 interest rates  will likely stay low for an “extended period.”
The benchmark has been zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled in a press conference
he will maintain record monetary stimulus once large-scale bond
purchases end, while the need to contain inflation means further
easing is unlikely.  Rate Bets  The odds of a rate increase by March slipped to 43 percent
from 50 percent a week ago, futures contracts indicate.  The central bank announced in November it would buy
Treasuries to spur growth. The Fed is purchasing $5 billion to
$7 billion today of debt maturing from April 2015 to September
2016 under the program.  Volatility was at almost a 13-month low, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s Move index. The gauge, measuring
price swings based on over-the-counter options maturing in two
to 30 years, was at 79.20 yesterday, after declining on April 25
to 74.80, the lowest level since March 17, 2010.  Investors may demand higher yields when the central bank
stops buying, according to a report today by  Orlando Green , an
interest-rate strategist in  London  at Credit Agricole SA.  Concession Worry  “We are worried what kind of concession the market will
require at Treasury auctions,” Green wrote.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, widened to 2.60
percentage points, from 2.28 percentage points on Dec. 31. The
10-year average is 2.10 percent.  Treasury 10-year notes yield 0.62 percent after subtracting
consumer-price increases, the so-called real yield. The figure
was 0.61 percent on April 26, the least since 2008.  The Fed said its preferred gauge of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures price index minus food and energy, will
rise 1.3 percent to 1.6 percent this year, up from its earlier
estimate of 1 percent to 1.3 percent. The central bank’s
preferred level is 2 percent or a bit lower.  To contact the reporters on this story:
