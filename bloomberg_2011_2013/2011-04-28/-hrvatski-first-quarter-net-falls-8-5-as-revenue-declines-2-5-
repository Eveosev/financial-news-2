 T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d., the
Croatian unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said profit fell 8.5
percent in the first quarter as a recession and special
government tax cut revenue.  Net income fell to 351 million kuna ($70.85 million) from
384 million kuna a year earlier, the Zagreb-based company said
today in a Regulatory News Service statement. Revenue declined
2.5 percent to 1.89 billion kuna.  “Recession and special taxes continue to affect
business,” the company said, adding that revenue would have
been worse had it not grown multimedia and Internet services. A
7.9 percent growth in residential mobile and 4.5 percent growth
in business mobile services partly compensated for an overall
decline in the amount of voice calls placed.  Profit was also dented by a government-imposed levy of 6
percent on mobile-phone usage, the company said.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, fell 6.4 percent to 767 million kuna,
the company said. Shareholders will vote May 4 on a proposed
dividend of 22.76 kuna per share off 2010 earnings.  “The Croatian economy continued to be depressed with
unemployment increasing and falling disposable income. The
anticipated recovery has yet to materialize,” Ivica Mudrinic,
president of the Management Board and chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  The company, 51 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom, said it
kept its leading position in the three main markets for mobile,
fixed line and Internet services, which will “bear fruit once
the economic situation improves,” Mudrinic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
