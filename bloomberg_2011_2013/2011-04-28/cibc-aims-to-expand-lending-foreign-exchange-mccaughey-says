Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
plans to add more corporate lending products and pursue
opportunities in trading to expand its investment-banking
business, Chief Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey said.  “Our wholesale business is focused on maintaining its
leadership position in key activities such as mergers and
acquisitions, corporate lending, equity trading and debt capital
markets,” McCaughey, 55, told investors today in Winnipeg,
Manitoba at the company’s annual meeting.  Canada ’s fifth-biggest bank also seeks to “generate
further growth within our risk appetite” by expanding corporate
lending products and capabilities and “pursuing additional
opportunities in select areas of trading and sales, such as
foreign exchange,” McCaughey said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
