Asia gasoline’s premium to naphtha
climbed to the highest since November 2008. Total SA sold gasoil
cargoes in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline advanced 2.4 percent to $134.95 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gasoline’s
premium to naphtha climbed $1.10 to $15.20, the highest since
Nov. 18, 2008. A wider reforming margin signals that the profit
from making gasoline over naphtha is increasing.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  gained 1.7
percent to $1,096 a metric ton, Bloomberg data showed. The
premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the crack
spread, rose to $153.50 from $140.39 at the end of Asian trading
yesterday.  In Singapore, ConocoPhillips sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON
gasoline for loading May 13 to May 17 to Vitol Group at $135 a
barrel, traders said. Vitol sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON for
loading in the same period to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $139.70.  Cargill Inc. bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half
June delivery for a second day, paying Shell $1,099 a ton,
traders said.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose $1.75, or
1.3 percent, to $139.30 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.
Jet fuel gained $1.75, or 1.3 percent, to $140.85, the highest
level since April 11.  In  Singapore , Total sold three cargoes of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil at 10 cents a barrel above benchmark quotes, the
same premium it received yesterday, traders said. Hin Leong
Trading Pte bought two cargoes and Cargill purchased one cargo.
Vitol sold 150,000 barrels with 500 parts-per-million of sulfur
to Shell at plus $2.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude declined 18
cents to $19.56 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread is a
measure of refining profit.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after climbing
yesterday to $1.45 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade was at the
widest since March 15, indicating it’s more profitable to
produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  BP Plc bought its seventh jet-fuel cargo in Singapore this
week, again paying 20 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes,
traders said. Hin Leong was the seller.  Fuel Oil   Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose $7, or 1 percent, to
$687.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, climbed $7.25,
or 1.1 percent, to $677.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened for the third
day to $12.35 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. This means
refiners are making the biggest losses from turning oil into
residual products since Nov. 27, 2008.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade dropped for a third day to $10.75 a ton. The viscosity
spread is the narrowest since April 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
