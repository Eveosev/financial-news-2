The Dollar Index fell to its lowest
level in more than two years as the U.S. economy expanded in the
first quarter at a slower rate than forecast, encouraging the
 Federal Reserve  to keep borrowing costs low.  The yen appreciated versus all of its major counterparts
after a report showed Japanese investors sold foreign assets
last week.  Brazil ’s real was the biggest loser versus the dollar
after the central bank said it will increase borrowing costs at
a slower pace for a longer period than initially planned.  “The  U.S. dollar  looks very heavy, and people are looking
for reasons to sell it,” said Firas Askari, head currency
trader at Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “The momentum we did
seem to be having in the U.S. economy seems to be hitting some
headwinds, but the headwinds seem to be temporary. Best-case
scenario:  U.S. economy  is lukewarm.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, dropped 0.6 percent to 73.116 at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
from 73.519 yesterday, after touching 72.871, the lowest level
since July 2008.  The  New Zealand dollar  decreased for the first time in
three days versus its U.S. counterpart after  Reserve Bank 
Governor Alan Bollard called the currency’s recent advance
“unwelcome” and policy makers held the official cash rate at a
record low 2.5 percent. The kiwi dropped 0.7 percent to 80.25
U.S. cents after reaching 81.08 cents yesterday, the highest
level since March 2008.  Weaker Real  Brazil’s real slid as much as 1.9 percent to 1.5963 versus
the dollar as policy makers indicated that a “substantial”
part of their anti-inflationary effort has already been
implemented given the recent rate increases and measures to curb
credit. They boosted the Selic rate by a quarter-percentage
point to 12 percent on April 20.  The yen rallied as Japanese investors were net sellers of
foreign bonds during the week ended April 22. The total net sale
was 162.8 billion yen ($2 billion).  “The yen is firmer today because it now seems that there
is more of a potential for repatriation back into the economy,
which would drive up demand,” said  Mark McCormick , a currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “Over
the long term, the BOJ is going to continue to ease policy,
which will keep the yen soft and in this range of 81 to 83.”  The U.S. currency fell against the euro and yen after the
Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product rose at
a 1.8 percent annual pace in the first quarter after a 3.1
percent rate of expansion in the last three months of 2010. The
median forecast of 80 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 2 percent pace of growth.  Dollar Versus Euro  The dollar slid 0.2 percent to $1.4823 versus the euro,
compared with $1.4788, after touching $1.4882, the weakest level
since December 2009. The greenback slid 0.8 percent to 81.54
yen, from 82.16. The yen rose for the first time in five days
against the euro, climbing 0.5 percent to 120.83.  The Dollar Index fell for an eighth day in its longest
losing streak since March 2009 after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled yesterday in his first press conference
following a policy decision that the central bank will likely
continue reinvesting maturing debt after its $600 billion
program of bond buying expires in June.  The gauge may rebound as technical indicators suggest the
drop in the U.S. currency will be hard to sustain, according to
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  Technical Indicator  The Williams %R indicator for the measure was at minus
93.6359 on a weekly basis, exceeding the threshold of minus 80
that some traders see as a sign an asset’s price has fallen too
fast and may reverse course.  “With the Williams %R at almost 100, the drop in the
Dollar Index is close to its limit,” said Teppei Ino, an
analyst at Bank of Tokyo. “A rebound is expected.”  Williams %R, developed by the trader Larry Williams,
calculates the difference between a security’s most recent
closing price and its highest high price, relative to its price
range over a given time period.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Dollar Index
dropped to 23.51, the lowest level since Oct. 14 and below the
level of 30 that signals an asset may be due for a rebound.  The dollar has lost 4.6 percent in the past month,
extending this year’s decline to 7 percent, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track the
foreign exchange of 10 developed nations. The yen has fallen 3.4
percent in the past month and has lost 7.5 percent this year.  Australia ’s dollar appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to
$1.0948, the highest since the currency began trading freely in
1983, as traders boosted bets that the central bank will
increase borrowing costs.  A Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps indicated the
 Reserve Bank of Australia  will raise its 4.75 percent cash
target by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, over the
next 12 months, compared with the outlook for a boost of 19
basis points a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
