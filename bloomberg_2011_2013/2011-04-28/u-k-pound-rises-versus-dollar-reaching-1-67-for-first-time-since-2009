The pound advanced against the
dollar even as data showed U.K. consumer confidence fell to the
weakest level in two years, as the U.S. currency slumped.  Sterling snapped a four-day decline versus the euro. The
GfK NOP Ltd. index of sentiment dropped to minus 31 in April
from minus 28 in March, the London-based research group said
today.  The pound gained 0.5 percent to $1.6716 as of 6:44 a.m. in
 London , and traded at 88.84 pence per euro, from 88.94 pence
yesterday in  New York . The British currency was little changed
at 136.632 yen.  The U.K. Debt Management Office plans to auction 4.5
billion pounds of 28-, 90- and 181-day Treasury bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
