Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-
largest card-payment processor by market value, gained the most
in more than one year after it reported collecting higher fees
in the first quarter, easing concerns that increasing
competition would reduce profits.  Shares jumped 6 percent to 23.90 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since March
2010. Competitor Cielo SA climbed 5.4 percent to 14.70 reais.
The Bovespa index fell 0.9 percent to 65,673.21.  Retailers paid Redecard an average of 0.71 percent on each
debit-card transaction in the first-quarter, 0.01 percentage
point more than in the previous quarter, the company said in a
regulatory filing. The average fee charged on credit-card
payments declined to 1.13 percent from 1.18.  “Investors were expecting these figures to keep falling,
as competition gets tougher,” said Daniel Malheiros, an analyst
at Spinelli Corretora SA brokerage in  Sao Paulo . “But the
debit-card fees rose, and credit-card fees dropped less than in
the previous quarter. The market was pricing shares for a much
worse performance.”  Redecard reported net income of 281.3 million reais ($177.5
million) in the first quarter, a 20 percent decline from a year
before. The result was in line with the average estimate of
282.5 million reais among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
