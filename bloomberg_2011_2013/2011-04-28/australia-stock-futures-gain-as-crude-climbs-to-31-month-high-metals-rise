Australian  stock futures  rose after
the price of crude oil climbed to a 31-month high and better-
than-estimated corporate earnings in the U.S. tempered
investors’ concern over slowing global economic growth.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company
by sales, gained 0.6 percent in London trading yesterday as a
measure of primary metals gained 0.3 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the largest global miner, advanced 0.8 percent in London.
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas
producer, may advance on rising oil prices.  “On the whole, the news has been fairly good in terms of
companies beating expectations,” Melbourne-based  Tim Schroeders ,
of Pengana Capital Ltd., which manages about $1 billion. “At
this stage, people are not prepared to give up on the U.S., but
how much of the current earnings are sustainable is an open
question.”  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index futures contract due in June
gained 0.2 percent to 4,882 as of 6:59 a.m. in Sydney. New
Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  increased 0.3 percent today. Japanese
markets are closed for a public holiday.  Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1
percent. The gauge rose 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as
insurers Allstate Corp. and Aflac Inc. posted earnings that
topped estimates. Investors shrugged off a report that showed
the U..S. economy slowed more than forecast in the first quarter
as  government spending  declined by the most since 1983 and
household purchases cooled.  U.S. Growth  Gross domestic product rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate
from January through March after a 3.1 percent pace in the final
three months of 2010, the Commerce Department said yesterday in
Washington. Economists projected 2 percent growth, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Crude oil for June delivery settled at $112.86 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest closing price
since Sept. 22, 2008. Oil has risen 5.7 percent in April and is
poised for an eighth consecutive monthly advance, the longest
streak since the contract began trading in 1983. Futures have
gained 36 percent in the past year.  The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals gained 0.3
percent yesterday, advancing for the first time in three days
after the  Federal Reserve   signaled it will maintain monetary
stimulus, boosting the prospects for metals demand.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 8.2 percent by the S&P
500 and of 2.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.6 times estimated earnings
on average as of the last close, compared with 15.7 times for
the  S&P 500  and 13.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
