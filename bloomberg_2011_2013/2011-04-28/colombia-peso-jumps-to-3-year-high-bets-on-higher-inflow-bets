Colombia’s peso rose to its highest
level in almost three years amid speculation rising investment
flows into oil and mining will push further gains in the local
currency.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 1,766.05 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:19 p.m. New York time, from 1,775 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,764.51, its strongest since July 2008. The peso has
jumped 6.4 percent in the past month, the best performance among
six Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Speculation policy makers will announce currency measures
in the central bank’s April 29 monetary policy meeting led the
peso to decline as much as 0.5 percent earlier this week.  “Amid the continued trend for a weak dollar and increasing
foreign direct investment into Colombia, the sense is additional
currency measures won’t be enough” to stem gains in the peso,
Daniel Escobar, an analyst at brokerage Global Securities SA in
Bogota, said in a telephone interview.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.36 percent,
according to  Colombia ’s stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.041 centavo to 112.766 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
