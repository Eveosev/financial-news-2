Hong Kong  is raising the weighting
for food and housing in the consumer-price index basket to
reflect spending trends, a move that may pare the size of
overall year-on-year increases, the government said.  The weighting for housing rentals rises to 31.66 percent
from the previous 29.17 percent, while food increases to 27.45
percent from 26.94 percent, the statistics department said in a
 release  today.  Hong Kong will first issue figures using the revised basket
when reporting April inflation in May, said Lily Ou-yang, acting
commissioner for the Census and Statistics Department. Changes
are made every five years, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
