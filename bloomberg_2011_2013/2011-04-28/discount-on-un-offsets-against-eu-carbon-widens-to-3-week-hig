The discount of United Nations
emissions offsets for December widened to the highest level in
more than three weeks as demand waned ahead of a compliance
deadline in the European Union. German power rose.  The discount of UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December compared with EU carbon allowances, traded as a
separate contract on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London ,
widened 1.8 percent to 4.03 euros ($5.97) a metric ton as of
5:20 p.m., the highest level since April 6.  About 12,000 factories and power stations in the EU
program, the world’s biggest CO2 market, can use some cheaper
CERs to comply with the bloc’s climate-protection laws. Emitters
have previously been swapping more valuable EU allowances for
CERs ahead of the April 30 deadline for turning in permits,
narrowing the discount, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  The spread may widen because there will be less demand for
CERs after the deadline, New Energy Finance analysts including
Clemens Tummeltshammer, said in an e-mailed research note on
April 26.  German power for next year rose to its highest price in
almost three weeks as coal, natural gas and carbon prices
advanced, boosting the cost of generation. German forwards for
2012 advanced 1 percent to 59.30 euros ($87.83) a megawatt hour,
according to data from brokers compiled by Bloomberg.  EU carbon for December rose 0.6 percent to 17.21 euros a
ton as volumes almost tripled to 18 million tons from 6.7
million tons yesterday.  Northwest Europe coal for next year gained 1.3 percent,
according to broker prices. U.K. gas for the six months through
September next year increased 0.8 percent on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
