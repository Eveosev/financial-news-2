Tennessee Valley Authority  shut all
three Browns Ferry reactors in Alabama yesterday after severe
storms and tornadoes caused a brief  power outage  at the plant,
Barbara Martocci, a company spokeswoman, said.  The plant, which includes the three reactors, automatically
shut at 5:30 p.m. local time after losing the off-site power
supply, Martocci, who is based in Knoxville, Tennessee, said
today in a telephone interview.  “They are in safe shutdown mode and will stay shut down
until we can assess the damage in the area and determine where
the  power lines  are down and what we need to restore those lines
in order for anything we generate from Browns Ferry to go back
out to the public,” she said.  The plant automatically shut down and the emergency systems
came on as they were designed to do, Martocci said.  A series of lethal storms moved through the U.S. Southeast
killing at least 178 people in five states.  Alabama  was hardest-
hit, as high winds tore apart homes and businesses, the
 Associated Press  reported. About 300,000 people were without
power.  It may have been the deadliest single day for tornadoes in
the U.S. since April 3, 1974, when 310 people died, according to
AccuWeather Inc.  The Browns Ferry plant has a combined capacity of 3,284
megawatts, enough to power 2.6 million average U.S. homes,
according to U.S. Energy Department statistics. The plant is
located about 84 miles (135 kilometers) north of Birmingham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
