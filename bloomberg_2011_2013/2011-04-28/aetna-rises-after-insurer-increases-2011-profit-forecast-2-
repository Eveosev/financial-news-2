Aetna Inc. (AET) , the third-largest U.S.
health insurer, climbed the most in almost three months in New
York trading after raising its full-year forecast and reporting
first-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  Aetna gained $1.64, or 4.1 percent, to $41.45 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock is up 36
percent over the past 12 months, compared with a 14 percent rise
for the Standard & Poor’s Health Index. The Hartford,
Connecticut-based insurer forecast profit of $4.20 to $4.30 a
share for 2011, more than a previous outlook of as much as
$3.80.  First-quarter profit excluding one-time items of $1.43 a
share beat the 98-cent average estimate of analysts.
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the biggest insurer by sales, and
 WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the largest by enrollment, also beat estimates
and raised annual earnings projections this month on lower
payouts for members’ care as Americans worried about joblessness
avoided doctors. Aetna spent 81.8 percent of premium revenue on
treatment in the quarter, the first to reflect the impact of
federally mandated spending limits.  “The stock should see positive action,” Matthew Borsch,
an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a
note. Investors may not have expected Aetna to raise its
forecast as much as it did, according to Borsch.  Aetna also said today that it was acquiring New York-based
Prodigy Health Group for $600 million from Prodigy Health
Holdings, LLC, whose main shareholder is One Equity Partners,
LLC. Prodigy Health Group, a third-party administrator of mostly
self-funded plans, gives Aetna much-needed membership of 600,000
in the medical plans and 400,000 in the pharmacy plans, said  Ana Gupte , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York.
Aetna is the only insurer that has reported a decline in
enrollment for the first quarter.  Profit Rises  First-quarter net income rose 4.2 percent to $586 million,
or $1.50 a share, from $562.6 million, or $1.28, as medical
spending was less than expected and Aetna was able to pocket
reserves from the prior quarter. Revenue declined 2.7 percent to
$8.39 billion, the company said in the statement.  Under the health-care overhaul signed into law in 2010, the
ratio of medical spending required is 85 percent for employer-
sponsored plans or 80 percent for individual policy holders to
avoid paying rebates to customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
