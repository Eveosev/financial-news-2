The  New York Yankees  leaked account
information for about 17,000 season-ticket holders, the Major
League Baseball team said.  An employee “mistakenly attached an internal Yankees
spreadsheet” to correspondence to several hundred ticket
holders on April 25, the team said in a letter to account
holders, a copy of which was sent to Bloomberg.  Names, addresses, e-mail addresses and phone and fax
numbers were disseminated, along with seat numbers, Yankee
account numbers, account representative’s names and ticket
package codes.  “We are writing to inform you about an accidental
electronic distribution of information that you have previously
supplied to the New York Yankees,” the team said in the letter.  The spreadsheet didn’t include birth dates, social security
numbers, credit card data, banking data or other personal or
financial information, the team said.  The Yankees said they took action to ensure the mistake
would not be repeated.  The 17,000 accounts represent less than half of the season-
ticket holders, Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
