Egyptian corporate earnings
probably declined 7 percent in the first quarter compared with
the year-earlier period after a popular revolt toppled President
 Hosni Mubarak , investment bank CI Capital said.  The drop in aggregate net income of 36 companies for the
quarter would be the first after five quarters of growth, the
Cairo-based investment bank said in an e-mailed report
yesterday. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index has fallen 30
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
