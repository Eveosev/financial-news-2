Angola ’s  Gove dam  hydroelectric
plant in Huambo Province will begin generating power this year,
 Jornal de Angola  said, citing Energy Minister Emanuela Vieira
Lopes.  The rebuilt plant, damaged during Angola’s civil war, will
generate 60 megawatts of power, the Luanda-based newspaper said
on its website.  Gove dam, also known as Ngove, is about 120 kilometers (75
miles) south of Huambo city.  The dam was built  in 1975 and
damaged by sabotage in 1986 and 1990. Journal de Angola did not
say how much the rehabilitation cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
