The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 1 basis point to 104.5 basis
points as of 8:36 a.m. in Beijing, Credit Agricole CIB prices
show. The index is on track for its lowest close since April 21,
according to data compiled by CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell half a basis point to
123 basis points as of 9:41 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 103.5 basis points as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Credit Agricole prices. Thatâ€™s on track for the lowest closing
level since April 11, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editor: Hugh Chow  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
