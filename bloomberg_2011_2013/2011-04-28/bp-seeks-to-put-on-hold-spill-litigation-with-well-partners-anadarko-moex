BP Plc (BP/)  asked a federal judge to put
on hold its oil spill-related litigation with  Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC)  and Mitsui & Co.’s Moex Offshore unit, which were BP’s
minority partners in the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.  BP’s joint operating agreement with Anadarko and Moex,
signed before the April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig, requires the companies to first attempt to
resolve disputes by arbitration, BP lawyers said in filings
today in federal court in  New Orleans .  “Anadarko and MOEX’s claims against BP conflicts with
their promise to ‘not resort to court remedies’ -- particularly
where BP has already initiated the arbitration process,”
according to the filing.  Anadarko and Moex have refused to pay millions of dollars
in costs associated with the rig explosion and subsequent
offshore  oil spill , accusing BP of “gross negligence” in
operating the drilling rig. In court filings, they accuse BP of
violating the joint operating agreement.  David Balabanian, an attorney for Moex in San Francisco,
said he couldn’t comment on BP’s request today. “I cannot
comment because I have not seen the filing,” he said.  John Christiansen , an Anadarko spokesman, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment after regular business
hours.  The case is In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).  To contact the reporter on this story:
