The Dollar Index had its biggest
monthly decrease since September as a slowing U.S. economy
encouraged the  Federal Reserve  to maintain stimulus.  The Swiss franc and Australian dollar rallied to records
against the greenback amid signs of accelerating inflation. The
euro had a fifth monthly gain on speculation the  European
Central Bank  will increase borrowing costs further while Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week he was unsure
when U.S. monetary stimulus will end.  “We’ve seen softness in the dollar this month not only
because the Fed will keep monetary easing but the market is
growing increasingly concerned about the economy,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group
LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut . “The market might be starting to
see where Bernanke and the doves are coming from.”  The Dollar Index slid 0.1 percent to 73.044 at 5 p.m. in
 New York , from 73.121 yesterday, after earlier falling 0.4
percent to 72.834, the lowest level since July 2008. The
IntercontinentalExchange gauge, which tracks the dollar against
the currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, fell 3.7
percent in April, the biggest drop since sliding 5.4 percent in
September.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Dollar Index
fell to 23.26, the lowest since Oct. 14 and below the level of
30 that signals an asset may be due for a rebound.  Swiss Franc Rallies  The franc rallied against the dollar as Swiss National Bank
President Philipp Hildebrand said in Bern that  price stability 
may be threatened by higher commodity prices and expansionary
monetary policy.  Switzerland ’s leading economic indicator
unexpectedly increased in April, signaling the economy is
gaining momentum.  The Swiss currency climbed 1 percent to 86.52 centimes
versus the dollar after reaching a record 86.44. The currency
gained 5.6 percent this month against the dollar, the biggest
jump in 2011. The franc advanced 1 percent to 1.2813 versus the
euro, extending a 1.5 percent monthly gain.  “Comments from Hildebrand overnight about the upside risks
to inflation is supporting the Swiss; the market is looking to
buy Swiss in the event of an SNB move,” said Brian Kim, a
currency strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford , Connecticut. “Aussie
strength is reflective of this larger U.S. weakness, and people
are still using the dollar as a funding currency.”  Record Level  The Australian dollar had its biggest monthly gain this
year and reached a record as Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in a
radio interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp. that the
currency’s strength reflects the improving economy and higher
commodity prices.  The Aussie rose 0.4 percent to $1.0971, making its monthly
rally 6.2 percent. The currency earlier advanced to $1.0978, the
highest since being freely floated in 1983. It fetched 89.06
yen.  Consumer prices in  Australia  increased 1.6 percent last
quarter from the previous three months, the biggest jump since
2006, the Bureau of Statistics said April 27.  The dollar broke its losing streak against, rising 0.1
percent against the euro, to $1.4807 after depreciating as much
as 0.4 percent. It touched $1.4882 yesterday, the weakest level
since December 2009. The euro dropped 0.5 percent to 120.22 yen,
from 120.83, paring its monthly gain to 2.2 percent. The dollar
decreased 0.4 percent to 81.19 yen, from 81.54.  The euro had a 1.7 percent weekly rally versus the dollar
on speculation quicker growth in  Europe  will encourage the ECB
to keep raising  interest rates  even as nations such as Greece
and Ireland struggle to contain sovereign-debt turmoil.  Slowing U.S. Growth  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.8
percent in April, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today in an initial estimate.  U.S. economic growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual rate
last quarter from 3.1 percent in the prior three months, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday.  Bernanke signaled on April 27 in his first press conference
following a policy decision that the central bank will likely
continue reinvesting maturing debt after its $600 billion
program of bond buying expires in June as planned.  China ’s yuan strengthened beyond 6.5 per dollar for the
first time since 1993. The currency gained for a third day on
speculation the central bank will let its currency appreciate
faster to curb accelerating inflation.  Consumer prices in  Asia ’s biggest economy rose 5.4 percent
in March from a year earlier, the most since July 2008, the
government said on April 15.  The yuan rose 0.2 percent to 6.4921 per dollar after
appreciating to 6.4892, the strongest since the country unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
