Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
note yields to a one-month low, as U.S. growth slowed more than
forecast and unemployment claims unexpectedly increased a day
after the  Federal Reserve  said the economy is recovering at a
moderate pace.  Government bonds  pared gains after a U.S. auction of $29
billion in seven-year notes drew weaker-than-average demand,
with the Fed’s primary dealers buying the biggest share of the
securities in almost two years. Treasuries recovered most of the
lost ground by day’s end. Policy makers reiterated yesterday
interest rates will likely stay low for an “extended period.”  “Sellers have been discouraged by the fact that monetary
policy will remain exceedingly accommodative for longer than
anticipated,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.7
billion as chief investment officer at United Nations Federal
Credit Union in New York. “With the data relatively weak it is
keeping the market bid despite the weaker auction.”  Ten-year note yields dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.31 percent at 5:20 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They reached 3.30
percent, the least since March 23, before touching 3.34 percent
following the auction. The price of the 3.625 percent security
due in February 2021 increased 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face
amount, to 102 19/32.  Thirty-year bond yields were down four basis points at 4.41
percent, after touching 4.45 percent shortly after the auction.
Yields on current seven-year notes declined five basis points to
2.67 percent.  Seven-Year Auction  The notes sold today yielded 2.712 percent, compared with a
forecast of 2.698 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of
the 20 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt offered,
was 2.63, the lowest since November, versus a 2.89 average at
the past 10 sales.  Primary dealers, who are obligated to bid in Treasury debt
auctions, purchased 53 percent of the securities at today’s
sale, their biggest share of a seven-year note offering since
May 2009.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 39.1 percent of the notes, the lowest
level since May 2009. That compared with an average of 50.8
percent at the past 10 sales. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer
investors that place bids with the Treasury, bought 7.9 percent,
versus an average of 7.8 percent at the past 10 sales.  ‘Pretty Sloppy’  “It was a pretty sloppy auction,” said  Martin Mitchell ,
head government bond trader at the Baltimore unit of Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., a St. Louis-based brokerage firm. “Being one
auction, I don’t take too much away from it. Certainly it raises
some flags -- you don’t often see the demand that weak.”  The offering was the last of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. The U.S. sold $35 billion in two-year debt
on April 26 and $35 billion of five-year securities yesterday.  Treasuries returned 0.7 percent this month through
yesterday, the most since August and the first gain since
January, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has risen 2.4 percent in April.  Treasuries held in custody by the Fed rose for an eighth
consecutive week, reaching a record $2.68 trillion for the five
days ended April 27. The 0.5 percent increase was the biggest
since November.  GDP Growth Cools  U.S. debt  climbed earlier after Commerce Department data
showed gross domestic product rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate
from January through March after a 3.1 percent pace in the
fourth quarter of 2010. Economists projected 2 percent growth,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Government spending  fell at a 5.2 percent annual pace, the
biggest drop since 1983, the data showed. Household purchases,
which account for 70 percent of the economy, rose at a 2.7
percent pace, slowing from 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter.  Initial claims for  unemployment benefits  increased by
25,000 to 429,000 in the week ended April 23, the most since
late January, Labor Department data showed. Economists in
another Bloomberg survey forecast a drop to 395,000.  “Higher Treasury prices are being supported by GDP growth
slowing to within 2 percent and the claims numbers still high,
which adds fuel to the fire,” said  Thomas Tucci , head of U.S.
government bond trading at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit in New York, a primary dealer.  Fed Purchases  The central bank, issuing a statement yesterday after a
two-day policy meeting, said it will finish $600 billion of
Treasury purchases in June, as scheduled. The Fed announced in
November it would acquire U.S. debt to spur growth. It bought
$6.68 billion of Treasuries today maturing from April 2015 to
May 2016.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled at a press conference
after the meeting that he will maintain record monetary stimulus
once large-scale bond purchases end, while the need to contain
inflation means further easing is unlikely. The benchmark
interest rate has been zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The odds of a rate increase by March slipped to 44 percent
today from 50 percent a week ago, futures contracts show.  Six-month bill rates dropped to a record-low 0.0895
percent. Rates have fallen as the Treasury cut bill issuance on
behalf of a Fed program as the federal debt ceiling approaches.  “Bill rates continue to grind lower with more dovish
guidance from the Fed on top of all the other factors that have
been keeping bill rates low of late,” said Thomas Simons, a
government debt economist in New York at the primary dealer
