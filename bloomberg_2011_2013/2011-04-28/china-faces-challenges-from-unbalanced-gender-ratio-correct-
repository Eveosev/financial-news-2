(Corrects sex ratio in second paragraph)  China faces several challenges
relating to its population, including the acceleration in the
number of old people, its large floating population and an
unbalanced gender ratio at birth,  Ma Jiantang , head of the
National Bureau of Statistics, said at a briefing in Beijing
today.  Last year there were 118.06 boys born for every 100 girls,
the bureau said today, up from a ratio of 116.86 in 2000, the
bureau said in a statement today about the nationâ€™s population
census that was carried out in November.  --Zheng Lifei. Editor: Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
