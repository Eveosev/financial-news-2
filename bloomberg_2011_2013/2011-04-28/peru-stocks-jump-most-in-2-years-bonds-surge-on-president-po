Peru ’s benchmark stock index rose
the most in almost 2 years and sol bonds surged after a national
poll gave presidential candidate Ollanta Humala a smaller lead
than a previous survey, leading investors to bet Congresswoman
Keiko Fujimori may win a June 5 runoff.  The Lima General Index of stocks climbed 5.6 percent to
18,971.59, the steepest rise since May 2009. The gauge pared its
loss to 11 percent since April 10, when Humala won the first-
round vote.  Humala had 41 percent support and Fujimori 37 percent in an
April 20-24 survey, researcher CPI said today. Humala had 42
percent support and Fujimori 36 percent in an April 16-21 poll
by Ipsos Apoyo. A former army officer and one-time ally of
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , Humala has pledged to increase
state control over the economy, including natural gas reserves,
and raise mining royalties. Fujimori says she will maintain
existing economic policies and backs industry privatization.  “The market is anticipating that future surveys will show
a narrower gap between the candidates,” said  Roberto Flores , an
economist at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-based brokerage. “If that
happens, the market will react positively.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 15 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 7.19 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.99 centimos to 104.46, the
biggest gain July.  The sol jumped 0.3 percent to 2.8125 per  U.S. dollar  from
2.8305 yesterday.  Central Bank  Peru’s central bank sold a record $492 million in the
foreign exchange market yesterday as foreign investors reduced
their holdings of soles and sol-denominated bonds on concern
 Latin America ’s fastest-growing economy will slow if Humala wins
the election.  The runoff will be tight but Humala will probably remain in
the lead, Credit Suisse said today in an e-mailed report. There
is a less than 50 percent probability Fujimori will overtake
him, the bank said.  “Humala could be seen as the slight favorite: his
rejection rates are slightly lower than Fujimori’s while his
supporters seem to be more convinced about their political
preferences,” Credit Suisse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
