Argentina ’s tax agency sent 1,200
inspectors to raid the offices of cereals producers and
exporters including Cargill Inc. and  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  as part of
a tax evasion investigation.  The companies, which export products such as soybeans and
corn, owe 310 million pesos ($73 million) in unpaid taxes, the
tax agency, known as AFIP, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The raids are the latest in an investigation that started
in October.  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and Cargill, Argentina’s second-and
first-largest exporters, respectively, were among companies
suspended this year from the tax agency’s exporters’ registry.  Companies created fake receipts as well as shell companies
to evade tax payments, AFIP inspector Marcelo Quintilliani said
today in an interview with C5N television channel. AFIP accused
Bunge last year of owing $252 million in unpaid taxes.  Cargill press officer Mark Klein couldn’t be reached by e-
mail and didn’t respond to a telephone call seeking comment.  Gabriela Campoamor, a spokeswoman for Hong Kong-based
Noble, the supplier of energy, food and mined commodities,
couldn’t be reached in  Buenos Aires .  To contact the reporter on this story:
