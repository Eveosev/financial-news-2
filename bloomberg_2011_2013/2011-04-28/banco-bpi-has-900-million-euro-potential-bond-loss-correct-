(Corrects first paragraph to show BPI recorded potential
loss, not actual loss.)  Banco BPI SA (BPI) , Portugal’s fifth-
largest bank, had a 900 million-euro ($1.3 billion) potential
loss in its bond portfolio at the end of the first quarter,
Chief Executive Officer Fernando Ulrich said.  As most of the bonds in the portfolio are held to maturity,
not in the trading book, their decline in value didn’t affect
the bank’s profit, board member Manuel Ferreira da Silva said in
an interview.  The bank had 2.7 billion euros in Portuguese bonds,
1 billion euros in Italian bonds, 500 million euros in Greek
bonds and 400 million euros in Irish bonds at the end of the
first quarter, Ulrich told analysts on a conference call today.  Portuguese, Greek and Irish government bonds have plummeted
as  Portugal  became the third euro-region country to ask for
external aid this month and speculation that  Greece  may need to
restructure its debt has mounted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
