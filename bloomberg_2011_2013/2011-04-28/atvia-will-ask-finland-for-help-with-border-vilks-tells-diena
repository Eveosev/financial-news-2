Latvia will ask  Finland  to lend
border guards to help reduce the amount of goods being smuggled
into the Baltic country, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said,
according to  Diena .  Finnish border guards have a different standard, higher pay
and it’s not possible to involve them in “corrupt schemes,”
Vilks told the Riga-based newspaper. Vilks said he had already
spoken with the Finnish ambassador, and would also try to begin
discussions with other Finnish officials, Diena reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
