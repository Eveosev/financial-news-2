Russia  said it won’t be forced by
the  United Nations  to contribute to about $30 billion being
raised through 2012 to finance climate-change-adaptation
projects in poor nations.  “Volumes and forms of its contribution into financing
climate actions will be defined by the Russian Federation,”
Alexander Frolov, an environmental official in the Russian
government, said in a  letter dated yesterday  to the UN Framework
Convention on  Climate Change  in Bonn.  Developed nations are required to pay the funding, not
Russia, which is “undergoing the process of transition to a
market economy,” Frolov said in the letter to  Christiana
Figueres , executive secretary of the UNFCCC. UN climate talks in
Cancun,  Mexico , in December noted the funding commitment of
developed counties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
