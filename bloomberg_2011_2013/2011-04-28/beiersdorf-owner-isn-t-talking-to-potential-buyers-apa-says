Maxingvest AG,  Beiersdorf AG (BEI) ’s
controlling shareholder, isn’t in talks with any potential
buyers for its majority stake, Austrian news agency  APA 
reported, citing Reinhard Poellath, head of both companies’
supervisory boards.  Beiersdorf shares rose on Feb. 15 after Der Aktionaer
magazine said  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  might want to invest in the
Hamburg, Germany-based maker of Nivea skin creams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
