Gasoline was little changed, paring
gains after reaching a 33-month high, as the dollar lessened its
loss against the euro, reducing the investment appeal of
commodities.  Futures reversed an earlier rise as the U.S. currency was
down 0.2 percent versus the euro as of 1:21 p.m. in  New York 
after dropping 0.6 percent. Prices advanced earlier on concern
that refinery outages in  Texas  may reduce U.S. inventories of
the fuel, already at a 20-month low, before the summer driving
season.  “There was a pushback in the dollar and commodities in
general are coming off a little,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Gasoline for May delivery was up 0.09 cent to $3.4203 a
gallon at 1:53 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
earlier touched $3.4762, the highest intraday price for the
front-month contract since July 15, 2008. The record was $3.571
on July 3, 2008.  Gasoline slipped as June-delivery crude lost 68 cents to
$112.08 a barrel on the Nymex after touching $113.97.  Brent
crude  for June settlement dropped 62 cents to $124.51 a barrel
on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Futures also fell after the Energy Department’s Petroleum
Supply Month report showed demand in February was lower than
originally estimated. February demand averaged 8.65 million
barrels a day, down from a preliminary estimate of 9 million
barrels based on the department’s weekly inventory reports.  Gasoline Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles sank 35.5 million barrels in 10
weeks of declines since Feb. 11, according to Energy Department
data. Power outages in Texas this week have disrupted production
for four plants, on top of unit shutdowns at East Coast
refineries that tightened supplies this month.  “It’s tight supplies in the New York Harbor area and the
issues in Texas that are contributing to the overall bullishness
for gasoline,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Supplies of gasoline in Padd 1, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point of the Nymex contract, sank 3.2
percent last week to the lowest level since Oct. 31, 2008,
according to department data.  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.7 cent to $3.886 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since Aug. 2, 2008. The record was $4.114 on July 15, 2008.  Heating oil for May delivery fell 1.14 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.222 on the exchange, after touching $3.269. The
May contracts for gasoline and heating oil expire at the end of
floor trading tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
