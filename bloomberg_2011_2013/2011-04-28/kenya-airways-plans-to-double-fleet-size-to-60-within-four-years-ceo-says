Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, plans to double the size of its
fleet to 60 planes in the next four years while training more
pilots to fly them, Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni said.  The airline, which currently employs 390 pilots, has bought
facilities that will allow it to train another 100 pilots by the
end of this year, he told reporters in Nairobi today.  “If I can get 200 pilots, I will take all of them, there
is a shortage,” Naikuni said. Kenya Airways employed 180 pilots
in 2007, he said.  The airline, based in Nairobi, is expanding its fleet as it
starts flying to new destinations. This year, Kenya Airways will
begin flights to seven new destinations including the capitals
of  Nigeria , Chad, Togo and  Burkina Faso , as well as Mauritius
and the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah.  Kenya Airways on April 14 said it agreed to buy nine Boeing
Corp. 787 aircraft in an accord that includes an option for
another four plans. The latest 787s will be delivered in October
2013, Kenya Airways said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
