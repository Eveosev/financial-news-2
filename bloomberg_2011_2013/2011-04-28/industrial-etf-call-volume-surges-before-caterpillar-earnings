A bullish options bet tied to 10
million shares of an exchange-traded fund tracking U.S.
industrial stocks lifted call volume to a six-week high before
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  reports results tomorrow.  Almost 114,000 calls to buy the Industrial Select Sector
SPDR changed hands as of 4 p.m. in New York. Susquehanna
Financial Group LLLP said a trader bought 100,000 June $40
calls, enough to buy 10 million shares if exercised, in a bet
that it will climb above $40. The fund tracking 59 stocks such
as Caterpillar,  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  rose 0.3
percent to $38.54. It hasn’t closed above $40 since 2007.  “Industrial stocks have been reporting higher-than-
expected earnings and someone is taking that into account and
putting on this massive bullish position,” said Brenna Hardman,
an options analyst at MEB Options LLC at the  Chicago Board
Options Exchange . “There are some big bulls out there in
industrials right now, judging by how some of the options are
trading.”  Eighty percent of companies tracked by the ETF exceeded
analysts’ first-quarter estimates by an average of 7.8 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rising demand for
industrial goods such as air conditioners and  jet engines 
spurred  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  to raise its full-year profit
forecast by a nickel to as much as $5.40 a share last week.
First-quarter earnings at GE and United Technologies beat
analysts’ estimates.  Ninety-eight percent of the June $40 calls changed hands on
the ask price. The options had an open interest of 288
outstanding contracts before today.  Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction
equipment, may post profit of $1.31 a share, the average of 21
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The Peoria, Illinois-based
company has climbed 20 percent this year, double the 10 percent
gain for the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  To contact the reporter on this story:
