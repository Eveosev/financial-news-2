hours,” said  Jeremy Stretch , executive director of foreign-
exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
 London , referring to the dollar-pound  exchange rate . “The rate-
differential argument, up to a point, has proved to be
beneficial, and the broader dollar negativity story, which was
further underpinned by the dovish stance of Bernanke, has helped
cable to rally.”  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.6658 as of 4:20 p.m. in
London, extending its monthly advance to 3.9 percent. It earlier
rose to $1.6747, the highest level since Nov. 19, 2009. Sterling

the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The U.K. central bank is expected to raise its benchmark
