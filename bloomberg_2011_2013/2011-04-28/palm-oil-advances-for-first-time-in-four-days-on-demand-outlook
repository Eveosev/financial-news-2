Palm oil  advanced for the first
time in four days on speculation importers led by  India  may
boost purchases, and as a gain in crude oil increased the appeal
of the vegetable oil as a biofuel.  The July-delivery contract increased as much as 1.4 percent
to 3,324 ringgit ($1,122) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and was at 3,322 ringgit at 3:36 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures fell 2.8 percent in the previous three
sessions.  “Now that the winter season is over, palm oil demand
seasonally picks up from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh,” Vijay
Mehta, director at Commodity Links Pte., said by phone from
Singapore. “We’ll see a lot of improvement in the export
figures for the first half of May as exports are really picking
up both from  Malaysia  and Indonesia. Demand is very strong.”  Palm oil exports from Malaysia fell in the first 25 days of
this month from the same period in March as the tendency of the
cooking oil to cloud in winter cooled demand. Shipments dropped
7.7 percent to 865,593 tons, independent market surveyor
Intertek said April 25.  China  will continue to buy more Malaysian palm oil, Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao said today in Putrajaya, outside Kuala
Lumpur. China is the second-biggest importer of palm oil after
India.  Malaysia’s palm-oil production may rise to 18.4 million
tons in the year beginning Oct. 1, from 17.8 million in the
current year, according to a unit of the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Exports may drop to 16.55 million tons, from 17
million, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a
 report  posted on its website yesterday.  ‘Well Supported’  Rival soybean oil is “very well-supported” because
soaring crude prices boost demand for vegetable oils used for
alternative fuel, Mehta said.  Crude oil climbed for a second day on speculation that
demand will increase after the  Federal Reserve  renewed its
pledge to stimulate growth and U.S. gasoline stockpiles
declined. The Dollar Index fell to the lowest since 2008 and
Asian stocks rose after the Federal Reserve renewed its pledge
to keep  interest rates  near zero.  “A weaker dollar and rising energy prices helped palm oil
stage a recovery in the near-term, which could be short-lived,”
Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, director of Mumbai-based Commtrendz Risk
Management Services Pvt., said in a technical analysis today.  Crude Gains  Crude oil for June delivery gained as much as 94 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $113.70 a barrel in  New York , the highest since
Sept. 22, 2008. The contract was at $113.24 at 3:45 p.m.
 Singapore  time.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six major trading partners, sank 0.7 percent to 73.016
as of 3:09 p.m. Singapore time.  Soybeans for July delivery rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$13.99 a bushel in Chicago and last traded at $13.95. Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month gained as much as 1 percent
to 59.02 cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
advanced 1.7 percent to close at 9,294 yuan ($1,429) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month increased 1.3 percent
to 10,356 yuan a ton at the close.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active July palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark, climbed 1.7 percent to $1,120.50 a
ton at 3:10 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
