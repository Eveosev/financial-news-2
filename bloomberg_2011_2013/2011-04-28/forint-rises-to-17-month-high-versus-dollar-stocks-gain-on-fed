The forint jumped to the strongest
against the dollar in 16 months after the  Federal Reserve 
renewed its pledge to keep  interest rates  near zero, boosting
investment in higher-yielding assets.  The forint appreciated as much as 1.6 percent against the
dollar and traded 1 percent stronger at 178.34, the highest
level since December 2009, by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest. The
currency was little changed versus the euro at 264.37.  Fed policy makers kept the target rate for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent, as forecast by
all of the economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  signaled yesterday in his first press conference
following a policy decision that the central bank intends to
maintain monetary stimulus.  “The comments at the Fed rate meeting increased risk
appetite on currency and stock markets alike,” Peter Karsai,
Imre Kerekgyarto and Karoly Bamli, traders at Commerzbank AG in
Budapest, wrote in an e-mail to clients.  The BUX index of shares traded 0.7 percent higher at
24,277.27. Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest refiner, rose 2.1
percent after Chief Executive Officer Gyorgy Mosonyi said at a
shareholder meeting he expects the company’s daily hydrocarbon
output to rise by 4 percent over the next two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
