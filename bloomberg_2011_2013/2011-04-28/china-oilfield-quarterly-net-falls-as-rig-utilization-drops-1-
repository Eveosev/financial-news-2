China Oilfield Services Ltd. (2883) , a
unit of the nationâ€™s biggest offshore oil explorer, posted a 1.2
percent drop in first-quarter profit compared with a year
earlier as rig utilization rates declined.  Net income fell to 965.9 million yuan ($148.6 million) from
977.3 million yuan a year earlier, the unit of state-owned China
National Offshore Oil Corp. said in a statement to the  Hong Kong 
stock exchange today. Revenue dropped 3.1 percent to 3.93
billion yuan.  The utilization rate for drilling rigs fell 5.7 percentage
points to 94.3 percent in the quarter even as the number of
operating days rose 5.2 percent to 2,225 days, according to the
statement. The volume of well services also declined, China
Oilfield said.  The utilization rate for its marine transport increased 0.9
percentage points to 98.9 percent, while the number of operating

output by 27 percent from a year earlier.  Shares of China Oilfield fell 5.6 percent in Hong Kong
