Russiaâ€™s spring plantings of grains
and other crops fell by about half this year, Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  said in Moscow today.  Spring sowing covered 2.5 million hectares (6.2 million
acres) as of April 25, Putin said. That compares with 5.1
million hectares in the year-earlier period, according to
Agriculture Ministry data.  The sowing is behind schedule because of a cold spring,
Putin said, adding he still expects a normal-sized crop to be
planted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
