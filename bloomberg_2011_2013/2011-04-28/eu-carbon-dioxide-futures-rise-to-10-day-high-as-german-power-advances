European Union carbon futures rose
to their highest price in 10 days, as German power for 2012
advanced.  EU carbon permits for December gained as much as 0.5
percent to 17.19 euros ($25.52) a metric ton on  London â€™s ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the most expensive since April 18. They
were at 17.17 euros as of 8:19 a.m., having jumped 21 percent
this year as utilities bought permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
