U.S. mortgage rates dropped to the
lowest level in six weeks, reducing borrowing costs for
homebuyers as the housing market languishes.  The average 30-year rate fell to 4.78 percent in the week
ended today from 4.80 percent,  Freddie Mac  said in a statement.
The 15-year rate averaged 3.97 percent, down from 4.02 percent a
week ago, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company
said. Both rates were the lowest since the week ended March 17.  Mortgage rates of less than 5 percent have done little to
increase demand for home purchases as unemployment remains close
to 9 percent. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in
20 cities fell 3.3 percent in February, the largest year-over-
year decline since November 2009, a report this week showed.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association â€™s index of loan
applications declined 5.6 percent in the week ended April 22,
the Washington-based group said yesterday. Its gauge of
purchases plunged 14 percent, the most in almost a year. The
index measuring refinancing dropped 0.6 percent.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is below where it
was last year at this time, when it was 5.06 percent, according
to Freddie Mac. It hit a record low of 4.17 percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
