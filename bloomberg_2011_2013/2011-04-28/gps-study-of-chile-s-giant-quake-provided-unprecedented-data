Global Positioning System networks
operating in  Chile  provided “unprecedented” knowledge about
the physics of rare earthquakes with magnitudes exceeding 8.5,
according to a study in journal  Science .  Using data from more than 20 GPS stations, researchers in
 France  relocated the epicenter of the mega quake that hit Chile
on Feb. 27 last year by 40 kilometers (25 miles) and concluded
that the earth ruptured at about three kilometers per second.  The high-resolution data used in the study has “been
recorded only a couple of times” in the past, wrote Christophe
Vign of the Laboratoire de Geologie de l’ENS in Paris, who is
lead author of the study published today.  The 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of
southern Chile was one of the largest ever recorded and may have
increased the risk of other large earthquakes in the region,
according to a January study in Nature Geoscience. The quake and
ensuing tsunamis killed about 500 people and caused an estimated
$30 billion in damage and losses.  Copper mines in central Chile owned by state-run Codelco,
Anglo American Plc and Antofagasta Plc temporarily halted output
because of power cuts, fueling a 3.7 percent gain in copper
futures the following week. Chile is the world’s top supplier of
copper. Mines in the country’s copper-rich northern region
weren’t affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
