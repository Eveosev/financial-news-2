Norddeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale said Lower Saxony yesterday decided to convert 1.1
billion euros ($1.63 billion) of so-called silent participations
and inject capital to strengthen its finances.  The German state, which owns 42 percent of the bank, will
change the silent participations into core capital and inject
600 million euros into NordLB, the Hanover, Germany-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. That will increase
Lower Saxony’s stake to more than 50 percent.  NordLB sought a decision on the plan, first announced on
April 14, before the end of this month as the European Banking
Authority will only count this form of German non-voting capital
in stress tests if provided by the government or regional states
as aid during the financial crisis. NordLB, which navigated the
crisis without state aid, had the second-lowest result among 14
German lenders stress tested last year.  While NordLB didn’t need help during the crisis and is
“adequately capitalized,” the stress tests “differ
significantly” from the current legal requirements and call for
“immediate adjustments,” NordLB said in the statement. “The
bank believes that it will pass the EBA’s stress test.”  The authority plans to publish results from the latest
round of tests, which include tougher capital rules, in June.
The 90 banks will be required to have a core Tier 1 ratio of at
least 5 percent under the new scenarios, which include losses on
bond holdings and an economic contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
