Manchester United football player
 Wayne Rooney  said he’s been shown documents by police that
suggest his mobile phone may have been hacked by a newspaper.  “Scotland Yard detectives came to see me earlier and
showed me some documents,” Rooney, 25, said in a message on
social networking site Twitter. “Looks like a newspaper have
hacked into my phone.” He didn’t identify the newspaper.  London  police have contacted dozens of possible victims of
phone hacking as part of an investigation into News Corp.’s News
of the World Newspaper. More than 20 actors, politicians and
athletes have sued the paper over claims their mobile-phone
messages were illegally accessed by reporters for stories.  Hayley Barlow, a spokeswoman for News of the World,
declined to comment. London’s Metropolitan Police, also known as
Scotland Yard declined to comment.  Rooney said in a separate post on Twitter that he would ask
lawyers to “deal” with the issue.  News Corp. (NWS) ’s U.K. unit last month offered to settle some of
the cases following the arrests of three journalists that have
worked at the paper. The scandal dates back to 2007 when a
former editor and a private investigator employed by the
newspaper were jailed for accessing voice-mail messages on
members of the royal household’s mobile phones.  To contact the reporters on this story:
