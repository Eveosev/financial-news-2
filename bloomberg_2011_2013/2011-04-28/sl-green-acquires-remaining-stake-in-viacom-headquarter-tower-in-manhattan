SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG)  said it
acquired the remaining interest in 1515 Broadway, the Times
Square skyscraper that houses the headquarters of  Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) ,
in a deal that values the property at $1.21 billion.  The company bought the stake from SITQ, a real estate
investment unit of Canadian pension-fund manager Caisse de Depot
et Placement du  Quebec , SL Green said in a statement today. The
valuation for the 1.75 million-square-foot (162,600-square-
meter) tower equals about $691 a square foot.  “Here we go again,” said  Dan Fasulo , managing director of
Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based research firm that
tracks commercial property sales globally. “That value is
another example of how the market has improved over the last 18
months. We’re within maybe 10 percent of record levels.”  SL Green, Manhattan’s biggest office landlord, has been
benefiting from climbing  New York  office values as vacancies
decline and rents rise. The real estate investment trust
yesterday said first-quarter funds from operations jumped 68
percent, beating analyst estimates, as rent revenue increased
and it received income from the sale of debt on 280 Park Ave.  SL Green gained $1.57, or 1.9 percent, to $82.54 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock is up 22
percent this year, compared with a 14 percent increase in the
Bloomberg REIT Office Property Index.  2002 Purchase  SITQ and SL Green paid $484 million for 1515 Broadway in
2002, according to a joint statement issued in 2005, when the
partners refinanced it for $625 million. The 54-story tower was
appraised at that time at $1 billion, the companies said.  SITQ had a 31.5 percent stake in the building, said  Rick Matthews , a spokesman for SL Green.  The property recently underwent a $40 million renovation,
including a new glass-enclosed lobby, new entrances and
bathrooms. The building houses MTV Studios, where the music-
video show Total Request Live was broadcast for many years.
Retail tenants include Billabong, Aeropostale and Oakley.  The tower is 97 percent occupied, according to the SL
Green’s first-quarter supplemental earnings statement.  “We have several revenue-enhancing initiatives under way,
and believe we can continue our nine-year trend of increasing”
the building’s net operating income, SL Green President Andrew
Mathias said today on a conference call with analysts.  Assuming Debt  The company assumed the building’s debt, a loan from  Bank
of China  originating in 2009, Mathias said. The initial return
is about 5.5 percent,increasing to 6 percent over about 12
months, he said on the call. SITQ received cash proceeds of $260
million, he said.  “We sold our interests in this property because it had
reached its maturity,” Jean-Michel Laberge, a spokesman for
Montreal-based SITQ, said in an e-mail. “New York remains an
important market for us. We still own other properties in New
York, and we wish to maintain a strong presence in this
market.”  SL Green’s total rent revenue increased 19 percent in the
first quarter to $229 million. Total revenue was $334.3 million,
up 33 percent from a year earlier. The company reported $38.7
million of additional income from the sale of debt on 280 Park
Ave. to a joint venture with  Vornado Realty Trust. (VNO)   The company increased its FFO projection for 2011 to
between $4.65 and $4.80 a share, compared with a December
estimate of $4.05 to $4.20.  Leasing Gains  Manhattan office leasing volume reached a four-and-a-half-
year high in the first three months of 2011, and rents rose for
a second consecutive quarter after two years of declines,
Cushman & Wakefield Inc. reported on April 5. Offices above the
25th floor in top-quality Midtown buildings were more than 99
percent leased, CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. said on April 14.  SL Green’s first quarter was a “material” outperformance
of analyst expectations, even given the additional 280 Park
income and other one-time items, Robert Stevenson, an analyst
with Macquarie Research, said in a note to clients today. New
leases on 577,000 square feet were 10.6 percent more than the
expired rents on that space, he said.  “SL Green posted very strong first-quarter numbers with
mark-to-market on new  Manhattan  leases exceeding our
expectations,” Stevenson wrote. “SL Green remains our favorite
name in the REIT space.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
