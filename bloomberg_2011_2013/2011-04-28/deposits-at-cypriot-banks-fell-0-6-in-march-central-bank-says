Cypriot bank deposits dropped in
March to 68.7 billion euros ($101.6 billion) after a sovereign-
debt rating cut by Moody’s Investors Service by two notches to
A2 in February, the  Central Bank of Cyprus  said.  Total deposits at the eastern Mediterranean island’s banks
declined 0.6 percent, or by 397.8 million euros, from February
and 1.8 percent, or by 1.2 billion euros, from Dec. 31, the
Nicosia-based central bank said in a  statement  on its website
today. It was the third drop in deposits in as many months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
