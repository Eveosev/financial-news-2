Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  hired  UBS AG (UBSN) 
metals and mining banker Dieter Hoeppli in the latest defection
from the Swiss bank to a competitor, said a person with
knowledge of the matter.  Daniel Chu, another New York-based metals and mining banker
at UBS, has also held talks about joining Deutsche Bank and
hasn’t reached an agreement, said the person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. UBS
disclosed the bankers’ planned departure on April 15 without
specifying their future plans.  Scott Helfman, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to
comment. Chu didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
