The Dollar Index slid to the lowest
level since 2008, Treasuries rose and gold rallied to a record
after economic growth slowed. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
climbed an almost three-year high as rising earnings and
takeovers overshadowed the report on gross domestic product.  The Dollar Index tumbled 0.6 percent at 4:10 p.m. New York
time after slumping to 72.871, an almost three-year low. It
declined for an eighth straight day, its longest slump since
2009. Ten-year Treasury yields lost five basis points to 3.31
percent, gold jumped as much as 1.4 percent to $1,538.80 an
ounce and silver rose for a second day. The  S&P 500  climbed 0.4
percent to 1,360.48 while the Russell 2000 Index of smaller U.S.
stocks rallied to a record for a second straight day.  The dollar and Treasuries reacted to government data
showing gross domestic product expanded at a 1.8 percent annual
rate in the first quarter. That trailed the 2 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, reinforcing the
 Federal Reserve ’s assessment that the “moderate” economic
recovery still requires record-low  interest rates . A separate
report showed jobless claims unexpectedly increased.  “We’re all reacting to the numbers and looking for
sustainable growth,” said Firas Askari, head currency trader in
Toronto at Bank of Montreal. “The dollar weakness is a trend
that’s hard to break,” he said. “The momentum we did seem to
be having in the  U.S. economy  seems to be hitting some
headwinds. Best case scenario: the U.S. economy is lukewarm.”  Dollar Slumps  The dollar weakened against 11 of 16 major peers, losing
more than 0.7 percent versus the yen and South Korean won. It
pared losses after slumping as much as 0.6 percent against the
euro to breach $1.48 for the first time since December 2009.  Treasuries pared gains after a U.S. auction of $29 billion
in seven-year notes drew weaker-than-average demand. The
securities yielded 2.712 percent compared with a forecast of
2.698 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the Fed’s
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of debt offered, was 2.63,
the lowest since November, versus a 2.89 average at the past 10
sales. Bonds headed for the biggest monthly gain since August
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday interest rates
will likely remain low.  Insurers in the S&P 500 rallied 1.7 percent as Allstate
Corp., Aflac Inc. and Lincoln National Corp. posted first-
quarter earnings that topped estimates.  Earnings Season  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  rose 6.7 percent as the third-largest
U.S. mobile-phone carrier reported a narrower loss after paring
costs to offset contract-customer defections. Constellation
Energy Group Inc. added 5.7 percent as Exelon Corp. offered $7.9
billion for the power producer.  The S&P 500 has rallied 8.2 percent in 2011 amid higher-
than-expected profit and reports on manufacturing and housing
bolstered investors’ confidence. Earnings-per-share beat
estimates at more than three-quarters of the 269 companies in
the S&P 500 that reported results since April 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  More than two stocks advanced for each that declined in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
bank, surged 5.1 percent after earnings beat estimates.  SAP AG (SAP) ,
the largest maker of business-management software, slid 6.4
percent after reporting smaller-than-expected growth in profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.3 percent to a two-
month high as  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rallied 1.6
percent.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index fell a fifth day,
dropping 1.3 percent on speculation the government will increase
interest rates as soon as next week to tame inflation.  India ’s
index dropped 0.8 percent, declining for a fourth day, after
food inflation accelerated to a three-week high.  To contact the reporters on this story:
