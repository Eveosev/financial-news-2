Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average
rose to the highest level since the March 11 earthquake after
companies including Nippon Electric Glass Co. reported better
earnings and the U.S. Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to
stimulate growth in the world’s biggest economy.  Nippon Electric Glass, which makes glass for liquid-crystal
displays, surged 8.6 percent.  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  rallied 2.4
percent after a report the electronics manufacturer plans to cut
more than 10 percent of its workforce.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , a camera
maker that gets about 20 percent of its sales in  Europe , jumped
3.1 percent after the yen weakened.  “The U.S. Fed will continue its easing policy for a while
and that’s allowing investors to take more risk,” said
Masayoshi Yano, a senior market analyst at Tokyo-based Meiwa
Securities Co. “Earnings are also shedding some light on the
situation.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.6 percent to 9,849.74 at the 3 p.m.
trading close in  Tokyo , the highest since the earthquake and
tsunami that last month devastated Japan’s northeast coast. The
broader Topix index gained 1.4 percent to 851.85, advancing 1.2
percent for the week. Japanese markets are closed tomorrow for a
public holiday.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3
percent today. In  New York  yesterday, the index rose 0.6 percent
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the Fed
will maintain its record monetary stimulus after ending large-
scale bond purchases in June. The Fed left its benchmark
interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s
been since December 2008.  Nippon Glass Surges  Nippon Electric Glass surged 8.6 percent to 1,223 yen,
leading gains on the Nikkei. The company yesterday reported
full-year net income rose 25 percent from a year ago to 68.6
billion yen ($839 million).  Shares of the glassmaker also rose after Jim Flaws, chief
financial officer at rival Corning Inc., said yesterday the
U.S.-based company will have “significant growth this year and
over the next several years.”  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s biggest maker of tools used to
test memory chips, jumped 5.6 percent to 1,597 yen. The company
yesterday said it returned to profit in the year through March,
posting net income of 3.16 billion yen. Sales jumped 87 percent.  Panasonic rallied 2.4 percent to 998 yen after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the company plans to cut 40,000 jobs by March
2013.  Supply Chains Cut  The Topix has lost 8.5 percent since the magnitude-9 quake
and tsunami that crippled a nuclear power plant last month and
left almost 26,000 people dead or missing. Damage to supply
chains has forced companies from Daihatsu Motor Co. to Sharp
Corp. to cut production and delay earnings forecasts for the
current year.  Factory output at Japanese manufacturers dropped 15.3
percent last month compared with February because of the
disaster, the Trade Ministry said today in Tokyo.  Still, stocks rose amid better-than-expected earnings
reports. The yen’s depreciation against the euro also boosted
exporters.  Olympus climbed 3.1 percent to 2,282 yen.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a
camera maker that gets about a quarter of its sales in Europe,
advanced 3 percent to 1,691 yen.  Japan’s currency weakened to as much as 121.84 against the
euro today, compared with 119.93 at the close of  stock trading 
in Tokyo yesterday, the weakest level since April 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
