The Monetary Authority of Singapore
fined Song Qing, an employee of law firm Shook Lin & Bok LLP,
S$50,000 ($41,000) for contravening insider trading laws.  Song bought 40,000  Bright World Precision Machinery Ltd. (BWPM) 
shares after reviewing the translation of legal documents
containing non-public price sensitive information, the central
bank said in a  statement  today. He made a profit of S$1,000 from
the share purchase, the regulator said.  Bright World’s share price jumped 80 percent to 66.5
Singapore cents in July 2008 after China Holdings Acquisition
Corp. announced its takeover plans, the monetary authority said.
Shook Lin was the legal adviser to Bright World’s majority
shareholder in the acquisition, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
