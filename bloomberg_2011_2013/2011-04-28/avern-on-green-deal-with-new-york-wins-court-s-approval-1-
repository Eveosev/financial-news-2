A bankruptcy judge approved the
settlement of a dispute between Tavern on the Green’s former
operators and the city of  New York  regarding rights to the
restaurant’s name.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper signed an order today
approving a settlement filed earlier this month between the city
and the U.S. Trustee in the liquidation of Tavern on the Green
LP, according to a filing in  Manhattan .  Tavern on the Green LP filed for bankruptcy protection in
September 2009 after it lost its lease to operate the restaurant
located in New York’s Central Park. The company sought to keep
the Tavern trademark. A federal district court judge last year
granted the city the rights to use the name. The restaurant
remains closed.  Under the stipulation signed today, the trustee will sell
the rights to use the name for restaurants outside New York,  New
Jersey , Connecticut and part of  Pennsylvania , as well as for
branded goods such as packaged foods and furnishings. Streambank
LLC will seek buyers for the name.  The trustee will keep 75 percent of the net proceeds from
the sale of the rights for distribution to creditors of Tavern
on the Green LP, and the city will get 25 percent.  The Chapter 7 liquidation case is Tavern on the Green LP,
09-15450,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
