The cost of two aircraft carriers
being built for the U.K. will not be established until the end
of 2012, when a review of the specifications is completed, the
Ministry of Defense and companies building the ships said today.  The redesign of the carriers, which are being built by a
group including  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Babcock International Group Plc (BAB) 
and  Thales SA (HO) , will enable them to carry the carrier-variant
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, the
government said in its defence review in October. The cost may
climb to as much as 7 billion pounds ($11.7 billion) from 5.2
billion pounds, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  “Final costs are yet to be agreed and detailed work is
ongoing. We expect to take firm decisions in late 2012,” the
defense ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  Converting the ships to carry the  Joint Strike Fighter  by
adding a catapult and arrester-wire system will bring long-term
benefits because the plane can carry a greater payload, has a
longer range and is cheaper to purchase than the alternatives,
the ministry said.  “The design of the ships and the options for catapults and
traps is undergoing a review, which is expected to be completed
towards the end of 2012,” BAE Systems, the lead contractor in
the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Current reports on conversion costs are therefore
speculative.”  To contact the reporter on the story:
