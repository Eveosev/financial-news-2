OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, said first-quarter profit rose 60 percent on the back
of higher crude prices.  Net income climbed to $3.88 billion compared with $2.43
billion a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said today on
its website. That beat a $3.8 billion average estimate from 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The price environment on the international market was
very supportive in the first quarter, allowing us to achieve
record high financial results,” Rosneft Chief Executive Officer
Eduard Khudainatov said in a statement.  Rosneft is seeking tie-ups with international producers to
expand production into offshore fields. The state-controlled
company plans to swap shares with BP Plc and form a venture to
explore in the South Kara Sea above the Arctic Circle. BP’s
billionaire partners in the TNK-BP oil venture have held up the
deal, winning a temporary injunction from a London court on
claims the alliance would violate their shareholder agreement.  Revenue rose 36 percent to $20.1 billion, Rosneft said.
Prices of Urals crude, Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged
$102.18 a barrel in the period, about 36 percent higher than a
year ago, the company said.  Rosneft’s oil production rose 2.9 percent to 2.355 million
barrels a day in the first quarter compared with the previous
year, according to a presentation on its website.  Earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and
amortization increased 50 percent to $6.65 billion, while the
 cash flow  from operations more than doubled to $6.05 billion
from $2.29 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
