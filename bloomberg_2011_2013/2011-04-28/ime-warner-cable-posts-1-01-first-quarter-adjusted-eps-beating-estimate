Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television provider, reported profit that
beat analysts’ estimates after adding new subscribers.  First-quarter net income rose to $325 million, or 93 cents
a share, from $214 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. Excluding one-time
costs, earnings per share were $1.01, topping the 99-cent
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company added 189,000 new broadband and 84,000 new
digital phone subscribers and lost 65,000 video subscribers. The
gains in broadband were higher than an estimate of 150,000 from
 James Ratcliffe , an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New
York, an indication that customers are recognizing the quality
of cable Internet, he said. Time Warner Cable competes against
AT&T Inc.’s U-verse and Verizon Communications Inc.’s FiOS for
broadband and video users.  “In areas where there are U-Verse and FiOS, cable has a
better broadband product,” said Ratcliffe, who rates Time
Warner Cable shares “neutral” and doesn’t own any.  U-verse and FiOS also reported subscriber gains in the
first quarter, “confirmation that pay-TV householders are not
in a secular decline as perhaps we thought in the third quarter
of 2010,” said Paul Sweeney, senior media analyst at Bloomberg
Industries. AT&T added 218,000 U-verse users and FiOS added
192,000 video subscribers last quarter.  Time Warner Cable rose 95 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $76.26
at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have advanced 15 percent this year.  Buyback Boost  Quarterly subscription revenue climbed 4.6 percent to
$4.63 billion, helped by a gain of 83,000 customers buying the
company’s “Triple Play” package, which combines broadband,
phone and video.  “I am particularly pleased with the performance of our
high-speed data product,” Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt
said on a conference call.  Sales rose 5 percent to $4.83 billion. Analysts projected
$4.79 billion on average. Residential subscription revenue rose
3.5 percent to $4.32 billion and commercial subscription sales
increased 23 percent to $313 million.  Time Warner Cable bought back 12 million shares for
$829 million, part of a $4 billion repurchase plan announced
in November. The company bought back 8 million shares for
$515 million in the previous quarter, and had about $2.7 billion
remaining for authorized buybacks at the end of March.  Evaluating Acquisitions  “We continue to generate solid results, invest to further
improve the value of our services and return cash to our
shareholders,” Britt said in the statement.  Time Warner Cable will evaluate buying Charter
Communications’ Los Angeles cable network, Britt said on the
call. He added, though, that the number of Time Warner Cable’s
subscribers doesn’t “need to be much bigger” and that a lot of
the acquisition possibilities “aren’t big enough to move the
scale much.”  Charter is hiring investment bankers to handle an auction
for its Los Angeles properties, according to a report by
Multichannel News earlier this week. Charter doesn’t comment on
speculative transactions, Anita Lamont, a Charter spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
