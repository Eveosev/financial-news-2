Riot police became the latest
group to protest in  Burkina Faso , firing their guns into the
air at their barracks in the east of the capital, Ouagadougou,
two weeks after the president dissolved the government.  “The shooting began in 9.30 p.m. and continued till this
morning,” said Oumarou Kabore, who lives near the barracks.
“They came out of their camp and fired in the air.”  A mutiny by the presidential guard on April 14 pushed
President Blaise Compaore to dismiss his government. On April
22, he appointed himself as defense minister. Sub-Saharan
Africa’s biggest cotton producer has been in turmoil since
February, when five people were killed during demonstrations
against police following the death of a student in their
custody.  Compaore, 60, has ruled Burkina Faso since seizing power
in a 1987 coup.  Gold miners including Montreal-based  Semafo Inc. (SMF)  and
London-based  Avocet Mining Plc (AVM)  have operations in Burkina
Faso. Semafo said on April 18 the unrest hasn’t disrupted
operations at its Mana mine, while Avocet said the same on
April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
