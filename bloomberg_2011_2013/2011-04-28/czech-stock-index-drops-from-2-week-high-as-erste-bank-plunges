The Czech Republic’s main equity
index erased losses at the end of trading as  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the
country’s biggest power utility, extended its rally to the
highest in almost two years.  The PX gauge of 15 companies rose less than 0.1 percent to
1,264.2 at 4:28 p.m. in  Prague , its highest close since April 8,
after earlier declining as much as 0.6 percent.  CEZ, which has a 23 percent weighting in the PX, gained for
a third day, jumping 1.8 percent to 944.5 koruna, its highest
close since August 2009. Power for 2012 delivery in neighboring
Germany, where CEZ exports some of its production, jumped as
much as 1.1 percent.  The power company’s rally offset  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG) ’s
plunge after the Austrian lender posted first-quarter earnings
that missed estimates and said bad debt in  Hungary  will continue
to drag on earnings. Erste closed down 3.2 percent to 828 koruna
after earlier losing as much as 3.7 percent, the most in five
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
