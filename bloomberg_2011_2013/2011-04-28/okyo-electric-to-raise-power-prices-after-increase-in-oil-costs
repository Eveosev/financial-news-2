Tokyo Electric Power Co. said it
will raise electricity prices after the cost of oil increased,
under a tariff adjustment system mandated by the government.  The utility raises or lowers monthly rates when prices for
fuel used to fire power stations move beyond a pre-set level
during a three-month period, it said in a statement.  Residential customers who paid 6,390 yen ($78) for power in
May will pay 84 yen more in June, Tokyo Electric said.  New York benchmark crude oil, which has risen about 27
percent in the last three months, was trading at $113.57 a
barrel at 10:13 a.m. Tokyo time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
