Burkina Faso’s  president, Blaise Compaore, fired the chiefs of staff of the country’s army,  air
force  and police after dismissing his government.  General Kodji Lougue of the land forces, General Abraham
Traore of the air force and Colonel Zambo Martin Zongo of the
police were replaced by their assistants, according to a
statement broadcast on national television.  Compaore has already dismissed his government and the head
of the presidential guard after demonstrating soldiers fired in
the air and looted parts of the capital, Ouagadougou. Many
businesses were closed yesterday in the city as shop owners
protested against the looting.  Burkina Faso, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer,
has been in turmoil since student demonstrations in February
against the death of a pupil in police custody. On March 22,
soldiers protested a court decision sentencing officers to
prison. Compaore, who took power in a 1987 coup, fled
Ouagadougou April 14 after some members of his presidential
guard mutinied, returning to his presidential palace the
following day.  Burkina Faso , which borders Mali,  Ivory Coast , Ghana, Togo,
Benin and Niger, ranks 161st out of 169 nations on the United
Nations  Human Development Index , a broad measure of economic and
social well-being.  To contact the reporters on this story:
