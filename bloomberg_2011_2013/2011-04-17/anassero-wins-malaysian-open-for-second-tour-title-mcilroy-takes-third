Italian teenager Matteo Manassero
won the Malaysian Open for his second title on golf’s European
Tour, while Rory McIlroy responded to his final-round collapse
at last week’s Masters Tournament with a third-place finish.  Manassero, who will be 18 in two days, collects a check for
288,465 euros ($416,260) for his  one-shot victory  at the Kuala
Lumpur Golf & Country Club. He ended on 16-under-par 272 after a
final-round 68, ahead of  France ’s Gregory Bourdy. McIlroy was a
further shot back.  “I couldn’t imagine anything better -- going back home to
celebrate my 18th birthday and my second victory,” Manassero,
who will climb to 35th in the  World Golf Rankings , told the
European Tour website. The event is co-sanctioned by the Asian
Tour.  Manassero finished the delayed conclusion of the third
round today on 67 to start the final round in a tie for the lead
with Alexander Noren of  Sweden . An eagle, three birdies and a
bogey saw the Italian edge Bourdy for the title, while Noren
slipped to fourth.  McIlroy, who last week had an 8-over par 80 in the final
round in Augusta to blow his chance of winning the Masters
Tournament, had a mixed round today including seven birdies, but
also two bogeys and a double-bogey.  “I’m disappointed with the result but everything else was
positive,” McIlroy said. “I’m proud of myself at how I picked
myself up from last week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
