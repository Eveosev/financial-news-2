French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity fell to a record low, with 28 percent of voters
polled by Ifop approving of his performance 12 months ahead of
presidential elections, the  Journal du Dimanche  said.  The 28 percent approval rating is 1 point below another
survey by Ifop in March, when Sarkozy’s rating fell 2 points
from the previous monthly poll, the French weekly newspaper
reported.  Sarkozy’s ratings are the worst for any president in the
Fifth Republic at 12 months before an election, the newspaper
said. Previous presidents  Jacques Chirac , Francois Mitterrand
and  Charles de Gaulle  all had ratings in the mid-50s, while
Valery Giscard d’Estaing had a 45 percent approval rating in
April 1980, JDD said.  France will hold the election in the first half of 2012.
The survey published today involved 1,829 people registered
voters who were interviewed from April 7 through April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
