Standard Life Investments, one of
the biggest shareholders in Rio Tinto Group, called for an
overhaul of the mining company’s compensation policy, the Sunday
Times reported.  Standard Life, which voted against a report on pay at last
week’s shareholders’ meeting, had concerns that long-term share
incentives reward executives for reaching “unchallenging”
targets, the newspaper said, citing Guy Jubb, head of corporate
governance at Standard Life.  To contact the reporter on this story:
