U.K. house prices may fall by as
much as 25 percent by the end of next year, the Mail on Sunday
said, citing a report to be published by consultant CheckRisk
tomorrow.  Rising interest rates, inflation, a sluggish labor market
and household indebtedness are among reasons Britons find
themselves cash strapped, the newspaper said, citing CheckRisk
analyst Nick Bullman.  Commercial property prices may fall more than residential
property, according to the CheckRisk report, the Mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
