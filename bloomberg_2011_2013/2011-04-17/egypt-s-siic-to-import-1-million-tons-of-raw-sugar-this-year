Sugar and Integrated Industries Co.
of  Egypt  plans to import 1 million metric tons of raw sugar
before the end of the year, said Chairman Hassan Kamel.  The Cairo-based company has enough sugar stockpiles to
cover the North African country’s domestic needs until the end
of August, Kamel said in a telephone interview in Cairo today.  Egypt’s sugar production is expected to increase to 2.1
million metric tons, with the addition of 100,000 tons of beet
sugar, in the season that runs from February to June 20, 2012,
compared with 2 million tons this season, Kamel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
