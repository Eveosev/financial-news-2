Israel ’s economy expanded 7.8
percent in the fourth quarter, little changed from previously
reported, as exports increased.  Growth accelerated from 4.6 percent in the third quarter
and was the fastest since 2006, the Jerusalem-based Central
 Bureau of Statistics  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Preliminary figures released last month showed fourth-quarter
growth at 7.7 percent.  “We are seeing very, very strong growth,” Yossi Shvimer,
chief economist at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd., said by
telephone before the announcement. “We see it in the
improvement in the employment market as well. We are in a much
better situation than most of the developed countries.”  Israel’s economy is likely to expand 4.5 percent this year
and 4 percent in 2012, the  Bank of Israel  forecast in March.
Unemployment is likely to drop to 6.1 percent this year, from
6.7 percent in 2010, it said.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  raised rates by a
half-point at the end of March, the biggest increase in five
years, after inflation accelerated past the government’s 3
percent ceiling for a second month. The benchmark stands at 3
percent, the highest since November 2008.  Israel’s benchmark TA-25 stock index has advanced about 11
percent in the past 12 months, led by led by Avner Oil
Exploration-L.P. The shekel has gained about 9 percent in the
same period against the dollar and closed at 3.4181 shekels on
April 15 in  Tel Aviv , the last day it traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
