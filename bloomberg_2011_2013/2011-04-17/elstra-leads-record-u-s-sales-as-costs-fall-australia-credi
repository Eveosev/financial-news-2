Australian companies are selling
record amounts of bonds in the U.S., tapping the lowest relative
yields since 2007 as the swaps market makes it cheaper to
exchange money raised abroad into local currency.  Telstra Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd. and  Woolworths
Ltd. (WOW)  led borrowers selling $30.7 billion of notes in U.S.
currency in 2011 as of April 14, the biggest start to a year on
record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cost of
bringing the proceeds back to Australia, gauged by the five-year
basis swap, has fallen 7 basis points this year to 20.5 and
dropped last month to the lowest since September 2009.  Australian firms need to refinance as much as A$80 billion
($84 billion) of maturing borrowings this year, according to
National Australia Bank, as well as fund expansion to meet
demand in an economy that the central bank estimates will grow
4.25 percent this year. Bond sales in the U.S. surged 24 percent
to $452.4 billion in 2011 compared with A$44.1 billion of sales
in Australia. U.S. relative yields touched 145 basis points on
April 8, the lowest since October 2007, a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index shows.  “We have had a lot of Australian companies tapping the
U.S. markets to diversify their funding and lengthen their
maturity profile,” said Natalie Vanstone, Sydney-based head of
debt capital markets at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which helped
manage the Woolworths and Telstra sales. “The depth and breadth
of credit appetite in the U.S. market is why a lot of issuers
will look at it.”  Largest Sale  Telstra, the nation’s biggest phone company, sold $1
billion of 4.8 percent 2021 notes on April 7, its largest U.S.
dollar bond offering and its first since 2002, Bloomberg data
show. The company raised A$200 million in November selling bonds
due in July 2020, priced to yield 7.595 percent.  The 2021 bonds were sold to yield 133 basis points more
than Treasuries, and that gap has since widened to 135, BNP
Paribas SA prices show.  Woolworths,  Australia ’s biggest retailer, sold $850 million
of five- and 10-year bonds on April 5, including $300 million of
five-year notes that cost about 97 basis points more than the
bank bill swap rate once the proceeds were swapped back into
Australian dollars, according to Perpetual Ltd. The supermarket
operator paid 105 basis points over swap when it sold A$500
million of 2016 notes domestically on March 7.  Deeper Market  “The U.S. market is deeper, so companies can issue in
larger size than in Australia,” said Ben Byrne, Sydney-based
credit analyst at Nomura Australia Ltd. “They can also often
sell debt of a longer tenor, at a cheaper cost.”  There hasn’t been a non-financial corporate bond sale of
more than A$1 billion in Australia’s domestic debt market since
Reliance Rail Finance Pty sold A$1.9 billion of notes in
February 2007 to fund the construction of new trains for
Sydney’s rail network, Bloomberg data show.  Average yields of 4 percent on U.S. investment grade
corporate debt compare to 6.7 percent in Australia, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  The extra yield investors demand to hold U.S. investment
grade corporate debt instead of Treasuries has dropped 20 basis
points to 146 basis points this year, while the Australian
equivalent was last at 162 basis points, the indexes show.  Investment Boom  Australian business investment climbed to a record in the
fourth quarter, and companies forecast investment of A$128.9
billion in the year ending June 30, according to the statistics
bureau. The increase in bond sales comes after bank lending to
businesses shrank on an annual basis in February for a record
20th month, declining 1.7 percent from the same month of 2010,
according to data from the  Reserve Bank of Australia .  Asciano Ltd. (AIO) , Australia’s largest port operator, sold $1
billion of debt on March 31 including $750 million of 5 percent
2018 notes priced at a yield premium of 220 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The spread has narrowed to 193 basis
points, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices.  Resource producers must spend at least $115 billion in the
next five years to build new mines or upgrade and run existing
operations, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
estimates.  The nation expects to earn a record A$220.6 billion from
exports of commodities in the 12 months ending June 30 as faster
economic growth in  China  boosts demand for raw materials.  Growth Forecasts  The RBA raised its forecast in February for 2011 growth to
4.25 percent, from a November prediction of 3.75 percent.  The boost from commodities helped spur the Australian
dollar’s advance to a record $1.0584 against its U.S.
counterpart on April 8. The currency climbed 14 percent in the
past 12 months to trade at $1.0544 as of 5:44 p.m. in Sydney.  Australian five-year government bond yields climbed 38
basis points to 5.35 percent in the past six months as the
 Reserve Bank  raised  interest rates  seven times between October
2009 and November 2010 to curb inflation. Yields exceed those on
similar-dated Treasuries by 325 basis points, down from last
year’s peak of 405 in November.  The gap between yields on Australian  government bonds  and
inflation-indexed notes show investors expect consumer prices
will rise an annual 3.03 percent for the next five years, the
fastest among eight developed nations tracked by Bloomberg.  Bringing money borrowed in the U.S. back to Australia is
getting cheaper.  Cheaper Swap Rate  The five-year Australian dollar basis swap was at 20.5
basis points today. It peaked at 48 basis points in November
2009, and has averaged 21 basis points this month.  The  basis swap  measures the cost of switching interest
based on the  London  interbank offered rate for payments linked
to Australia’s bank bill swap rate. It falls when overseas
borrowers sell debt in Australia and seek to swap the proceeds
for U.S. dollars, and rises when Australian issuers make the
opposite transaction. Libor is the rate banks say they charge to
lend to each other, as collated in London by the  British Bankers
Association .  “Currently the combination of relatively good credit
margins in the U.S. and favorable cross-currency swap margins
combine to make the U.S. bond market attractive,” Telstra
Corporate Treasurer Cliff Davis said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  Corporate sales are also increasing in Australia’s own bond
market. Westfield Retail Trust raised A$900 million from 5.5-
year notes on April 12, a record in Australian dollars for a
REIT and the largest non-financial corporate debt offering in
the nation this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Woolworths’ five-year debt offering in Australia last month
priced at a lower borrowing cost than General Electric Co.’s
sales in the nation, the data show.  “The Australian market is an attractive alternative for
many corporates,” JPMorgan’s Vanstone said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
