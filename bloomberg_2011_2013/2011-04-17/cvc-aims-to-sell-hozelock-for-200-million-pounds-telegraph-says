CVC Capital Partners Ltd. aims to
sell the garden-hose brand Hozelock for 200 million pounds ($327
million), the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying where it
got the information. CVC is making its third attempt to divest
Hozelock in four years.  Rothschild is one of the favorites to win a beauty parade
of banks competing to advise on the sale and Black & Decker
Corp. is a possible buyer, the newspaper said. A CVC spokesman
declined to comment, the Telegraph said. Hozelock will probably
be sold by the end of the year, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
