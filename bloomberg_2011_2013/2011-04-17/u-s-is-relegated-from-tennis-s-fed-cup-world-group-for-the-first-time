The U.S. was relegated from the top
group of the  Fed Cup  for the first time following a 5-0 defeat
to  Germany  in women’s tennis’s top team competition.  The U.S. dropped out of the elite world group when  Melanie Oudin  lost 6-2, 6-3 to Andrea Petkovic at the Porsche Arena in
Stuttgart to give Germany a 3-0 lead.  “I tried not to think about it but it was extra weight on
my shoulder,” Oudin said of her need to win to avoid
relegation.  The U.S. has won the Fed Cup a record 17 times and was
runner-up to Italy the past two years. Having won the playoff,
Germany returns to the world group, comprising the top eight
countries.  Venus and  Serena Williams  haven’t represented the U.S. in
the competition since 2007. Venus hasn’t played since the
Australian Open in January and was unavailable because of a hip
injury. Serena began practicing last week, ESPN said, after two
foot operations and treatment for a blood clot in her lung
combined to keep her sidelined since Wimbledon last year.  The U.S. entered the World Group playoff after a 4-1 first-
round loss to  Belgium  in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
