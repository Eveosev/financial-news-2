Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is concerned that  Egypt â€™s new government may become
hostile to  Israel , the daily Haaretz said today, without saying

recently made by the Egyptian foreign minister have raised his
concerns, Haaretz said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
