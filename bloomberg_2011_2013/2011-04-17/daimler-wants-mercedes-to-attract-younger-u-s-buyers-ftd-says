     April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Daimler AG (DAI)  wants to revamp its
Mercedes-Benz brand in the U.S. to appeal to younger customers,
Ernst Lieb, chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz in the
U.S., said in an interview with  Financial Times Deutschland  to

the country, Lieb told the newspaper. The company wants future
