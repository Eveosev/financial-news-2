U.S. advertising sales will
increase 1.8 percent in 2011, less than last year’s 3.2 percent,
reflecting a slow recovery in the overall economy, according to
MagnaGlobal, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.  Excluding 2010 spending for the  Olympic Games  and political
races, sales this year will rise 3.1 percent, New York-based
MagnaGlobal said in a statement.  Advertising growth will be impaired by weakness in key
sections of the economy, the company said. The  International
Monetary Fund  reduced its forecast for growth in the U.S. gross
domestic product to 2.8 percent last week, citing the rising
cost of food and gasoline and “lackluster” job creation.  Large advertisers will continue to shift spending to cable
television networks from broadcast channels during the year,
MagnaGlobal said. Cable spending will increase 10.8 percent,
compared with 2.4 percent growth for broadcast networks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
