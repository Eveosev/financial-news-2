China increased banks’ reserve
requirements to lock up cash and limit inflation after economic
growth exceeded forecasts and consumer prices rose by the most
since 2008.  Reserve ratios will rise a half point from April 21, the
People’s Bank of China said in a one-sentence statement on its
website yesterday. The move, taking the requirement to 20.5
percent for the nation’s biggest lenders, came less than two
weeks after the central bank boosted benchmark  interest rates .  China will publish new  home prices  in 70 cities monitored
by the government, including Beijing and  Shanghai . The
statistics bureau is scheduled to release the numbers before 10
a.m. today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
