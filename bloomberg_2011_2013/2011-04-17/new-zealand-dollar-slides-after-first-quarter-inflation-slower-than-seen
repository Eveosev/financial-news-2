The New Zealand dollar declined
after a government report showed consumer prices climbed 0.8
percent in the first quarter from the previous three months,
slower than economists estimates for a 1 percent advance.  The currency dropped to 79.66 U.S. cents as of 10:48 a.m.
in Wellington from 79.91 cents before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
