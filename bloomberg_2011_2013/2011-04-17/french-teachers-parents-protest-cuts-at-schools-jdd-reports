French teachers and parents of
students are protesting plans by the government to slash the
number of classes, the  Journal du Dimanche  reported.  There will be 4,900 more students in primary school next
year, including pre-school, while the number of teachers will
fall by 9,000, the French weekly newspaper reported, citing
union representatives of teachers.  While teachersâ€™ unions said as many as 3,000 classes will
be cut, Education Minister Luc Chatel contested the figure,
saying about 1,500 classes would be cut, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
