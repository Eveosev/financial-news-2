Brendan Steele shot a final-round
1-under-par 71 at the Texas Open to win his first title on the
U.S.  PGA Tour .  Steele, in his 12th start on the world’s richest golf
circuit, finished the tournament at the TPC San Antonio at 8-
under par, one shot ahead of Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell.
Brandt Snedeker finished one stroke further back in fourth place.  “I’m not even sure what’s going on right now, I’m just
trying to capture it all in my mind,” Steele, who’s from
Idyllwild, California, told CBS in a televised interview.  In addition to $1.12 million in prize money, the 28-year-
old Steele earns a place at next year’s Masters Tournament,
which was won last week by Charl Schwartzel of South Africa.  The tour next moves to Harbour Town Golf Links in Hilton
Head,  South Carolina , for the  Heritage  tournament, won last year
by  Jim Furyk .  To contact the reporter on this story:
