Guinea’s President  Alpha Conde 
halted the rebuilding of a railway from the capital, Conakry, to
the city of Kankan.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s second-largest mining
company by market value, had planned to invest $1 billion in the
project.  “I do not agree with Zagope, the company to which the
project is entrusted,” Conde told reporters in Conakry
yesterday. Guinea would ask the World Bank to help conduct a
feasibility study and would hold a tender to select a builder
for the work, he said, without giving additional details. Vale,
based in Brazil, announced the 662-kilometer (411-mile) rail
project on Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ougna Camara in Conakry
