Stoke City will play in English
soccer’s F.A. Cup final for the first time after a 5-0 win over
Bolton Wanderers yesterday at Wembley Stadium in  London .  Matthew Etherington,  Robert Huth ,  Kenwyne Jones  and
Jonathan Walters (two) scored for the Potters, who will face
Manchester City in the Wembley final on May 14. City defeated
Manchester United 1-0 two days ago in the other semifinal.  “We wanted to achieve something this year,” Walters told
ESPN. “It was a tough game but we did really well from back to
front.”  Both teams had early chances yesterday, Walters forcing a
save from Jussi Jaaskelainen, then Martin Petrov had a shot
deflected wide.  Stoke took an 11th-minute lead, Etherington curling a 20-
yard shot into the net after four-time F.A. Cup winner Bolton
gave away possession in defense.  Six minutes later, Huth volleyed past Jaaskelainen to
double Stoke’s advantage and after 30 minutes the lead was 3-0.
Jermaine Pennant stole possession and slipped the ball to Jones
to score.  Walters ended any hopes of a Bolton comeback after 68
minutes with the fourth goal, adding another goal 13 minutes
later.  Bolton had been aiming for its first appearance in the
final for 53 years since winning the title in 1958. Stoke was
making only its fourth semifinal appearance.  “We are used to being the underdogs,” Etherington told
ESPN. “The manager said that before the game and we will be the
underdogs in the final as well. Bring it on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
