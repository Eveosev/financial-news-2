Saudi Arabia ’s imports of gasoline
and jet fuel more than tripled in February from the previous
month as domestic output declined, official data showed.  Saudi Arabia, holder of the world’s largest proven oil
reserves, imported 65,000 barrels a day of gasoline and aviation
fuel in the month, compared with imports of 19,000 barrels a day
in January, according to data posted on the  website  of the Joint
Organization Data Initiative.  Gasoline production at Saudi refineries fell to 365,000
barrels a day in February, down 59,000 barrels a day from
January’s level, the data showed. The data initiative is
overseen by the Riaydh-based  International Energy Forum , a
gathering of energy ministers from 86 producing and consuming
countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
