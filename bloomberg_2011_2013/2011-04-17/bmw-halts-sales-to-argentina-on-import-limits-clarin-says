Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) 
suspended its sales to  Argentina  after it failed to reach an
accord with the government to shrink the company’s trade deficit
in the country, newspaper  Clarin  said, citing sources at the
automaker it didn’t identify.  Argentina has signed accords with automakers to allow them
to import vehicles for sale as long as they export goods for the
same value, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. The
government is seeking to reduce the auto industry’s trade
deficit, Clarin reported.  The lack of an accord led the Munich-based company to ship
about 1,000 BMW vehicles that were seized by Argentine customs
to  Brazil , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
