Corn and soybeans may rise this
week as wet, cool weather may delay planting in  Canada  and the
U.S., increasing the risk of reduced acreage and yields.  Twenty-two of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on April 15 said corn will advance, and 19 of 32
respondents forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the
Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for July delivery dropped
3.2 percent to $7.495 a bushel, snapping a four-week rally, and
soybean futures for July fell 4.3 percent to $13.4325 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s declines in corn and soybeans were a surprise
to the majority of respondents surveyed on April 8. Since 2004,
the surveys have been correct 56 percent of the time for corn,
and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 22    Bullish on soybeans: 19
Bearish on corn:  9    Bearish on soybeans: 13  To contact the reporter on this story:
