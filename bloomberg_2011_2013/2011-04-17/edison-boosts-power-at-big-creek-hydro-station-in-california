Edison International (EIX) , owner of
California’s largest electric utility, increased power output at
a hydroelectric generating plant.  The company’s 820-megawatt Big Creek Hydro Project was
generating 659 megawatts as of 3:15 p.m. local time yesterday,
according to a  report  by the California Independent System
Operator. The plant was producing 543 megawatts a day earlier, a
previous  report  showed.  The Big Creek system is about 250 miles (400 kilometers)
northeast of Los Angeles. One megawatt can power about 800
average U.S. homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
