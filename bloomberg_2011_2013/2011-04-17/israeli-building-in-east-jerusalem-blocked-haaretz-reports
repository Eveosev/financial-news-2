Israeli building in east  Jerusalem 
has been blocked for political reasons, the daily Haaretz said,
citing remarks by Housing Minister Ariel Atias.   Atias said that construction of 2,500 new homes has been
halted due to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s commitment to
the U.S. Administration, according to Haaretz.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
