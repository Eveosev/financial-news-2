Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  plans to
sell its 60 percent stake in  St James’s Place Plc (STJ)  as it disposes
of assets owned by HBOS Plc, which it acquired in 2008, the
 Sunday Express  said, without saying where it got the
information.  St James’s Place may be worth 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG will probably
handle the sale, the newspaper said.  Sarah Sawiles, a spokeswoman for London-based Lloyds,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
