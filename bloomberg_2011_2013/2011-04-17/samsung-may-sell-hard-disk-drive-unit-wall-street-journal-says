Samsung Electronics Co. may sell
its hard-disk-drive unit to raise cash for expansion, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the plan.  The Seoul-based company would like to divest the unit for
$1.5 billion, though it would consider offers of less than $1
billion, the newspaper reported, citing the person. Seagate
Technology is the most likely buyer, the person said, according
to the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
