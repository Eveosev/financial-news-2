The head of the Accounting and
Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions,
Mohamad Nedal Alchaar, will leave his post at the regulator
after being appointed  Syria ’s Minister of Economy and Trade.  Alchaar, who headed AAOIFI since 2003, will continue to
serve as secretary general for the next three months as the
Bahrain-based regulator looks for a replacement, the body said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Syria, where Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s Baath party
has been in power since 1963, is the latest Middle Eastern
country to be hit by a wave of uprisings that ousted longtime
rulers in Egypt and Tunisia and sparked armed conflict in Libya.  AAOIFI , which has more than 200 members, set 86 accounting
and auditing standards that are used in Bahrain, the Dubai
International Financial Centre, Jordan, Lebanon and Qatar,
according to its website. The agency said its guidelines have
also been used to help frame policy in Indonesia, Malaysia,
 Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and South Africa.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
