Wang Qing , chief  China  economist at
Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, talks about China’s decision to
increase bank reserve ratios by half point from April 21.  The move, taking the requirement to 20.5 percent for the
nation’s biggest lenders, came less than two weeks after the
central bank boosted benchmark  interest rates .  Gross domestic product rose 9.7 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier and inflation accelerated to 5.4
percent, the most since July 2008, the statistics bureau said
April 15.  “The timing is in reaction to the high inflation rate
released on Friday. Over the next two weeks there is a large
amount of central bank bills maturing. When they start to
mature, there will be liquidity injection into the economy, so
they need to raise reserve ratio to offset the liquidity
implication.”  “The market was a bit relaxed in thinking policy stance is
unlikely to tighten further. But with the high inflation rate
for March on Friday, and comments by PBoC’s Zhou (Xiaochuan) on
Friday at the Boao forum and this reserve ratio hike, the market
will start to start pricing in more aggressive monetary
tightening going forward.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
