A group of  Barclays Plc (BARC)  investors,
which together hold more than 10 percent of its equity, have
told the board they would prefer the British bank to be
domiciled outside of the U.K., the  Sunday Telegraph  reported.  Basing the bank in  New York  or another city outside the
U.K. would be preferable from a tax and regulatory perspective
and provide better returns for shareholders, the newspaper said,
citing an investor it didnâ€™t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
