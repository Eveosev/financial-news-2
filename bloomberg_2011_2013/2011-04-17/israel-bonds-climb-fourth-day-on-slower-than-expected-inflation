Israel ’s 10-year government bond
climbed for a fourth day, pushing yields to the lowest level in
a month, as consumer prices rose less than expected, spurring
bets the pace of interest rate increases may slow.  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.3 percent in March from
4.2 percent the previous month, below the 4.4 percent expected
by economists in a Bloomberg News survey, the Jerusalem-based
 Central Bureau of Statistics  said April 15. In the U.S., the
consumer-price index, excluding volatile food and energy
charges, rose 0.1 percent, less than the 0.2 percent increase
projected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We expect the governor to leave interest rates unchanged
at the end of the month as the U.S. may wait longer to start
raising  interest rates ,” Yaniv Hevron, head of macro-strategy
at  Ramat Gan , Israel-based Excellence Nessuah Investment House
Ltd., said by telephone. “A widening interest rate differential
with the U.S. is more of a concern to the central bank than
inflation.”  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 slid 3 basis points to 5.23 percent at 12:16 p.m. in Tel
Aviv, the lowest since March 17. The shekel was little changed
at 3.4181 per dollar on April 15.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  raised the
benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point at the end of
March, the biggest increase in five years, as inflation
accelerated past the government’s 3 percent ceiling for a second
month. The rate stands at 3 percent, the highest since November
2008. Fischer will leave the rate unchanged on April 24,
according to 10 of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg at the
end of March and the beginning of April. Three predict a
quarter-point increase and the other three a half-point boost.  Inflation expectations, as derived from the bond market
declined with the spread between inflation-linked bonds due
October 2014 and fixed-rate notes of similar maturity narrowing
17 basis points to 315.5 points today from 332.8 points on April
14. That implies expected inflation of about 3.2 percent, down
from 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
