Dubai’s benchmark stock index
entered a so-called bull market today after rebounding 20
percent from this year’s low.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  advanced less than 0.1 percent to
1,623 at 10:02 a.m. in Dubai, surpassing the 20 percent
threshold some investors consider as the beginning of a bull
market.  The index declined 4.6 percent in the first quarter,
reaching a low of 1,352.24 on March 3, after uprisings in the
Middle East and North Africa that ousted Egypt and Tunisia’s
leaders reached the Persian Gulf states of Oman,  Saudi Arabia 
and Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
