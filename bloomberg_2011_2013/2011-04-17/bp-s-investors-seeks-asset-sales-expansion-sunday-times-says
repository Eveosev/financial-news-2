BP Plc (BP/) ’s 10 biggest investors want
the company to sell as much as half its assets, expanding an
existing $30 billion asset-sale program, the  Sunday Times 
reported, citing an unidentified shareholder in the group.  They want BP to become a smaller and faster-growing company
so that it becomes an interesting investment, the investor was
cited as saying.  Investors have also expressed doubts about what Chairman
Carl Henrik Svanberg brings to the company, the newspaper said.
Svanberg was re-elected for another year as chairman last week
with 92 percent of the votes, BP told the Sunday Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
