Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said the
imposition of European Union travel bans and asset freezes
against 32 Iranian officials are an effort to distract public
opinion from abuses committed by Western nations.  The chiefs of Iran’s prosecutor’s office, police and
government-backed militia are among the individuals subject to
the sanctions following the EU’s April 12 decision. The bloc’s
foreign ministers said they were “complicit or responsible for
directing or implementing grave human-rights violations”
against Iranians.  The EU’s measures are an attempt “to divert attention”
from cases of human rights violations committed by Western
governments in their own countries and in countries in the
region, including Iraq and Afghanistan as well as “crimes
committed” by  Israel , Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  said, according to  Press TV.   To contact the reporter on this story:
