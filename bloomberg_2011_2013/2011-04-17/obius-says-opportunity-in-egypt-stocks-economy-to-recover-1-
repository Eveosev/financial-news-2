 Mark Mobius  sees opportunities in Egyptian stocks and expects
the economy and equity market to recover in a year after a
popular uprising ousted the North African country’s president.  Mobius, who oversees about $34 billion, is “very
optimistic” about changes in the Middle East, he said at a
media roundtable in Dubai today. “One of the benefits of the
events happening at this time in history is that there is a lot
of liquidity in the global economic system. Everybody is pumping
money into the system and this money needs a home. It’s looking
for a home.”  Eighteen days of protests in  Egypt , sparked by falling
living standards, high unemployment and a lack of democratic
rights, led to the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  on Feb. 11. The
economy is still reeling from the impact of the uprising. Growth
may slow this fiscal year to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent
from 5.1 percent in the previous year, Finance Minister Samir Radwan said.  Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  has slumped 28 percent this year after
the demonstrations forced the bourse to shut on Jan. 27 and
trading remained suspended for almost two months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
