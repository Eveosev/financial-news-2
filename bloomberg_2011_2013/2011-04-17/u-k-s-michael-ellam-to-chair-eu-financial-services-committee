Michael Ellam, managing director of
the U.K. Treasury’s international and finance directorate, has
been appointed chairman of the European Union’s financial
services regulation committee.  Ellam will steer the work of the Brussels-based panel ahead
of meetings of the EU’s 27 finance ministers while retaining his
role at the Treasury in  London , two U.K. government officials
said today. Another U.K. official, Verena Ross, director of the
Financial Services Authority’s international division, was
appointed director of the European Securities and Markets
Authority, the two officials told reporters in Washington. The
officials asked not to be identified by name, citing government
policy.  “Part of maintaining the U.K.’s place as the world’s
leading financial market-place is making sure we’re at the heart
of the global effort to reform the sector to make it stronger
and safer,” Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in
a statement released by his office. “That’s why it’s so
important that two of our top policy makers will be at the
center of both making the rules and implementing them.”  The appointments will give the U.K. a greater say in the
shaping of EU financial regulation after losing out to France
when  Michel Barnier  took over as EU Financial Services
Commissioner last year. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said
that the U.K. was the “big loser” when the commission jobs
were awarded.  Ellam was previously a spokesman for Prime Minister  Gordon Brown .  To contact the reporters on this story:
