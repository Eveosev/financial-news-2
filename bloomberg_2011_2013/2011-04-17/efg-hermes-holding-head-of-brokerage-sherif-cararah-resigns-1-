EFG-Hermes Holding SAE’s head of
brokerage and board member Sherif Cararah has resigned and will
be replaced by Mohamed Ebeid and Ahmed Waly, said Chief
Executive Officer Yasser El Mallawany.  “Sherif made us number one in his 15 years at EFG,” El
Mallawany said in a telephone interview today. “This
resignation was pre-planned from last year for personal
reasons.”  Cararah will remain with EFG-Hermes, the biggest publicly
traded investment bank in  Egypt , until the end of June “to
ensure an orderly handover,” the Cairo-based company said in an
e-mailed statement. The shares dropped 5.8 percent to 19.59
Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo today, valuing the company
at 7.5 billion pounds ($1.3 billion).  “There is never a good time to make this type of decision,
but it has been no secret with the firm in the past year that I
have wanted to move on for family reasons,” Cararah said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
