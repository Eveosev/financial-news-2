National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)  SAK said
first-quarter profit rose 6 percent as the country’s biggest
lender reduced its non-performing loan ratio.  Net income increased to 80.8 million dinars ($292 million)
from 76.3 million dinars a year earlier, the bank said in an e-
mailed statement today. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE forecast a profit
of 77 million dinars for the quarter, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The global credit crisis weakened lending and investment
banking in the Middle East, pushing up provisions for loan
defaults and a decline in the value of banks’ investments.
Kuwait was forced to guarantee all deposits at local banks in
2008 after  Gulf Bank KSC (GBK)  lost $1.3 billion in derivatives
trading and  Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) , the country’s biggest
investment bank, defaulted on $2.8 billion of debt.  Non-performing loans to gross loans ratio declined to 1.69
percent at the end of March from 1.81 percent, while NPL
coverage was at 202.8 percent. The bank’s total assets were 13.9
billion dinars at the end of March this year.  The results “are a testament to our ability to generate
strong returns despite challenging regional and global
conditions,” Chief Executive Officer Ibrahim Dabdoub said in the
statement. “This is due to our solid core banking operations in
and outside Kuwait.”  NBK raised its capital by 10 percent to 360 million dinars
in October in a rights share offering that was more than five
times oversubscribed. The shares gained 1.7 percent to 1,200
fils on April 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
