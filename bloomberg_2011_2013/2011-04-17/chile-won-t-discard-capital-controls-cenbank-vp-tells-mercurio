Chile ’s central bank may eventually
discuss  capital controls  as a measure of last resort to stem
capital inflows,  El Mercurio  reported, citing an interview with
Manuel Marfan, the bank’s vice president.  The central bank will not rule out any instrument it’s
legally allowed to use, such as capital controls, especially as
local  interest rates  are rising and rates in other regions
remain low, the Santiago-based newspaper said, citing Marfan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
