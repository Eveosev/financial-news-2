More money than ever is flowing to
mutual funds that buy both stocks and bonds, a sign that
individuals are starting to return to equities during the most
volatile  bull market  since at least 1942.  About $18.6 billion was added to so-called hybrid funds
last quarter, the most since the  Investment Company Institute 
started tracking the  data  in 1984. The record flows show that
while investors remain skittish after the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression, they want more equities after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index doubled since March 2009.  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and rising oil prices are
spurring the widest price swings since 1942, providing investors
with another reason to limit purchases after pumping 232 times
more money into debt funds over the last two years. That’s
bullish to Fiduciary Trust Co. and Credit Suisse Asset
Management, which say the doubts mean more money is available in
what is already the biggest rally since 1955.  “It’s a chicken step into the equity market,” said
Michael Mullaney, who manages $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in
 Boston . “Very few investors, especially on the retail side,
have been on board with this rally. That’s why we think this
market still has legs to run because one major investor still
hasn’t shown up to the party.”  Occidental Petroleum  Mullaney said he bought  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  shares
on speculation the oil producer will increase revenue and
profits faster than other companies as energy demand rises.
Analysts have boosted profit estimates for the current fiscal
year at the Los Angeles-based company by 17 percent since Dec.
31 to $8.18 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks retreated today after S&P put a “negative” outlook
on the U.S.’s AAA credit rating, citing rising budget deficits
and debt. The S&P 500 dropped 14.54 points, or 1.1 percent, to
1,305.14 as of 5:30 p.m. in  New York .  Last week the index fell 0.6 percent after sales from
Pittsburgh-based  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer,
trailed analysts’ projections and jobless claims unexpectedly
increased. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Apple Inc. are among
more than 100 companies in the benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks
scheduled to release results this week.  Profits for S&P 500 companies probably climbed 12 percent
in the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2009, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fund Inflows  Funds that buy stocks and bonds absorbed $1.24 billion in
the week ending April 6. Equity funds, with seven times more in
assets, took in $2.44 billion. Bond funds got $5.22 billion,
data from Washington-based ICI show.  Investors have added $604 billion to debt funds since March
2009, compared with $2.6 billion for equities, according to ICI
data through March 31. The  S&P 500  has gained 104 percent
including dividends in the past 25 months, while Barclays
Capital’s index of U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds
returned 35 percent.  “People have been traumatized by equities in the U.S. and
have started to look for a more balanced approach,” said Adrian Zuercher, who helps oversee $150 billion in asset allocation
strategies at Credit Suisse in Zurich. “Given all the money
that has gone into  government bonds , sooner or later they have
to bring back some money into the equity segment.”  Mutual-Fund Industry  Hybrids vary from balanced funds, which maintain a specific
mix of equities and bonds, to flexible funds that can put any
portion of their assets in stocks, debt or money-market
securities. They make up 6.5 percent of the $12.1 trillion U.S.
mutual fund industry, according to ICI.  The average hybrid allocates 60 percent to stocks, 34
percent to bonds and the rest to cash, options, warrants and
other securities, according to December data from the
Washington-based trade group. That compares with 58 percent in
equities and 36 percent in debt the previous year.  St. Denis J. Villere & Co.’s $83 million Villere Balanced
Fund, created in 1999, has returned 30 percent in the past 12
months, about three times more than the S&P 500, making it the
top performer among 225 balanced U.S. equity funds tracked by
Bloomberg. The biggest holding as of March 31 was  3D Systems
Corp. (TDSC) , a maker of imaging systems in Rock Hill,  South Carolina ,
that has risen more than 230 percent in the past year.  ‘Peace of Mind’  “A lot of clients, having gone through the dark days of
‘08 and ‘09, want peace of mind,” said George Young, co-owner
with three family members of the century-old asset manager,
which oversees about $1.5 billion. At the same time, “they
realize now that equities are a viable investment,” he said.  Villere started buying more stocks and high-yield bonds in
April 2009 just after equity indexes bottomed, boosting share
holdings from a low of 60 percent to as high as 68 percent, said
Young, who helps oversee the balanced fund. Its assets have
grown from about $50 million in August 2010, mostly through
gains in asset prices.  The rally in equities may slow amid turmoil from  Greece  to
Libya and  Japan , said Sybren Brouwer, the global head of equity
research at ABN Amro Bank NV’s private-banking division. He said
his team reduced its allocation for shares to “neutral” from
“overweight.”  “We’ve had the  Europe  debt crisis and increasing inflation
concerns in the emerging markets, and on top of that we had
unrest in the Middle East and  Africa  and of course the natural
disaster in Japan,” said Brouwer, who helps oversee more than
$200 billion. “Adding that all up makes us a little bit more
concerned on equity markets in the short term.”  Greek Bond Yields  Yields on 10-year Greek bonds reached a record 13.84
percent last week amid concern Europe’s most-indebted nations
will be forced to restructure. Oil climbed as high at $113.46 a
barrel on April 11 and Japan raised the severity rating of the
nuclear crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant to the same level as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  Historical volatility for the S&P 500 has averaged 19.5
since March 2009, higher than the first two years of all rallies
dating back to 1942, based on 30-day data compiled by Bloomberg
and Birinyi Associates Inc., the Westport, Connecticut-based
research firm. The measure of daily swings is above the levels
of 16.3 during the 2002 rally and 13.2 from the 1990 advance,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The prospect of higher  interest rates  may be driving fixed-
income investors to hybrids. Bond prices dropped 5.5 cents since
Sept. 30 to as low as 105.93 cents on Feb. 8, the least since
June, sending yields up 59 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate Master Index.  Corporate-Bond Returns  Credit analysts at firms including New York-based Goldman
Sachs and Bank of America Corp. in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina ,
forecast that returns would be below 10 percent from corporate
bonds this year.  The yield on 10-year Treasury notes will reach 4.05 percent
by March, according to the median estimate of 66 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, up from 3.41 percent on April 15.  Balanced funds have beaten U.S. investment-grade company
debt for seven of the past eight months, returning 17 percentage
points more over the period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and Barclays. They’ve increased 4.6 percent this year,
trailing the S&P 500’s 5.5 percent advance including dividend
payments.  “The whole area of balanced fund investing has really made
a resurgence,” said  Hayes Miller , the Boston-based head of
asset allocation in  North America  at Baring Asset Management
Inc., which oversees $51.6 billion. For individuals, “the
safest way they feel they can go about it is to pass that asset
allocation decision along to a professional.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
