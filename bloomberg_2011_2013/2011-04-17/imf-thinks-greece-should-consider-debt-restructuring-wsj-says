The  International Monetary Fund 
believes  Greece ’s debt is unsustainable and that the country’s
government should consider a restructuring as early as next
year, the Wall Street Journal said, citing three unidentified
people familiar with the situation.  Senior IMF officials have told European Commission and
euro-zone governments that a restructuring should be considered,
the paper said. IMF, which hasn’t recommended a restructuring of
all the country’s debt, has considered extending its loan
repayment schedule, IMF spokesman William Murray told the paper.  Euro-zone officials, including finance ministers, have said
it is necessary to restructure Greece’s debt and the  European
Central Bank  responded by saying it didn’t want a public
discussion, an unidentified official familiar with the situation
told WSJ.  A first step would be to substantially extend Greek bond
maturities, another unidentified official said, according to the
paper. That may include extending debt repayments by as much as
30 years, the official said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
