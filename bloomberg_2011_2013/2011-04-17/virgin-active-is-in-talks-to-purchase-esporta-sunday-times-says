Virgin Active Ltd., the chain of
gyms owned by  Richard Branson , is in talks to buy smaller U.K.
competitor Esporta Plc from  Societe Generale (GLE)  and an agreement
may be announced in a couple of weeks, the  Sunday Times 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Esporta will probably be split into a property owner and a
gym-operating company and Virgin will purchase the latter, the
newspaper said. Esporta and Virgin declined to comment, the
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
