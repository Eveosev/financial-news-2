ConocoPhillips (COP)  said 142 pounds of
benzene and 268 pounds of unspecified volatile organic compounds
escaped from a wastewater treatment tank at its Sweeny refinery
in Old Ocean,  Texas , because a pollution control device failed.  Emissions began at 5:54 p.m. local time yesterday and
repairs may be complete today, Houston-based ConocoPhillips, the
third-largest publicly traded U.S. oil company said today in a
filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  A failed valve, as well as failure of a motor that operates
the valve, caused the emission, according to the filing. The
valve was removed for repairs and a replacement motor ordered,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
