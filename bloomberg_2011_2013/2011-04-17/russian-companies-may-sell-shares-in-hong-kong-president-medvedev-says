Several Russian companies may sell
shares in  Hong Kong , following the example of aluminum producer
United Co. Rusal, President  Dmitry Medvedev  said today while
touring the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Power generator EuroSibEnergo Plc, which supplies
electricity to Rusal, may hold an initial public offering next
year, Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska , who controls both
Rusal and EuroSibEnergo, told reporters in Hong Kong today.  Otkritie Financial Corp., billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg ’s
Renova Group and renewable energy producer OAO RusHydro are the
other companies that might sell shares in Hong Kong, said an
official in the Russian delegation, who declined to be named
because he isn’t authorized to speak for the companies.  Maria Gurevich, a spokeswoman for Otkritie in Moscow,
confirmed that the company is considering a share sale in Hong
Kong. Yelena Vishnyakova, a spokeswoman for RysHydro, wasn’t
available for immediate comment today. Andrei Shtorkh,  a
spokesman for Renova, didn’t answer his cell phone.  Renova is considering selling shares of its Kamchatka Gold
unit in Hong Kong in late 2011, Interfax said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
