Mario Gomez  scored three goals as
 Bayern Munich  routed Bayer Leverkusen 5-1 to dent its opponent’s
German soccer title chances. Napoli’s bid for a first Italian
league championship since 1990 was hit by a 2-1 loss to Udinese.  Gomez got all his goals in the first half yesterday, after
Simon Rolfes’s own goal, as Bayern took a 4-0 lead. Eren
Derdiyok got one back for Leverkusen before Franck Ribery
completed the scoring for the home team, which fired coach Louis van Gaal last week.  Borussia Dortmund  beat Freiburg 3-0 to open up an eight-
point lead over Leverkusen atop the Bundesliga with four games
remaining as it seeks its first title since 2002. Bayern is
third with 55 points and Hanover has 54.  In  Italy ’s Serie A, Napoli’s four-match winning streak
ended with a 2-1 home loss last night.  The defeat leaves Napoli six points behind leader AC Milan,
a 3-0 winner over Sampdoria two days ago, with five games
remaining. AC Milan leads with 71 points, Napoli has 65 and
Inter Milan has 63 after a 2-0 defeat at Parma two days ago.  In Spain, Barcelona remains eight points ahead of second-
place Real Madrid after the archrivals drew 1-1 two days ago at
the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. Both goals came from the penalty
spot in the second half, Cristiano Ronaldo leveling after  Lionel Messi  put the visitor ahead.  In  France , defending champion Marseille narrowed the gap on
leader Lille to a point with a 2-1 win at Montpellier yesterday.
Paris Saint-Germain beat third-place Lyon 1-0 in the late game
as Zoumana Camara’s 76th-minute goal took the capital club up to
fourth place. Arles-Avignon will be relegated after a 1-0 defeat
by Valenciennes.  PSV Eindhoven drew level on points with Netherlands leader
FC Twente after a 2-0 win at Heracles Almelo yesterday. Twente
drew 1-1 at De Graafschap. Ajax is a point back in third place
following a 2-1 win at  NEC Nijmegen .  WEEKEND RESULTS
