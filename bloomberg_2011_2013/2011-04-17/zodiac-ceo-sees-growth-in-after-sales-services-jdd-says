Zodiac Aerospace (ZC) , a French maker of
seats, galleys, toilets and baggage storage compartments for
commercial aircraft, sees potential for growth in revenue from
after-sales services, Chief Executive Officer Olivier Zarrouati
told Journal du Dimanche in an interview.  Zarrouati said the global fleet of commercial aircraft in
service has doubled over the last 10 years and Zodiac expects to
benefit from demand for servicing equipment for planes,
especially after opening new offices in China and  Singapore ,
according to the interview.  Zodiac has made 30 acquisitions over the last 15 years,
expanding its activities in seats, escape chutes, and building
its presence in the U.S., the executive said, declining to tell
the newspaper whether the company plans further acquisitions.  Zodiac is making 400 aircraft seats a day, about a third of
world production for new planes, the executive said, estimating
the value of the seats market at $2 billion a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
