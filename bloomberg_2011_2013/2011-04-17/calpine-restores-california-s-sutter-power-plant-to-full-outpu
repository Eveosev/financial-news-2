Calpine Corp. (CPN) , the biggest U.S.
producer of natural gas-fueled power, restored a Northern
California generator to full output after planned work.  The company’s 525-megawatt Sutter Power Plant was operating
at full capacity as of 3:15 p.m. local time yesterday, the
California Independent System Operator said in a  report . The
generator in Yuba City was producing 200 megawatts at the same
time a day earlier, a previous  report  showed.  One megawatt can power 800 typical U.S. homes, according to
the Department of Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
