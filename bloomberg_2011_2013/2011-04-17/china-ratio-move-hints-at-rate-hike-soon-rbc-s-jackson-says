Brian Jackson , an emerging-markets
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong , talks about
China’s decision to increase bank reserve ratios by a half point
from April 21.  The move, taking the requirement to 20.5 percent for the
nation’s biggest lenders, came less than two weeks after the
central bank boosted benchmark interest rates.  Gross domestic product rose 9.7 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier and inflation accelerated to 5.4
percent, the most since July 2008, the statistics bureau said
April 15.  “Beijing did not take long to respond to the strong
inflation number on Friday. Governor Zhou (Xiaochuan) also
struck a hawkish tone in comments made over the weekend, so this
move comes as no surprise.  ‘‘We revised up our forecast for policy rates in response
to the inflation data, and now expect another increase in the
benchmark lending rate this quarter, in addition to the one we
were already forecasting for later in the year. Today’s move
suggest that another increase in  interest rates  is on the way
soon.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
