Honam Petrochemical Corp. (011170) ,  South
Korea ’s second-biggest ethylene producer, plans to buy out
minority shareholders in subsidiary KP Chemical Corp. this year
as it seeks expansion and revenue growth in  Asia .  “We need to beef up our petrochemicals business and become
big enough to compete throughout Asia,” Chief Executive Officer
Chong Bum Shick said yesterday. “We are open to acquisitions.”  Honam, which targets sales of 40 trillion won ($37 billion)
by 2018 from an estimated 14 trillion won this year, is
diversifying its products, betting on rising demand for low-
carbon energy business as governments tighten regulations on
emissions.  Seoul-based Honam acquired Malaysia’s Titan Chemicals Corp.
in 2010 for 1.5 trillion won and said last week it will partner
ZBB Energy Corp. of the U.S. to move into the energy -storage
business. KP Chemical, which is 52 percent owned by Honam, has
production bases in Korea, the U.K. and Pakistan.  Shares of Honam almost tripled in  Seoul  trading in the past
year, the sixth-best performance on South Korea’s benchmark
Kospi 200 stock index. The shares gained 0.9 percent to 382,000
won on Friday, compared with a 0.03 percent decline by the Kospi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
