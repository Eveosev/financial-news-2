A prominent Bahraini human rights
lawyer was arrested after at least two dozen security officers
raided his home,  Human Rights Watch  said.  Mohammed al-Tajer is the first defense lawyer detained by
Bahraini authorities in more than a decade, New York-based Human
Rights Watch said  in a statement  on their website yesterday.
Uniformed and plainclothes police confiscated mobile phones,
documents and laptops before detaining al-Tajer, the
organization said, citing his wife Huda. He is among 499 people
currently being detained, the rights group said, citing figures
from Wefaq National Islamic Society, the kingdom’s biggest
opposition group.  Calls and e-mails to  Bahrain ’s Interior Ministry weren’t
immediately returned.  Bahrain declared a three-month state of emergency on March
15 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf states arrived
to help quell protests led by majority Shiites, who are calling
for more democracy and civil rights. Some groups have escalated
their demands since protests began two months ago to include the
overthrow of the Sunni rulers, the Al Khalifa family, and the
creation of a republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
