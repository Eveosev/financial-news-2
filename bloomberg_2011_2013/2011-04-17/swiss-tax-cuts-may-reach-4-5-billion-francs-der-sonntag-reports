Switzerland ’s tax reforms in recent
years may reduce the confederation’s income by 4.5 billion Swiss
francs a year, Der Sonntag said today, citing a confidential
Department of Finance document.  The government is already losing three billion francs a
year after property, family and business tax changes and will go
without another 1.5 billion francs a year according to plans for
further concessions, the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
