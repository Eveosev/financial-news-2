Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s European
headquarters in  London  may be sold for more than 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) to China Investment Corp., the country’s
sovereign wealth fund, the Mail on Sunday reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The 42-story building in  Canary Wharf , owned by Glenn Maud
and Derek Quinlan, was put up on the market earlier this month.
The tower generates annual rental income of 57.6 million pounds,
according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the property broker conducting
the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
