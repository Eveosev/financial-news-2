Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
it will take time to update Britain’s centuries-old rules of
succession to the throne to give first-born princesses the same
rights as their brothers to become monarch.  Discussions about an end to discrimination against women in
the line of royal succession have been given urgency by the
wedding of Prince William, the second in line to the throne, to
Kate Middleton on April 29. Under the current rules, the
couple’s first male child would overtake any elder daughters in
the line of succession.  “Everyone in the front line of politics agrees that this
does need to change and indeed there are conversations ongoing
about this,” Cameron said in an interview with Sky News
television yesterday. “But it clearly does take some time
because the queen is not just the queen of the United Kingdom,
but of many other countries around the world.”  Queen Elizabeth II is also monarch of  Canada ,  Australia  and
 New Zealand , as well as nine countries in the Caribbean and
three in the South Pacific.  Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said yesterday that the
rules of succession are “a little old-fashioned,” the U.K.’s
Press Association newswire reported.  “If Prince William and Catherine Middleton were to have a
baby daughter as their first child, I think most people would
think it is perfectly fair and normal that she would eventually
become queen of our country,” PA cited Clegg as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
