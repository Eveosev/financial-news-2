National Express Group Plc (NEX)  hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise the company as it tries to
prevent the appointment of three board members nominated by
Elliott Advisors, the U.S. hedge fund thatâ€™s its biggest
shareholder, the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Elliott Advisors wants the bus and railway operator to
adopt a new growth plan, wring value from a Spanish unit that
delivers a quarter of sales and evaluate a merger with
Stagecoach Group Plc or FirstGroup Plc, a person familiar with
the campaign said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
