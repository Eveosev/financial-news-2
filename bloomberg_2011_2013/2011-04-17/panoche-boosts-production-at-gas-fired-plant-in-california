Panoche Energy Center, a central
 California  power plant owned by U.S. Power Fund II LP, increased
production at the plant yesterday.  The plant, which can generate 400 megawatts, was producing
299 megawatts as of 3:15 p.m. local time yesterday, the
California Independent System Operator said in a  report.  Output
was 200 megawatts a day earlier, according to a  previous  report.
One megawatt is enough power for 800 average U.S. homes.  The Fresno County plant, which has four natural-gas-fired
combustion turbine generators, began operation in  July  2009,
according to a government filing. Panoche Energy Center has a
20-year agreement to supply power to Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,
California’s largest utility.  U.S. Power Fund II LP is managed by  Energy Investors Funds ,
invests in the U.S. electric power market, according to the
company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
