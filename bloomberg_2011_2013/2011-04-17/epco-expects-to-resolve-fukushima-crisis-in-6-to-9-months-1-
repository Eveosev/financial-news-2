Tokyo  Electric Power Co. expects to
resolve the crisis at its tsunami-hit Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant within six to nine months under a two-phase plan.  The utility known as Tepco expects a sustained reduction in
radiation levels at the plant within three months, the company
said in a statement handed out to reporters at a conference in
Tokyo today. Following that, the utility expects to achieve a
cold shutdown of the reactors, where the temperature inside the
core drops below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit),
within three to six months, according to the statement.  Engineers battled to cool reactors by spraying water from
helicopters, water cannons and fire engines after a magnitude-9
earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station on March 11 and knocked out its cooling system.
Radiation levels in the sea near the plant rose after highly
radioactive water leaked into the ocean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
