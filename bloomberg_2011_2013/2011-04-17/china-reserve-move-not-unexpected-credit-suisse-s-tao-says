Dong Tao, a Hong Kong-based
economist with Credit Suisse Group AG, talks about  China ’s
decision to increase bank reserve ratios by a half point from
April 21.  The move, taking the requirement to 20.5 percent for the
nation’s biggest lenders, came less than two weeks after the
central bank boosted benchmark  interest rates .  Gross domestic product rose 9.7 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier and inflation accelerated to 5.4
percent, the most since July 2008, the statistics bureau said
April 15.  “Not unexpected. A response to CPI out last Friday.
Private segment of the economy has already seen tight liquidity.
I don’t know how much can PBoC further raise reserve ration
requirements. Probably need to use other tools as well.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
