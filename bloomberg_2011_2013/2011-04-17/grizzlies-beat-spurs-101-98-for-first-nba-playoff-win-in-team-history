The  Boston Celtics  won their
National Basketball Association playoff opener 87-85 on a 3-
pointer by Ray Allen that denied the New York Knicks a first
postseason victory in 10 years.  Allen scored 24 points and hit the game-winning shot with
11 seconds left as the Celtics erased a 12-point halftime
deficit yesterday at TD Garden in Boston. Carmelo Anthony was
held to 15 points on 5-of-18 shooting for the Knicks and missed
a 3-pointer with one second left.  “Defensively we joined the playoffs in the second half,”
Celtics coach Doc Rivers said during a news conference.  The Celtics pulled out the win after the top two seeds in
the Western Conference -- the  San Antonio Spurs  and  Los Angeles
Lakers  -- were beaten at home. It’s the first time since 1984
that the No. 1 and No. 2 seed from the same conference lost
their playoff openers.  The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the top-seeded Spurs 101-98
for their first postseason win in franchise history and the New
Orleans Hornets beat the defending NBA-champion Lakers 109-100
as 10-point underdogs.  The Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Denver Nuggets 107-103
in Game 1 of their Western Conference series last night behind a
41-point effort by  Kevin Durant .  The  Chicago Bulls , the top seed in the East, host the
 Indiana Pacers  in Game 2 of their best-of-seven series after
winning the opener two days ago. The  Miami Heat  are home to the
Philadelphia 76ers in today’s other NBA playoff game.  Final Five  Boston  kept the Knicks winless in the postseason since
April 29, 2001, scoring the final five points after Toney Douglas gave New York an 85-82 lead by hitting a 3-pointer with
37 seconds left.  After a basket by Boston’s  Kevin Garnett , Anthony was
whistled for an offensive foul with 21 seconds remaining.
Anthony, who had three points over the final 24 minutes, said
afterwards he didn’t agree with the call.  “What I thought and what they called was two different
things,” said Anthony.  The Celtics then got the ball to Allen and the NBA’s career
leader in 3-pointers hit the game-winner. Anthony was short on
his final 3-point attempt.  Amar’e Stoudemire scored 28 points to lead the Knicks, who
were making their first playoff appearance since 2004. Paul Pierce added 18 points for Boston, the third seed in the Eastern
Conference, while Garnett had 15 points and 13 rebounds. The
Celtics, who have won 17 of their past 19 meetings against the
sixth-seeded Knicks, will host Game 2 of the best-of-seven
series tomorrow.  ‘Great Chance’  “We had a great chance to win. We just didn’t quite close
it out down the stretch,” Stoudemire said. “In the playoffs,
you have to take these games and learn from them.”  At the AT&T Center in  San Antonio , Zach Randolph scored 25
points and had 14 rebounds to lead the Grizzlies past the Spurs.
Randolph scored nine of his 25 points in the fourth quarter for
eighth-seeded Memphis, which was 0-12 in its three previous
postseason series.  “It was a physical game,” Randolph said in a televised
interview. “We just kept fighting.”  The Spurs were without All-Star guard Manu Ginobili, their
second-leading scorer with an average of 17.4 points per game,
because of a sprained right elbow.  Tony Parker had 20 points to lead the Spurs, who won the
NBA title four times from 1999 to 2007, while  Tim Duncan  added
16 points and 13 rebounds.  The teams return to the AT&T Center for Game 2 on April 20
before heading to Memphis for two games.  Paul Leads Hornets  At the Staples Center in  Los Angeles , Chris Paul scored 33
points and had 14 assists to lead the Hornets, who had lost all
four regular-season games against the Lakers.  “It’s been a tough year for me as far as making shots but
it’s the playoffs,” Paul, who hit 11 of 18 shots, told ABC in a
televised courtside interview. “My teammates were looking for
me to be aggressive.”  Kobe Bryant  scored 34 points to lead the Lakers, who began
the playoffs as the 5-2 favorite with oddsmakers to win a
record-tying 17th NBA title. Los Angeles will host Game 2 on
April 20.  The Thunder won their opener in Oklahoma City behind a
combined 72 points from Durant and fellow All-Star Russell Westbrook. It was the first time the franchise has won Game 1 of
a playoff series since 1998, when it was in  Seattle .  To contact the reporter on this story:
