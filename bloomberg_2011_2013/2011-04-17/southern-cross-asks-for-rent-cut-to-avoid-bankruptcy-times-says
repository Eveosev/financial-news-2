Southern Cross  Healthcare Group
Plc, a company that runs 750 care homes for the elderly in the
U.K., asked its landlords to lower its rent by a quarter in a
bid to avoid bankruptcy, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The company, which has been in talks with its landlords
since August about the reduction, may run out of cash within two
months, the newspaper said. Lower rents would enable Southern
Cross to raise fresh capital in a rights offering, in which the
landlords could also be given shares in exchange for an
agreement on rents, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
