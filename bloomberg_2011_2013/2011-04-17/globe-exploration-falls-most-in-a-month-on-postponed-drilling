Globe Exploration LP dropped the
most in more than a month after the oil and gas explorer
postponed the drilling of the Ofek 1 well to as late as August 1
because it needs to import a new drill.  The shares declined 6 percent, the biggest fall since March
15, to 0.047 shekel as of 11:19 a.m. in  Tel Aviv , giving the
Ramat Gan, Israel-based company a market value of 49.6 million
shekels ($14.5 million).  Editors: Digby Lidstone, Susan Lerner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
