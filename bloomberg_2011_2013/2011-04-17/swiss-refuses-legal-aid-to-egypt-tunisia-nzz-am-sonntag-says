Switzerland  will not send legal aid
to Egypt or  Tunisia  after the Alpine country froze the funds of
overthrown rulers  Hosni Mubarak  and Zine Ben Ali,  NZZ am Sonntag 
reported.  Requests for assistance from the two countries werenâ€™t
drawn up with sufficient detail, the newspaper said, citing
Folco Galli, a spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
