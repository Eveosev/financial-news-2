U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will say that adopting the proposed alternative voting system
would lead to “permanent damage to British democracy,” the
 Daily Telegraph  reported, citing a speech the Conservative
leader is to deliver in  London  tomorrow. Cameron will maintain
that supporting AV in the May 5 referendum would undermine the
principle of one person, one vote, arguing that under the
system, “the votes of some people get counted more than
others,” the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
