The Chinese yuan is close to being
freely usable, which would allow it to be included in the
International Monetary Fund’s  Special Drawing Rights  basket,
People’s Bank of  China  Deputy Governor Yi Gang said.  The IMF should consider adding currencies from the five so-
called BRICS countries to its SDR basket, Yi told reporters in
 Washington . China’s yuan, which is not fully convertible, is
“very close to being freely usable” judged by its use in
global trade, investment and financial transactions, Yi said,
pointing to increasing offshore yuan trade in  Hong Kong .  “The currencies of the BRICS countries, which also include
 South Africa , are very obvious candidates for new components of
the SDR basket,” Yi said. “China will respect existing rules
of the IMF,” and the yuan’s inclusion in the basket should take
place “naturally,” he said.  Since the financial crisis, the world’s second-largest
economy has called for a more reflective basket of currencies
that IMF members can use to settle accounts with each other. The
SDR currently  consists  of the euro, yen, British pound and  U.S.
dollar . China’s Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan urged the
IMF in 2009 to create a “super-sovereign reserve currency” to
take the dollar’s place in the global financial system.  The IMF can test the volatility of a simulated basket that
includes other currencies before its next review of the SDR’s
composition, Yi said. The Washington-based lender can then make
an interim appraisal based on the tests, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
