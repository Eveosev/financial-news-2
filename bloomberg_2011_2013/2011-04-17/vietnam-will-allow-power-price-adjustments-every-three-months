Vietnam ’s government said it will
allow power prices to be adjusted as often as once every three
months, depending on market conditions.  The policy will take effect at the beginning of June, based
on  a government decision  dated April 15 and signed by Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, according to  a posting  on the
government’s website.  Among the reasons for adjusting power prices are changes in
fuel costs or changes in exchange rates, according to the
posting.  The government increased electricity prices by about 15
percent from March 1, contributing to a 13.89 percent year-on-
year inflation rate in March, the highest level in more than two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
