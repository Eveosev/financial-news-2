U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said  South Korea  and other Asian partners are vital to
the U.S.’s “economic renewal.”  The South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will deliver
“significant benefits to both of our peoples,” Clinton said
today at a business forum in South Korea’s capital, Seoul.  President Barack Obama’s administration is “determined”
to get the accord approved by the U.S. Congress, Clinton said.
“This is a priority for me, for President Obama and for the
entire administration.”  Clinton and President South Korea’s Lee Myung Bak later had
a “substantial discussion” on North Korea, a senior U.S.
official said. Lee told Clinton he believed that a “strategy of
patience’ was having an effect in the interactions between  North
Korea  and South Korea.  The North Koreans are beginning to understand that there
would be no return to the kinds of “rewards and bribes” of
previous interactions, the official said. Lee called on the U.S.
to continue to tell  China  to press North Korea to behave
responsibly, he said.  Talks on dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program, within
a six-nation forum of China, the U.S., North Korea, South Korea,
Japan and Russia, stalled in December 2008.  Clinton later flew to Tokyo for a five-hour stop, in a show
of solidarity for Japan after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
