ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the worldâ€™s biggest
power-grid supplier, and five other companies were selected to
bid to develop a power plant in western Iraq, Deputy Electricity
Minister Salam Qazaz said.  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)  of India, Techint Group of Italy,
Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. as well as Turkish and
Iraqi companies were preselected to bid for the project, he said
in a press conference in Baghdad today.  The lowest bid came from Lanco Infratech, which offered to
build the natural-gas-fired 250 megawatts power station in Al
Qaim in the Al Anbar province near the Syrian border for $81.3
million over 16 months, Qazaz said. The winner will be announced
within 10 days, he said.  Iraq, which faces severe power shortages eight years after
the U.S.-led invasion ousted President  Saddam Hussein , has
offered this year a series of tenders to build about 60 new
power plants. Its electricity plants and distribution system
have suffered through years of conflict, sanctions and sabotage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
