     April 17 (Bloomberg) --Evonik Industries AG agreed to sell
its carbon black business to New York-based buyout firm Rhone
Capital LLC for more than 900 million euros ($1.3 billion),
including the assumption of certain obligations.  The sale must be approved by Evonik’s supervisory board and
antitrust authorities, and would close this summer, Evonik said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Evonik’s carbon black operations, the world’s third
largest, include 16 production facilities in 11 countries, with
1,650 employees including 500 in  Germany , the company said.
Sales were 1.2 billion euros in 2010. Carbon black is used in
tires, coatings, plastics, ink and toners.  “The transaction is good for Evonik, the future of the
carbon black business and its employees,” Klaus Engel, chairman
of the Evonik’s executive board, said in the statement. “At the
same time, this represents another major step toward a more
clear-cut profile for Evonik as a leading specialty chemicals
company.”  Evonik decided to sell the business in September, and the
sale process began in November, the Essen, Germany-based company
said.  Evonik has said previously that  Barclays Capital  advised it
on the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
