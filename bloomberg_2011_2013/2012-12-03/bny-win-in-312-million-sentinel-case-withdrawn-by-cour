Bank of New York Mellon  Corp.’s
victory in a lawsuit challenging its $312 million lien on the
assets of bankrupt Sentinel Management Group Inc. was canceled
without explanation by a U.S. appeals court.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in  Chicago 
on Nov. 30 withdrew its prior ruling affirming the lender’s
entitlement to the lien in a two-sentence decree.  “The opinion of this court issued on Aug. 9, 2012, is
withdrawn and the judgment is vacated,” a three-judge panel of
Daniel A. Manion, Ilana Diamond Rovner and John D. Tinder said.
“This appeal remains under consideration by the panel.”  After the Northbrook, Illinois-based cash-management firm
filed for bankruptcy in 2007, liquidation trustee Frederick
Grede sued the New York-based bank alleging its employees knew
Sentinel was improperly using investor assets as collateral for
its own line of credit and sought to disallow or subordinate
BNY’s lien.  Following a 2010 trial, U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel
in Chicago rejected Grede’s claims.  After Manion, Rovner and Tinder upheld that decision,
Grede’s lawyers petitioned for a rehearing by the full court.  Chris Gair , an attorney for Grede, didn’t immediately reply
to voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
appellate court order. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the bank,
said he couldn’t immediately comment on it.  The case is In re Sentinel Management Group Inc., 10-3787,
10-3990 and 11-1123, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
