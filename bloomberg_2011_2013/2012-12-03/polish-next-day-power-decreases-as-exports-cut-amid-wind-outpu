Polish day-ahead electricity  declined
as exports were set to fall amid forecasts of higher wind output
in  Germany .  Next-day power dropped 1.6 percent to 177.15 zloty ($56.11)
a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Net exports to Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia
were set to decline to 224 megawatts from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m.
tomorrow, from 1,195 megawatts at the same time today,
predominantly due to lower flows to Germany, data from Warsaw-
based grid manager PSE Operator SA showed.  German power for tomorrow, a benchmark for the region,
decreased 12 percent to 48.65 euros ($63.31) a megawatt-hour as
above-average wind generation is forecast.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and  Hungary  slumped 9.4 percent to 49.45
euros a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the
countriesâ€™ market operators.  Link to Company News:  To contact the reporter on this story:
