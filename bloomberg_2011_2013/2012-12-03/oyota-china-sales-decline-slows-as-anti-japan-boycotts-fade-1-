Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  China  sales fell
by the least in three months as protests and boycotts of
Japanese brands, triggered by a territorial dispute between the
two countries, subsided.  Deliveries declined 22 percent in November from a year
earlier to 63,800 vehicles,  Asia ’s largest automaker said in a
text message today. Last month’s decline compares with the 49
percent drop in September and a 44 percent slump in October.  The automaker said last month sales in China were
recovering. Deliveries in the first 11 months of the year fell
3.3 percent to 749,600 units, setting the automaker on course
for its first annual decline in China sales on record.  “The drop in sales is smaller-than-expected, so it looks
like recovery is on the way,”  Satoru Takada , a Tokyo-based auto
analyst at Toward the Infinite World Inc., said by phone today.
“If the sales are positive again in December, we should be able
to positively say that it’s rebounding.”  Annual Target  Toyota’s November China sales leave it 25 percent away from
its previous annual target of 1 million units. Deliveries in the
July-to-September period tumbled 23 percent, the biggest
quarterly drop on record, according to company figures
stretching back to 2002.  Japan ’s automakers may suffer production cuts into 2014 and
lose a combined 650,000 units in vehicle output if tensions
don’t abate between the two countries, according to estimates by
IHS Automotive.  Toyota fell 0.6 percent to 3,515 yen at the close of
trading in  Tokyo  today, before the China sales were announced.
The  stock  has gained 37 percent this year, compared with the 12
percent advance in the benchmark Nikkei 255 Stock Average.  Separately,  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  said sales fell 30 percent to
12,187 units last month, according to its website.  The decades-long territorial dispute, involving a group of
islands called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, was
reignited in April, when then-Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara,
a longtime critic of China, proposed buying the territories.
That led Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s administration to
purchase the islets in September, escalating tensions between
the two nations and sparking violent protests across China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
