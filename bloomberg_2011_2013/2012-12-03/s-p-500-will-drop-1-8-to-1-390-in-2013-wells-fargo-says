The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
fall 1.8 percent to 1,390 by the end of 2013 as global growth
slows and policymakers struggle to reach a budget agreement,
according to  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ’s Gina Martin Adams.  Adams, who has the lowest projection for the U.S. equity
benchmark next year among Wall Street strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg, says investors should buy companies that are least-
tied to economic growth. The average estimate from eight other
forecasters implies a 9.2 percent rally to 1,546 from Nov. 30.  “The  U.S. economy  is likely to flirt with recession in the
near term, as slowing exports and falling investment likely lead
to a weaker consumer at the start of 2013,” Wells Fargo’s Adams
wrote in a note today. “The market will suffer downward
pressure until policymakers act decisively to convince investors
that the U.S. debt house is ‘in order’.”  The U.S. national debt has soared to more than $16 trillion
from less than $9 trillion in 2007 and lawmakers are debating
ways to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts that
will kick in next year if an agreement is not reached. The
 Congressional Budget Office  has warned that if Congress doesn’t
avert the so-called fiscal cliff, the economy might slip into
recession next year.  Defensive Stocks  Adams recommends holding more health-care, consumer staple
and utility shares than the U.S. equity benchmark, and fewer
energy, industrial, material and technology companies.  Wells Fargo’s Adams estimates earnings per share for  S&P
500  companies of  $103 (SPX)  in 2013. It’s the second-lowest projection
among the strategists surveyed, only behind Morgan Stanley’s
forecast of $98.71 by strategist  Adam Parker .  Thomas Lee  at
JPMorgan & Co., which has the highest estimate, predicts S&P 500
earnings of $110.00 a share next year.  “There is a trifecta of major macro drags likely to
continue to wreak havoc on S&P 500 company earnings,” Adams
wrote. “ First, growth in the Eurozone continues to falter.
Second, business investment is contracting. Finally, the
combination of slow exports, declining investment and fiscal
policy is likely to result in a slowdown in the U.S. consumer
sector at the start of 2013.”  The U.S. economy is forecast to grow 2 percent next year
from the 2.2 percent gross domestic product projected for 2012,
according to a Bloomberg survey with economists.  Adams is also among the most bearish strategists for 2012.
The New York-based strategist predicts the S&P 500 will fall 4
percent through the end of 2012 from Nov. 30. On average, the
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg say the index will end the
year at 1,399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
