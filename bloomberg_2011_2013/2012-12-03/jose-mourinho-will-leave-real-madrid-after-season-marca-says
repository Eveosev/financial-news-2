Jose Mourinho  said he won’t discuss a
report in a Spanish newspaper that he will quit as Real Madrid
coach after the season ends in June.  Marca  reported Mourinho and team president  Florentino Perez 
agree the 49-year-old Portuguese should leave after some Real
fans turned against him.  “I’m not going to say a single word, and I don’t think the
president will,” Mourinho told a televised news conference
ahead of a Champions League game against Ajax tomorrow. “I’m
not going to feed this situation.”  Home fans in a mainly-empty Santiago Bernabeu stadium
whistled at Mourinho when he entered the field an hour before
Real’s 2-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Dec. 1. Real is third in
the Spanish league, 11 points behind leader Barcelona.  Marca also cited Mourinho falling out with defender  Sergio Ramos  and Real’s B team coach Alberto Toril as reasons why he
would leave the club.  Mourinho said it was too early to discuss who should
succeed  Alex Ferguson  at Manchester United, saying the 70-year-
old coach “looks better every day.” Mourinho added that he
wasn’t thinking about moving to Paris Saint-Germain, another
team newspapers have linked him with.  To contact the reporters on this story:
