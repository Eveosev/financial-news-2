Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  jumped the most in
11 weeks in Frankfurt trading after  Germany ’s federal network
agency said the country’s solar-panel installations rose 26
percent in October.  Wacker Chemie, the world’s fourth-biggest maker of
polysilicon, gained as much as 3.9 percent to 43.47 euros, the
biggest intraday increase since Sept. 14. Germany added 612
megawatts of panels, compared to 486 megawatts in the same month
in 2011, the network regulator said on its  website .  Wacker and other producers of polysilicon, the main raw
material used in solar panels, have struggled with low prices
after expansion at Asian peers outpaced growth in demand. The
overcapacity has hurt margins at solar-cell and panel makers,
customers of Munich-based Wacker, as governments across  Europe 
scaled back support for the industry.  October’s jump in German panel installations also boosted
shares of other solar-industry stocks.  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) 
rose as much as 2.2 percent to 16.92 euros, the highest intraday
price in more than three weeks.  Conergy AG (CGYK)  increased as much as
2.4 percent to 30 cents, a 2 1/2-week high.  Wacker Chemie traded up 3 percent at 11 a.m. That pared the
stock’s decline this year to 31 percent, valuing the company at
2.25 billion euros ($2.9 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
