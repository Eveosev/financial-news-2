The Argentine government plans to
contact holders of $2.5 billion of defaulted bonds to see how
they feel about the re-opening of its offer to swap the
securities, Ambito Financiero  reported today , without saying how
it obtained the information.  Officials from the  Economy Ministry  have a list of 63 so-
called holdouts who will be contacted before Feb. 27, the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper said.  These investors will be encouraged to participate in a re-
opening of the exchange under the same terms  Argentina  gave
investors who accepted a 2010 restructuring, Ambito said.
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , which handled
the 2010 exchange, may be called on to organize the swap, Ambito
said. The reopening may proceed in March, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
