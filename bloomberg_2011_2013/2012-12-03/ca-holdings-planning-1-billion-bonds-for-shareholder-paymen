HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) , the biggest U.S.
for-profit hospital operator, sold $1 billion of bonds to make a
distribution to stockholders.  The company issued the 6.25 percent debt due February 2021
to yield 462 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will also be used to pay certain option holders,
the Nashville, Tennessee-based company said today in a filing.
HCA plans to pay a special cash dividend of $2 per share by Dec.
31, HCA said today in a statement distributed by Business Wire.  The hospital chain previously issued securities in October,
selling $1.25 billion each of 4.75 percent senior secured notes
at a relative yield of 304 basis points and 5.875 percent,
senior unsecured debt at a spread of 417 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. The bonds mature in May 2023 and proceeds were to be
used to repay a term loan and to pay a stockholder dividend.  The new bonds are rated B3 by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service and
an equivalent B- by Fitch Ratings, the ratings companies said
today in separate reports.  Payouts this year are subject to a 15 percent U.S. levy
that may rise to as high as 43.4 percent if lawmakers allow $600
billion of scheduled tax increases and spending cuts to take
effect in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
