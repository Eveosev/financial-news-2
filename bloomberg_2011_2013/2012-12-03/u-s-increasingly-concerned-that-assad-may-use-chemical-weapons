The U.S. is increasingly concerned
that Bashar al-Assad’s regime in  Syria  might use chemical
weapons to put down a rebellion, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said.  As it fails to stem the upheaval by conventional means,
concern “has increased” that the regime might turn to its
chemical weapons stockpiles, Carney told reporters at his
regular briefing in Washington.  Carney refused to say what measures the U.S. may be
considering. “Contingency planning is the responsible thing to
do,” he said.  “The Assad regime must know the world is watching,” he
said.  Carney reiterated that any use of chemical weapons would be
a “red line” that would trigger U.S. action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
