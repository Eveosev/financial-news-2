Ernst & Young LLP has agreed to pay
C$117 million ($117.6 million) to settle claims in a Canadian
class action suit against Sino-Forest Corp., according to the
law firms behind the action.  The class action alleges that Sino-Forest, certain of its
directors and officers, auditors and underwriters misled
investors concerning the business and accounting at the now
insolvent Chinese timber trader, law firms Siskinds LLP and
Koskie Minsky LLP said in an e-mailed statement today.  The settlement is the largest by an auditor in Canadian
history, the law firms said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
