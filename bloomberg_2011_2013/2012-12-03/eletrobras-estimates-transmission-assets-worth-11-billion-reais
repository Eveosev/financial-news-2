Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
estimates its transmission assets are worth 11 billion reais
($5.2 billion) and may receive compensation based on revised
government rules, Chief Financial Officer Armando Casado said.  The company expects a “significant” amount for the
assets, which were built before May 2000, from  Brazil ’s
government, Casado told reporters today in Brasilia. The
specific amount isn’t yet known, he said.  Eletrobras, as the state-controlled company is known, also
expects its generation assets will be reevaluated higher because
of a separate government ruling, he said.  The rules, which mean less revenue, force the company to
seek cost cuts, Casado said. He said there aren’t plans for mass
firings as the company is studying asset sales and voluntary
dismissals.  Eletrobras today approved renewing for 30 years concessions
due to expire between 2015 and 2017, after Eletrobras
shareholders approved government conditions for renewal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
