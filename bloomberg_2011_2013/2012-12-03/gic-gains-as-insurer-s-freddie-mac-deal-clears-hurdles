MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that breached regulators’ capital limits, advanced the
most on the KBW Insurance Index after saying  Freddie Mac  will
allow the company to continue selling coverage.  MGIC  gained  7.4 percent to $1.88 at 4:15 p.m. in New York.
The shares have retreated 50 percent this year.  The insurer is transferring $100 million to a subsidiary to
maintain approval from government mortgage buyer Freddie Mac,
Milwaukee-based MGIC said in a statement late Nov. 30. MGIC will
also pay $100 million to Freddie Mac by next week and $167.5
million more in 48 installments, beginning in January. The
payments help resolve a coverage dispute, over which the
companies reached a preliminary agreement in October.  “All other conditions required by Freddie Mac to continue
Freddie Mac’s approval of MGIC’s subsidiary, MGIC Indemnity
Corporation, as a limited mortgage insurer through Dec. 31, 2013
have been satisfied,” MGIC said in the statement.  MGIC said it will record a $267.5 million charge in the
current quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
