Even as  U.S. government debt  swells
to more than $16 trillion, Treasuries and other dollar fixed-
income securities will be in short supply next year as the
Federal Reserve soaks up almost all the net new bonds.  The government will reduce net sales by $250 billion from
the $1.2 trillion of bills, notes and bonds issued in fiscal
2012 ended Sept. 30, a survey of 18 primary dealers found. At
the same time, the Fed, in its efforts to boost growth, will add
about $45 billion of Treasuries a month to the $40 billion in
mortgage debt it’s purchasing, effectively absorbing about 90
percent of net new dollar-denominated fixed-income assets,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Even after U.S. public borrowings outstanding grew from
less than $9 trillion in 2007 as the U.S. raised cash to pay for
spending programs designed to pull the economy out of the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression, rising demand
coupled with a drop in net supply means bonds will be scarce.  “The shrinking amount of bonds in the market is lowering
rates and not just benefiting the Treasury, but providing lower
rates for private-sector decision-makers as well,”  Zach Pandl ,
a senior interest-rate strategist in Minneapolis at Columbia
Management Investment Advisers LLC, which oversees $340 billion,
said in a Nov. 30 telephone interview. “The Fed is not creating
this scarcity to help out the Treasury, it’s primarily to get
the economy going.”  Treasury Auctions  Investors  bid  for more than four times the amount of two-
year notes the Treasury auctioned last week, matching a record
high, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Yields on U.S. government
bonds are about a half a percentage point lower than the rest of
the world on average, compared with about a quarter-percentage
point more as recently as April 2010, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show.  Buyers range from central banks to financial institutions
stocking up on high-quality assets to meet the Dodd-Frank
financial-overhaul law and global regulations set by the  Bank
for International Settlements . They’re helping the Fed and the
Obama administration keep borrowing costs at all-time lows for
everyone from consumers to  Walt Disney  Co.  Strategists have cut their forecasts for 10-year Treasury
yields. They now see the benchmark yield at 2.26 percent by the
end of 2013, down from the 2.79 percent predicted in June, based
on the median estimate of about 50 analysts in separate surveys
by Bloomberg. The yield has averaged 4.88 percent average since
 Bill Clinton  began his first term as President in 1992.  Falling Yields  U.S. 10-year yields fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, last week to 1.62 percent in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield rose less
than two basis points to 1.63 percent at 12:35 p.m. in New York.  Bonds rose as President  Barack Obama  and Republican
lawmakers traded ideas on how to avoid more than $600 billion in
mandated spending cuts and tax increased scheduled to go into
effect in January.  Obama warned Nov. 30 of “prolonged negotiations,” while
U.S. House Speak  John Boehner  said the administration plan
presented to congressional leaders by Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  would risk growth by raising taxes on small
businesses.  $31.3 Trillion  Programs to pay for the bailout of the financial system, an
extension of  unemployment benefits  and to bolster housing helped
caused the size of the U.S. taxable debt market to swell 27
percent since 2007 to $31.3 trillion, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc. The figures exclude money-market securities such
as commercial paper.  With the economy strengthening, net sales of new U.S.
fixed-income dollar debt with maturities of more than a year,
such as corporate, sovereign and municipal bonds, will fall next
year to $1.121 trillion from $1.344 trillion, or an almost 17
percent drop, according to JPMorgan’s fixed-income research
team, led by Terry Belton.  The decline includes a slide in net Treasuries to $893
billion from $1.002 trillion in fiscal 2012, according to
JPMorgan in a report dated Nov. 21. Overall, net supply of
fixed-income debt will average about $93 billion per month in
2013, the bank estimates, down almost 20 percent.  With the Fed buying about $85 billion a month in Treasuries
and mortgage bonds next year, the net supply to the private
sector will be about zero as the central bank effectively soaks
up about 90 percent of new issuance of those assets.  Gross Borrowing  Gross U.S. borrowing through Treasury sales rose to more
than $2.1 trillion in each of the last three years from $922
billion in 2008, according to government data. Debt owned by the
public jumped to $10.1 trillion in January 2012 from $5.75
trillion in January 2009.  Even without the full effects of the fiscal cliff, net
Treasury sales will slip to $952 billion as the budget deficit
contracts to about $918 billion for fiscal 2013, according to
the average prediction of 18 primary dealers surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . The  shortfall  totaled $1.089 trillion in 2012, a
Treasury Department report said Oct. 12, the fourth straight
year above $1 trillion.  The smaller net supply of government debt will be matched
by fewer corporate issues, according to Nomura. Net company
borrowing may fall to $288 billion next year from $353.6
billion, the firm estimates.  Disney Bonds  Walt Disney (DIS)  sold a record amount of debt last week at the
lowest interest cost it’s ever paid. The company issued $3
billion of bonds on Nov. 27 in a four-part offering with coupons
ranging from 0.45 percent on three-year debt to 3.7 percent for
30-year securities. The issue was the biggest in the 89-year
history of the Burbank, California-based company.  The effect on yields from less supply coupled with high
demand typically proves temporary, according to Mark Dowding, a
senior fixed-income manager at BlueBay Asset Management in
London, which oversees $47 billion.  “Considerations like supply and demand are important if
you are looking at the shorter term, but for out over a three,
six or 12 month period, the most important factor is going to be
the economy,” he said in a telephone interview on Nov. 28.
“Although negotiations surrounding the cliff may be somewhat
difficult, we do expect a compromise to be found and see the 10-
year yield more likely to head to 2 percent than to 1.25
percent.”  Stronger Growth  The  U.S. economy  expanded more than previously estimated in
the third quarter, led by  consumer spending , government outlays
and residential construction. Gross domestic product rose at a
2.7 percent annual rate for the period from July through
September, up from 2 percent reported in October, revised
figures from the Commerce Department showed Nov. 29.  Persistent demand for U.S. securities as a haven from
turmoil in the world’s financial markets since the subprime
mortgage collapse in 2007 and Europe’s three-year-old sovereign
debt crisis has helped damp yield increases even as government
supply rose.  Foreign governments and banks  have been among the biggest
buyers. Brazil, Belgium, Luxembourg, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan
and  Hong Kong  boosted their holdings by a collective $264.8
billion since August 2011, Treasury data released Nov. 16 show.  Yields on Treasuries of all maturities ended last week at
0.897 percent, below the 1.42 percent for the global government
bond market excluding the U.S., according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. In April 2010, U.S. yields averaged 2.44
percent, versus 2.22 percent for the rest of the world.  Bank Deposits  Deposits at U.S. banks exceed loans by $1.91 trillion,
marking a turnaround from 2008, when loans exceeded deposits by
about $200 billion. Much of that surplus money has been used to
buy Treasuries and government agency debt such as that issued by
 Fannie Mae ,  Freddie Mac , boosting holdings to a  record  $1.86
trillion, Fed data show. Bank holdings of Treasuries increased
15 percent to  $531.7 billion  in the past year.  Investors have bid a record $3.16 for each dollar of the
$1.974 trillion in notes and bonds the U.S. government has sold
at auctions this year, Treasury data show, up from the previous
high of $3.04 set last year. The bid-to-cover ratio at the
Treasury’s auction of $35 billion in two-year notes on Nov. 27
was 4.07, matching the record high in November 2011.  That has kept down the cost of financing the record $16
trillion debt. The U.S. spent $359.8 billion on interest expense
in fiscal 2012, below the $454.4 billion the previous year.  Mortgage Rates  Consumers are also benefiting. The average  interest rate  on
 30-year mortgages  is a record low 3.31 percent, according to a
weekly survey conducted by Freddie Mac. Banks reported the most
common rate for a 48-month  new-car loan  was 4.88 percent in
August, the most recent reporting period. The rates were more
than 7 percent in December 2008.  The Fed has pumped money into the financial system by
purchasing more than $2.3 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-
related securities in three rounds of policy called quantitative
easing. The latest program announced Sept. 13 involves buying
$40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and has no end date
or fixed total amount.  A “number” of Fed officials said the central bank may
need to expand its purchases next year, according to the minutes
of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Oct. 23-24 meeting. Bond
traders predict policy makers will announce at their Dec. 11-12
meeting that they will make new Treasury purchases next year of
about $42.9 billion a month, according to the average estimate
of primary dealers surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Fiscal Cliff  The  Congressional Budget Office  said that failure to reach
an agreement on the fiscal cliff may push the economy into a
recession next year and boost  unemployment  to 9.1 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2013, from 7.9 percent in October.  “You’ve got supply likely to come down and you’ve got
demand strong,” Brett Wander, chief investment officer for
fixed income in  San Francisco  at Charles Schwab Investment
Management Inc., which oversees about $200 billion, said in a
telephone interview Nov. 29. “Think of it like arrows acting
like forces on an object. The supply arrow is pushing yields
down and the demand arrow is pushing yields down at the
moment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
