French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said the banking law he will present this month will
be “more pragmatic” than proposals for the euro area set out
by a group led by Bank of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen.  “We want something more practical to distinguish between
speculation and what’s useful for the economy,” Moscovici told
a committee of the European Parliament in Brussels today. “We
have a strong banking industry, with  universal banks  that
provide 4,000 jobs. We haven’t decided to break this model.”  Under the French plan, speculation through high-frequency
trading and on agricultural-commodities derivatives would be
banned. The bill seeks to prohibit “pure proprietary trading
that allows” banks “to speculate with their balance sheets,
unless they are very strictly ring-fenced,” Moscovici said last
month.  Liikanen’s Oct. 2 report recommended a “legal separation
of certain particularly risky financial activities from deposit-
taking banks within the banking group.”  The European Union report found that Paris-based  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , together with Barclays Plc
of  London , Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc of Edinburgh had the highest proportion of
trading assets, accounting for more than 30 percent of total
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
