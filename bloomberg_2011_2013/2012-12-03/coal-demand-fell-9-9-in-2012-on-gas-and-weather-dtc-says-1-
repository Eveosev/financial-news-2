Coal demand in the U.S. fell 9.9
percent in 2012 because of a mild winter and cheap gas that
robbed coal of market share for electricity production.  Companies lost about 93 million tons’ worth of demand this
year from the warmer-than-average weather and lower natural gas
prices, Gordon Howald, senior vice president of the utility
group at Doyle Trading Consultants LLC, said at a conference put
on by his company in  New York .  Coal’s share of electricity  demand  will be about 37 percent
this year, down from 42 percent in 2011, while gas consumption
by utilities is expected to rise to 31 percent from 25 percent
last year, Energy Department data show.  Utilities retiring coal-fired units meant a loss of 9.5
million tons of use this year, Howald said.  Consumption may rebound next year as the fuel gets about 11
million tons of demand from power companies starting new coal
units, as the speed of retirements weakens and as coal recovers
some of its allure amid higher gas prices, he said.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , coal has fallen 11
percent to $61.95 a ton this year. Gas has risen 20 percent to
$3.591 per million British thermal units.  Between 2012 and 2020, utilities will shutter 34,700
megawatts of coal-fired generators, Howald said, equal to about
61 million tons of demand. The majority of the closings will
happen by April 2015 as the Environmental Protection Agency’s
Mercury and Air Toxics Standard takes effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
