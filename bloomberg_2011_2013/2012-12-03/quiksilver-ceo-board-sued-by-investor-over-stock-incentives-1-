Quiksilver Inc. (ZQK) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Robert McKnight and the board of the surfwear brand were
sued by an investor over stock incentives.  Awards of 4 million restricted stock units to McKnight,
Pierre Agnes, president of Quiksilver Europe, and Craig Stevenson, the company’s chief operating officer, violated a
2000 stock incentive plan, according to the complaint filed
today by the Vladimir Gusinsky Living Trust.  The awards are “a waste of the company’s corporate assets
and a breach of fiduciary duties owed to the company and its
shareholders by the members of the compensation committee,” the
trust said in the filing in Delaware Chancery Court.  The trust, which says it has held Quiksilver stock since
July 2006, is seeking a court order directing  Huntington Beach ,
California-based clothing maker to improve its corporate
governance procedures in addition to unspecified damages on
behalf of the company.  Quiksilver’s compensation committee awarded restricted
stock units to company officials in June 2011. The awards to
McKnight, Stevenson and Agnes violated the company’s stock
incentive which capped such awards to 800,000 stock units,
according to the trust. The committee’s actions put at risk the
tax deductibility of the 2011 awards, according to the trust.  Quiksilver officials weren’t immediately available for
comment on the complaint.  The case is The Vladimir Gusinsky Living Trust v. McKnight
Jr., CA8074, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington)  To contact the reporter on this story:
