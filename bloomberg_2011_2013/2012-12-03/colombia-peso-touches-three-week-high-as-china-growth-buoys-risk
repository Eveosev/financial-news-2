Colombia’s peso touched a three-week
high as a report showing an increase in Chinese factory output
boosted demand for higher-yielding assets and helped drive up
the price of oil, the Andean nation’s top export.  The currency appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 1,810.18
per dollar in intraday trading, the strongest level since Nov.
8. It closed little changed at 1,815.30. The peso has rallied
6.8 percent this year.  “There’s a positive tone in international markets,” said
 Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA. “People
have been worried about growth, and the data from  China  was
somewhat better, so that encourages optimism.”  China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index increased to
50.6 in November, while a private gauge of manufacturing climbed
to 50.5, separate reports showed. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. Oil rose 0.2 percent to $89.09 a barrel on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since Nov. 19.  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated bonds
due in May 2014 was little changed at 4.95 percent, according to
the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
