The Seychelles Securities Exchange is
in talks with two foreign companies about listing on the bourse,
which officially opened on Nov. 30.  Several local businesses are also interested in trading
their shares, including three in the first quarter next year,
said Francois Venter, the director of the Mahe-based bourse,
which is known as Trop-X. He didn’t identify them. A listing
takes a minimum of six weeks, he said.  The  International Monetary Fund , which completed a
performance review of the Indian Ocean island nation at the end
of October, said the economy has been resilient in the face of
the global economic slowdown. The government remains on track to
reduce public debt to 50 percent of gross domestic product by
2018 and debt restructuring is almost complete, the IMF said.  Europe , which remained in recession in the third quarter,
is Seychelles’s biggest trading partner and accounts for about
75 percent of visitors, according to the nation’s National
Bureau of Statistics.  Besides the main board, the bourse also has a venture
capital board and one for small and medium enterprises, Venter
said.  Bonds and derivatives trading will start by the end of the
first half next year, Trop-X Director of Operations and Finance
Bobby Brantley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
