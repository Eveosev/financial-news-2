General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
U.S. wind manufacturer, expects annual turbine sales of about $1
billion in  Brazil  for the next decade, according to the head of
the company’s renewable-energy unit.  Developers will install between 1.5 gigawatts and 3
gigawatts of wind turbines a year in Brazil, and GE will be one
of “three or four players” supplying the market, Vic Abate
said today in a telephone interview. The Fairfield, Connecticut-
based company agreed to provide 386 megawatts of turbines to the
Sao Paulo-based developer  Renova Energia SA (RNEW11)  in a $394 million
deal announced today, enough to power a city of a million
people.  Turbine installation is surging in Brazil, the world’s
fastest-growing wind market, giving GE an important place to
sell its systems as demand in the U.S. slows, Abate said. U.S.
deployment in 2013 is expected to decline from this year because
Congress hasn’t renewed a 2.2-cents-per-kilowatt-hour tax credit
that expires at the end of this month.  “Two years ago, we were zero and now it’s over a billion
dollars a year,” Abate said. Brazil is “a sustainable
market.”  Wind capacity in Brazil will rise 11-fold to about 15.6
gigawatts by 2021, the country’s government said in September.
Chinese turbine makers are pursuing deals to gain access to the
the South American market.  “What you’ll probably see is fewer, but more mainstream,
players in Brazil over the next couple of years,” Abate said.
“Wind is going to be a large chunk of the installs going into
that country between now and 2022.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
