PMI Group Inc. (PPMIQ) , the mortgage insurer
that filed for  bankruptcy protection  last year, said a “well-
known private equity investor” expressed interest in injecting
capital in the company in exchange for a stake.  The insurer is consulting with a committee of unsecured
creditors about the proposal, the Walnut Creek, California-based
company said today in a regulatory filing.  A rebound in the housing market is fueling investor
interest in  mortgage insurance  after companies like PMI and
Triad Guaranty Inc. were hobbled by losses in the real estate
slump. NMI Holdings Inc. raised $550 million in April to open a
mortgage insurer, and Essent Guaranty Inc., backed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., bought Triad software
and other assets in 2009.  The expression of private equity interest “is not binding
and there can be no assurance that any definitive agreement for
an investment will be reached or that any transaction will be
completed,” the company said in the filing, which didn’t
identify who was weighing the capital injection. Calls to PMI
seeking comment weren’t returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
