Hidroelectrica SA ,  Romania â€™s state-
owned hydropower generator, said it has resumed power supplies
at full capacity after river water levels improved.  Hidroelectrica ended a force-majeure clause it activated
for its contracts with companies such as  Alro SA (ALR)  on Dec. 1, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The company, which cut electricity supplies between October
2011 and April 2012 and for another three months from August
because of a prolonged drought, has been under an insolvency
procedure since June as part of a government restructuring plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
