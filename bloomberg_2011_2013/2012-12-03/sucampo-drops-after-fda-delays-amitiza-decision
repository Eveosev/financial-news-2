Sucampo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SCMP)  fell the
most in five months after U.S. regulators delayed a decision on
expanding the use of its Amitiza drug to treat opioid-induced
constipation in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.  Sucampo declined 8 percent to $4.82 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time, its biggest decline since July 6. The shares of the
Bethesda, Maryland-based company have gained 8.8 percent this
year.  The  Food and Drug Administration  extended Sucampo’s
decision date three months to late April because the agency
needed more time to review data analysis submitted Nov. 16,
Sucampo said in a statement on Nov. 30. Twice-daily Amitiza,
first approved in 2006, is the company’s sole product on the
market.  The FDA did approve label changes for Amitiza that removed
all pregnancy-related warnings and precautions, the company
said. The changes include the deletion of the caution that women
who could become pregnant should have a negative pregnancy test
prior to beginning the treatment and should be capable of using
effective contraception. The new label advises nursing mothers
to monitor their infants for diarrhea while taking Amitiza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
