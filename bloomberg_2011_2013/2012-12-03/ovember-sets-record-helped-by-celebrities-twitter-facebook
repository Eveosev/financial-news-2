Movember , a global campaign that asks
men to grow moustaches in November to raise awareness and money
for male cancer charities, had a record year for fundraising,
with the U.K. topping the list for most participants.  “This year has been Movember’s strongest year yet in terms
of participation,” U.K. country manager Sarah Coghlan said in
an e-mailed statement today. “We’ve heard thousands of
incredible stories from Mo Bros and Mo Sistas.”  Movember raised $116 million worldwide, compared with
$98.1 million last year, the organization said on its website.
Canada raised the most money, a total of $37.5 million, while
the U.K. came second, contributing $28.3 million. A total
362,828 people in the U.K. took part, the highest of any
country. Canada was in second slot with 247,093 participants and
 Australia  in third on 143,949.  The campaign, which recruited celebrities such as chef
Jamie Oliver and actor Stephen Fry in the U.K., was also helped
this year by the growth in users of social network sites such as
 Facebook (FB)  Inc. and Twitter Inc., said Movember.  To contact the reporter on this story:
