Cuban Economy Minister Adel Yzquierdo
Rodriguez said the island’s economy would grow 3.1 percent this
year, trailing earlier forecasts of 3.4 percent, after the
government failed to complete construction projects on time.  Education, public health, social assistance and culture and
sport will grow at a similar rate to last year, Yzquierdo told
the Council of Ministers,  according Granma , the Communist
Party’s newspaper, which didn’t give details. The rest of the
economy will expand about 4.5 percent, he said.  Since taking over from his brother Fidel in 2008, President
Raul Castro has allowed limited sales of real estate, welcomed
foreign oil exploration and expanded the list of professions
open to private enterprise as the government seeks to
“redesign” the economy by loosening state control.  The government expects the economy to grow 3.7 percent next
year, Yzquierdo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
