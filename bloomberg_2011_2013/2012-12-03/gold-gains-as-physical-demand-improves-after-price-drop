Gold futures rebounded from the
biggest weekly drop in five months as the dollar’s decline
boosted the appeal of the metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback weakened to a six-week low against the euro
after  Greece  offered to buy back bonds.  China ’s manufacturing
index rose to a seven-month high, data showed on Dec. 1.
Precious metals and energy will lead commodities higher in the
next 12 months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report dated
Nov. 30.  “We’re seeing more of a ‘risk-on’ trade with the Greek
debt news and the weaker dollar,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s also a macro-based rally
in commodities on strength in China and Goldman reiterating its
bullish views.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,721.10 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Last week, the price tumbled 2.2 percent, the most since
late June.  Goldman Sachs forecasts a 7 percent return from commodities
in the next 12 months, including an 8 percent gain for precious
metals. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials pared gains from the highest in six weeks.  Holdings in  exchange-traded products  backed by the metal
climbed 2.3 metric tons to a record 2,621.7 tons on Nov. 30,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  U.S. Mint  sold 136,500
ounces of American Eagle gold coins last month, the highest
since July 2010.  Silver futures for March delivery advanced 1.4 percent to
$33.759 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery increased 0.6 percent to $1,613.80 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
$691.25 an ounce, the highest settlement since Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
