China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) , the
nation’s biggest wind-power producer, said unit Hero Asia
Investment Ltd. will issue $400 million of senior perpetual
securities to develop and expand its new energy business.  Sale of the 5.25 percent securities will be closed Dec. 7,
Longyuan said today in a  Hong Kong  stock exchange statement. The
proceeds will also be used for working capital needs.  None of the securities will be sold to the public in Hong
Kong, where the company is traded, Longyuan said. The company
has sought listing of the securities in  Singapore .  The Beijing-based company will choose the proper timing to
raise about $500 million by selling shares in Hong Kong by June
2, 2013, Lan Peizhen, Longyuan’s investor relations manager,
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
