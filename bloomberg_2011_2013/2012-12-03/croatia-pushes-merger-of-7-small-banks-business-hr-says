The  Croatian government  is pushing
for the merger of seven small lenders,  Business.hr  reported
today, without saying how it got the information.  Centar Banka (CEBARA)  d.d., Vaba d.d., Jadranska Banka d.d., Banka
Kovanica d.d. and Croatia Banka d.d. are expected to merge with
Karlovacka Banka d.d., which on Nov. 19 merged with  Nava Banka
d.d. (NVBARA) , according to the Zagreb-based business news portal.  The  central bank  in November last year put Karlovacka, Vaba
and Nava on watch, saying they are “near” the capitalization
limit of 12 percent. The central bank at the same time withdrew
the operating license for Credo Banka d.d. for falling below the
limit.  More than 90 percent of the country’s banking assets are
owned by foreign lenders.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
