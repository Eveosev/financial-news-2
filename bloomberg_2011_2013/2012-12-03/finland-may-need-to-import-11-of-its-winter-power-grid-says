Finland  may need to import as much as
11 percent of its power use in the five-month winter period as
demand surges amid freezing temperatures, according to the
Nordic nation’s grid operator.  Demand may rise to as much as 15,000 megawatts through
March while available supply will total 13,300 megawatts,
triggering a need for imports from neighboring countries
including  Russia , Sweden and  Estonia , Fingrid Oyj said today in
an e-mailed statement. That’s in line with last year’s imports,
grid data show.  Finland is dependent on electricity imports, which can
cause power prices to soar in case of surges in demand or
malfunctions in plants or cross-border cables. Imports from
Russia, which have met more than 10 percent of demand in the
past, have become uncertain since Finland’s eastern neighbor
introduced a capacity tariff that made it unviable for it to
export electricity since August 2011, Fingrid said.  “It will be interesting to see whether the differential
between Russian and Finnish power prices will be big enough to
trigger imports during a cold spell,” Reima Paeivinen,
Fingrid’s vice president of power system operation, said today
at a seminar in Helsinki.  The country’s power use was 12,841 megawatts at 11:36 a.m.
Helsinki time with net imports at 2,595 megawatts, according to
Fingrid’s  website . The low temperature will be minus 14 degrees
Celsius (7 Fahrenheit) in Helsinki today, compared with a 10-
year average of minus 1 degree, CustomWeather Inc. data show.  A malfunction on a 550-megawatt cable with  Sweden , Fenno-
Skan-1, will restrict imports from the West until Jan. 25,
according to a Nov. 26 filing with the Nord Pool Spot AS
exchange in Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
