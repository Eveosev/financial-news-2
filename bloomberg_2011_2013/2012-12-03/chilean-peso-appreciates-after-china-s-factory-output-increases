Chile’s peso gained after a report
showed an increase in factory output in  China , the biggest
customer for the South American country’s exports.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 479.65 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:58 a.m. in Santiago. Copper for March delivery
reached the highest in six weeks on a closing basis.  “Chinese manufacturing data added to arguments for an
economic recovery, so markets are positive,” said Francisco Schneider, the head of foreign exchange at Celfin Capital SA
unit in Santiago.  China’s official manufacturing index rose to the highest
level in seven months as new orders and export demand climbed.
China imports more Chilean copper than any other country and
accounted for $1.6 billion of the Andean nation’s $4.4 billion
in exports in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
