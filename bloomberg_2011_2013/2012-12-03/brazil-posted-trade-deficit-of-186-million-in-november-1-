Brazil posted its first  trade gap  in
10 months in November as exports fell more than expected and
imports gained.  The trade deficit was $186 million last month, compared with
a $1.7 billion surplus in October, the Trade Ministry said in a
report published today on its website. Economists forecast a
surplus of $500 million, according to the median estimate from
21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exports fell to $20.5 billion from $21.8 billion in
October, lower than the median forecast of $21 billion in a
Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts. Imports rose to $20.7 billion,
from $20.1 billion.  In recent weeks, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration
has stepped up measures weaken the real, encouraging exports by
making manufacturers more competitive against cheaper imports.
Stimulus measures have also stoked private consumption and
propped up demand for imports. Since August 2011, policy makers
have cut the benchmark  interest rate  to a record low, reduced
taxes on  consumer goods  and lowered bank reserve requirements to
free up billions of reais for credit.  Even as authorities try to revive the world’s second largest
emerging market, Brazil’s gross domestic product in the third
quarter  expanded  at half the pace forecast by economists.  After growing 7.5 percent in 2010 and 2.7 percent last year,
Brazil’s economy will grow 1.27 percent this year, according to
the latest central bank survey of about 100 economists.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell six basis points to 7.77
percent at 3:20 p.m. local time. The real rose 0.8 percent to
2.1181 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporters on this story:
