Czech stock trading was suspended for
almost two-hours a day after the Prage bourse switched to a new
trading platform in an attempt to attract more investors.  Trading was halted between 10:10 a.m. and 12:05 p.m. in
 Prague  after one of the three connection protocols between the
exchange and traders failed, bourse spokesman Jiri Kovarik said
by phone today. The market operator is investigating the outage
and can’t entirely rule out a repetition of the issue, he said.  The Xetra platform was adopted to ease access for foreign
investors and allow Czech market participants to trade in other
countries using the same system, including Germany and  Austria ,
the Prague Stock Exchange said in a statement on its website
after the switch on Nov. 30. The  PX (PX)  equity index fell 0.3
percent to 944.33 in Prague today, while data on turnover hasn’t
been published yet.  “The new system is generally more sophisticated and it’s
certainly a step in the right direction,” Jan Pavlik, head of
trading at broker Wood & Co. in Prague, said by telephone. “The
outage didn’t have a major impact on us and our clients.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
