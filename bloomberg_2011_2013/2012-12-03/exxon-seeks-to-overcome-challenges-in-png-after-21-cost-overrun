Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in  Papua New Guinea , said
it’s confident the development will begin shipments in 2014,
even after costs surged 21 percent.  “There’s still a long road ahead and quite a few
challenges,” Decie Autin, Exxon’s project executive in Papua
New Guinea, said today in a speech in Sydney.  Exxon is working with the government of Papua New Guinea to
resolve infrastructure challenges, especially along the
Highlands Highway used to transport materials, and “law and
order issues,” Autin said. The company also has brought in
special equipment to manage heavy rains, which have hit records
in 14 of the last 21 months, Autin said.  Irving, Texas-based Exxon and its partners, including  Oil
Search Ltd. (OSH)  and  Santos Ltd. (STO) , face higher costs because of a
stronger Australian dollar and construction delays, the
companies said last month. The project also will increase
production capacity by 5 percent to 6.9 million metric tons
annually, according to Exxon.  Initial results “look positive” from exploration drilling
at the P’nyang natural gas resource, and Exxon is evaluating
options for the gas, including a potential third processing unit
for the LNG venture, Autin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
