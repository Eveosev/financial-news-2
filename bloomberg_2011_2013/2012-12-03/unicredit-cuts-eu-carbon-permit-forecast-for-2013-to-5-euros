UniCredit SpA (UCG)  cut its forecast for
European Union carbon permits to an average 5 euros a metric ton
in 2013, predicting a measure to delay sales of some
allowances is unlikely to be implemented next year.  The high volume of permits to be sold at auctions next year
will depress prices, Kathrin Goretzki, a commodity analyst at
the bank, said in a research note published today.  “We expect prices for EU allowances to fall further in
2013, trading in the range of 3.5 euros to 6.5 euros a metric
ton,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
