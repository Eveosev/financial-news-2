Thailand ’s four-year bonds fell for a
fifth day as data signaled  China ’s recovery is gathering pace,
brightening the Southeast Asian nation’s export outlook and
reducing the likelihood of any cut in local  interest rates .  A  manufacturing index  in China, Thailand’s biggest overseas
market, rose to a seven-month high in November, official figures
showed on Dec. 1. Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said on Nov. 28 that current economic data don’t
warrant a further reduction in borrowing costs. The central bank
kept its benchmark  rate  unchanged at 2.75 percent that day,
after lowering it by a quarter of a percentage point in October.  “The economy and bond yields seem to be bottoming out,”
said  Koji Fukaya , president of currency research and consulting
company Office Fukaya in Tokyo and a former chief foreign-
exchange strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG. “The Chinese
economy is probably beginning to stabilize and that will
gradually support Asia’s recovery.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent securities due June 2017 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.11 percent as of
9:05 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thailand’s  exports  climbed 14 percent in October after
falling 0.1 percent the previous month, while imports surged 21
percent, central bank data showed on Nov. 30.  The baht was steady at 30.69 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options,
dropped eight basis points to 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
