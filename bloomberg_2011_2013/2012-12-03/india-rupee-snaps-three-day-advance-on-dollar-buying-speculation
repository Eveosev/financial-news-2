India ’s rupee weakened, snapping a
three-day rally, on speculation importers stepped up purchases
of dollars to take advantage of the currency’s ascent to a
three-week high.  The rupee surged 2.3 percent against the greenback last
week, the most since June, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. India’s economy  expanded  5.3 percent in the three
months through September from a year earlier, matching the pace
in the first quarter that was the slowest since 2009, official
data showed Nov. 30.  “The moves seem to be importers buying dollars,” said
Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in
Mumbai.  The rupee declined 0.9 percent to 54.7650 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest drop since Nov. 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 54.2450 earlier today, the
strongest level since Nov. 7. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange-rates used to price
options, was steady at 10 percent.  India’s $1.8 trillion economy will grow 5.4 percent in the
year through March, Morgan Stanley economists, including Hong
Kong-based Chetan Ahya, wrote in a research report today. That
compared with their earlier estimate of 5.1 percent and would be
the slowest pace in a decade.  Foreign funds pumped $607 million into Indian stocks last
week through Nov. 29, taking November inflows to $1.7 billion,
exchange data show.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.50 per
dollar, compared with 55.22 on Nov. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.48 versus 55.26. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
