Property entrepreneur  Vincent Tchenguiz  is suing the U.K. Serious Fraud Office for about 200
million pounds ($322 million) over illegal searches and seizures
during an investigation into the collapse of Iceland’s Kaupthing
Bank hf.  The SFO dropped its investigation into Vincent and his
brother Robert last month, after a judge ruled its raids had
been unlawful.  “My reputation suffered serious damage during the 15
months between my arrest and the SFO conceding that they had no
grounds for holding me as a suspect,” Vincent said in an e-
mailed statement.  A trial was scheduled for January 2014 following a hearing
this morning at a London court, according to the statement. SFO
spokeswoman Jina Roe declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
