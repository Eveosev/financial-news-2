McClatchy Co. (MNI) , the media company that
owns the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee, raised $910 million in
its first bond sale in more than two years.  The company issued 9 percent, 10-year securities to yield
737 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The newspaper publisher
marketed $750 million on Nov. 29.  Proceeds will go to fund a tender offer for bonds issued in
the company’s previous debt sale, according to a  Standard &
Poor’s  report and Bloomberg data. McClatchy has tendered for as
much as $700 million of its $846 million of 11.5 percent notes
due February 2017, which it issued in August 2010, according to
a Nov. 28 company statement.  Covenants in the deal allow for the first lien debt to be
effectively subordinated by as much as $100 million of “super
priority debt,” according to a report today from research firm
Covenant Review LLC. Also, the collateral on the securities
excludes the company’s property, plant and equipment assets,
which totaled $733 million as of Sept. 23.  The new bonds are rated B1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
the ratings company said in a Nov. 29 report. JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG managed
the sale for the Sacramento, California-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
