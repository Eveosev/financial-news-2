Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , the
world’s largest corn processor, raised its bid for  GrainCorp
Ltd. (GNC)  by 3.8 percent to A$2.8 billion ($2.9 billion) after the
Australian grain handler said an earlier offer was too low.  ADM proposes paying A$12.20 a share in cash, compared with
A$11.75 previously, and allowing GrainCorp investors to keep the
35 cent dividend announced Nov. 15, Decatur, Illinois-based ADM
said yesterday in a statement. ADM said it raised its stake in
GrainCorp to 19.9 percent with the approval of the Australian
Foreign Investment Review Board.  “ADM is getting much closer to a point where GrainCorp
will feel obliged to engage,” James Ferrier, a Melbourne-based
senior research analyst with  Wilson HTM Investment Group (WIG) , said
by phone. “I don’t think they’re yet at a point where the
GrainCorp board are going to accept that price.”  Buying GrainCorp, the only major publicly traded grain
merchant in  Australia  left after the nation deregulated its
wheat-export system, would give ADM control of seven of the
eight ports that ship grain in bulk from the nation’s east coast
as well as a substantial malt producer. Australia is the world’s
second-largest wheat exporter.  GrainCorp gained 3.2 percent to A$12.32 at 11:09 a.m. in
Sydney, the most since Oct. 22, when ADM made its bid. ADM rose
0.3 percent to $26.79 in New York yesterday.  GrainCorp Response  “The GrainCorp board will review the revised proposal and
will advise the market in due course,” the Sydney-based company
said today in a statement. “GrainCorp has a unique portfolio of
integrated, strategic assets and is confident in its outlook and
strategy to continue to deliver shareholder value.”  ADM, which got 52 percent of its sales from the U.S. in
fiscal 2012, has been working to increase foreign revenue. Its
net income dropped 60 percent in the quarter through September
from a year earlier on losses in ethanol and after the worst
U.S. drought in five decades reduced grain merchandising and
handling volume.  “Access to the  emerging markets  is attractive,” Jessica Bemer, an analyst at Sewickley, Pennsylvania-based Snow Capital
Management LP, which oversees $2 billion including ADM shares,
said in a telephone interview.  Biggest Deal  Buying GrainCorp would be ADM’s biggest deal. The largest
so far is its $470 million purchase of W.R. Grace & Co.’s cocoa
business in 1996, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The latest bid is 40 percent higher than GrainCorp’s
closing share price on Oct. 18, the day before the initial offer
was announced, ADM said.  The revised proposal is still too low, with an offer of
between A$13.97 and A$14.33 a share “more in line with recent
transactions,” Belinda Moore, a Brisbane-based analyst with RBS
Morgans Ltd., said in an e-mailed note yesterday.  GrainCorp said Nov. 15 that ADM’s original proposal
undervalued it -- pointing to its global portfolio of grain-
processing assets that handle about 75 percent of annual
production on Australia’s east coast.  ADM’s bid “offers more certainty, greater value and
immediate realization of potential future value for GrainCorp
shareholders than GrainCorp’s standalone plan,” ADM Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz said in yesterday’s
statement.  Due Diligence  The bid is subject to GrainCorp granting ADM access to its
books and recommending the proposal to shareholders, ADM said.
Credit Suisse Group AG and Greenhill & Co. are advising
GrainCorp while Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. are acting for
ADM.  ADM has invested an average of $1.4 billion in capital
investments over the past three fiscal years, according to a
report yesterday by Standard & Poor’s.  That level of investment, including acquisitions, will
continue over several years as the company looks to expand its
global grain origination and processing business, said Chris Johnson, a New York-based credit analyst for S&P. ADM’s credit
measures “may weaken substantially” if it issues debt to
acquire GrainCorp, he said in the report.  Summa Group,  Russia ’s biggest port operator, is raising
money for a foreign grain-trading deal and was considering
making an offer for GrainCorp before ADM made its initial bid,
two people with knowledge of the matter said in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
