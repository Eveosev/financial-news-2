Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s settlement with
Australian patients who received faulty knee implants was
approved by a judge, clearing the way for compensation to be
paid beginning at A$30,000 ($31,000) per user.  Pamela Casey, who had a total knee replacement in 2008,
sued Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy International unit in 2010
on behalf of all patients who had received the DePuy LCS Duofix
Femoral implant. The companies agreed to  settle  the lawsuit in
August with Federal Court Justice  Robert Buchanan  approving the
deal today.  “There have been very few complaints among the more than
430 inquiries received regarding the proposed settlement,”
Buchanan wrote in his reasons for approval. None of the
complaints “provide a reason not to approve the settlement,”
he said.  DePuy and  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson
voluntarily recalled the knee implant in 2009 after reports of
defects surfaced. Prior to the recall, 5,071 of the implants
were used in Australia, the judge said.  Johnson & Johnson and Warsaw, Indiana-based DePuy agreed to
pay A$30,000 to people who underwent revision to the knee
implant and didn’t require additional surgical procedures. The
payment rises to A$65,000 for people who required two or three
other surgical procedures, following the revision surgery.  People who required more surgeries or had significant
complications or injuries will be assessed on an individual
basis, according to the settlement, negotiated by the class
action law firm  Maurice Blackburn , which represented the
plaintiffs.  Johnson & Johnson and DePuy also face an Australian lawsuit
over hip implants, which were also recalled in 2009.  In the U.S., Johnson & Johnson agreed in August to pay
about $600,000 to resolve three cases in the first settlements
of litigation over hip implants. The company faces about 8,000
lawsuits over hip implants in the U.S.  The case is Pamela Joan Casey v. DePuy International Ltd.
