Dan Carter  was named the player of
the year for 2012 as world champion New Zealand swept the
International Rugby Board’s annual awards.  Carter, Test rugby’s all-time top scorer with 1,385 points,
beat out All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, England’s Owen Farrell
and France’s Frederick Michalak. The 30-year-old is only the
second player to capture the honor more than once, with McCaw
winning three times.  Steve Hansen  was named coach of the year and the All Blacks
the team of the year following a 20-match unbeaten run that was
ended two days ago by a 38-21 loss to England.  Hensen replaced  Graham Henry , who led the All Blacks to
victory at the 2011 World Cup, last December and guided New
Zealand to a 10th consecutive Bledisloe Cup win over Australia,
as well as the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship title.  The  awards  were announced in London at the pool draw for
the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The player of the year is selected by
an IRB Awards independent panel, comprising former players with
more than 500 international appearances between them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
