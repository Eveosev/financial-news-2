Jacob Ruppert, who bought  Babe Ruth 
from the Boston Red Sox and turned around the fortunes of the
 New York Yankees , was among three people chosen today for the
National Baseball Hall of Fame.  Joining Ruppert on the list of inductees from the hall’s
Pre-Integration Era Committee are umpire Hank O’Day and 19th
Century infielder/catcher Deacon White.  They each received the 12 or more votes needed from the 16-
member committee, and will be inducted into the Cooperstown, New
York, shrine in July 2013. The election results were announced
at baseball’s Winter Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee.  Ruppert, a brewer who also served in the U.S. House of
Representatives, bought the Yankees in 1915 and transformed them
from a struggling franchise into one that would go on to win a
record 27  World Series  championships. In addition to buying
Ruth, Ruppert built the original Yankee Stadium.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
