Continental Resources Inc. (CLR) , the
largest owner of oil-drilling rights in the U.S. Bakken Shale,
said the formation holds about 57 percent more crude than
previously thought. The shares rose the most in more than three
months.  The formation beneath  North Dakota  and Montana holds the
equivalent of 903 billion barrels of so-called oil in place,
compared with the company’s 2010 estimate of 577 billion,
Oklahoma City-based Continental said in a statement today. The
Bakken’s potential expanded after the company was the first to
successfully tap a deeper geological layer of the Three Forks
zone, according to the statement.  The breakthrough at the  Charlotte  3-22H well represents the
second exploration triumph in as many months for Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Harold Hamm . The company announced a
discovery known as the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province, or
SCOOP, on Oct. 9 that may add 1.8 billion barrels to
Continental’s reserves in coming years.  “The results are very encouraging and indicate that there
may be an upside to our estimate of 24 billion barrels of oil
equivalent of recoverable reserves for the Bakken field,” Jack Stark, Continental’s senior vice president of exploration, said
in the statement.  The shares rose 4.8 percent to $71.99 at 10:16 a.m. in New
York after earlier gaining as much as 5.6 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
