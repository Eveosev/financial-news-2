South African yellow-corn futures
dropped for a second day as rain fell in the second-biggest
growing region, enabling planting for the next season.  Yellow-corn for delivery in March, the most active
contract, declined 0.2 percent to 2,529 rand ($285) a metric ton
by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg.  Parts of the drought-stricken North West province, the
second-largest corn-growing region, had rainfall of 17
millimeters (0.7 inch) to 60 millimeters over the weekend, Johan
van den Berg, an agricultural meteorologist at Santam
Agriculture, a unit of the country’s largest short-term insurer,
said by phone from Bloemfontein today. The  South African Weather
Service  forecasts rainfall for Lichtenburg, located in the North
West, until Dec. 5.  “The guys will be able to plant now,” Van den Berg said.
“They can still plant until the end of the month. The optimal
planting time is until around Dec. 15.”  Meal made from white corn is one of South Africa’s staple
foods while the yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.
The amount of land allocated to the grain in the 2012-13 season
is expected to be 2.74 million hectares (6.77 million acres), or
1.3 percent higher than the previous season, the committee said
on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
