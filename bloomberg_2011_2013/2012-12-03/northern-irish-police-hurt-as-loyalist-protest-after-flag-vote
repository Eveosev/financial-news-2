Northern Ireland  Police said five
officers were hurt, with two requiring hospital treatment, as a
crowd of pro-U.K. loyalists gathered at Belfastâ€™s city hall to
protest at a vote to remove the British flag from the building.  Crowds dispersed 10 p.m. and police are at the scene, in an
area east of downtown Belfast, the  Police Service of Northern
Ireland  said in an e-mailed statement today. Two city hall
security workers were also injured, police said.  Loyalists, some waving union flags, gathered at the city
hall as lawmakers inside voted on a plan to stop flying the flag
every day and instead hoist it on 15 designated days every year.
The vote, opposed by unionist councillors, passed after members
of the cross-community Alliance Party voted with nationalist
lawmakers to carry the motion.  The flag has been flown at the city hall every day since
1906, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.  A press photographer was injured and windows at the city
hall were smashed, according to images shown by Irish
broadcaster RTE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
