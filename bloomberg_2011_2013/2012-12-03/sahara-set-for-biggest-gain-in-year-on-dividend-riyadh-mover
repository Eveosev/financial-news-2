Sahara Petrochemicals Co. (SPC)  advanced
the most in more than a year after the board recommended its
first cash  dividend.   The shares rose 4.4 percent, the biggest increase since
November 2011, to 13.10 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh .
The stock was the  second-biggest gainer  on the benchmark  Tadawul
All Share Index (SASEIDX) , which increased 0.4 percent. The board of the
Saudi Arabian manufacturer of chemicals recommended a dividend
of 0.5 riyal a share for the fiscal year.  “Sahara announced an inaugural dividend ahead of market
expectations, which is a positive signal for the investors,”
said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at Riyad Capital. “The
market had been under pressure and petrochemical stocks had
taken a bit of a plunge.”  Sahara’s shares declined 2.8 percent in November, compared
with a drop of 3.8 percent for the benchmark and a fall of 3.6
percent for the Tadawul All Share Petrochemical Industries
Index. The company has an indicated  dividend yield  of 3.8
percent, compared with a dividend yield of 3.7 percent for the
Tadawul.  Sahara’s  third-quarter profit  fell 55 percent to 44 million
riyals ($12 million). The company may post a 34 percent decline
in full-year profit to 273 million riyals, according to the  mean
estimate  of six analysts on Bloomberg.  Two analysts  recommend investors buy the shares, while
five, including Potrik, say hold and one says sell, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
