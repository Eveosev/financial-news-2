The Philadelphia Eagles fired
defensive line coach Jim Washburn today after dropping their
eighth straight game, 38-33 to the Dallas Cowboys.  Washburn, who led the team’s defensive line the last two
seasons, will be replaced by Tommy Brasher, the team said on its
 website . Brasher held the same position in 1985 and 1999-2005.  “Jim is a fine football coach and we appreciate the
efforts he gave to this team over the past two years,” Eagles
coach Andy Reid said in a statement. “However, I determined
that it was in the team’s best interest that we move in a
different direction in terms of trying to maximize the
production of that position group.”  The Eagles (3-9) have 20 sacks this season, tied for 27th
out of 32 National Football League franchises. Their 50 sacks
last season tied for the league lead.  Defensive end Jason Babin, with 18 sacks in 2012, had 5 1/2
this season when was released Nov. 28. Defensive coordinator
Juan Castillo was fired on Oct. 16 and replaced by Todd Bowles.
The team hasn’t won since Sept. 30.  Reid said at his news conference today that Nick Foles
would remain the starting quarterback for the rest of the
season, even if Michael Vick is cleared to return from a
concussion suffered on Nov. 11. The coach said he made the
decision based on the team’s record and Vick’s health.  Foles was 22 of 34 for 251 yards and a touchdown against
the Cowboys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
