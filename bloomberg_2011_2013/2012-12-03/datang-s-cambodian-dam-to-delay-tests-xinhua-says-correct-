(Corrects date of accident in first paragraph.)  Three workers on a hydropower dam in
 Cambodia  went missing after a rupture of a concrete tunnel on
Dec. 1, Xinhua News reported, citing Sarun Chanthy, the police
chief of the country’s Pursat province.  Operational tests on the dam originally scheduled for the
end of this year will be delayed because of the damage,
according to the report. China Datang Corp. is an investor in
the dam, Xinhua News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
