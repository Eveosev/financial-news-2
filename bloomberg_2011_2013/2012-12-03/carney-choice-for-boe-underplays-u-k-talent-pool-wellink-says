The U.K.’s choice of Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney to lead the Bank of England was surprising
given the breadth of local talent already available, said Dutch
Central Bank President Nout Wellink.  “I don’t why they haven’t chosen excellent people in the
U.K.,” Wellink said in a Nov. 30 interview on Bloomberg
Television in  Frankfurt . “I don’t know whether that is a
political decision, but Mark Carney is an excellent governor. It
might not be easy for him in the years to come.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced on
Nov. 26 that Carney would replace Mervyn King after his term
ends in June. U.K. officials who applied for the job included
Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker, who was the front-
runner for the job at bookmakers, and Financial Services
Authority Chairman Adair Turner.  “It did surprise me,” Wellink said. “I know him, I have
seen him operating in the G-10, the G-20 and other fora. He’s an
excellent choice.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
