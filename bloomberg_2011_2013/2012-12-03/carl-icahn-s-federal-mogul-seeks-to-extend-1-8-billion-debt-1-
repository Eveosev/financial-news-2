Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDML) , the auto-parts
supplier controlled by billionaire  Carl Icahn , will host a call
with lenders on Dec. 5 at 10 a.m. in New York to discuss an
amendment to its credit pact, according to a person with
knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be identified because
it’s private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co . are arranging
the transaction, which will extend maturities on a $1.8 billion
term loan to 2016 from 2014, the company said in a statement
today.  Its revolving asset-based credit, to which the banks have
agreed to commit an additional $125 million, will be extended to
2017 from 2013, according to the Southfield, Michigan-based
company.  As part of the refinancing, Federal-Mogul will issue $150
million of common stock to a subsidiary of  Icahn Enterprises LP (IEP) 
according to the statement. The transaction requires the company
to prepay as much as $300 million of the extended term loans.  Federal-Mogul obtained the original debt when it exited
from bankruptcy in 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The $540 million revolving credit line initially paid
interest at 1.75 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, while the term B portion initially paid
interest at 1.94 percentage points more than Libor, Bloomberg
data show. It also has about $953 million of debt under a term C
slice, the data show.  In a revolving line of credit, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan  it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
