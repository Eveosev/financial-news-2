U.S. Small Business Administrator 
Karen Gordon Mills says small businesses are watching the fiscal
cliff debate with great interest because as they head toward the
holidays they want "to make sure their customers and consumers 
have some money in their pocket." Mills talks with Bloomberg's 
 Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays 
Advantage."   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 13:31
