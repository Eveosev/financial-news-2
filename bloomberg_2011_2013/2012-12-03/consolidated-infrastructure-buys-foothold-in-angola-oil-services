  Consolidated Infrastructure Group
Ltd. (CIL)  bought almost a third of  Angola  Environmental Servicos
Limitada, an oil and gas waste-management company, to gain
exposure to the country’s expanding oil industry.  Consolidated paid $15.3 million for 30.5 percent of AES
while two other investors bought smaller stakes, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement. AES generated
sales of $42.6 million in the year ended 31 December, it said.  “The number of oil rigs operating offshore in Angola will
increase significantly over the next few years,” the company
said in the statement published on the Johannesburg stock
exchange news service. “Changes to environmental legislation
enacted in July 2012 will significantly enhance AES’s
business.”  Angola pumps about 1.8 million barrels of oil a day, making
it Africa’s largest producer after  Nigeria . Exploration in so-
called pre-salt offshore blocks could double Angola’s output in
10 to 15 years, Tako Koning, a geologist and manager of Angola
business development at Gaffney, Cline & Associates, said last
month.  Shares in Consolidated advanced 2.5 percent to 14.55 rand,
its highest value in almost five years. The company has gained
more than 45 percent this year, valuing it at 1.73 billion rand
($195 million).  Consolidated, which builds electricity stations for
utilities and miners, said it would fund 30 percent of the
purchase with cash and the remaining 70 percent with shares. The
shares could number about 7.5 million at a 10 percent discount
to the Nov. 27 price, according to pro-forma financial
information in the statement.  Fundo De Investimento Privado Angola S.C.A., a private
equity fund based in  Luxembourg , bought 16 percent of AES for $8
million, Consolidated said. Morten Eriksen, a portfolio manager
at Laerernes Pension Forsikrin in  Denmark , purchased 1.5 percent
for $750,000. The total price for 48 percent of the company was
$24 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
