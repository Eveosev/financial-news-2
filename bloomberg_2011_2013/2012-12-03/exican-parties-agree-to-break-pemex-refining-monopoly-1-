Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto
and leaders of the nation’s three largest parties agreed to work
toward allowing competition for some of  Petroleos Mexicanos ’s
operations and revise mining royalties.  Mexico will make “the necessary reforms to create a
competitive environment in the economic processes of refining,
petrochemical, and transportation of hydrocarbons,” according
to a  document  signed by the new president and the heads of
Mexico’s three largest political parties.  In 2008, former president  Felipe Calderon  proposed a bill
that would’ve allowed state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos to
partner for deep-water projects and private companies to build
refineries in Mexico. Congress instead gave the company known as
Pemex leeway to hire companies without granting these outside
firms the ability to market Mexican crude and rebuffed private
investment in refining.  Breaking Pemex’s monopoly in refining “will most likely
require a constitutional amendment,” board member Fluvio Ruiz
said today in a phone interview from Mexico City.  Pemex won’t be privatized, according to document published
on the president’s website.  The accord, which outlines goals for the relationship
between Pena Nieto’s government and Congress for the coming
years, also said a new mining law will be created and that
royalties will be reviewed. About 100 members of the different
parties attended the signing at Chapultepec Castle yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
