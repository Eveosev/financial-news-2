Innospec Inc. (IOSP) , a U.S. producer of
fuel additives, withdrew its $744.7 million offer for  TPC Group
Inc. (TPCG)  after the world’s largest maker of butadiene agreed to be
acquired by private-equity firms First Reserve Corp. and SK
Capital Partners.  Innospec and  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  had made a $47.50-a-share
bid on Nov. 15. Littleton, Colorado-based Innospec said today it
will pay a $2-a-share special dividend on Dec. 21.  “While we still feel that it is a good fit with Innospec,
we are unable to conclude a deal structure in a manner where we
are totally satisfied with the value creation for our
shareholders,” Innospec Chief Executive Officer Patrick Williams said in a statement today.  TPC shareholders are scheduled to vote Dec. 5 on the $45-a-
share offer from First Reserve and SK, which has regulatory
approval. TPC fell 6.8 percent to $44.75 in  New York . Innospec
rose 1.4 percent to $32.28.  TPC, formerly known as Texas Petrochemical Inc., competes
in the market for butadiene with LyondellBasell Industries NV,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. It’s planning to
boost its output by refurbishing a Houston plant to make the
chemical from butane, a component of natural gas that has
increased in supply with production from shale-rock formations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
