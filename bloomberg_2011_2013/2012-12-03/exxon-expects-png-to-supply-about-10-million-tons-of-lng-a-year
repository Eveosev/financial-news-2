Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea,
expects the Pacific nation will supply more than 10 million
metric tons of LNG annually by 2025.  Natural gas demand is forecast to rise by more than 60
percent by 2040, Jeff Appleton, Exxon senior vice president of
LNG marketing, said today in a speech in Sydney. The Asia-
Pacific region will account for 29 percent of total worldwide
gas demand in 2040, with consumption in the U.S. and Europe
unchanged or declining, he said.  Exxon and its partners in the LNG venture, including  Santos
Ltd. (STO)  and  Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) , will increase production capacity by 5
percent to 6.9 million tons annually, the Irving, Texas-based
oil producer said last month. Exxonâ€™s development is on schedule
to start shipments in 2014, even after a 21 percent cost
overrun, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
