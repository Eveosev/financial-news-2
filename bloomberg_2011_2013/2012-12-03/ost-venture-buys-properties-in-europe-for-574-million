A  Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (HST)  joint
venture acquired five hotels in Paris and Amsterdam for about
440 million euros ($574 million).  The hotels, which comprise 1,733 rooms, were purchased from
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Whitehall Real Estate Funds,
according to a statement today by Bethesda, Maryland-based Host.
The company, the largest U.S. lodging real estate investment
trust, holds a 33.4 percent stake in the joint venture.  “The acquisition provides the venture with further brand
and geographic diversification,” Host said in the statement.  The deal will be funded in part by a 250 million-euro loan,
secured by the properties, at a 4.4 percent interest rate,
according to the statement.  The hotels in the deal are the 757-room Paris Marriott Rive
Gauche Hotel & Conference Center, the 402-room Renaissance
Amsterdam Hotel, the 327-room Renaissance Paris La Defense
Hotel, the 97-room Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, and the 150-
room Courtyard Paris La Defense West - Colombes, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
