Qatar, the Persian Gulf emirate
hosting this year’s  United Nations  climate talks, plans to
tender its first solar power project in the first quarter of
2013, the country’s energy minister said.  The project will generate 200 megawatts of power when
completed by 2020, Mohammed al-Sada told a press conference in
Doha today. The project will produce 2 percent of the nation’s
electricity, he said. It’s the first step in a goal to have
1,800 megawatts of solar power by 2020.  Qatar, which has no large renewable energy plants, joins
 Saudi Arabia , Dubai and Abu Dhabi in announcing clean energy
plans to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and related emissions.
Saudi Arabia aims to meet a third of its electricity with solar
power by 2032, while Dubai targets 5 percent of generation by
2030.  Abu Dhabi  wants 7 percent of its power from renewable
sources by 2020.  “We want to produce more clean energy to save burning
natural gas in  power plants , which we can sell at higher prices
globally,” al-Sada said.  The project will use different solar technologies including
solar-thermal, al-Sada said. The country is producing
polysilicon in order to produce solar cells that will be used in
the project, he said.  The nation aims to boost solar power as part of plans to
meet 20 percent of its energy demand from renewable sources by
2030, Qatar Solar Technologies said in October. QSTec is a
venture between the private charity Qatar Foundation  Germany ’s
 SolarWorld AG (SWV)  and the Qatar Development Bank.  Solar Ventures  The venture aims to produce polysilicon, manufacture
photovoltaic panels and install the devices that generate
electricity directly from the sun in the country, it said today.
In May, QSTec obtained financing for a $1 billion polysilicon
plant in Ras Laffan City from Islamic lender  Masraf Al Rayan. (MARK)   The facility will initially produce 8,000 metric tons of
polysilicon a year and enough of the raw material for 6.5
gigawatts in panels when at full capacity, according to QSTec.  Envoys from more than 190 nations are in Qatar’s capital
for two weeks of discussions on how to limit global warming. The
UN organizes the annual conference is attracting 17,600
delegates including business leaders and energy ministers from
around the globe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
