Turkey  asked  Russia  to increase
natural gas supplies by 3 billion cubic meters a year, Russian
Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.  OAO Gazprom (OGZD) , Russia’s natural-gas export monopoly, agreed
to consider expanding the Blue Stream pipeline running under the
Black Sea, he told reporters today in Istanbul. It may also use
South Stream, a planned offshore pipeline from Russia to
Bulgaria, he said. Bulgaria is already used as a transit country
for Russian gas supplies to Turkey via the so-called western
route, he said.  “It’s all just on the drawing board at the moment,” Novak
said at the briefing after President Vladimir Putin met with
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The request for
additional gas is for “the near future,” he said.  Turkey is the second-largest export market after Germany
for state-owned Gazprom, according to the Moscow-based company’s
export unit. The company ships gas to Turkey via the Transbalkan
pipeline through Ukraine, Moldova,  Romania  and  Bulgaria  as well
as via the direct Blue Stream underwater link. Turkey, along
with Bulgaria, agreed to give a Gazprom-led venture use of its
Black Sea territorial waters to build the 10 billion-euro ($13
billion) South Stream pipeline.  Russia’s long-term gas contracts with Turkey cover 30
billion cubic meters a year. Deliveries will increase to about
27 billion cubic meters this year from 26 billion cubic meters
in 2011, Novak said.  Russia also ships about 2 million tons of crude to Turkey
annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
