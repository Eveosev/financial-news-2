Text messages turn 20 today and their
use may rise 40 percent by 2016, even as mobile-phone owners
increasingly rely on  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and WhatsApp to communicate.  The first SMS, or short message service, text was sent over
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s network on Dec. 3, 1992 with the message
“ Merry Christmas .” By 2016, users may send 9.4 trillion texts,
generating $127 billion in revenue, up from 6.7 trillion
forecast for this year, according to researcher Informa Plc.  SMS became a key source of income for carriers worldwide,
initially costing users a few cents per text and eventually
becoming wrapped into unlimited voice and data plans. As more
customers have switched to smartphones, with better access to
the Internet and more applications, people are increasingly
using chat features on Facebook and other websites.  “The concern for mobile operators is that the malaise that
SMS faces in countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, China,
South Korea and the Philippines, where SMS traffic and revenues
are in decline, will inevitably spread, as the penetration of
smartphones and mobile broadband grows,” Informa said in a
note.  Growth will come via  emerging markets  in Africa, Asia and
 Latin America  where fewer users have smartphones and they rely
on SMS for communication as well as services such as mobile
banking, Informa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
