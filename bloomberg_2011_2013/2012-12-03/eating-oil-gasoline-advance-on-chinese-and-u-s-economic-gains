Heating oil and gasoline climbed as
factory output in  China  rose to the highest level in seven
months following reports last week of U.S. economic gains.  Futures rose after China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index
reached 50.6 in November, according to the  National Bureau of
Statistics  and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.
U.S. economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, weekly
jobless claims fell and pending home resales climbed in October,
all signs that fuel demand may increase.  “We’ve been rallying on the economic headlines starting
last week with the third-quarter U.S. GDP and now factory orders
in China,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  January-delivery heating oil rose 3.15 cents, or 1 percent,
to $3.0922 a gallon at 9:29 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices fell 0.9 percent last month.  Gasoline for January delivery advanced 2.85 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.7588 a gallon on the exchange. Prices were almost
unchanged in October.  Gross domestic product grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in
the third quarter, up from a 2 percent prior estimate, revised
figures from the Commerce Department showed. Applications for
 jobless benefits  fell by 23,000 to 393,000 in the week ended
Nov. 24, according to Labor Department data.  The  index  of pending home resales climbed 5.2 percent in
October, after a revised 0.4 percent gain in September, the
National Association of Realtors reported.  “Growth in the Chinese and U.S. economies is supporting
prices,” Lipow said.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  fell 0.4
cent to $3.387 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s
the lowest average since July 11. The pump price reached a 2012
high of $3.936 on April 4.  -- Editors:  Charlotte  Porter, Bill Banker  To contact the reporter on this story:
