Gasoline advanced in  New York  Harbor
after Philadelphia Energy Solutions shut three units at the
 Philadelphia refinery .  The 355,000-barrel-a-day plant last week shut a 1332
reformer, 231 hydrotreater and 331 isomerization unit at the
Girard Point section of the refinery, according to a notice with
state regulators. An “H2 heater tripped and wouldn’t relight”
at the plant, the filing showed.  Cherice Corley, a company spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail inquiring about the status of the units.  Reformulated gasoline in New York Harbor gained 0.13 cent
to a premium of 4.13 cents a gallon over futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 2:48 p.m.  Conventional gasoline  rose 1.88
cents to trade 3.88 cents above futures.  Motor gasoline supplies in the Central Atlantic region
including the New York Harbor, known as PADD 1B, dropped 879,000
barrels to 22.8 million in the week ended Oct. 23, the Energy
Department reported last week. That’s 19 percent lower than the
same time period in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
