Romania  may be technically able to
export natural gas through a pipeline to neighboring  Hungary 
starting from the end of 2015, Ziarul Financiar reported, citing
unidentified officials at gas grid operator Transgaz SA.  The technical conditions for gas exports through the
pipeline running between Arad in western Romania and Szeged in
southeastern Hungary will be created at the end of 2015, Ziarul
Financiar said.  Romania’s gas production covers about 80 percent of the
country’s consumption and Transgaz has not received any requests
for exports so far, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
