European Central Bank Vice President
 Vitor Constancio  said policy initiatives implemented this year
have succeeded in alleviating tensions in financial markets.  “As a result of the combined effect of the measures
implemented by the ECB, the euro money market conditions
improved during 2012, although its fragmentation remains still
high,” Constancio said in a speech in Frankfurt today,
according to a text provided by the ECB.  Financial-market tensions have eased after ECB President
 Mario Draghi  committed to buy the bonds of distressed nations as
long as they fix their budgets and reform their economies. The
ECB also provided banks with more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) in cheap three-year loans and softened rules on the
collateral it accepts in exchange for the funds.  “A key lesson from the crisis is that we need to better
understand and monitor the repo as well as the securities
lending markets, given their importance for the efficient
functioning of the financial system,” Constancio said.  While more detailed information provides regulators with
“insights that may help them to identify trends in the build-up
of risks over time,” increased transparency might also benefit
central banks and guide policy decisions on collateral and risk
control, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
