Serbia ’s central bank will hold its
final rate-setting meeting of the year on Dec. 14 instead of
Dec. 6, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said.  The change was made “because of the obligations of
Executive Board members,” the bank said on its website today.  The National Bank of Serbia has raised its  benchmark  rate
five times since June by a total of 145 basis points, or 1.45
percentage points, to 10.95 percent, as it tries to tame
inflation that reached 12.9 percent in October.  The bank officially targets year-end inflation of 4
percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
