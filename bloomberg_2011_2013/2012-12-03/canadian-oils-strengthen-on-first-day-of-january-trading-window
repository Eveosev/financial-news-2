Canadian crudes strengthened in the
 spot market  on the first day of the January trading window.  Syncrude, a light oil processed from bitumen, traded at its
highest level against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate in
more than a month. The trading window for January delivery of
Canadian crude begins today and ends Dec. 14.  Syncrude rose $2.40 a barrel to trade at a 40-cent premium
to West Texas Intermediate as of 2:07 p.m.  New York  time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was highest price
relative to WTI since Oct. 24.  Western Canada Select, a heavy oil grade, rose 50 cents to
trade at a $29 discount to WTI.  Most of the trading for Canadian crudes takes place in a
three-week “window” beginning on the first business day of the
month until pipeline volume nominations are due. In December,
the window is shortened because of the holiday season.  Crudes delivered on the  Gulf of Mexico  coast weakened as
WTI gained strength against North Sea Brent, the global
benchmark crude. Brent slipped 50 cents to a $21.82 premium
against WTI at 2:08 p.m.  As Brent’s premium to WTI declines, alternatives such as
Gulf crudes also tend to fall. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
declined 65 cents to $20.85, Southern Green Canyon’s slipped 65
cents to $17, Mars Blend’s dropped 45 cents to $16.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
