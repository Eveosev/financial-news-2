Pedestrians caught jaywalking in
 China  may find their credit scores affected, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported, citing a Ministry of Public Security
official.  The current maximum fine of 50  yuan  ($8) or a warning isn’t
enough of a deterrent and the traffic bureau is looking into
punishment that could affect personal credit scores, the
official, who wasn’t identified, told Xinhua yesterday.  China, the world’s largest market for new vehicle sales,
held its first ever national traffic safety day on Sunday. There
were more than 210,000 traffic accidents last year, resulting in
more than 60,000 deaths and 230,000 injuries, according to a
Xinhua report posted on the public security ministry’s website.  China had 238 million vehicles and 256 million drivers as
of October, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
