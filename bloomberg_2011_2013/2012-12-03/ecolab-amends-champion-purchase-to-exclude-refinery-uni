Ecolab Inc. (ECL) , the largest maker of
cleaning chemicals for hotels and restaurants, amended its
agreement to buy Champion Technologies Inc. to exclude a unit
that sells water-treatment chemicals to refiners.  The units will be spun off to shareholders of Permian Mud
Service Inc., the parent of Houston-based Champion Technologies,
according to a statement today. Ecolab, based in  St. Paul ,
Minnesota, agreed to buy Champion for $2.2 billion in cash and
stock on Oct. 12 in a bid to become the largest supplier of oil-
field chemicals in  North America . The amended agreement reduces
the value of the transaction to $2.16 billion.  “When we announced the deal, we made it very clear we were
focused on the upstream part, which is a very stable and growing
part of the business,” Lisa Curran, an Ecolab spokeswoman, said
in an interview. “The downstream portion is a very small part
of the business, and it’s not a strategic part of what we’re
going after.”  The downstream, or refining, business had sales of about
$50 million last year. Its exclusion won’t “have a significant
impact” on the economics of the deal, which is expected to
close by the end of the year. Ecolab said it still sees the
purchase adding 12 cents a share in adjusted earnings next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
