Asian clean-technology companies’
sales overtook those of European peers last year on surging
Chinese renewable-energy investments, Ernst & Young said.  Asian companies’ revenue rose 20 percent to $56 billion as
sales by Europeans fell 32 percent to $49.5 billion, said the
consultant in an e-mailed statement today. North American
companies’ sales gained 29 percent to $30 billion. The industry
was unprofitable last year with combined global losses of $6.6
billion, after profit of $5.1 billion in 2010, E&Y said.  “Mainly Chinese companies have committed to a clear target
to become leaders in the clean-tech market,” said Robert
Seiter, head of E&Y’s German clean-tech team. “They’re pursuing
an aggressive growth strategy that’s radically focused on sales
growth -- even if that comes at the expense of profit margins.”  The  International Energy Agency  expects plants such as wind
farms, solar parks and hydroelectric dams to rival coal as the
main generators of electricity by 2035. That’s even as solar and
wind equipment makers from  Denmark ’s  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  to
 China ’s  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  struggle with falling margins
and industry overcapacity. Chinese solar and wind companies have
expanded to help meet a target to get 20 percent of the nation’s
energy from renewables by 2014 even as global demand slows.  E&Y analyzed about 400 listed companies that generate more
than half of their sales from clean technologies, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
