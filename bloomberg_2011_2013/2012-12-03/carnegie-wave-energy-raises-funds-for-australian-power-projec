Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. (CWE) , a producer
of technology that generates power from the sea, raised A$5.8
million ($6.1 million) to build its first grid-connected project
off Perth, Western  Australia .  The company got a grant from the state government as well
as about A$3.5 million from private investors, mostly existing
shareholders, Perth-based Carnegie said today in a  statement .  The 2-megawatt wave-power project will cost about A$31.2
million, of which more than half is now government-funded, the
statement shows. Construction will start in 2013, with power
sent to the grid at the end of that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
