Time Warner Cable (TWC)  Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Glenn Britt threatened to drop networks with
low ratings when their programming contracts expire to combat
rising pay-television costs.  Distribution on Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S.
cable company, “is not a birthright,” Britt said at a
conference today in New York hosted by UBS AG.  Time Warner Cable’s programming costs since 2008 have
increased about 30 percent, leading to a 15 percent increase in
cable-TV prices, Britt said. The trends are unsustainable as
prices rise too quickly for many people to afford, he said.  “If you have a network that is getting hash-mark ratings
and no real sign it’s going to get any better, we’re going to
have a different kind of conversation that we might have had
five, six or 10 years ago,” Britt said.  Dropping low-rated networks can be a tricky decision
because their owners often bundle them with higher-rated
channels, forcing U.S. cable companies to pay for all of them or
lose access to networks they would otherwise want to keep.  Britt declined to say how New York-based Time Warner Cable
would deal with the dilemma of potentially losing popular
channels.  “We’re going to have to do things where we can,” Britt
said in an interview after the conference. “Stay tuned.”  Time Warner Cable  gained  0.7 percent to $95.53 at 10:47
a.m. in  New York . The shares had climbed 49 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
