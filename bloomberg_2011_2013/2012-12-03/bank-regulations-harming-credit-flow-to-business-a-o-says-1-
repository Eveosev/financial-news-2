Tighter financial regulation around
the world is constraining bank lending to businesses, according
to research published today by  Allen & Overy  LLP, which polled
its regulatory and finance lawyers.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’s incoming rules
and U.K. recommendations from the Independent Commission on
Banking may “have much wider economic impacts” than the
changes intend, including stifling credit, A&O said.  “Four years down the line following the crisis we are
seeing huge amounts of regulation, thousands of pages, impacting
banks,” Etay Katz, a regulatory partner at the London-based  law
firm , said in an interview today with  Mark Barton  on Bloomberg
Television. “Despite international efforts to harmonize
regulation, we see a lot of turf wars, incohesion, duplication,
and more than anything uncertainty.”  The law firm asked its employees whether new regulations
were having a positive, neutral or negative impact on the
availability of credit across 11 separate areas of finance,
including corporate lending, bonds and trade finance, in 13
countries.  The so-called Basel III rules would more than triple the
core capital that banks must hold as a buffer against
insolvency, while the U.K. recommendations suggest placing
firebreaks around British banks’ retail operations.  Allen & Overy is the third-largest member by income of the
U.K.’s so-called magic circle firms and has about 2,700 lawyers
in more than 40 offices around the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
