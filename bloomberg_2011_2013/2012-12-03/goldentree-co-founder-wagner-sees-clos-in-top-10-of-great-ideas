Leon Wagner, the retired chairman of
GoldenTree Asset Management LP, said collateralized loan
obligations are in the top 10 percent of attractive investments
because they are still cheap after the 2008 financial crisis.  Corporations that are more difficult to finance represent
“tremendous opportunity,” according to Wagner, who co-founded
New York-based  GoldenTree , the $16.9 billion hedge fund
specializing in corporate credit. CLOs are a type of
collateralized debt obligation that pool high-yield, high-risk
loans and slice them into securities of varying risk and return.  “The opportunities in the market are still a function of
what happened during the credit crash,” Wagner said today in a
television interview on Bloomberg’s “Market Makers.” “The
overhang and fear continues such that leverage continues to be
underpriced.”  As  Europe  struggles with a record unemployment rate and the
U.S. faces the prospect of tax increases and spending cuts in
early 2013, investors are seeking safety in the highest part of
a company’s capital structure, pouring $7.5 billion into bank
loan funds this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Nearly
$46 billion of CLOs have been sold this year, three times the
amount raised in 2011, according to JPMorgan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
