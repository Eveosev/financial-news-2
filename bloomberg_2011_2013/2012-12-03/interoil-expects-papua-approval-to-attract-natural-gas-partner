InterOil Corp. (IOC)  expects approval for a
liquefied natural gas project from the Papua New Guinea
government will help attract a partner to develop the venture.  “There are a number of international  oil companies , a
number of national oil companies and a number of utilities”
that have spoken to InterOil about joining the planned project,
Chief Executive Officer Phil Mulacek said today in an interview
in Sydney. “We’ve funneled that down to a shorter list.”  InterOil last month received approval from Papua New
Guinea’s National Executive Council, clearing the way for the
proposed LNG plant with an initial production capacity of 3.8
million metric tons annually. The company said last year it
hired Morgan Stanley, UBS AG and Macquarie Group Ltd. to
evaluate partnership proposals.  InterOil shares in New York have risen 8.9 percent this
year, compared with a 10 percent increase in the  New York  Stock
Exchange Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
