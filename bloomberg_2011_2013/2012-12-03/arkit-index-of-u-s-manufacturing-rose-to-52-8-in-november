The Markit Economics final  index  of
U.S. manufacturing increased to 52.8 in November from 51 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The final figure
compares with an initial November reading of 52.4.  Markitâ€™s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of those American manufacturers who
respond to a poll of more than 600 companies.  The gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The company
surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries and
regions, including Europe and  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
