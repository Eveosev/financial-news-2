Crodux Plin d.o.o. ,  Croatia â€™s
closely-held gas retailer, plans to build a 500 million-euro
($652 million) thermoelectric plant near Slavonski Brod in
eastern Croatia,  Vecernji List  reported, citing Hrvoje Cermak, a
management board member.  The 570-megawatt, gas-powered facility will probably start
