India ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
second day, pushing the yield to the lowest level in more than a
month, on speculation a central bank plan to buy debt will spur
demand for the securities.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will offer to purchase a total
120 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes due in 2018, 2020,
2022 and 2027 at an open-market auction tomorrow, it said in a
statement last week. The RBI may buy as much as 500 billion
rupees of bonds during the rest of the fiscal year that ends
March 31,  Standard Chartered  Plc estimates.  “We believe the open-market operations make the demand-
supply equation favorable for  government bonds ,” analysts at
Standard Chartered including Singapore-based Nagaraj Kulkarni
wrote in a research note today.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.17 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the lowest level since Oct. 29. It dropped six basis points last
week and four basis points in November.  The central bank, which last held a debt-purchase auction
in June, picked up 820 billion rupees of securities in the first
quarter of this fiscal year to boost the availability of funds
in the financial system.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.72 percent today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
