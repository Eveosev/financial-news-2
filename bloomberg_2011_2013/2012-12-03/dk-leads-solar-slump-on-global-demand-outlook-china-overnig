Chinese equities  retreated from a
one-week high in New York, led by  LDK (LDK)  Solar Co., after the
world’s second-largest wafer maker cut its sales forecast this
year on expectations global demand is faltering.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dipped 0.9 percent to 91.98
yesterday, after losing 1.2 percent in November. LDK tumbled 10
percent and Suntech Power Holdings Co., the world’s biggest
solar-panel maker, slid the most in two weeks. Social networking
site owner  Renren Inc. (RENN)  posted the biggest loss in three months,
while Qihoo 360 Technology Co., owner of  China ’s most popular
Web browser, surged to the highest level since May 2011.  LDK reported a third-quarter loss that was wider than a
year earlier. The company’s results follow  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and
 Yingli Green  Energy Co.’s reports of losses since the third
quarter of 2011 or earlier. LDK cut its full-year projection for
sales and shipments, citing lower market demand and product
oversupply, as well as anti-dumping tariffs on solar products
imposed by U.S. and European governments.  “There will be a long, long climb back to actual
profitability for Chinese solar companies, unless global GDP
accelerates dramatically,” James Kelleher, an analyst at Argus
Research said by phone yesterday from New York. “LDK is an
integrated supplier, so they feel the pain all throughout the
supply chain.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., lost 0.9 percent to a one-week
low of $36.8. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dipped 0.5 percent
to 1,409.46 as an unexpected contraction in U.S. manufacturing
spurred concern about the potential economic toll from the so-
called fiscal cliff.  LDK Plunges  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  retreated 1.5 percent
to 10,458.91 yesterday while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dipped
1 percent to 1,959.767, the lowest level since January 2009, as
concern that a possible wave of initial public offerings will
lure funds away from existing equities overshadowed evidence
that economic growth is rebounding.  LDK plunged to $1.05 in the biggest drop since Oct. 19.  The company, based in Xinyu of China’s Jiangxi province,
expects revenue of $950 million to $1 billion for 2012, down
from a Sept. 17 forecast of $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion,
according to its statement yesterday. Its net loss for the
quarter widened to $136.9 million from $114.5 million in the
year-earlier period.  LDK cut 2,563 jobs, about 16 percent of its workforce, from
the prior quarter, the company said on a conference call
yesterday. Wafer production costs rose to 25 cents a watt from
17 cents as it reduced output, and average selling price rose to
30 cents from 25 cents.  iPhone Orders  Suntech slid 1.8 percent on its second day of declines to
89 cents.  Trina Solar  dropped 3.1 percent to $2.78 and Yingli
Green retreated 2.8 percent to $1.75.  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the nation’s third-largest mobile-
phone carrier, sank 2 percent to $53.22, the lowest since Nov.
15.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) , the second largest, slid 1.2
percent to $15.35, the lowest close in a week.  The two operators have competed to be the first to sell
Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5 in China after the Cupertino, California-
based company said in a Nov. 30 statement the smartphone will be
available in the country on Dec. 14. China Telecom said it
started to accept orders for iPhone 5 on Dec. 2 in an
announcement  posted  a day earlier on Sina Corp’s Twitter-like
Weibo service. China Unicom’s order started on Dec. 3,  according
to  its Nov. 30 Weibo posting.  Qihoo Surges  Both companies need to subsidize the smartphones to attract
subscribers, according to a Nov. 30  report  on Sootoo.com, a
website focusing on Chinese Internet industry news. Total
subsidies to iPhone 5 sales are estimated to be more than 1
billion  yuan  ($160 million) each for the carriers, the report
said, citing Analysys International analyst Guo Yang.  Renren, which runs a real-name social networking website in
China, dropped 6.4 percent to $3.21, the biggest decline in
three months.  Qihoo 360 jumped 9.8 percent to $27.44, the highest since
May 24, 2011. Trading volume on the stock was 5.6 times the
three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  George I. Askew, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said
Qihoo will continue to add new search functions after it
introduced a music search tab and a map query feature last week,
according to his  report  yesterday. He reiterated a buy rating on
Qihoo’s stock with a 12-month price target of $31.  Beijing-based Qihoo started a new online search engine in
August, challenging market leader Baidu Inc. Qihoo said it
accounts for 10 percent of China’s Internet searches, the Wall
Street Journal reported Nov. 30.  SouFun Jumps  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the country’s biggest real estate
website owner, surged 8.5 percent to a four-month high of
$23.38. Trading volume on SouFun stock was three times the
three-month daily average.  China’s new home prices rose 0.26 percent in November from
October, a sixth month of advances, SouFun said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday, based on its survey of 100 cities.  Thirty-day volatility  in the Bloomberg China-US gauge
increased to 19.69 yesterday, from 19.64 on Nov. 30 and compared
with this year’s average of 22.5. The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse
Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a basket of companies that gained
U.S. listings after buying firms that already trade, climbed 0.7
percent to 75.41, the highest since May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
