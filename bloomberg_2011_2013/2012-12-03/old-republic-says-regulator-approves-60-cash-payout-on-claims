Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) , the
insurer that stopped backing new home loans, said its regulator
in North Carolina approved a plan to allow for cash payment of
60 percent of settled mortgage-guaranty claims.  The remainder will be covered through a deferred payment
obligation, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
