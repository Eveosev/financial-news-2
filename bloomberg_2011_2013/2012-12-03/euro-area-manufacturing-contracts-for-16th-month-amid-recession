Euro-area  manufacturing output 
contracted for a 16th month in November, adding to signs a
recession in the currency bloc may extend into next year as
leaders struggle to tackle the sovereign-debt crisis.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area rose to
46.2 from 45.4 in October, London-based Markit Economics said
today. That’s in line with an  initial estimate  on Nov. 22. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The euro-area economy has shrunk for two successive
quarters and economists foresee a further decline in gross
domestic product in the final three months of the year. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week
forecast contractions of 0.4 percent and 0.1 percent this year
and next.  “The ongoing steep pace of manufacturing decline suggests
that the region’s recession will have deepened in the final
quarter of the year, extending into a third successive
quarter,”  Chris Williamson , Chief Economist at Markit, said in
the report. “The rate of GDP decline is likely to have gathered
pace markedly on the surprisingly modest 0.1 percent decline
seen in the third quarter.  With euro-area unemployment at a record, economists project
the region’s GDP will decrease 0.3 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to the median of 25 forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey.  The euro was higher against the dollar, trading at $1.3032
at 10:11 a.m. in Brussels, up 0.4 percent on the day, after
reaching $1.3047 earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
