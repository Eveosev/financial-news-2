Sweden’s manufacturing  contracted for
a fourth consecutive month in November as the euro area’s debt
crisis hurts demand for the Nordic country’s exports.  An index based on responses from about 200 purchasing
managers was a seasonally adjusted 43.2 in November, compared
with 43.1 the previous month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which
compiles the index, said today. A reading below 50 signals a
contraction. The  median estimate  of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a reading of 44.  Sweden’s central bank has signaled it may cut  interest
rates  again next month, after three reductions since last year,
as a recession in the euro area hurts exporters in the largest
Nordic economy. Companies such as Ericsson AB, the world’s
biggest maker of wireless networks, and truckmaker Volvo AB are
cutting jobs to cope with the reduced demand. About 70 percent
of Swedish exports go to  Europe .  The survey’s production sub-index rose to 43.3 from 40.3
and the order index rose to 40.3 from 40.1. The employment index
fell to 39 from 43 while the delivery time index rose to 44.7
from 40.4.  Swedish  growth  will slow to 1.2 percent this year from 3.9
percent in 2011, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said last week. The country’s annual expansion
slowed to 0.7 percent in the third quarter from 1.3 percent in
the prior period,  Statistics Sweden  also said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
