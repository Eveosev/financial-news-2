European coal for 2013 delivery rose
to the highest price in more than a week as crude oil gained.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp advanced 0.5 percent to $97.45 a metric ton, at 1:45
p.m. in  London , according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the highest level since Nov. 23.  Brent crude  for January settlement rose 38 cents to $111.61
a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London as China’s
official manufacturing index reached a seven-month high,
signaling economic recovery in the world’s second-biggest crude
consumer.  Bloomberg tracks information from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
