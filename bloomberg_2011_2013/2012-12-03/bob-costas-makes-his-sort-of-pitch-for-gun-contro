NBC sportscaster  Bob Costas  used the Sunday Night Football halftime show to  make a pitch  for gun control. It was a rare event in sports television, where talking heads aren't supposed to begin a discourse in which the destination is unknown. And this destination turned out to be quite unusual. Costas's commentary followed the  murder-suicide  by Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, who shot Kasandra Perkins, the mother of his infant child, on Saturday morning before driving to the Chiefs' practice facility and shooting himself in the head in front of the team's coach and general manager. After mocking the reliance on cliché and the inevitable calls for "perspective" such tragedies produce, Costas quoted from this  column by Jason Whitlock : Costas's unexpected remarks had the weight of a cultural moment. And so they are, albeit for two conflicting reasons. First, the fact that he made them at all. Costas surely knew the consequences would include the ire of gun enthusiasts and the gun industry. (The NRA's social media muezzin issued a  tweet  to the faithful at 7:58 this morning, accompanied by a link to an  article  in the Daily Caller.) And second, because by stating the obvious about handguns -- they kill people -- Costas apparently felt more comfortable quoting a third party. We know the NRA believes the Second Amendment is sacred and unbounded. Costas seems to have had somewhat less confidence in the amendment that precedes it.
