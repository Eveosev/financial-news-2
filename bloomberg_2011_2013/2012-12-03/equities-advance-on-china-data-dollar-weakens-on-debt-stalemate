U.S. stocks fell, halting a three-day
gain, and commodities  trimmed  an early advance as a contraction
in American manufacturing and concern about the budget debate
overshadowed optimism on  China’s economy . Treasuries and the
dollar fell.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.5 percent to close at 1,409.46 at 4 p.m.
in New York after climbing as much as 0.5 percent. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index pared gains after rising above its highest
closing level in 18 months. The S&P GSCI Index of raw materials
was up 0.1 percent after rallying 1.1 percent. The  Dollar Index 
slid to a one-month low while 10-year Treasury yields added one
basis point to 1.62 percent.  Equities extended losses as  House Republicans , rejecting
President  Barack Obama ’s demand for tax rate increases, proposed
$1.4 trillion in spending cuts and $800 billion in new revenue
by limiting tax breaks and capping deductions for top earners.
Benchmark indexes opened higher before erasing gains as the
Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index
unexpectedly fell below 50, the threshold signaling growth.  Today’s manufacturing data “is just a confirmation that
the fiscal-cliff concerns are actually affecting decision making
at the business level,” Andres Garcia-Amaya, New York-based
global market strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s mutual funds
unit, which oversees $400 billion in assets, said in a phone
interview. “For that reason, the market obviously doesn’t like
it, considering that we probably won’t get an answer either at
the last minute prior to the holidays or right before” New
Year’s, he said.  Market Movers  The S&P 500 also erased early gains after briefly climbing
above 1,421, its average over the  past 50 days , a level watched
by traders to gauge the market’s trend. The index has closed
below its 50-day average since Oct. 19, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  DuPont Co., General Electric Co. and Coca-Cola Co. lost at
least 1.4 percent for the biggest declines in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average. (INDU)  Newmont Mining Corp. declined 3 percent
after the largest U.S. gold producer appointed Gary Goldberg to
replace  Richard O’Brien  as chief executive officer.  An index of airlines fell 1.9 percent as Delta Air Lines
Inc. slipped 3.8 percent. The company is mulling a bid for
Singapore Airlines Ltd.’s stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.,
according to people familiar with the plans who declined to be
identified because the matter is private.  Dell Inc. (DELL)  added 4.4 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended buying the  shares .  Santa Claus  December has been the  best month  for the S&P 500 since 1950
with an average gain of 1.7 percent, according to the Stock
Trader’s Almanac. The stock market may also get a year-end boost
from a so-called Santa Claus rally -- an upswing in the last
five days of the year and the first two in January, the almanac
said.  While JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief U.S. equity strategist
 Thomas Lee  told Bloomberg Television today that American
equities are in a secular bull market, his counterpart at  Wells
Fargo & Co . predicted a drop next year. The S&P 500 will fall
1.8 percent to 1,390 by the end of 2013 as global growth slows
and policymakers struggle to reach a budget agreement, according
to Wells Fargo’s Gina Martin Adams.  Drop Forecast  Adams, who has the lowest projection for the U.S. equity
benchmark next year among Wall Street strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg, says investors should buy companies that are least-
tied to economic growth. The average estimate from eight other
forecasters implies a 9.2 percent rally to 1,546 from Nov. 30.  “The  U.S. economy  is likely to flirt with recession in the
near term, as slowing exports and falling investment likely lead
to a weaker consumer at the start of 2013,” Adams wrote in a
report today. “The market will suffer downward pressure until
policymakers act decisively to convince investors that the U.S.
debt house is ‘in order’.”  Stocks, bonds, commodities and the dollar all posted
monthly gains in November for the second time this year amid
optimism central bank stimulus programs are bolstering growth in
the world’s biggest economies.  Today’s report showing manufacturing unexpectedly
contracted in November for the fourth month signaled factory
managers grew more concerned about the potential economic toll
stemming from the so-called fiscal cliff. Data may show on Dec.
7 that U.S. payrolls rose by 90,000 last month, the smallest
gain since June, as superstorm Sandy forced businesses to close.  ‘We’re Nowhere’  Republicans are renewing attempts to use a debt-limit
increase to force deeper spending cuts, replicating the 2011
showdown that led to a credit-rating downgrade. Many
congressional Republicans see the need to raise the $16.4
trillion limit on public debt in early 2013 as leverage to force
President Barack Obama to cut spending. House Republicans view
the U.S. budget deficit, which topped $1 trillion in each of the
past four years, as a crisis requiring immediate action.  There’s “clearly a chance” that there won’t be an
agreement in time to avert the fiscal cliff, House Speaker
 John Boehner  told “Fox News Sunday.” “I would say we’re 
nowhere, period,” he said.  American companies are supplanting China from the world’s
500 biggest stocks faster than at any time in the past decade,
as an improving U.S. economy and investor confidence in free
markets overcomes the lure of equities offering twice the profit
growth.  Biggest Companies  U.S. corporations led by Apple Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp.
make up 171 of the top 500 with a market capitalization of $10.6
trillion, or 40.3 percent of the total, compared with 159 valued
at $8.24 trillion in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
PetroChina Co. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
lead the 24 Chinese firms worth $1.74 trillion qualifying today,
down from 34 with a capitalization of $2.19 trillion.  Among European stocks, Cable & Wireless Communications Plc
rose 1.2 percent after agreeing to sell its Monaco and Islands
unit to Bahrain Telecommunications Co. for $680 million. Colruyt
SA slid 1.9 percent after first-half earnings before interest
and taxes missed analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.1 percent at the
close in London as three stocks rose for every two that fell.
The equity benchmark has rallied 18 percent from this year’s low
on June 4 as the  European Central Bank  announced an unlimited
bond-buying plan and the  Federal Reserve  started a third round
of asset purchases.  Ten-year Greek bond yields fell below 15 percent for the
first time since July 2011 as the nation offered to buy back
bonds.  Currencies  The euro strengthened 0.5 percent to $1.3054 and climbed as
high as $1.3076, the strongest level since October. The dollar
weakened against 11 of 16 major peers, dropping 0.3 percent to
82.27 yen. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  declined to as low as 79.799, the
weakest since Oct. 31.  The Australian dollar dropped versus 15 of 16 major
counterparts, sliding 0.6 percent to 0.7982 euro. The  Reserve
Bank  of Australia will return  interest rates  to a half-century
low of 3 percent tomorrow, economists predict, as data today
showed manufacturing contracted and retail sales stagnated. New
Zealand’s dollar weakened versus most peers after data showed
the nation’s terms of trade worsened.  China Data  China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.6 in
November, while a private gauge of manufacturing climbed to
50.5, separate reports showed. Nine of 16 analysts surveyed over
the past two weeks by Bloomberg forecast China will set an
economic growth goal of 7.5 percent, unchanged from 2012, in a
sign that new leadership headed by  Xi Jinping  won’t tolerate a
bigger slowdown from the lowest target since 2004.  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities trimmed gains after
reaching 657.11, the strongest level since Oct. 22. Sugar,
natural gas, aluminum and silver rose at least 0.9 percent to
lead gains in 15 of 24 commodities tracked by the index, while
hogs, nickel and Kansas wheat fell the most.  Gold futures rose 0.5 percent to $1,721.10 an ounce,
rebounding from the biggest weekly drop in five months, as the
dollar weakened and investors boosted holdings of exchange-
traded products backed by bullion to a record 2,621.73 metric
tons Nov. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Silver
increased 1.4 percent to $33.759 an ounce.  The MSCI Emerging Market index was little changed following
a two-day gain. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng (HSI)  index slumped 1.5 percent,
the steepest drop since Nov. 15. The BSE India Sensex 30 Index
slipped 0.2 percent, retreating from the highest level since
April 2011.  Turkey’s  ISE National 100 (XU100)  Index rose 1.7 percent to the
highest close in records dating to January 1988 as the nation’s
inflation rate fell to the lowest in 14 months, giving the
central bank more room to reduce borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
