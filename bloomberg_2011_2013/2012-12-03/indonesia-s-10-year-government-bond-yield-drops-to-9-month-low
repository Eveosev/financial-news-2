Indonesia ’s bonds rallied, pushing
the yield on 10-year notes to a nine-month low, after inflation
in November slowed more than forecast. The rupiah was steady.  Consumer prices  rose 4.32 percent from a year earlier,
official data showed today, less than the 4.57 percent gain
predicted by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Inflation
was 4.61 percent in October.  Bank Indonesia  will review its
benchmark  interest rate  on Dec. 11, after it held borrowing
costs at a historic-low 5.75 percent for a ninth month in
November. The  trade balance  swung to a record deficit of $1.5
billion in October, compared with a $466 million surplus
forecast by analysts.  “The gains in bonds will continue as stable inflation will
see the central bank holding its  reference rate  steady,” said
Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906
in Jakarta. “The rupiah will be under pressure due to the trade
deficit.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due in May
2022 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
5.34 percent as of 3:45 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since
Feb. 22, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  Foreign funds added 18.1 trillion rupiah ($1.9 billion) to
their local-currency government bond holdings last month through
Nov. 29, the biggest monthly inflow since data going back to
January 2003, according to the  finance ministry .  The rupiah closed at 9,598 per dollar compared with 9,594
on Nov. 30, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, climbed five basis points
to 4.65 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
