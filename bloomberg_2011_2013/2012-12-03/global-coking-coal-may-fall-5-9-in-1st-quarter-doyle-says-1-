The global coking-coal benchmark may
fall 5.9 percent in the first quarter on lackluster demand in
 Europe  for the  steelmaking component .  Metallurgical coal may drop to $160 a metric ton from $170,
Steve Doyle, founder of  Doyle Trading Consultants LLC , said
today at a conference put on by his company in New York.  For the fourth quarter of this year, the BHP/Mitsubishi
Alliance, or BMA, agreed to the lowest benchmark price since
contracts shifted to quarterly settlements from annual pacts in
the first quarter of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prices may rebound to $180 by the fourth quarter of 2013 as
30 million metric tons of production cuts from Appalachia to
 Australia  take effect, Doyle said.  New supply from mines in Mozambique and  Mongolia  has been
slow to reach the global market and the quality of the coal
isnâ€™t as favorable as that found in other regions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
