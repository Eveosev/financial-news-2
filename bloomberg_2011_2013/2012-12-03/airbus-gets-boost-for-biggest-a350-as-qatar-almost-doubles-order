Airbus SAS got a boost for the
largest variant of its A350 wide-body aircraft after Qatar
Airways Ltd., the first airline to take the jet, almost doubled
the number of A350-1000s to 37 and dropped a smaller type.  Qatar, already among the biggest customers for Airbus wide-
body jets, also increased its order of the A350-900s, the mid-
sized and first variant to enter service from late 2014, by
three units to 43 and entirely dropped a previous order for 20
smaller A350-800s, Airbus said in a statement today.  The decision confirms the market trend toward airlines
wanting larger models, Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier
said in the statement.  The Qatar Airways decision leaves Airbus with a shrinking
backlog for the smallest A350 variant, raising doubts if it will
stick with the model. The Toulouse-based planemaker has already
seen several customers swap A350-800 orders for larger models,
most recently Afriqiyah Airways.  The A350-800 will seat 270, while the A350-900 can
accommodate 314 passengers and the -1000 model can handle 350.
The A350-900 is the most popular, and is set to enter service
three years before the largest model. Airbus has said it remains
committed to building the A350-800, even while recognizing
margins are higher for the larger versions.  Airbus could probably save at least 1 billion euros ($1.27
billion) by dropping the smallest model and concentrating its
engineering resources on developing the bigger and more
expensive A350-1000,  Nick Cunningham , managing partner at Agency
Partners in  London , has said.  Rolls-Royce Plc (RR/)  has exclusive rights to offer engines for
the A350-1000 and is the only engine maker offering powerplants
for all three of the models.  Qatar dropping the A350-800 leaves Airbus with 98 of the
smallest type on order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
