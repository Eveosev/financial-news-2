Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped after posting
their biggest weekly advance in almost six months last week.
Shares of some automakers rose after monthly sales increased.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 0.2 percent
to 19,305.32 at the close. The gauge advanced 4.5 percent last
week.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the second-largest private lender, lost
2.4 percent after rallying 11 percent last month to a record.
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, climbed for the
first time in three days as sales rose 12.5 percent in November.  The Sensex climbed to a 19-month high on Nov. 30 as data
showing economic expansion slowed last quarter to match a three-
year low stoked speculation the government will introduce more
policy measures to boost growth and investment. A finance
ministry official said the same day that  India  had raised the
limit for foreign investors to buy sovereign debt and company
bonds in a bid to attract inflows and bolster the rupee.  “There is bound to be some consolidation as the markets
have rallied too fast,” Sunil Pachisia, vice-president at
Mumbai-based brokerage Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd., said by phone
today. “Still, the near-to-medium term outlook is positive as
global liquidity, government policy and interest-rate cuts will
lend support to equities.”  The broader  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  added 0.2 percent to 2,393.05,
its highest close since April 27, 2011. The  BSE Mid-Cap Index (BSEMDCAP) 
rallied 1.2 percent to 6,985.48, the highest level since July
27, 2011, with as many as 23 stocks on the gauge climbing to a
52-week high, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Attractive Valuations’  The midcap index trades at 13.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with a  multiple  of 15.8 times for the Sensex, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  is
valued at 11.6 times, the data show.  “In the next two months, the Sensex might move up about 3
to 4 percent, but we may see significantly higher gains in the
mid-cap index,” Nirmal Jain, chairman of the Carlyle Group LP-
backed India Infoline Ltd., told Bloomberg TV India today.
“Valuations are more attractive and opportunities are bigger”
in midcap stocks, he said. Carlyle Group held 10.38 percent of
the Mumbai-based brokerage at the end of September.  HDFC Bank slid 2.4 percent to 686.95 rupees, its steepest
drop since June 1. Oil and Natural Gas Corp., India’s largest
explorer, lost 1.1 percent to 262.15 rupees, amid concern it may
face record high borrowing costs. Maruti rose 1.1 percent to
1,489.9 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest maker of
sport-utility vehicles and tractors, jumped 1.1 percent to a
record 957.65 rupees after November sales rose 18 percent.  Fund Inflows  The Sensex has climbed 25 percent this year, driven by
foreign flows and policy measures announced since September.
Overseas funds  bought  $360 million more stocks than they sold on
Nov. 29, the most in eight weeks, taking their purchases in 2012
to a net $19.8 billion. That’s the highest among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding  China , the data show.  The 30-stock gauge’s 14-day relative strength index, a
measure of how rapidly prices rose or fell during the period,
was at 72 on Nov. 30. Some investors regard readings at 70 or
more as a signal to sell.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Sensex was at 11.2, compared
with the year’s lowest reading of 9.06 set on Nov. 26, the data
show. The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. dropped 0.2 percent to 5,870.95 while its December
futures traded at 5,916. India VIX, which measures the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, advanced 3.1 percent.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh began a campaign in September
to revive economic growth from the weakest levels since 2009 and
avoid a credit-rating downgrade by paring fuel subsidies and
opening up retailing and aviation to foreign investment.  Gross
domestic product  expanded 5.3 percent in the three months to
Sept. 30 from a year earlier, in line with the median of 42
estimates in a Bloomberg survey and down from 5.5 percent in the
previous quarter, the government said Nov. 30.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded India to overweight from
market-weight, according to a Nov. 29 report. The Nifty may
climb to 6,600 by December 2013, the bank said in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
