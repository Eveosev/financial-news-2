Spain ’s  Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA  will start up a 416 million-soles ($161 million)
sewage treatment plant in Peru’s capital on Dec. 18, the state
news agency  Andina  reported.  The  Taboada  plant in Lima will initially treat 7 cubic
meters per second of sewage and double its treatment capacity by
July 2013, Andina said, citing Rossina Manche, general manager
of the state water company Sedapal.  ACS, which won the bidding for the 25-year contract in
2009, will treat waste from 5 million Lima inhabitants in 27
districts, ending raw sewage discharge from eight pipelines into
the Pacific Ocean, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
