Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos’ approval rating fell to a record low of 45 percent in
November from 60 percent in September, after an international
court in The Hague last month awarded Nicaragua sovereignty over
some waters surrounding Colombian islands in the Caribbean.  Eighty-three percent of Colombians believe the country
should reject the International Court of Justice’s ruling,
according to the  poll  by Ipsos Napoleon Franco published Dec. 1
in Semana magazine. Thirty-two percent of Colombians would
support Santos’ re-election in 2014, while 61 percent are
opposed to it, the poll found.  The fall in popularity wipes out the gains Santos received
after his August announcement that his government would start
peace talks with the FARC, Colombia’s main Marxist guerrilla
group.  Ipsos Napoleon Franco interviewed 1,006 people from Nov. 23
to 25. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
