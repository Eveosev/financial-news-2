Swaps prices climbed a sixth day for
thermal coal for loading next year from  Indonesia , the world’s
largest exporter of the fuel for electricity generation,
according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 rose 5 cents to $62.75 a metric ton on a net-as-
received basis on Nov. 30, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
December contract stood at $61.45 a ton.  In  Australia , Centennial Coal said it is deferring spending
on a number of mines and putting its Mannering project near Lake
Macquarie and its Airly mines at Western Coalfields on “care
and maintenance” status starting next month. The sites will be
reopened when market conditions improve, the company, owned by
Banpu Pcl in Bangkok, said in a Nov. 28 statement.  Contracts for coal with heating value of 5,500 kilocalories
a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first quarter were
unchanged at $84.30 a ton on a net-as-received basis, the energy
broker said. The swap for December remained at $83.85.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better-quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
