Kenya ’s shilling weakened, snapping
two days of gains, as businesses sought to buy more dollars
ahead of the festive season.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy declined as
much as 0.4 percent to 85.98 a dollar and was trading 0.3
percent weaker at 85.93 a dollar as of 12:27 p.m. in Nairobi,
the capital.  “The shilling is under pressure as businesses seek to
accumulate dollars for their purchases in preparation for the
festive season,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-
based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said by telephone. “We expect
to see robust business in the next two weeks then a slowdown
thereafter as the year comes to an end.”  Businesses usually import more products as they prepare for
increased sales during the Christmas and year-end period.
Christians account for 87 percent of Kenya’s 38 million
population, according to the CIA World Factbook.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya offered 10 billion shillings
($116 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  and term-
auction deposits, a bank official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy, said by phone.  The Ugandan shilling gained 0.1 percent to 2,680 a dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling depreciated less than 0.1 percent
to 1,601 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
