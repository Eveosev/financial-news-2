South Korea ’s Jongwoo Park received a
two-game ban from soccer’s governing body over a political
message he displayed during his team’s win in a bronze medal
match against  Japan  at the London Olympics.  FIFA also ordered Park to pay a 3,500 Swiss franc ($3,783)
fine after its disciplinary panel ruled he violated rules on
sporting behavior. Park carried a banner that supported the
sovereignty of a group of islands that is disputed between Korea
and Japan.  “The committee took into account that the behavior of the
player, even though it appears not to have been premeditated or
intentional, contradicts the principal idea and goal of
sportsmanship and fair play, and therefore, cannot be
tolerated,” FIFA said in a statement.  The Zurich-based body also warned the Korean Football
Association sanctions will be harsher should the incident be
repeated.   To contact the reporter on this story:
