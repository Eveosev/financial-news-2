Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s record November
U.S. sales paced the best month for industrywide deliveries in
almost five years as buyers returned to showrooms that were
disrupted by Hurricane Sandy a month earlier.  Honda led major automakers with a 39 percent gain in
deliveries from a year ago, topping analysts’ average projection
of 33 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  also topped estimates and  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  posted a 17 percent sales gain.  The annualized industrywide light-vehicle sales  rate ,
adjusted for seasonal trends, accelerated to 15.5 million,
beating the 15 million average estimate of analysts, to give the
best monthly pace since 15.6 million in January 2008, according
to Autodata Corp. Replacement  demand  from owners of damaged
vehicles and purchases deferred by Sandy boosted U.S. light-
vehicle sales for the eight largest automakers.  “The overall health of the industry is good, clearly,”
said  Jesse Toprak , industry analyst for TrueCar.com, a vehicle
pricing and data website in  Santa Monica ,  California . “There
were clearly positive impacts from Sandy with a lot of consumers
who didn’t even plan to buy but had to buy because their cars
were damaged. That’s going to continue to help in December.”  Autos contributed 14 percent of the 2.2 percent average
rate of growth for gross domestic product in the recovery that
began in the third quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2012,
according to data from the Commerce Department.  Accord, Civic  Honda, the Tokyo-based maker of Accord sedans and Civic
compacts, said yesterday deliveries of those two models surged
83 percent and 76 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
The CR-V compact crossover, the top-selling sport-utility model
in the U.S. this year, rose 36 percent last month.  “At the start of the year Honda was just barely starting
to emerge from their tsunami woes last year, and no one knew
what to expect from CR-V,” said Alec Gutierrez, industry
analyst for Kelley  Blue Book , a vehicle pricing and data company
in Irvine, California. “They’re certainly finishing the year in
a much better place.”  Honda’s sales in the U.S. increased 24 percent through
November, and its market share was 10.2 percent last month, up
from 8.4 percent a year ago, according to Autodata.  The 17 percent increase in deliveries for Toyota fell short
of the 20 percent average of eight analysts’ estimates for the
Toyota City, Japan-based company. Deliveries of Corolla compacts
surged 40 percent to 22,616 and Camry sedans increased 23
percent to 28,765.  Fuel Economy  Sales for Toyota, Asia’s top selling U.S. automaker, are up
29 percent through November, and its market share last month
improved 0.2 percentage point to 14.1 percent, according to
Autodata.  South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
combined to sell 9.1 percent more vehicles in November compared
with a year earlier, matching the average of six analysts’
estimates. U.S. regulators said last month that the affiliates
overstated the fuel-economy ratings for most of their 2012 and
2013 models.  Sales for Nissan, based in Yokohama, climbed 13 percent,
according to an e-mailed statement. That topped the average
analyst estimate of 4.8 percent.  U.S. deliveries for Japanese and South Korean automakers
rose 21 percent last month to 524,330, based on company
releases.  Tax Increases  Ford deliveries of cars and light trucks rose 6.4 percent,
the company said yesterday in a statement. That surpassed the
average estimate of analysts of 2.4 percent.  The company said it plans to increase North American
production in the first quarter by 11 percent to 750,000
vehicles. The automaker reiterated that it’s making plans to
prepare for the combination of U.S. tax increases and spending
cuts known as the fiscal cliff should they occur at the end of
the year and disrupt the economy.  “That is the biggest uncertainty out there over the next
couple months,” Jenny Lin, the senior U.S. economist for
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, said yesterday on a conference
call with analysts and reporters. “We are watching it very
carefully as to how the final package is and the final agreement
is from the Congress and the administration.”  General Motors Co. (GM)  sales rose 3.4 percent, the company said
in a  statement  yesterday on its website. The Detroit-based
automaker trailed the 7.6 percent gain that was the average
estimate of 11 analysts.  Consecutive Gains  Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker majority owned by  Fiat
SpA (F) , said deliveries increased 14 percent, trailing the 16
percent average gain of 11 analysts. The Auburn Hills, Michigan-
based company extended its streak of consecutive monthly sales
gains from a year earlier to 32.  “There is nothing wrong with these numbers,” Alan Baum,
principal of auto-industry researcher Baum & Associates in West
Bloomfield,  Michigan , said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“We are obviously coming from much lower numbers, and more and
more people are coming back into the market.”  Deliveries of Chrysler’s Ram pickups rose 23 percent to
24,337, according to the statement from the automaker controlled
by Turin, Italy-based Fiat. Ford said sales of its F-Series
trucks climbed 18 percent to 56,299.  GM’s deliveries of Chevrolet Silverado pickups declined 10
percent to 30,674, while GMC Sierra truck sales slipped 2
percent to 11,726. The automaker said inventory of its full-size
pickups ballooned to 139 days’ supply as of Nov. 30, from 110
days a month earlier.  ‘Ramped Up’  “Competitors ramped up spending to sell down their 2012
model-year stock,” Kurt McNeil, GM vice president of sales
operations, said of the truck market on a conference call
yesterday with analysts and reporters. GM’s full-size pickup
inventory, which was 245,853 at the end of November, may end the
year at more than its goal of as much as 220,000, he said.  Ford slipped 0.3 percent to $11.41 at the close in  New York 
yesterday. GM slid 1.4 percent to $25.51. Toyota’s shares fell
less than 1 percent to 3,510 yen at 10:12 a.m. in  Tokyo . Honda
rose 1 percent to 2,726 yen while Nissan fell 1.5 percent to 795
yen.  U.S. light-vehicle deliveries rose 15 percent in November
to 1.14 million, exceeding the 1.11 million average estimate of
10 analysts. For October, all automakers reported deliveries
that trailed average estimates from Bloomberg’s survey after
 Hurricane Sandy  inflicted almost $70 billion in damage to New
York and New Jersey alone.  Honda began the month with almost double the inventory it
had in November 2011, according to researcher WardsAuto. Dealers
for the company faced shortages a year ago after the tsunami in
 Japan  and floods in  Thailand  disrupted production and supply of
parts.  Steady Recovery  This year, Sandy damaged more than 230,000 vehicles,
including 190,000 in New York and New Jersey, according to
estimates from the National Insurance Crime Bureau. The storm,
which made landfall on Oct. 29, disrupted East Coast dealerships
during the busiest time of the month. The October industry sales
rate was 14.3 million, Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based Autodata
said.  The U.S. market has been in steady recovery this year and
is headed for a third consecutive annual increase of more than
10 percent. Industry sales may increase by about 4 percent to 15
million in 2013, according to a Bloomberg Industries analysis.
That gain, predicted by researchers Edmunds.com and LMC
Automotive, would be the slowest growth for the industry since
2009’s 21 percent plunge.  The U.S. averaged 16.8 million light-vehicle deliveries
annually from 2000 to 2007, then dropped to 10.4 million in
2009, a 27-year-low, according to Autodata.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  surpassed its full-year target for U.S. sales
of 500,000 vehicles, with combined deliveries by its Volkswagen
and Audi brands of 518,597 through November. The automaker
boosted sales in November by 28 percent, exceeding the 25
percent average of three estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
