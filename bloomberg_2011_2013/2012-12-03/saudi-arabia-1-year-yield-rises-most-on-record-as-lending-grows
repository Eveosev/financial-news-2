Saudi Arabia ’s one-year local-
currency borrowing costs rose the most on record at an auction
today as accelerating loan growth in the largest Arab economy
puts pressure on  interest rates .  The average yield on one-year securities advanced five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, the most since Bloomberg
started tracking the data in March 2010, to a record 0.684
percent. Six-month notes yielded 0.555 percent, up four basis
points, the data show. The kingdom only discloses the amounts
raised at T-bill auctions on a monthly basis.  Saudi Arabia’s interest rates have climbed this year as
government investment programs valued at more than $500 billion
spurred lending. Bank loans to private businesses expanded 15
percent in October, the fastest pace in almost four years,
according to central bank data. The  three-month Saudi interbank
offered rate , a benchmark used by banks to price loans, has
gained 20 basis points this year to 0.98375 percent today, the
highest since April 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The kingdom, which sells treasury bills at weekly auctions
on Mondays, also issued three-month securities at an average
yield of 0.47867 percent, up three basis points, the data show.
The yield on 28-day T-bills added less than one basis point to
0.26273 percent, while that on seven-day notes was unchanged at
0.11212 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
