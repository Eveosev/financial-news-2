Shale-Inland Holdings LLC, a
distributor of steel pipes, valves and fittings, has appointed
Richard Lundgren chief executive officer as founder Craig Bouchard becomes chairman of the board.  Lundgren, who was previously president of Tyco Thermal
Controls, a subsidiary of  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  brings
experience from jobs in the energy and chemical fields,
Bellaire, Texas-based Shale-Inland said in a statement today.  Bouchard has been CEO since the company was formed. Before
he created closely held Shale-Inland, Bouchard founded Esmark
Inc. with his brother James Bouchard. They built the company by
acquisitions, including the hostile takeover of Wheeling-
Pittsburgh Steel Corp., forming the fifth-biggest U.S.
steelmaker.  OAO Severstal, Russiaâ€™s largest steel producer, bought
Esmark for $775 million in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
