Free agent  Mike Napoli  agreed on a
three-year, $39 million contract with the Boston  Red Sox ,  ESPN
reported  today.  Napoli, who played at first base and catcher last year for
the  Texas Rangers , will play primarily at first base for Boston,
the network said citing an unidentified person with direct
knowledge of the negotiations.  Red Sox spokeswoman Pam Kenn didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment on the report. Baseball’s Winter
Meetings are under way in Nashville, Tennessee.  Napoli hit .227 last season with 56 runs batted in and 24
home runs, his fifth consecutive season with at least 20 homers.
Those numbers were down from 2011, when he hit .320 with 30 home
runs and 75 RBI, all career highs.  The Red Sox were 69-93 in 2012, their worst record in 47
years, and finished last in the five-team American League East
for the first time since the divisions were reformatted prior to
the 1994 season. The team fired manager  Bobby Valentine  in
October after one season, and replaced him with John Farrell.  Napoli never has played first base for more than 70 games
in a season, which he did in 2010, and never caught more than
the 96 games he caught in 2009. Last year he caught 72 games and
played in 28 games at first base.  Boston’s Fenway Park, with its 37-foot-tall “Green
Monster” left-field wall, has proved beneficial for right-
handed hitters like Napoli. He has hit .306 with seven home runs
and 17 RBI in 19 games at Fenway, and his on-base percentage
plus slugging percentage, a statistic known as OPS, is 1.107 at
the ballpark, compared with .863 for his total career and .812
last season, according to Baseball-reference.com.  Elsewhere, the Tampa Bay Rays agreed with free-agent first
baseman James Loney on a one-year, $2 million deal, according to
ESPN. Loney hit .249 last year with the  Los Angeles Dodgers  and
Red Sox.  The  San Diego Padres  agreed on a one-year, $3 million
contract with starting pitcher Jason Marquis, and the Rangers
agreed on a one-year deal with catcher Geovany Soto, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
