BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  is limiting
expenditure on growing its thermal coal assets as the world’s
biggest mining company grapples with the environmental impact of
burning the fuel to produce energy.  “Developing countries want low-cost energy but you can’t
deal with the carbon consequences over the long term,” Marcus Randolph, chief executive officer at the Melbourne-based
company’s iron ore and coal unit, said today on a call with
reporters. “Our response has been that the amount of dollars
that we direct to our energy-coal growth has been quite low and
we’ve actually not had substantial growth,” in the business.  Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere touched an all-time
high in 2011, according to the World Meteorological
Organization. That will make the weather more volatile, the
United Nations said last month.  Hurricane Sandy  caused at least
$25 billion of damage when it struck New Jersey and New York in
October.  “The issue with greenhouse gas has sort of fallen off the
agenda as economic conditions have gotten tighter globally,”
Randolph said. “The amount of progress that the world has shown
in the last couple of years in dealing with climate change is,
frankly, inadequate.”  BHP  earned  8.4 percent of its revenue from thermal coal in
the year ended June 30, 2012. It produced 71 million metric tons
from mines in  Australia , Colombia and South Africa during the
period, compared with 70 million tons a year earlier, according
to company reports. BHP is also the world’s biggest exporter of
steelmaking coal.  ‘Off the Agenda’  The price of thermal coal fell to a three-year year low
last month, prompting companies including  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  to cut
production and staff.  Economic turmoil in  Europe  is restricting global efforts to
cut fossil-fuel emissions and curb pollution as climate change
policy is “sliding off the agenda,” International Energy
Agency Chief Economist Fatih Birol said in an interview before
the UN’s annual meeting on the subject. The talks are currently
on in Doha, the capital of  Qatar .  “We have good assets in the business but we’re very aware
of the environmental implications,” said Randolph. “It’s a
routine discussion for management generally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
