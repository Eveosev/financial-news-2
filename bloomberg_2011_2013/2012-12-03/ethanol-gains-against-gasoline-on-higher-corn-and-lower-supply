Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
as supplies fell and rising corn prices signaled higher
production costs.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline was 29.85
cents a gallon, compared with 35.34 cents Nov. 30, based on
futures settlement prices. The spread has averaged 62.67 cents
this year, enticing refiners to blend more ethanol in order to
pocket the difference between the two fuels.  “There’s still plenty of blending value,” said Ian
Jackson, a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago . “We’re
seeing less and less imports and a draw in stockpiles.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.428 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The contract expires Dec. 5. Futures have gained 10 percent this
year.  Imports averaged 27,000 barrels a day in the week ended
Nov. 23, Energy Department data show. That was down 78 percent
from the Oct. 12 level, which was the highest since the agency
began tracking weekly data for the biofuel in June 2010.  Stockpiles have fallen in three of the past four weeks, to
18.3 million barrels as of Nov. 23, the lowest since Nov. 9.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast gained
2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.60 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive rose 1 cent to $2.495, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Spot Trading  Ethanol in New York climbed 0.5 cent to $2.525 a gallon and
in Chicago the additive increased 0.5 cent to $2.43.  Gasoline for January delivery decreased 0.38 cents to
$2.7265. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery advanced 2 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $7.5475 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
31 cents on Nov. 30, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, rose 11 percent to 4.85 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
