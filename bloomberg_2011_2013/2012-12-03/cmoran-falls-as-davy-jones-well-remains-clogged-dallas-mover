  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  climbed
after it said it will continue to try to unclog the Davy Jones
No. 1 well in the  Gulf of Mexico  and seek a measurable flow test
of natural gas.  McMoRan, based in  New Orleans ,  rose  2.2 percent to $8.72 at
the close in  New York , after earlier falling 9 percent on news
that the company’s latest attempt to clear the well had failed.
The shares are down 30 percent from the close on Nov. 23, the
last trading day before the company announced more setbacks in
testing the Davy Jones well.  The company had “limited success” using a solvent to
dissolve barite, a component of drilling mud that’s been
blocking the well for months. McMoRan is starting to use a
propellant stimulation gun to create new fractures, according to
a statement today. The company said it may inject more solvent
to dissolve the barite.  Complications have repeatedly delayed the test since late
2011 as McMoRan seeks to produce gas from an ultra-deep well in
the shallow waters of the Gulf. McMoRan said Nov. 26 that a test
earlier that month was inconclusive and that it would use a
solvent to try to clean out the barite.  McMoRan operates and has a 63.4 percent working interest in
Davy Jones, according to today’s statement. Other partners
include Energy XXI Bermuda Ltd., JX Nippon Oil Exploration
(Gulf) Ltd. and Moncrief Offshore LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
