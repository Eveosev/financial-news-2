Nigeria ’s Eurobond yields fell for a
fourth day to a record as oil, the country’s key export, gained
and foreign-exchange reserves rose.  Borrowing costs on $500 million dollar debt due January
2021 slid one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.232
percent at 1 p.m. in London, the lowest since issuance in
January 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
international bonds of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer have
dropped 206 basis points from a high of 6.29 percent in December
2011.  Crude traded close to its highest level in almost two weeks
in  New York  as China’s official manufacturing index rose to a
seven-month high. Bonny Light Crude, Nigeria’s main export
grade, added 0.41 percent to $112.92 in New York. The nation’s
 foreign-exchange reserves  have increased 34.9 percent this year
to $44.4 billion as at Nov. 28, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of
Nigeria  published on its website today.  The Nigerian bonds are being “supported by favorable
market sentiments, the elevated oil price and the continued
accumulation of foreign reserves,”  Samir Gadio , a London-based
emerging-markets strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said
today in an e-mailed reply to questions.  The naira weakened less than 0.1 percent at 157.215 a
dollar on the  interbank market  in Lagos. The currency has
strengthened 3.2 percent this year, the second-best performer in
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022 fell
11 basis points to 12.19 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices on the website of the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association.  Ghana’s cedi gained for the second day, adding 0.3 percent
to 1.8986 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
