Cantor Fitzgerald  LP had its credit
grade cut to one level above junk by  Standard & Poor’s  as
competition and the brokerage’s expansion plans pressure income,
according to the ratings company.  Market conditions will constrain profitability at  New York- 
based Cantor for a “prolonged period,” S&P said yesterday in a
statement. S&P cut Cantor to BBB- and left the rating for BGC
Partners Inc., the company’s interdealer broker affiliate,
unchanged at the lowest investment grade.  “We believe management’s opportunistic growth strategy
increases operational and business risks and potentially
increases the company’s financial risks,” S&P said.  Sheryl Lee, a Cantor spokeswoman, didn’t respond to phone
and e-mail requests for comment. Cantor Fitzgerald is a private
partnership and doesn’t regularly release financial results.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered its rating on the
brokerage to junk in October, then ceased coverage of the firm.
Cantor said it asked Moody’s to stop following the company three
months earlier.  Cantor’s profit for the six months ended June 30 climbed
almost 50 percent from a year earlier, the company said in a
statement disputing the Moody’s downgrade. It didn’t disclose
the amount of the profit.  The head of Cantor’s brokerage unit, Shawn Matthews, said
in an interview that it plans to hire 200 staff next year and
that it had bought Ireland’s Dolmen Stockbrokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
