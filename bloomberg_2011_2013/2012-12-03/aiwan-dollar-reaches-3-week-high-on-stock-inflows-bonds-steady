Taiwan ’s dollar touched the strongest
level in three weeks as global funds added to holdings of the
island’s stocks on optimism the economic recovery is gaining
momentum.  Government bonds  were steady.  Foreign investors bought $1.4 billion more shares than they
sold last month, and $285 million today, bringing net purchases
in 2012 to $3.5 billion, according to exchange figures. Official
data due this week will show exports rebounded in November and
inflation slowed, Bloomberg surveys of economists show.  “Taiwan’s fundamentals are slowly getting better,” said
Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets
Management Corp., which oversees $700 million. “There’s some
foreign buying of local stocks.”  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.121 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the close and earlier reached NT$29.019,
the strongest level since Nov. 13, based on Taipei Forex Inc.
prices. It has appreciated 4 percent this year, the fifth-best
performance among  Asia ’s 11-most traded currencies.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was little changed at
3.3 percent.  Figures due on Dec. 7 will show overseas shipments rose 7.8
percent from a year earlier, following a 1.9 percent drop the
previous month, based on the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Consumer prices probably increased 2.05
percent, compared with 2.36 percent in October, according to a
separate survey before a government report on Dec. 5.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was little changed at 1.134 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.38
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
