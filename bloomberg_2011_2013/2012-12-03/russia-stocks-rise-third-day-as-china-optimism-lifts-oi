Russian equities climbed for a third
day to the highest in almost a month as oil, the nation’s chief
export earner, rose and Chinese economic data stoked investor
appetite for riskier assets.  The Micex Index added 1.1 percent to 1,421.97 by the close
in Moscow, the strongest level since Nov. 7. Financial, telecom
and oil gas company stocks rose at least 1.1 percent on average.
OAO Tatneft, a regional oil producer, increased 1.8 percent,
while OAO Novatek, the largest independent natural-gas producer,
rose 1.9 percent. OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s biggest phone
operator,  climbed 2.1 percent. Russia’s dollar-denominated  RTS
Index (RTSI$)  increased 1.1 percent to 1,451.69.  Oil rallied as much as 1.6 percent to $90.33 a barrel in
 New York , the highest level in six weeks. Russia receives about
half of its budget revenue from the oil and natural gas
industry. A manufacturing gauge in  China  rose to a seven-month
high in November, data released Dec. 1 showed.  “Chinese manufacturing data was a positive surprise,”
Aleksei Belkin, who manages about $400 million in equities as
chief investment officer at Kapital Asset Management LLC, said
by phone.“We’re expecting to see rising investor demand for
riskier assets and especially Russia as the end of the year
approaches.”  The Micex declined as much as 0.2 percent earlier as
Russia’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index eased to 52.3 after rising
to 52.9, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  Rusal, Potanin  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
fell as much as 3.6 percent, the biggest decliner on the index,
before the London Arbitrage Court starts hearing the company’s
claim against  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding about the
alleged breach of a 2008 agreement on board representation at
OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel today. Norilsk dropped 0.3 percent to
4,809 rubles.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of Commodities gained 0.9
percent to 655.70. Most metals on the London Metal Exchange
rose, including tin and nickel. The Russian  Depositary Index (RDXUSD) 
increased 1.1 percent to 1,634.27.  OAO Gazprom, Russia’s largest company and natural gas
export monopoly, climbed 1.6 percent to 140.99 rubles.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 1.2 percent to $27.84 on Nov.
30 to leave it little changed in the month. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in futures, slipped 0.6
percent to 22.22 points.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times  estimated earnings  after
adding 1.4 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
10.3 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which has added
9.9 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
