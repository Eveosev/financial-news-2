Vietnam ’s bonds rose, pushing the
five-year yield to a three-month low, on speculation a slowdown
in lending growth resulted in banks investing surplus funds in
government debt. The dong was steady.  Outstanding loans increased 4.2 percent this year through
Nov. 20, compared with 14.4 percent in 2011, official data show.
Liquidity at banks is improving, central bank Deputy Governor
Dang Thanh Binh, told a conference in Hanoi today, adding that
Vietnam will manage credit growth in line with consumer-price
gains. Inflation will be about 7 percent this year, Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said Nov. 28.  “Demand from banks is still strong and they believe they
can get some short-term profit,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities. “They
expect yields to continue to go down.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.80 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest decline in more than a week and the lowest yield since
Aug. 29.  The dong was unchanged at 20,850 per dollar as of 2:28 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  State
Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
