The  American Academy  in Berlin said
it raised 1 million euros ($1.3 million) at an art benefit
auction to fund visits by distinguished artists from the U.S. to
the German capital.  The top lot at the Nov. 30 sale at Berlin’s  Villa Grisebach 
was  Julie Mehretu ’s painting “Four Fold,” which reaped 268,400
euros, the  American Academy  said in an e-mailed statement.  Other highlights included a Guenther Uecker nail sculpture,
which fetched 195,200 euros, and a Max Beckmann charcoal drawing
which sold for 19,500 euros to Indiana University Art Museum.  The scholarship will be known as the Max Beckmann
Distinguished Visitorship in honor of the German artist, who
spent the last years of his life in the U.S. after World War II.  His granddaughter is supporting the visitorship, which will
include teaching and curating an exhibition in Berlin, the
Academy said. The first distinguished visitorship is scheduled
for 2015.  Muse highlights include  Elin McCoy  on wine,  Martin Gayford 
on art,  Warwick Thompson  on theater and  Jeremy Gerard  on U.S.
theater.  To contact the writer on the story:
