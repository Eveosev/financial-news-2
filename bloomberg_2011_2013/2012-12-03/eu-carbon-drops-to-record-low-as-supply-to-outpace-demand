European Union carbon permits dropped
to a record as rising supplies will outpace demand.  Allowances for December dropped 4 percent to close at 5.95
euros ($7.77) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London . They dropped as low as 5.92 euros in intraday trading, 3
cents more than the record 5.89 euros on Nov. 30.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  cut its forecast for permits to an average 5
euros a ton in 2013, predicting a draft measure to delay sales
of some allowances is unlikely to be implemented next year.  The permits have fallen 23 percent in the past year as the
bloc considers proposals to curb a glut in the world’s biggest
greenhouse gas market.  The high volume of permits to be sold at auctions next year
will depress prices, Kathrin Goretzki, a commodity analyst at
the bank, said in a research note published today.  “We expect prices for EU allowances to fall further in
2013, trading in the range of 3.50 euros to 6.50 euros a metric
ton,” she said.  A decision by European governments on the measure to
postpone sales of 900 million allowances can take place as early
as March, after the European Parliament rules on an amendment to
the bloc’s emissions trading law in a plenary vote, according to
two EU officials, who declined to be identified, citing policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
