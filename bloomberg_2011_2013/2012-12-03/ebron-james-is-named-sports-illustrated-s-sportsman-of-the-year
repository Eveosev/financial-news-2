LeBron James  was named Sports
Illustrated’s Sportsman of the Year for 2012 after winning his
first National Basketball Association title along with a third
NBA Most Valuable Player award and an Olympic gold medal.  James, 27, guided the Miami Heat to the NBA championship
after the 2011-12 season and added the NBA Finals MVP to his
regular-season award. He then helped the U.S. successfully
defend the men’s basketball title at the London Games.  James is the seventh NBA player to receive SI’s award, the
Time Inc. magazine said today in an e-mailed statement. James’s
Heat teammate Dwyane Wade was the league’s last winner, in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
