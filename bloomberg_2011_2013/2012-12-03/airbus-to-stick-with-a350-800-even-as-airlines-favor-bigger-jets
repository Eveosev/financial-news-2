Airbus SAS (EAD)  said it will stick with
the smallest variant of its A350 wide-body plane to provide a
challenger for every version of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787, even after
initial customer Qatar Airways Ltd. switched to a bigger model.  While Qatar’s decision today to almost double its A350-1000
backlog to 37 while dropping an order for 20 smaller -800s
highlights a trend toward larger jets, scrapping the baseline
plane would leave Airbus vulnerable to the similar 787-9, Chief
Operating Officer John Leahy said in an interview.  Airbus’s older A330, which won some earlier competitions
against Boeing’s Dreamliner, doesn’t have the range to combat
the 787-9 and even the 787-8, Leahy said, adding: “For the
longer range you’ll need the A350-800.”  Airbus is meanwhile looking at increasing production of the
A330 to 11 planes a month, up from 9.5 now and 10 next spring,
Leahy said. December order figures, to be announced in January,
may reveal positive news on A330 orders from  China , which had
held back on contracts until the European Union suspended fees
to be levied on flights for carbon dioxide emissions, he said.  Leahy, also Airbus’s sales chief, will fly to China this
evening after speaking with financial analysts in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
