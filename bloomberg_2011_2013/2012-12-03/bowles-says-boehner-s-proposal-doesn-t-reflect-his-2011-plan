Former deficit commission co-chairman
Erskine Bowles said the deficit-cutting plan offered today by
House Republicans doesn’t reflect a proposal he offered in 2011.  House Speaker John Boehner said the Republican proposal
made today was based on Bowles’s plan. Bowles said the plan he
offered represented the “midpoint” of proposals made by all
sides at the time.  “Circumstances have changed since then,” Bowles said in
an e-mailed statement. “It is up to negotiators to figure out
where the middle ground is today.” Still, he said, “Every
offer put forward brings us closer to a deal.”  Bowles was former President Bill Clinton’s White House
chief of staff and also was co-chairman of President  Barack
Obama ’s deficit commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
