Illinois farmers may pay double the normal cost to ship grain and have inputs such as fertilizer and seed delivered as water flows in the Mississippi River drop amid the worst drought since 1956, the state’s farm bureau said.  Less grain is being loaded onto southbound barges to avoid ships bottoming in the river because of the declining water levels, said Philip Nelson, the president of the Illinois Farm Bureau. Companies that would normally buy grain from northern states for domestic use or overseas shipping will put off purchases because of concerns that corn, soybeans and wheat won’t be delivered, he said.  “When you start lightening loads up by 30, 40 or 50 percent, it could double the cost of freight going up and down the river,” Nelson said in an interview in Chicago at the bureau’s annual meeting today. “We’re seeing cash bids go away, because they know they’re not going to get the barges to ship the commodities on.”  The U.S. drought, which dried farmland from Ohio to Nebraska and sent corn and soybean prices to a record this year, will last at least through February in most areas, according to the U.S. Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Barges on the Mississippi handle about 60 percent of the nation’s grain exports entering the Gulf of Mexico through New Orleans, as well as 22 percent of its petroleum and 20 percent of its coal.  Trains, Trucks  Growers and elevators who normally send grain down the river for shipment overseas or to mills that process it into exportable goods may instead use trains or trucks to move corn, soybeans and wheat, Nelson said.  Companies sending fertilizers made in Russia and the Middle East shipped to the Gulf of Mexico and then up the Mississippi may also need to find alternative transport, Nelson said. Without the necessary inputs, crops planted in May and June may be smaller than forecast, he said.  “Long term, we’re worried about what could happen in the spring if we don’t get these inputs in the hands of growers in the state,” Nelson said. “We’re looking into alternative methods, whether it’s trucking or railing it in. We’re looking at a whole host of venues we’re not accustomed to because we’ve always taken advantage of the river.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Tony C.
