Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , a panel maker
with manufacturing operations in China, is borrowing C$139 ($140
million) from Deutsche Bank AG to build five solar farms in
Ontario.  The non-recourse construction financing will fund 49
megawatts of solar power, the West Guelph, Ontario-based company
said today in a statement.  The short-term loans are expected to be repaid when the
solar farms are sold.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  has agreed to buy them.
The projects will sell electricity to Ontario Power Authority
under 20-year contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
