A group of minority shareholders in
 Russia ’s OAO TNK-BP Holding plans to drop a 100 billion ruble
($3 billion) lawsuit against  BP Plc (BP/)  after the U.K. oil producer
resolved a dispute with its billionaire partners in the unit.  The shareholders led by Andrey Prokhorov told a Russian
court they will drop the suit before a Dec. 14 hearing, Dmitry
Chepurenko, a partner at the Liniya Prava law firm representing
Prokhorov, said today. Chepurenko wouldn’t specify the reason.  BP has agreed to sell its half of TNK-BP, the third-largest
Russian oil producer, to OAO Rosneft for $17 billion and 12.8
percent of Rosneft after years of disputes with its billionaire
partners. Rosneft plans to sign a binding agreement for the
purchase of the balance from AAR, the company representing the
billionaires, this month.  BP is aware of the request to end the suit, Konstantin
Lukoyanov, a lawyer for the company, said today by phone.  A Tyumen, Russia court in July ordered BP to pay  TNK-BP
Holding (TNBP)  100.4 billion rubles in damages over a failed deal with
Rosneft. Prokhorov had originally sought 409 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
