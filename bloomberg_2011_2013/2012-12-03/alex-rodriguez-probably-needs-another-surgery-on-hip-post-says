New York  Yankees third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  played last season after re-injuring his surgically
repaired hip and probably needs another operation that will
sideline him for part of 2013, according to the New York Post.  Rodriguez, 37, had arthroscopic surgery on a torn labrum in
his right hip in March 2009 and now has a similar tear, the
newspaper said. He will be operated on by Marc Philippon, the
surgeon who performed the first procedure, the  Post reported  on
its website without saying where it got its information.  Rodriguez, a 19-year Major League Baseball veteran who has
played his last nine seasons with the Yankees, batted .272 with
18 home runs and 57 runs batted in over 122 games in 2012. He
was 3-for-25 in the playoffs without an extra-base hit.  The three-time American League Most Valuable Player’s 647
home runs are the most among active major league players and
he’s fifth on the all-time list. He was re-signed to a 10-year,
$275 million contract after the 2007 season, a deal that
included bonus payments for milestone home runs leading up to
 Barry Bonds ’s record of 762. He has five years and about $115
million left on that package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
