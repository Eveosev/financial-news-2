Chinese stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its lowest level in almost four years, as
liquor makers and coal producers plunged.  A  gauge  tracking consumer-staple companies sank the most in
three years.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , the world’s second-largest
distiller by market value, tumbled the most since 2008 on
concern demand for high-end liquor is decreasing. Datong Coal
Industry Co. dropped 4.1 percent after the benchmark price for
thermal coal decreased. The declines overshadowed data showing a
manufacturing gauge rose to a seven-month high.  “The macroeconomic data may indicate that the economy is
improving but people don’t feel that on the ground,” Li
Guangming, an analyst at Dongxing Securities Co., said in a
telephone interview from Beijing today.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1 percent to 1,959.77
at the 3 p.m. local-time close, with about seven stocks
declining for each that gained. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slid 1.4
percent. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index lost 1.6 percent
in  Hong Kong . The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of
the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.6 percent
in  New York  on Nov. 30.  Concern that a possible wave of new share sales will lure
funds from existing equities also dragged stocks lower. China
has 493 companies awaiting initial public offerings on the
mainboards in  Shanghai  and Shenzhen and on Shenzhen’s small and
medium-sized enterprises board as of Nov. 29, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on the latest data posted on the
China Securities Regulatory Commission’s website.  Stock Discount  The Shanghai Composite trades at 10.8 times reported
 earnings , the lowest level since at least 1997, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The index has fallen 11 percent this
year, heading for a third straight year of losses, amid
estimates the economy will grow at its slowest pace in a more
than a decade this year.  Chinese companies traded on the mainland are 3.3 percent
cheaper than their Hong Kong-listed counterparts, according to
an  index  from Hang Seng Bank Ltd. The discount, which last week
was the widest since January 2011, shows global investors are
more optimistic than locals on the country’s growth prospects.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  has jumped 16 percent
since Sept. 5. Yuan-denominated shares are restricted to
domestic investors and a limited number of foreign institutions,
while their Hong Kong counterparts are open to overseas
investors.  A  gauge  tracking consumer staples dropped 5.6 percent, the
most among 10 industries in the CSI 300. Kweichow Moutai slumped
7.3 percent to 200.19  yuan , the biggest drop since September
2008. Wuliangye Yibin Co. tumbled 9.9 percent to 24.31 yuan.
Jiuguijiu Co. lost 6.3 percent to 27.32 yuan.  Billionaire Stake  “Investors don’t have a good outlook for baijiu,” Liu Wei, an analyst at Masterlink Securities Corp., said by phone
from Shanghai. “We haven’t seen Wuliangye increasing prices of
their products even though this should be the peak season.”  Silver Base Group Holdings Ltd. (886) , a Hong Kong-based
distributor of high-end Chinese liquor including products by
Wuliangye, reported Dec. 2 a six-month loss of HK$194.5 million
($25.1 million), citing weak consumption and increased
inventories. Billionaire Cheng Yu-Tung cut his stake in Silver
Base to 3.91 percent from at least 8.1 percent last month,
according to disclosure filings to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Silver Base shares plunged 5.8 percent to HK$2.29 today,
the lowest level in three years.  Rising Inventories  Datong Coal dropped 4.1 percent to 7.73 yuan, the lowest
close since March 17, 2009. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. retreated
4.8 percent to 15.43 yuan, the lowest since July 5, 2010.  China’s benchmark price for thermal coal fell for a second
week to the lowest level since the end of September as
inventories at the port of Qinhuangdao increased.  November’s official manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’
Index rose to 50.6. A gauge of new orders increased to its
highest level since April and the output reading was the highest
in six months, according to an official report. Non-
manufacturing PMI climbed to 55.6 last month, the highest in
three months.  Nine of 16 analysts surveyed over the last two weeks by
 Bloomberg News  forecast the government will set next year’s
economic growth target at 7.5 percent, unchanged from from 2012,
while six expect a decline to 7 percent and one sees an increase
to 8 percent.  American companies are supplanting China from the world’s
500 biggest stocks faster than at any time in the past decade.
U.S. corporations make up 171 of the top 500 with a  market
capitalization  of $10.6 trillion, compared with 159 valued at
$8.24 trillion in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
PetroChina Co. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
lead the 24 Chinese firms worth $1.74 trillion, down from 34
with a value of $2.19 trillion.  Developers (SHPROP)  advanced. Poly Real Estate Group Co. increased
2.4 percent to 11.75 yuan. Gemdale Corp. climbed 2.3 percent to
5.41 yuan.  Home prices  rose 0.26 percent in November from
October, the most in four months, Soufun Holdings Ltd., the
country’s biggest real estate website owner, said today.  -- Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact the reporter on this story:
