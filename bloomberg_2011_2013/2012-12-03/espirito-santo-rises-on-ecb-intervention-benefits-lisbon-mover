Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  rose the most
in a month after JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended investors buy
shares in Portugal’s biggest publicly traded bank to benefit
from possible European Central Bank intervention in the country.  Banco Espirito climbed as much as 4.8 percent in Lisbon
trading, the biggest intraday gain since Nov. 1. The stock was
up 4.2 percent to 79.9 cents as of 1:20 p.m. local time, with
volume at about 90 percent of the three-month daily average,
giving the lender a market value of 3.21 billion euros ($4.2
billion).  “We consider BES is the best option to play this event in
the European periphery as the benefits from lower funding costs
would offset a very weak domestic economy,” Jaime Becerril, an
analyst at JPMorgan in London, wrote in a note today.  Becerril raised his recommendation for Espirito Santo to
overweight from neutral and said JPMorgan expects ECB
intervention in Portugal to take place in the first quarter of
2013. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said in September bond
purchases may be considered for euro-area countries currently
under bailout programs, such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland,
when they regain bond-market access.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  increased 1.4 percent to 7.1
cents and  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  rose 1.4 percent to 81.9 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
