Kanematsu Corp. (8020) , a Japanese trading
company, won an order to build a 54-megawatt wind power station
and lay underwater cables for power transmission in the
 Philippines .  The order, worth more than 10 billion yen ($102 million),
was awarded by Trans-Asia Renewable Energy Corp., a unit of
Trans-Asia Oil &  Energy Development Corp. (EDC) , Tokyo-based Kanematsu
said in a statement today.  A long-term expansion of renewable energy is expected in
the Philippines after the country introduced an incentive
program for clean energy, known as feed-in tariffs, in July
2012, Kanematsu said. The project will be completed at the end
of 2014 and will be financed through syndicated loans, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
