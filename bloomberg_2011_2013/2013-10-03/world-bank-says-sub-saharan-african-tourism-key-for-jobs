Sub-Saharan  Africa  has the world’s
fastest-growing tourism industry as the continent attracts hotel
investments to cater for foreign visitors and African travelers
with rising incomes, according to the World Bank.  Tourism on the continent is forecast to employ about 6.7
million people by 2021 and returns on investments “are among
the highest in the world,” the Washington-based lender said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “Sub-Saharan Africa is outpacing other regions in tourism
growth,” it said. “Global hotel chains are expanding across
Africa, recognizing investment potential and committing millions
of dollars in new projects over the next few years.”  Cape Verde, Kenya, Mauritius,  Namibia , Rwanda, South Africa
and Tanzania are examples of African countries that have adopted
tourism policies to spur growth, liberalized air traffic and are
creating solid investment climates, the World Bank said.
Economic  growth  in sub-Saharan African is forecast to expand an
average of 5.6 percent this year compared with 1.2 percent in
advanced economies, according to the International Monetary
Fund.  Accelerating improvements to sub-Saharan Africa’s
electricity supplies, infrastructure and transportation networks
would support further growth, said Makhtar Diop, the bank’s
vice-president for Africa, according to the statement.  Marriott International (MAR)  Inc., Hilton Worldwide Inc.,
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT)  and Kempinski AG are
among companies with plans to build more hotels in Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
