Cia. Energetica de  Sao Paulo ,
 Brazil ’s best-performing utility this year, sank as  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  cut it to the equivalent of hold, saying the
stock’s value already reflects higher wholesale power prices.  The  shares  dropped 3 percent to 22.60 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Sept. 4. The Ibovespa
equity benchmark fell 1.1 percent.  Cesp, as the utility is also known, can sell its excess
electricity into the daily wholesale market, earning profits in
addition to those from power distributed under contract rates.
The company has exceeded analysts’ earnings  estimates  in each of
the past three quarters partly because of higher market prices,
known as spot.  “After a period of undeserved skepticism, we believe the
market is now fairly aware of the benefits of high spot prices
for Cesp’s earnings,” Credit Suisse analysts including Vinicius Canheu wrote in a research note today. “Most of its room for
earnings surprises is already reflected in the stock price.”  Credit Suisse  cut  Cesp from the equivalent of buy. The
price target is 24 reais.  Even with today’s decline, Cesp shares are up 17 percent in
2013, the best performance among 16 members in the Bovespa
Electric Energy Index, which is down 6.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
