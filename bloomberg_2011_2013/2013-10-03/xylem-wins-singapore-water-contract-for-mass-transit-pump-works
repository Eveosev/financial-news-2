Xylem Inc. (XYL) , whose equipment helped
clean  New York  tunnels of Hurricane Sandy floodwaters, won a
supply contract that includes submersible drainage pumps and UV
disinfection units for Singaporeâ€™s mass transit project.  The equipment and service contract with the Singapore Land
Transport Authority for the Downtown Line Mass Rapid Transit
project is valued at S$8.2 million ($6.6 million), the company
said today in a statement. The 42-kilometer (26-mile) train
line, scheduled for completion in 2017, will be the longest
