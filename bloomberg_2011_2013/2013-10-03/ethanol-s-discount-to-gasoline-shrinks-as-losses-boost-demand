Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that four days of losses increased
demand for the biofuel while Renewable Identification Numbers
fell a second day.  The price difference shrank 3.41 cents to 96.76 cents a
gallon a day after it reached $1.0017. That compares with an
average of 52.24 cents so far this year. The Energy Information
Administration said  stockpiles  dropped 0.7 percent to 15.5
million barrels last week, the lowest level since June 28.  “Yesterday, it came off really hard,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “It was maybe a
little bit overdone. There’s not a ton of physical product out
there.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery jumped 4.5 cents,
or 2.8 percent, to $1.672 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The October contract, which expired today, climbed 9.4
cents, or 5.3 percent, to $1.881.  Gasoline for November delivery advanced 1.09 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.6396 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Damask said the ethanol market is in backwardation, when
prompt deliveries are more expensive than later ones, and that’s
causing end-users to buy just enough of the additive to supply
immediate needs.  Corn Harvest  Prices are expected to fall as more corn becomes available
during the harvest, which lasts from September to November,
Damask said.  Ethanol  production  increased 5.2 percent to 875,000 barrels
a day last week, the highest level since July 12, data from the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical agency, show.  Corn for December delivery added 0.25 cent to $4.3925 a
bushel in  Chicago . The December corn crush spread of corn to
ethanol was 1 cent, up from minus 3 cents yesterday.  A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year. The government maintains
compliance with Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, which
are tracking certificates attached to the biofuel. They can be
traded among refiners and later submitted to the Environmental
Protection Agency.  Conventional ethanol RINs dropped 1 cents to 38 cents, the
lowest since Feb. 20, while advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, declined 1 cents to 48
cents, the cheapest since Jan. 29, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Next Year  The EPA is scheduled to release its proposal for next
year’s requirements this fall. Last week, congressional
negotiators met with renewable fuel interests to discuss
possible changes to the program. In August, EPA said it would
 extend  the deadline for refiners to show compliance to June 2013
from February.  “Uncertainty” about the EPA’s blending targets has led to
lower prices for the certificates, said  David Dunn , a certified
financial analyst at Progressive Fuels Ltd., in Naples, Florida.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  tumbled 10
cents to $2.10 a gallon; in Chicago prices gained 2.5 cents to
$2; in the U.S. Gulf the additive rose 1.5 cents to $2.07; and
on the West Coast the biofuel held at $2.05 a gallon, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago dwindled 12.5 cents to
10 cents, while the West Coast’s discount to the Gulf expanded
1.5 cents to 2 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
