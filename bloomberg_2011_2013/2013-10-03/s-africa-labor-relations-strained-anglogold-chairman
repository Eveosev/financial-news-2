A lack of communication and
unwillingness to compromise are undermining labor relations in
South Africa, said Tito Mboweni, the chairman of  Anglogold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)   There are “examples of adversarial labor relations, lack
of negotiation in good faith, unrealistic wage demands and poor
communication between management and workers” that’s weighing
on bargaining talks, Mboweni, who served as Labor Minister from
1994 until 1998 and thereafter as central bank governor, said in
an Africa-Ireland forum today in Dublin, according to an e-mailed copy of the speech.  South Africa’s mining industry has been wracked by strikes
since last year, disrupting exports and limiting growth in the
continent’s largest economy. Members of the Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union at  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd. (AMS) ’s mines have been on strike since Sept. 27 to protest
against the company’s plans to cut 3,300 jobs.  “The recent history of labor relations in South Africa has
not been a proud one and poor communication, a lack of respect
and good faith, destructive behavior and an unwillingness to
compromise have been observed far too often,” Mboweni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
