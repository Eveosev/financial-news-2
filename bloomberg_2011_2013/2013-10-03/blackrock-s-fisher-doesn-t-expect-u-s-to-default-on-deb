BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Peter Fisher, the
former head of fixed income at the world’s biggest money
manager, said he doesn’t expect the U.S. to reach its debt limit
and default.  “Both sides have lost the power to threaten,” Fisher, now
a senior director of the BlackRock Investment Institute, said
today during an interview with  Erik Schatzker  and Stephanie
Ruhle on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers”. Fisher is a
former Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, and
previously spent 16 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
