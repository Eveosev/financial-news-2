President Dennis Lockhart said it’s difficult to get an accurate
picture of the labor market given declining participation rates
and problems of underemployment.  “I find getting a fix on employment conditions” to be
“extremely challenging,” Lockhart, who doesn’t vote on
monetary policy this year, said in introductory remarks at a
conference in Atlanta. Questions about how to assess the state
of the labor market “weigh on the minds” of policy makers
seeking full employment, he said.  The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee last month
unexpectedly refrained from reducing the pace of its $85 billion
in monthly bond buying, saying it wants to see more evidence of
lasting improvement in the labor market.  While  joblessness  fell to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4
percent in July, the decline was attributable to discouraged
Americans giving up on finding jobs. The share of working-age
people in the labor force declined to 63.2 percent, the lowest
 participation rate  since 1978, from 63.4 percent in July.  The U.S. Department of Labor won’t issue the September
payrolls report tomorrow as initially scheduled because of the
partial government shutdown now in its third day. The release
includes the unemployment rate and data on payroll employment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
