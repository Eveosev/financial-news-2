Angola ,  Africa ’s largest crude oil
producer after  Nigeria , plans to build hydroelectric plants to
boost power generation fivefold in a bid to attract investment
in other industries to the country.  The goal is to have an installed capacity of 9,000
megawatts of generation capacity by 2025 compared with about
1,800 megawatts now, Jose Salgueiro, director of studies,
planning and statistics at the Ministry of Energy and Water,
said in an Oct. 2 interview.  “Everything is planned to have the electricity there
because it’s the main way to say Angola is open for business,”
he said in Luanda, the capital. “The promise of more power will
attract more investment.”  The southwest African country of 21 million people plans to
build about 15 plants with the help of companies such as
 Brazil ’s Odebrecht SA and Xinjiang TBEA Group Co. of  China  as it
seeks to almost double non-oil foreign investment to $4 billion
a year by 2017. Angola suffers daily power outages as it
recovers from a 27-year civil war in which homes, dams, plants
and power lines were destroyed and an estimated 800,000 people
were killed, according to the  University of Massachusetts ’
 Political Economy Research Institute .  The government wants to diversify its economy, which the
 International Monetary Fund  expects to expand by 6.2 percent
this year, away from the petroleum spending that accounts for 97
percent of exports and 75 percent of taxes. Angola pumped about
1.74 million barrels of oil a day in September, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The kwanza appreciated 0.3 percent
to 97.47 per dollar by 2:22 p.m. in Luanda, paring the decline
this year to 1.7 percent.  Power Access  The state wants to double the number of people with access
to electricity to 60 percent in 12 years, ministry documents
show. Citizens and businesses use diesel generators to maintain
supply. One megawatt is enough to supply 2,000 average European
homes.  The largest network so far approved will be four  power
plants  southeast of Luanda along the Kwanza River, including the
$3.9 billion Lauca dam with capacity of 400 megawatts by 2017,
Salgueiro said. It will use equipment made by  Spain ’s  Elecnor SA (ENO) 
and  Germany ’s Voith GmbH, ramping up to 2,069 megawatts of
capacity eight years later, he said.  The $1.5 billion Cambambe 2 project will have 380 megawatts
of capacity by 2015 and increase to 780 megawatts two years
later. It joins Cambambe 1, which began in 1960, has 180
megawatts of capacity and will increase to 240 megawatts after a
project to add 30 meters (98 feet) of height to the dam is
completed in 2015, Salgueiro said.  Capanda Plant  The 2,047-megawatt Caculo Cabaca project may be started
next year and completed within six years, while the Capanda
plant on the same river, managed by state-owned  Gabinete de
Aproveitamento do Medio Kwanza , or Gamek, continues to have
capacity for 520 megawatts, Salgueiro said.  The government’s most ambitious project is being studied
for the Queve, Longa and Ngunza rivers further south to produce
774 megawatts by 2018 and rise to 6,284 megawatts in the decade
following that, Salgueiro said.  A plan to increase capacity from Catumbela in Benguela
province to 2,000 megawatts from 90 megawatts depends on the
approval of a dam at Cacombo, he said.  A natural-gas power plant at Soyo near the mouth of the
Congo River will use four turbines to have capacity of almost
500 megawatts by 2015 in a $1.6 billion project, including 300
kilometers (186 miles) of transmission lines to Luanda, he said.
Capacity may rise to 1,700 megawatts in the next decade, he
said.  Namibia Partnership  Angola is splitting costs and output with  Namibia  in
building several power and water projects along the Cunene River
that forms part of the border between the countries, he said.  The Jama ya Omo and Jama ya Mina projects, estimated to
cost $500 million for 78 megawatts and $800 million for 227
megawatts, respectively, are expected to be approved in the 2014
state budget, Salgueiro said. A 100-megawatt wind-power project
at Tombwa is also being considered and contracts have yet to be
awarded, he said.  Two new water projects are also awaiting approval for
Luanda, he said. The six-contract, $622 million Quilonga Grande
will supply the city’s north from the Kwanza River and the 7-contract, $538 million Bita project will deliver to its south.
Each will take three years to build, Salgueiro said.  The state plans to reorganize its three overlapping
electricity companies along separate production, transmission
and distribution mandates by early next year, he said. Along
with Gamek, the state owns power distributor  Empresa de
Distribuicao de Electricidade EP , or EDEL, and  Empresa Nacional
de Electricidade EP , known as ENE.  Goals include increasing electricity usage to 15 percent of
all energy by 2025 from 3 percent now, raising oil and gas to 55
percent from 33 percent and cutting wood burning to 30 percent
from 64 percent, ministry documents show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
