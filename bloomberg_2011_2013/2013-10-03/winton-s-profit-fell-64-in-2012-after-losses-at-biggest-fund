Winton Capital Management Ltd., the
$24.5 billion hedge-fund firm founded by David Harding, said
profit plunged 64 percent last year after its main fund posted
just its second annual decline since starting in 1997.  Earnings after taxes fell to 58.6 million pounds ($95.1
million) in 2012, compared with 162 million pounds in 2011,
London-based Winton said in a U.K. Companies House filing
published today. Winton, which earns its most lucrative fees
from investment gains made at the firm’s hedge funds, said
revenue declined 45 percent to 193 million pounds.  Winton invests in  futures markets  tied to commodities,
currencies, bonds and stocks, relying on computer models to
decide when to buy and sell. Its $9.8 billion futures fund slid
3.5 percent last year, hurt partly by swings in  market sentiment 
from pessimism to optimism based on actions by central banks and
politicians.  Robin Eggar, a Winton spokesman, declined to comment on the
results.  Winton, the fourth-biggest hedge-fund firm in  Europe  by
assets, employs more than 100 scientific researchers, including
Harding, a Cambridge University-educated physicist. Harding, 52,
and the firm’s seven other directors received dividends totaling
38.2 million pounds in 2012, the filing shows.  The Winton Futures Fund has risen about 3.5 percent this
year and has produced an average annual gain of about 14 percent
since it started trading more than 15 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
