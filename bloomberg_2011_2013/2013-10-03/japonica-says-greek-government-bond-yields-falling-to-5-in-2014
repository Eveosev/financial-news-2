Japonica Partners & Co., the U.S.
investment firm that offered to buy as much as 4 billion euros
($5.5 billion) of Greek  government bonds , expects yields on the
securities to drop to 5 percent early next year, a level last
seen in 2009.  “Greece has accomplished what most would have thought was
impossible,” founder Paul Kazarian said today in his first
public comments since the firm announced its tender offer in
June. The market has been “almost certainly wrong, particularly
in comparison to euro-zone peers.”  Japonica’s offer expired last month and the firm said it’s
now one of the largest holders of Greek government debt, without
disclosing how many bonds it owns. The Providence, Rhode Island-based firm paid as little as 11.4 percent of face value for the
bonds it purchased, Kazarian said on a conference call. It
expects the debt to be valued at more than 85 percent by next
year, he said.  Greece ’s 10-year bonds advanced today, with the yield
dropping five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.25
percent as of 5 p.m. in  London . That’s down from as much as
11.94 percent in July. The yield was last below 5 percent in
December 2009.  The price of the 2 percent security maturing in February
2023 was 62.15. On May 31, the last trading day before Japonica
announced its offer, the securities yielded 9.39 percent, with
the price at 60.325. Greek government bonds have returned 3.3
percent since May 31, according to the  Bloomberg Greece
Sovereign Bond Index. (BGRE)   Kazarian started Japonica after leaving Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Japonica gained prominence in the U.S. during the late
1980s and early 1990s for deals including an attempted buyout of
food company Borden Inc., a failed $1.6 billion takeover of
railroad operator CNW Corp. and the purchase of appliance maker
Sunbeam-Oster Co.  Japonica will continue to focus on investing in companies
the firm deems undervalued, which is the firm’s “core
competency,” Kazarian said when asked on the call whether it
will use its Greek bonds to acquire state assets in the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
