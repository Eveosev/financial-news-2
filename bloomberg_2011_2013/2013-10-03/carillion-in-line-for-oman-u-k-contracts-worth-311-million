Carillion Plc (CLLN) , a British construction
and services provider, won a 92 million-pound ($149 million)
contract to build a hotel in  Oman  and was named preferred bidder
for work on a U.K. program worth as much as 100 million pounds.  Carillion will begin developing the Kempinski Wave Hotel in
Muscat, Oman, this month on a 40,000-square-meter plot, under a
24-month contract, the company said in a statement today. A U.K.
energy-saving program for local authorities led by West Sussex
County Council in  England  may begin in early 2014, and work
would be carried out under a 10-year contract, the company said
said in a separate statement.  “Our order book and pipeline of contract opportunities
both remain strong and continue to support our expectations for
2013 and our medium-term targets for growth,” the
Wolverhampton, England-based company said today.  The U.K. energy-saving program would help as many as 17,000
households by 2017, potentially rising to 680,000 over the next
25 years, Carillion said.  The company, which employs about 40,000 people, has been
expanding in the  Middle East  and  Canada  to offset a drop in
construction orders in its U.K. home market. The Middle East
contributed 7.1 percent of total revenue last year, compared
with 5.3 percent in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company announced today it will restructure its energy
services operations before the end of the year in response to
delays in the government’s Green Deal initiative, which helps
householders and business owners make energy-saving
improvements. Carillion forecast non-recurring charges from the
restructuring of about 40 million pounds in 2013.  The company’s shares  fell  0.8 percent pence to 313.1 pence
at 11:29 a.m. in London, valuing Carillion at 1.35 billion
pounds. The stock has dropped 1.2 percent this year while the
 FTSE 250 index  has surged 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
