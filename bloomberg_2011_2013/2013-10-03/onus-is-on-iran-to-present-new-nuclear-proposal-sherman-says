The U.S. and other world powers won’t
make a new offer to  Iran  in nuclear talks before assessing what
Iranian officials tell negotiators in Geneva later this month,
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman
said.  Terms presented previously to Iran will remain unchanged
when Iran meets with world powers, she said. The meeting
involving the group known as the P5+1 -- China,  France ,  Russia ,
the U.K. and the U.S., plus Germany -- is scheduled for Oct.
15-16 in Geneva.  The U.S. wants to see “new and verifiable and concrete”
measures from Iran that meet international concerns that it is
seeking nuclear weapons capability, Sherman said in testimony to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  While the new Iranian government has said it is ready to
address those issues, Sherman said the U.S. is going into the
talks “with our eyes wide open,” given past Iranian deception.  “The onus is on Iran,” she said. “We will not put new
ideas on the table until we hear from Iran.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
