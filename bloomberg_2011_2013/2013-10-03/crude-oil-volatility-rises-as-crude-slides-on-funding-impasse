Crude oil volatility rose as the
underlying futures fell on concern that the U.S. government
shutdown will slow economic growth and cut fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money November options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
rose to 19.8 percent at 4:40 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  from 19.4 percent yesterday.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 57
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most active
options were November $95 puts, which gained 2 cents to 9 cents
a barrel on volume of 4,265 lots. With 2,927 contracts
exchanging hands, November $100 puts were the second-most
traded. They increased 14 cents to 54 cents a barrel  West Texas Intermediate for November delivery slid 79
cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $103.31 a barrel on the
Nymex. Prices dropped from a two-week high as the first face-to-face talks between President  Barack Obama  and congressional
leaders failed to break the budget logjam yesterday.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 53 percent of
the 125,9563 lots traded.  November $95 puts were the most-active options yesterday,
with 8,870 contracts trading as they slipped 16 cents to 5 cents
a barrel. November $110 calls gained 7 cents to 15 cents.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
41,370 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 41,259 lots
and December $100 calls with 31,864.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
