Taiwan’s dollar touched the strongest
level in almost five months amid speculation the central bank
has scaled back intervention aimed at weakening the currency to
reduce inflationary pressures.  The monetary authority has sold the local dollar in the
run-up to the close on most days since March 2012, according to
traders who asked not to be identified. Planned increases in
transport and electricity costs will drive up inflation in the
fourth quarter, according to a report by Standard Chartered Plc
strategists including Hong Kong-based  Robert Minikin  last month.  The local dollar closed 0.3 percent stronger at NT$29.532
against its U.S. counterpart, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show.
It rose as much as 0.9 percent earlier to NT$29.353, the
strongest level since May 9. The currency weakened 0.4 percent
in the last eight minutes of trading amid suspected central bank
intervention.  “Since oil, electricity and rail prices have gone up
recently, there is inflationary pressure in October, which is
why the central bank has been less active in blocking
appreciation,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union
Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The  Taiwan dollar  has been pulled
back to NT$29.6 at the close lately, but the market has been
allowed to move more freely during the day.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the local dollar rose
0.4 percent today to NT$29.33, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts touched NT$29.315, also the strongest
since May 9. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.71 percent.  The yield on the 1.75 percent notes due September 2023 was
little changed at 1.66 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.384
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
