German institutional investors plan
to reduce their holdings of government bonds in the next three
years in favor of higher-yielding assets to beat low interest
rates, according to researcher Greenwich Associates.  The investors have increasingly diversified into emerging-market debt and other assets with higher returns while reducing
allocations to fixed-income funds that track indexes,  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based Greenwich said in a  report  published today,
citing a survey.  “Over the past 12 months, institutions have increased
allocations to active global bonds, emerging-markets debt and
high yield,” Greenwich said in the report. “Expectations to
decrease government bonds exposure further also continue, with
emerging-market debt, high yield and active global bonds
anticipated to continue to be beneficiaries.”  German institutional investors also extended duration of
their bond portfolio on bets interest rates will stay low for an
extended period, Greenwich said. They now hold ‘virtually no
fixed-income assets with less than five years duration,’’ it
said. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond’s price
to changes in interest rates.  German institutions are now devoting more than three
fourths of their investment capital to return-seeking as opposed
to meeting liabilities, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
