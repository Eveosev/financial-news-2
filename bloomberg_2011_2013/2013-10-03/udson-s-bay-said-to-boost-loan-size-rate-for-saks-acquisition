Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBAYF) , Canada’s biggest
department-store operator, increased the size and interest rate
for the loans it’s seeking to support its purchase of luxury
retailer  Saks Inc. (SKS) , according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  A $2 billion, seven-year  term loan , increased from $1.9
billion, may now pay interest at 3.75 percentage points to 4
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
up from an initially proposed range of 3.25 percentage points to
3.5 percentage points more than the lending benchmark, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.
Libor will have a 1 percent minimum.  The company added a $300 million second-lien term portion
that expires in eight years and replaces a senior unsecured bond
that Hudson’s Bay had considered offering, the person said.
While the  interest rate  hasn’t yet been proposed, the lending
benchmark will have a 1 percent minimum.  Bank of America Corp. is leading the financing and requests
that lenders to the $2 billion piece submit commitments by 5
p.m. today in New York. The debt is being offered at 99 cents on
the dollar.  A lender call to discuss the second-lien slice will take
place on Oct. 7.  Hudson’s Bay agreed to buy New York-based Saks for $2.4
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
