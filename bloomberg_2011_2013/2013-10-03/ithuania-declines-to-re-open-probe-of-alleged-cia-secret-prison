Lithuania  prosecutors said evidence
provided last month by human rights groups about claims the
country hosted a secret U.S. Central Intelligence Agency prison
don’t merit renewing an investigation.  “A decision was made after reviewing the materials to
decline to start a pretrial investigation,” Elena Martinoniene,
a spokeswoman at the prosecutor’s office in Vilnius, Lithuania’s
capital, said today by phone.  Redress, a London-based anti-torture advocacy group, and
Lithuania’s Human Rights Monitoring Institute,  said  last month
that a Saudi national accused of financing the Sept. 11, 2001
terrorist attacks was held illegally in the Baltic nation
between 2004 and 2006. Based on the new information, London-based  Amnesty International  on Sept. 26 urged Lithuanian
prosecutors to re-open a probe of alleged CIA crimes that they
closed in 2011 for lack of evidence.  Redress will appeal the rejection of its complaint in
Lithuanian courts, it  said  on its website today.  A Lithuanian parliamentary commission said in December 2009
it had evidence that security department officials allowed the
CIA to operate a secret prison in the Baltic state between 2002
and 2006 to detain terrorist suspects. The panel said it had no
“firm evidence” that the prison was used for its original
purpose to interrogate terrorist suspects.  Then-U.S. President  George W. Bush  in 2006 confirmed for
the first time the country held some detainees captured abroad
at covert jails run by the CIA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
