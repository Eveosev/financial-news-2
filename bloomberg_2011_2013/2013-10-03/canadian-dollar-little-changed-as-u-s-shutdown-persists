Canada ’s dollar traded in the
narrowest range since April as the U.S. government shutdown
reached a third day, raising concern the political gridlock will
slow growth in the nation’s largest trading partner.  The currency touched almost a two-week low against its U.S.
counterpart amid speculation the standoff would merge with the
fight about raising the U.S. debt ceiling later this month. It
fell versus a majority of its most-traded peers, along with the
 U.S. dollar .  “The market is looking for inspiration here, it’s in a
wait-and-see mode,” said  John Curran , a senior vice president
at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign exchange dealer, said
by phone from Toronto. “It’s a lose-lose situation. If they
resolve this, people would start buying the U.S. dollar. If this
drags on, the Canadian will weaken too.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed at C$1.0333
per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It depreciated earlier to
C$1.0340 after touching C$1.0356 yesterday, the weakest level
since Sept. 16. One Canadian dollar buys 96.78 U.S. cents. The
loonie traded in a range of 0.27 cent, the least since April 1.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  was little
changed to yield 2.54 percent. The price of the 1.5 percent
security due in June 2023 gained four cents to C$91.14.  The Canadian dollar lost 1.3 percent in the past month
against nine developed-market peers tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar dropped 3 percent,
while the Australian currency gained fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
