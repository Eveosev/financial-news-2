Australia cricket captain  Michael Clarke  may miss the first Ashes Test against England because of
his back injury.  The 32-year-old was already ruled out of Australia’s one-day series in  India , which starts Oct. 10 in Rajkot, after his
back problem failed to respond to its usual treatment program.  Asked by reporters today if there’s a chance he could miss
the start of the Ashes series, Clarke said team physiotherapist
 Alex Kountouris  sees him as at risk.  “I’ll say ‘definitely not’ but at this stage we can’t
predict how long it’s going to take to get right,” Clarke said.
“If you ask Alex, the physio, I’m sure he’ll say there is that
chance. For me personally I’m trying not to look at that. It’s
about being nice and positive and working my backside off and
getting myself right.”  The five-match contest for cricket’s oldest trophy begins
in Brisbane on Nov. 21.  England  is bidding for a fourth
successive Ashes series win after wrapping up a 3-0 victory in
the last competition in August.  To contact the reporter on this story: Peter-Joseph Hegarty in
