BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , France’s biggest
bank, will host a conference on Asian manufacturers in Japan for
the first time as interest increases in the world’s best-performing developed equity market.  The Asia Pacific industrials conference will take place in
 Tokyo  in November, with about 80 to 90 percent of the companies
introduced being Japanese, according to Yukiko Kishino, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the bank. Until now such events were
mostly held in Hong Kong, she said.  About 40 companies have registered and the brokerage
estimates that as many as 100 foreign and domestic investors
will attend, Kishino said. When the bank will hold one of these
gatherings in Hong Kong again hasn’t been decided, she said.  Japan’s  Topix index  surged 37 percent this year through
yesterday, the biggest gain among major developed markets, amid
optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will boost economic growth.
That compares with a 1.5 percent advance for  Hong Kong ’s Hang
Seng Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
