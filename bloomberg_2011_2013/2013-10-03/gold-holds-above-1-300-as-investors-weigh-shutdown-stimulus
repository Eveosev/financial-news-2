Gold held above $1,300 an ounce after
gaining the most in two weeks as investors assessed the U.S.
government shutdown and its impact on the outlook for monetary
stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,309.47 an ounce, and traded at $1,312.28 at 2:15 p.m. in
Singapore. Prices climbed 2.2 percent yesterday, rebounding from
an eight-week low of $1,277.15, after a private report showed
U.S. companies added fewer workers than forecast in September,
supporting the case for the Fed to maintain its $85 billion-a-month of bond buying.  The first government shutdown in 17 years, which  IHS Inc. (IHS) 
estimates may cost the U.S. at least $300 million a day in lost
economic output, extended into a second day yesterday as
President  Barack Obama  refused to negotiate in a meeting with
top congressional leaders, said House Speaker  John Boehner . Gold
dropped 22 percent this year on speculation the U.S. central
bank may scale back asset purchases as the economy recovers.  “The market expects a short shutdown that will have a
minimal impact on the broader economy and doesn’t change the
Fed’s timetable on tapering,” said Mark To, head of research at
Wing Fung Financial Group, a Hong Kong-based precious metals
trader and refiner. “If the budget standoff stretches into next
week, it could begin to negatively impact the economy, and the
demand for a safe haven will support gold.”  Gold for December delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $1,311.30
an ounce on the Comex in  New York  after climbing 2.7 percent
yesterday and falling 3.1 percent on Oct. 1. Trading was 57
percent below the average for the past 100 days for this time of
day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver for immediate delivery rose and fell at least 0.5
percent, before trading 0.3 percent lower at $21.67 an ounce.
Platinum was little changed at $1,387.20 an ounce and palladium
lost 0.2 percent to $716.98 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
