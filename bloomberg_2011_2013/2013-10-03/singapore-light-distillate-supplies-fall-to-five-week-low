Light-distillates inventories in
 Singapore  dropped to the lowest level in five weeks, according
to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Stockpiles of naphtha, reformate and gasoline, fell 7.4
percent to 10.4 million barrels in the week ended yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at the lowest since the week ended Aug. 28.  Middle-distillate stockpiles, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 2 percent to 10.2 million barrels, rebounding
from the lowest level in four weeks.  Residual fuel  inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, gained 0.9 percent to
22 million barrels. Supplies rose first time in three weeks.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
