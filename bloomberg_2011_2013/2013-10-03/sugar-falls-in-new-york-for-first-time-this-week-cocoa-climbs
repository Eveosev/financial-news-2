Cotton rose to the highest in six
weeks on speculation that cold weather and rain will hamper
crops in the U.S., the world’s leading exporter. Coffee and
sugar also gained, while orange juice and cocoa declined.  In the next few days, temperatures will be colder than
normal across most of  Texas , the top cotton-growing state, with
readings reaching the high 30 degrees Fahrenheit in northern
areas, Joel Widenor, the director of agricultural services at
Bethesda, Maryland-based Commodity Weather Group, said in a
telephone interview. Rains this weekend in southeast states,
including  Georgia , the second-largest producer, will cause minor
harvest delays, according to the forecaster.  “We do have some weather concerns,”  Sharon Johnson , a
senior market specialist with KCG Futures in Roswell, Georgia,
said in a telephone interview. “Cool temperatures stunt the
growth of plants, cotton bolls won’t open, and that also halts
the maturity” process, she said.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 0.7 percent to settle
at 87.44 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after reaching 87.78 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 21.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery advanced 0.8
percent to $1.1535 a pound on ICE.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery added 0.1 percent to
18.52 cents a pound, the fourth straight advance.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery fell 1.3 percent
to $1.2585 a pound.  Cocoa futures for December delivery slumped 1.8 percent to
$2,585 a metric ton in  New York , the biggest loss since Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
