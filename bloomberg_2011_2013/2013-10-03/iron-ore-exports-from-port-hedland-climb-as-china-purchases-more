Iron ore  shipments from  Australia ’s
 Port Hedland , the world’s biggest bulk terminal, increased in
September as exports expanded to  China .  Cargoes totaled 28.96 million metric tons from 27.39
million tons in August and 19.89 million tons a year earlier,
 data  on the Port Hedland Port Authority’s website show.
Shipments to China, the largest buyer, were 22.97 million tons
from 22.26 million tons the previous month and 15.13 million
tons in September 2012.  Iron ore  entered a  bull market  in July as users in China
replenished stockpiles that shrank in March to the lowest level
since 2009. Morgan Stanley said in September that the commodity
will be supported into the first half of 2014 before a global
surplus emerges, while Citigroup Inc. and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  have
bearish short-term views as miners boost output.  Ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin was unchanged at $131.40 a dry ton yesterday,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices, which are 19 percent
above this year’s low of $110.40 on May 31, are down 9.3 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
