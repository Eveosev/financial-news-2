Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed the most in two
weeks, led by materials producers, amid speculation a
strengthening rupee will lure foreign investors.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest miner of the fuel,
gained the most in a week after reporting September sales that
beat its target. Iron-ore miner  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  soared 7.4
percent.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  gained the most in a
month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its recommendation
on the stock. The rupee strengthened 1.1 percent to 61.79 per
dollar, the highest level since Sept. 19.  The S&P BSE Sensex Index surged 2 percent to 19,902.07 at
the close in Mumbai, the biggest gain since Sept. 19. A stronger
rupee may lead to more portfolio inflows and foreign direct
investment, according to Centrum Wealth Management Ltd.  Infosys
Ltd. (INFO) , the nation’s second-largest software services provider,
will be the first Sensex company to report earnings for the
quarter ended September on Oct. 11.  “The rupee stabilizing at 62 is giving some comfort to
investors,” Chokkalingam G, chief investment officer at
Centrum, which oversees 1.4 billion rupees, said by phone today.
“Metal shares were beaten down and investors are seeing
value.”  The benchmark index has added 2.5 percent this year and
trades at 13.7 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with
the five-year average of 14.1 times. The Sensex’s 50-day
 volatility  index, a measure of price movements, increased to the
highest level since November 2011 today.  Earnings Season  The rupee gained today as U.S. lawmakers’ failure to
resolve a budget impasse that has shut down the government for
the past two days damped demand for the dollar. The currency has
rallied from a record low on Aug. 28 after  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Raghuram Rajan introduced measures to boost the
financial industry and support the currency, and the U.S.
Federal Reserve refrained from curtailing stimulus.  A 16 percent drop in the rupee in the past 12 months is
helping improve the competitiveness of Indian exports. The
nation’s shipments rose 13 percent in August from a year
earlier, the most since October 2001, while imports dropped 0.7
percent, government data showed Sept. 10. India’s $1.8 trillion
economy may grow 5.5 percent in the year to March 2014,
according to central bank estimates. Gross domestic product
expanded 5 percent in the previous 12 months, the weakest pace
since 2003.  Materials Stocks  Coal India increased 1.6 percent to 302.35 rupees, paring
this year’s loss to 15 percent. September sales were 35.8
million metric tons, compared with a target of 34.8 million
tons, the company said on Oct. 1.  Sesa Goa surged to 188.15 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the
biggest producer of the alloy, rose 3.7 percent to 285.85
rupees. The S&P BSE Metal index gained 3.9 percent, the most
since Aug. 22 and the best performer today among 13 sectoral
gauges tracked by BSE Ltd.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  jumped 5.8 percent to 1,104.70 rupees,
cutting this year’s loss to 19 percent.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the
country’s second-biggest lender, rose 3 percent to 937.85
rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the biggest lender by value, added 4
percent to 636.20 rupees. The Bankex Index gained 3.4 percent,
its largest advance since Sept. 19.  Tata Consultancy Services advanced 3.9 percent to 2,024.60
rupees. Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the stock to buy from
neutral on improved earnings prospects, the bank said in a
report dated yesterday, while  New York  City awarded the company
naming rights to its annual marathon. Infosys added 0.7 percent
to 3,037.15 rupees, the highest close since Sept. 12.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange soared 2.2
percent to 5,909.70. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
