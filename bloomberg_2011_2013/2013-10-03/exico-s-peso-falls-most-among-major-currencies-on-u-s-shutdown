Mexico ’s peso fell to the weakest
level in one month on concern a partial government shutdown in
the U.S. will slow growth of the Latin American nation’s biggest
export market.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 13.1586 per U.S. dollar
today in Mexico City, its weakest closing level since Sept. 6.
The currency extended its decline this year to 2.3 percent.  “Caution is prevailing due to a lack of developments on
the fiscal impasse in the U.S.,” Juan Carlos Alderete, a
strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB in Mexico City, wrote
today in an e-mailed research note. “We’re reiterating our
strongly defensive position on the peso.”  A one-week partial U.S. government shutdown would probably
shave 0.1 percentage point from economic growth, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with
the costs accelerating if the closing lasts longer. Mexico sends
about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor.  A face-to-face meeting between President  Barack Obama  and
congressional leaders yesterday failed to break the stalemate
over the budget that has led to the partial shutdown of the
government, which is entering a third day.  Yields on Mexican peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.96 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.36
centavo to 132.87 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
