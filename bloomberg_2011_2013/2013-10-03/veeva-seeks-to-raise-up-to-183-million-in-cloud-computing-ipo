Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV) , the maker of Web-based software for pharmaceutical sales, plans to raise as much
as $182.6 million in a U.S. initial public offering.  The company and existing shareholders are offering 13
million shares at $12 to $14 each, according to a regulatory
filing today. Pleasanton, California-based Veeva plans to list
on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VEEV.  The funds will help Veeva step up its challenge to  Oracle
Corp. (ORCL) , the world’s largest database-software maker, with tools
to help drugmakers promote treatments to doctors. It has already
won over many of the world’s top drugmakers with technology
tailored to the pharmaceutical industry, counting 33 of the 50
largest global pharmaceutical companies among its customers,
according to the filing.  Veeva posted sales of $92.4 million in the six months
through July, about 71 percent higher than they were a year
earlier, according to the filing. At the midpoint of the price
range, Veeva would be valued at about $1.59 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Veeva initially sought a valuation
of about $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said in
March.  Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG are leading Veeva’s
offering. The company filed for the IPO using a $150 million
placeholder amount last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
