The New England Patriots signed
former Indianapolis Colts receiver Austin Collie with four of
their wideouts limited this week by injuries. They also placed
defensive lineman Vince Wilfork on season-ending injured reserve
with a torn Achilles tendon.  Collie, 27, spent the past four National Football League
seasons with the Colts, though he was limited to one game in
2012 because of a ruptured patellar tendon. He was with the San
Francisco 49ers during training camp this year before being
released in the team’s final roster cuts.  The Patriots have been without Danny Amendola the past
three games because of a groin injury, while rookie receivers
Kenbrell Thompkins and Aaron Dobson were limited in practice
yesterday because of injuries suffered in last week’s win over
the Atlanta Falcons. Thompkins has a shoulder injury and Dobson
a neck injury, the Patriots said without being specific.  Collie was a fourth-round draft pick of the Colts in 2009
and over his first three NFL seasons caught 172 passes from
Peyton Manning for 1,839 yards and 16 touchdowns.  The 325-pound Wilfork, a five-time Pro Bowl selection and
one of the Patriots’ top run-stoppers on defense, was injured in
last week’s win.  “You just don’t replace Vince Wilfork,” Patriots coach
Bill Belichick said yesterday. “We’ll miss him, but whoever is
out there, those other 11 guys that are out there, we’re all
going to have to pull a little bit harder. It’s a big loss.”  The Patriots (4-0) this week visit the Cincinnati Bengals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
