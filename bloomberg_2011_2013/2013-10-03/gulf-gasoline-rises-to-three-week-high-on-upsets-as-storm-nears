Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened to a
three-week high amid upsets at the two largest U.S. refineries
and as a tropical storm formed in the  Gulf of Mexico ,
threatening to slow plant operations in the region.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  on the Gulf climbed 3.5
cents to 10.5 cents a gallon below  New York  Mercantile Exchange
futures at 2:30 p.m., the strongest level since Sept. 12.
Conventional gasoline blendstock,  known as CBOB , rose 2.88 cents
to a discount of 12.75 cents.  Differentials widened after a filing showed that  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  had a malfunction on a hydrocracker compressor at
the 584,000-barrel-a-day Baytown refinery in  Texas , which has
the second-highest crude processing capacity in the U.S. Motiva
Enterprises LLC reported an upset late yesterday at a vacuum
crude unit in its 600,000-barrel-a-day  Port Arthur , Texas,
refinery, the nation’s largest.  Tropical Storm Karen, which formed in the southeast Gulf of
Mexico, is expected to be at or near hurricane strength tomorrow
and could possibly disrupt operations on the coast. That may
cause a decline in  supplies  in the region, which a government
report showed gained 127,000 barrels to 79.5 million in the week
ended Sept. 27.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , climbed $1.73 to $8 a barrel, snapping a
four-day losing streak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The same spread based on  Light Louisiana Sweet oil , the Gulf
Coast benchmark, gained $1.48 to $4.50 a barrel.  Diesel Gains  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  added 0.25 cent to a discount of
5.13 cents a gallon on the Gulf Coast, the first rise in nine
days. The same fuel in New York Harbor added 0.52 cent to 0.9
cent a gallon above Nymex futures.  Reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, in New York
added 0.25 cent to 1.63 cents a gallon over gasoline futures.  Planned maintenance is underway at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s 238,000-barrel-a-day  Bayway refinery  in Linden,  New Jersey , the plant
closest to the New York Harbor trading hub.  To contact the reporter on this story:
