Law firms and insurance companies may
be among former clients of private detectives who used illegal
methods to collect information that face a probe by the U.K.’s
data protection watchdog.  The Information Commissioner’s Office will examine 19
clients of four private investigators that were jailed last year
for using illegal data-gathering methods, such as phone-hacking,
according to Keith Vaz, the office of Parliament’s Home Affairs
Committee. Vaz said Christopher Graham, the information
commissioner, will give the committee more details on Oct. 8.  “There are 19 clients that will now be investigated with
another 11 awaiting further information,” Vaz said in an e-mailed statement. “We will seek assurances that the onward
investigation will be conducted in the most efficient,
comprehensive and speedy manner.”  The U.K.’s Serious Organised Crime Agency gave the
committee a list of clients, asking it not to publish the names
for fear of prejudicing future investigations. The list included
22 law firms, as well as 10 insurance companies, an  oil company 
and eight companies in financial services.  Out of 98 names on the list, eight were investigated in the
crime agency’s probe of hacking into mobile phone accounts and
blagging, or the use of deception to obtain private details, Vaz
said. There is no case against 24 and another 24 are based
outside the U.K., he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
