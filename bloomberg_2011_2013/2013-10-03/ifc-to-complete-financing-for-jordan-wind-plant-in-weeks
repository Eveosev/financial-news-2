International Finance Corp., the
World Bank’s investment arm, expects to complete financing for a
$300 million wind-power plant in  Jordan  in the coming weeks,
allowing construction to start before the end of the year.  IFC will contribute about $70 million to the 115-megawatt
project, Adil Marghub, the lender’s head of infrastructure and
energy for Middle East and North Africa, said today. It also has
helped raise a further $150 million through other institutions.  Jordan plans to boost renewables capacity to meet
electricity demand and curb imports of fossil fuels. The World
Bank has stepped up its funding of clean-energy projects while
scaling back support for coal-fired power to help nations
mitigate the effects of climate change.  Partners in the Jordanian wind venture, known as Tafila,
include investment vehicle InfraMed and Abu Dhabi’s Masdar. IFC
also expects to fund a photovoltaic project in the country next
year and may finance as many as five of the 12 mini-solar plants
slated for development there, according to Marghub.  IFC plans to invest as much as $300 million in renewables
in the Middle East and North Africa this year and at least $200
million next year, including funding for a concentrated-solar
plant in  Morocco , Marghub told reporters in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
