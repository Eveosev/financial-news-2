Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s
second-largest airline, said losses at the Germanwings discount
unit will shrink this year while costs for upgrading cabins and
lounges will top 500 million euros ($682 million) through 2015.  The operating loss at Germanwings will be cut by 90 million
euros as the unit starts to take over short-haul routes outside
Lufthansa’s Frankfurt and Munich hubs, according to a website
posting. The unit aims to break even by 2015, while the wider
short-haul business, including Germanwings and flights feeding
long-haul routes, should show a first profit in 5 years in 2013.  Eliminating losses in European point-to-point traffic is
among the most important tasks of the so-called Score program
that seeks to lift Lufthansa’s operating profit to 2.3 billion
euros by 2015. The company has ordered planes worth 23 billion
euros at list prices this year in order to regain ground lost to
low-cost and Gulf carriers that operate younger fleets.  Project costs, which include installing new business class
seats on long-haul planes, upgrading lounges and introducing a
premium-economy service next year, will amount to 120 million
euros this year and about 300 million euros next, before
declining to below 100 million euros in 2015, Lufthansa said.  Fleet Plans  Lufthansa was trading 2.6 percent higher at 14.49 euros as
of 3:55 p.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing the Cologne-based carrier at
6.66 billion euros. The shares have gained 1.7 percent this
year, lagging behind the Bloomberg World Airlines Index’s 17
percent return.  Air France-KLM Group (AF) , Europe’s biggest airline
by traffic, is up 7.7 percent and British Airways parent  IAG SA (IAG) ,
the No. 3, has surged 85 percent.  At Lufthansa’s mainline business, capacity, the number of
seats times the distance flown, will rise about 1 percent this
year and jump 5 percent next as the company adds bigger planes
and scraps its first class offering on some jets. Capacity will
rise 4 percent in 2015 and about 3 percent in 2016, it said.  While Lufthansa’s fleet won’t grow beyond 400 planes
through 2016, seat growth will come from using larger planes,
eliminating first-class from part of the long-haul fleet and
flying longer legs,  Carsten Spohr , who heads the passenger
airline unit, said at an analyst briefing in  London . Previous
capacity plans had called for as many as 480 aircraft, he said.  A380s, 747s  Planes without a first-class service will operate to
Bangkok and destinations in  Canada ,  India  and Africa, while
Lufthansa will use incoming Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos to fly
to Miami and Shanghai and employ Boeing Co. 747-8s on routes
including Mexico City and Sao Paolo, the executive said.  Spohr, a trained pilot and potential successor to Chief
Executive Officer Christoph Franz, who last month announced his
planned departure, said Lufthansa is discussing commercial
cooperation with  Air China Ltd. (601111)  and may deepen a venture with
Japan’s  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202)  amid strong competition on Asia trips.  Germanwings expects demand to rise by 5 percent this year,
while the  load factor , a measure of occupancy, should improve by
2.9 percentage points and the yield by 4.5 percent, Thomas Winkelmann, who heads the unit, said today.  While Germanwings will also use  Bombardier Inc. (BOMB) ’s CRJ900
regional jets through 2015, the goal is to make the low-cost
unit an all-Airbus operator, Spohr said, without disclosing when
the CRJ’s might go.  To contact the reporter on this story:
