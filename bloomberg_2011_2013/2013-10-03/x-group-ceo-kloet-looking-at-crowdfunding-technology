TMX Group Ltd. (X) , owner of  Canada ’s
largest stock exchange, is investigating the “potentially game-changing” use of crowdfunding as a source of capital markets
investment, Chief Executive Officer Tom Kloet said.  “It’s an interesting development that’s becoming more and
more real,” Kloet said, after speaking at the Investment
Industry Association of Canada annual  conference  in Toronto
today. “We’re watching it.”  In crowdfunding, entrepreneurs go online and seek cash from
the general public to help fund projects, including potential
products or even art.  Kloet declined to say if Toronto-based TMX Group was
considering building its own version of the technology or if it
was looking at an acquisition.  “We haven’t formed a view yet. We’re looking at it and
trying to understand what it means and do investors understand
what they’re getting into when they go through the crowdfunding
format,” he said. “Things like that will test the boundaries
of investor protection versus the need to efficiently let people
get capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
