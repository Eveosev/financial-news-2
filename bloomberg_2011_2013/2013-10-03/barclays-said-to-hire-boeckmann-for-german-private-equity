Barclays Plc (BARC)  hired  Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604) ’s Ulrich Boeckmann to head relations with  private-equity 
firms operating in German-speaking territories in Europe,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Boeckmann becomes managing director at the investment
banking division in Frankfurt and will develop business with
clients in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the information is
private.  London-based spokesmen for Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank, and Nomura declined to comment. Boeckmann did not
immediately respond to e-mailed requests seeking comment.  Boeckmann performed the same job at Nomura alongside
responsibilities for consumer and retail companies in Germany
and Austria. He joined Nomura after it acquired the European
operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008.
He started at Lehman in 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
