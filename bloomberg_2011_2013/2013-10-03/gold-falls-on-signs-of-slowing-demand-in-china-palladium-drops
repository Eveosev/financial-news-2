Gold futures fell for the third time
in four days on signs that demand is ebbing in  China , the
world’s second-largest buyer.  The premium for the metal on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
over international prices dropped to less than $10 an ounce at
the end of September from more than $40 in July, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. Yesterday, futures touched $1,276.90, the
lowest in eight weeks.  “We are not seeing any demand come in from China even at
these levels, indicating that people expect it to fall
further,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The mood in the market
remains bearish.”  Gold futures for December delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,317.60 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the metal dropped as much as 1.4 percent. Trading
was 24 percent below the average in the past 100 days for this
time, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prices have dropped 21 percent this year as U.S. equities
rose to a record and inflation remained low, eroding demand for
a store of value.  China’s markets have been closed since Oct. 1 for national
holidays. They open on Oct. 8. India’s is the biggest gold
buyer.  Yesterday, futures jumped 2.7 percent on speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will delay reducing the pace of $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases because the U.S. government shutdown
may damp the economy.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$21.786 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slipped 1.4 percent to $1,373.30 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery slumped 2.9 percent
to $700.20 an ounce, the biggest drop since June 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
