France ’s  economic output  will rebound
for the first time this year to the level before the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., national statistics
office Insee said.  After expanding 0.5 percent in the second quarter,  gross
domestic product  will probably be unchanged in the July-to-September period before rising 0.4 percent in the year’s last
three months, the national statistics office said in its latest
forecast. For 2013, Insee predicts growth of 0.2 percent.  Consumer spending and exports are helping revive Europe’s
second-largest economy after two years of stagnation, and growth
will probably get a boost from investment in the final three
months of this year, according to the forecast. While that makes
France the second major European economy with  Germany  to return
to its pre-crisis peak, the recovery remains fragile.  “The sky continues to clear but the clouds are still
present,” Cedric Audenis, Insee’s chief forecaster, told
journalists. “At this stage we’ve had one good quarter, the
second quarter, and the data for the third isn’t great.”  The drop in non-government payrolls will slow in coming
months and the  unemployment rate  will peak at 11 percent in the
fourth quarter, Insee predicted.  Investment spending by companies will increase 0.3 percent
in the final three months of the year, the first time it has
grown since the fourth quarter of 2011, according to the
forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
