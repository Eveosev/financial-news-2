Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  don’t
infringe a patent owned by SmartMetric Inc., a company that had
sought as much as $13.4 billion for alleged use of its
technology in “smart” debit and credit cards.  U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in  Los Angeles ,
in a written ruling yesterday, affirmed his earlier tentative
decision from a Sept. 25 hearing.  “The parties here are comparing apples and oranges,” the
judge said in the written ruling. “The piecemeal similarities
that SmartMetric has identified in support of its claims do not
change the fact that claims 1 and 14 of the ’464 patent are
simply not practiced by defendants, and no reasonable jury could
conclude otherwise.”  SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S.  The EMV cards, which are already used in  Europe , include a
microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
Patrick Bright, the company’s lawyer, said at the Sept. 25
hearing.  SmartMetric said in a statement today it will appeal the
non-infringement ruling.  SmartMetric fell 4 cents, or 20 percent, to 16 cents, today
in over-the-counter trading.  The case is  SmartMetric Inc. (SMME)  v. MasterCard International
Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of
 California  (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
