A little more than two decades after it began to open its economy in 1991, India still counts as an emerging market. There's still plenty of room for growth in product categories from alcohol to mobile phones, as a consumer revolution takes hold among a middle class that is expanding rapidly.  Take two-wheelers, for instance. Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers show that sales of two-wheelers in India rose an  astonishing 85 percent  between 2007-2008 and 2011-2012, to 13.4 million units a year.  The two-wheeler market was one of the drivers of India's consistent double-digit growth, reflecting exploding demand for fuel-efficient transport in rural areas -- where public transport is often poor or nonexistent -- and from specific segments of the urban population such as students, office workers and working women. (Much of the advertising for scooters is directed at the last category, such as a commercial featuring the Bollywood film-star Priyanka Chopra with the tagline, "Why should boys have all the fun?") The market for two-wheelers in India, though,  may have peaked earlier  than most others. Demand rose just 2.9 percent in the last financial year, even though a host of multinational companies, including the Japanese brands Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha, have recently entered the Indian market to compete with the big domestic brands owned by the market leaders,  Hero MotoCorp Ltd.  and  Bajaj Auto Ltd.  (as well as other significant players such as  TVS Motors  and  Mahindra Two Wheelers ) .  The phase of exceptionally high growth is probably over, with the two-wheeler market having come close to its maximum penetration level in a slowing economy. But that might not be not such a bad thing. After surviving years of ferocious competition domestically, and swiftly leading an undeveloped market into a state of maturity, Indian two-wheeler manufacturers have begun to take a  more global view . As demand at home cools, the Splendors, Boxers, Passions and Scootys are increasingly turning up on other continents. The next phase of expansion for Indian two-wheeler companies will probably be built on exports to other emerging markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This week, in the business newspaper Mint, Shally Seth Mohile took stock of these trends in a report titled " Two-wheeler firms eye Africa, Latin America ":  The story of Hero MotoCorp might be seen as a sign of the increased willingness of the Indian automobile industry to think globally, a stark contrast to the protectionism habitually sought by Indian industry in the decades after independence.  In December 2010, the company  pulled the plug  on Hero Honda, its 26-year-old joint venture with Honda Motor Co.,  buying out  the Japanese auto giant in India, a transaction valued at close to $2 billion. Part of its reason for doing so was that it was limited by the terms of the joint venture to exporting two-wheelers only to those markets where Honda wasn't already present.  Three years later, Hero remains the leading player in India's two-wheeler market (even as its former partner, Honda, has set up its own operations in India and risen quickly to beat out  Bajaj Auto  for second position). But it has a lot of catching up to do overseas. In the years that Hero Honda had remained restricted to South Asia, Bajaj had made  significant progress  in reaching out to emerging markets elsewhere. It is now the market leader in  Nigeria , has a significant presence in many markets in Latin America, and exports make up almost  35 percent  of its revenue from motorcycle sales (it also makes three-wheelers). Eventually, the company expects sales from exports to surpass domestic revenue.  Earlier this year, Hero  announced  ambitious plans to expand the company's presence to more than 50 countries by the end of the decade and keep pace around the world with Bajaj. The company, which currently exports about  200,000 two-wheelers  annually (Bajaj, by comparison, sells more than 1 million) said that it would soon be selling two-wheelers in Kenya, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Peru, and that it planned to set up a manufacturing unit in Colombia. In a  2011 profile  of the company's chief executive officer, Pawan Munjal, Samar Srivastava wrote of the company's plans to make up for lost time in the global market: Mahindra Two Wheelers  announced last month  that it was going to make three models available in Latin America with the aim of doubling exports to 20 percent of overall sales. Cumulatively, these developments signal a global ambition on the part of one of the few manufacturing sectors in India that can hope to hold its own against Chinese goods.
