Henry Paulson , who was secretary of
the Treasury Department under Republican President  George W. Bush , said some members of the party have been shameless in
fueling a stalemate over the U.S. budget.  “We’re seeing certain segments tap into a very
disaffected, angry segment of the population, who are angry and
disaffected for some very, very legitimate reasons,” Paulson
said today on CNBC. “But what they’re doing is shamelessly
telling these people exactly what they want to hear, which has
them tilting at windmills and focusing on the wrong solutions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
