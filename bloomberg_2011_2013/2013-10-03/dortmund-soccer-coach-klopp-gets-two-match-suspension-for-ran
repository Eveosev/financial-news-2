Borussia Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp
was suspended for two games by European soccer’s disciplinary
body for a sideline rant against officials during his team’s
 Champions League  loss to Napoli last month.  Klopp served the first match of the ban during his team’s
3-0 victory over Marseille two days ago. He’ll miss Dortmund’s
next European game at Arsenal in  London  on Oct. 22.  Governing body UEFA banned Klopp for one match, and the
disciplinary panel added another game today after reviewing the
Sept. 18 incident in Napoli. The coach shouted at the fourth
official, Portugal’s Venancio Tome, following a Napoli goal
scored when Dortmund defender Neven Subotic was waiting to
return to the field. Klopp was sent to the stands and Dortmund
went on to lose 2-1, hampered by a red card to goalkeeper Roman
Weidenfeller just before halftime.  “It is necessary to safeguard and respect the role of the
referee and the referee team during  UEFA  competition matches,”
 UEFA said  in the statement.  Klopp guided Dortmund to two Bundesliga titles since
taking over as manager in 2008. He also led the team to last
season’s Champions League final where it lost to  Bayern Munich .  To contact the reporter on this story:
