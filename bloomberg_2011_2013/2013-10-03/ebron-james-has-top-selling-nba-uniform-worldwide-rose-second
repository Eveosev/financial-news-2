LeBron James of the Miami Heat had
the most popular National Basketball Association uniform
worldwide and in the U.S. last season, while  Derrick Rose  of the
Chicago Bulls was No. 1 in China, Europe and Latin America.  The NBA released its list of top-selling jerseys today, two
days before the league tips off its Global Games with the
Oklahoma City Thunder visiting Istanbul for an exhibition
contest. There will be eight preseason and two regular-season
games featuring 12 NBA teams in seven countries in 2013-14.  James, 28, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, also had
the top-selling jersey last season in the Philippines. Rose, 24,
a former MVP, was second worldwide and in the U.S. to James.  Kobe Bryant  of the Los Angeles Lakers was third worldwide
in jersey sales, followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder’s  Kevin Durant , Miami’s Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony of the New York
Knicks.  The rankings are based on global sales by Adidas, the
league’s official uniform and apparel provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
