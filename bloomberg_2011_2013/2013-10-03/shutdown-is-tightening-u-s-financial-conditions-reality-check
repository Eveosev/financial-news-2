Financial conditions tightened after
the first face-to-face talks between President  Barack Obama  and
congressional leaders failed to break the budget logjam as a
partial U.S. government shutdown entered its third day.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  fell to 1.23,
the lowest since Sept. 3. The gauge, which is up from 0.31 at
the end of 2012, measures stress in the markets by combining
everything from money-market rates to yields on government and
corporate bonds to volatility in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, it fell as low as negative 1.631.  President Barack Obama urged House Speaker John Boehner to
hold a vote on funding federal operations without strings
attached, saying the Republican leader’s refusal to do so is the
only thing standing in the way of reopening of the U.S.
government. Obama also said today that if Republicans hold up
raising the federal debt ceiling to press their demands it would
cause “dramatically worse” consequences for the U.S. economy.  “It’s a very difficult investing environment with no
resolution from  Washington , and a lack of fundamental economic
data to go on,” said Christopher Sullivan, who oversees $2.2
billion as chief investment officer at United Nations Federal
Credit Union in New York. “Investors are increasingly staying
on the sidelines and looking for safety, and the longer this
thing gets drawn out, the more uncertainty we will have to
contend with.”  The government’s first partial shutdown since 1996 may cost
the U.S. at least $300 million a day in lost economic output at
the start, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS)  Though that’s a fraction of the
country’s $15.7 trillion economy, the effects may grow over time
as consumers and businesses defer purchases and expansion plans.  Treasuries  The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.6 percent at 5

yield is down from the high this year of 3 percent on Sept. 6
and compares with the average of 3.52 percent during the past
decade.  Rates on Treasury bills that mature Oct. 24 rose to 0.13
percent after touching negative 0.01 percent on Sept. 27. Two
years ago, one-month bills climbed to a 29-month high of 0.18
percent as the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by Treasury to avoid a
default approached.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, rose 0.44 basis point to 14.25 basis points.
