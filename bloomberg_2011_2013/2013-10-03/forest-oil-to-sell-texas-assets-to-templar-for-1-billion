Forest Oil Corp. (FST)  agreed to sell oil
and natural gas assets in the Texas Panhandle to a business
backed by private-equity firm First Reserve Corp. for $1 billion
-- more than the selling company’s total market value.  The sale to Templar Energy LLC includes the equivalent of
517 billion cubic feet of gas in reserves and daily production
of about 100 million cubic feet, Forest Oil said in a statement
today. The company announced in July it was seeking a buyer for
the assets after receiving unsolicited offers. The assets
produce 50 percent gas, 30 percent natural gas liquids and 20
percent oil, Chief Executive Officer Patrick R. McDonald said in
August.  Forest Oil, a Denver-based energy company founded 97 years
ago, had a market value of $762.5 million at the close today.
The shares  rose 6.3 percent  to $6.75 at 4:59 p.m. in  New York .  The transaction “will allow us to significantly reduce
long-term debt and greatly enhance our financial flexibility and
liquidity,” McDonald said in the statement. McDonald has said
sale of the Panhandle assets would let the company focus on
holdings in the Eagle Ford, Permian and Ark-La-Tex regions.  The deal is expected to close by Nov. 25 with an Oct. 1
effective date, Forest Oil said in a statement today. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. advised the company on the sale.  Templar Energy is an exploration and production company
based in  Oklahoma City  that First Reserve invested in last
December, according to the firm’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
