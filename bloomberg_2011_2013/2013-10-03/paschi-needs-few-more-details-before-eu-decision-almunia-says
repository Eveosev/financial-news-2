Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,
the bailed-out bank embroiled in a fraud probe, should soon get
a decision from European Union regulators about state aid the
lender needs for a restructuring.  “Talks with the Italian authorities were slowed by the
political situation, which was clarified yesterday,” EU
competition commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  told reporters in
Vilnius today. Only a few details remain to be agreed and once
the proposal is ready “we’ll be able to move very quickly,
because everything has already been discussed.”  The EU resisted Italy’s original bailout blueprint and
insisted in recent months on changes. In a July letter sent to
Italian Finance Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni, the regulator
recommended executive pay caps, lower costs and cutting Italian
sovereign-debt holdings and trading activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
