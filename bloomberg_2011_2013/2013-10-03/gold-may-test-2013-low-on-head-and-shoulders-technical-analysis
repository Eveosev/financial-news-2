Gold futures may test this year’s low
in coming weeks as prices on charts form a head-and-shoulders
pattern that signals more selling, according to Hiroyuki Kikukawa of Nihon Unicom Inc.  The most-active  contract  on the Comex in  New York  fell to
$1,276.90 an ounce on Oct. 2, testing support at the August low
of $1,271.80 and the upward trend that began in July, said
Kikukawa, the general manager of research at the Tokyo-based
brokerage. Futures traded at $1,316.60 at 8:40 a.m. in  Tokyo .  “The $1,300 level will be an important point in coming
days to set the market direction,” Kikukawa said. “Any move
below the August level will confirm the downtrend toward this
year’s low of $1,179.40 an ounce on June 28.”  Gold futures have lost 21 percent this year, heading for
the first annual drop in 13 years, as some investors lost faith
in the metal eroding its appeal as a store of value and as
concern increased that the U.S. Federal Reserve would pare
stimulus as the economy improved.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A head-and-shoulders pattern
occurs when a price forms three consecutive peaks or valleys,
the middle being the largest, and indicates a high possibility
of a trend reversal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
