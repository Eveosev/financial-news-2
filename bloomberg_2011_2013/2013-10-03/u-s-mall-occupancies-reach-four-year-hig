U.S. regional mall  occupancies 
climbed to the highest level in more than four years, led by
properties owned by real estate investment  trusts , as smaller
retail centers recover at a slower pace.  The vacancy rate at malls, which typically include
department stores and are larger than neighborhood and community
shopping centers, fell to 8.2 percent in the third quarter from
8.7 percent a year earlier,  Reis Inc. (REIS)  said in a report. Asking
rents rose to an average of $39.77 a square foot from $39.24,
the New York-based research firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
