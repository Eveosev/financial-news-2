Soybean futures rose for the fifth
session in six on the South African Futures Exchange.  Soybeans for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 1.8 percent to 5,556 rand ($553) a metric ton,
the most since Sept. 27 by the close in Johannesburg.  White corn for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to
2,372 rand a ton, while the yellow variety for delivery in the
same month, rose 0.1 percent to 2,158.20 rand a ton.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
also called maize. A meal made from white corn is one of South
Africa’s staple foods and the yellow variety is mostly fed to
animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
