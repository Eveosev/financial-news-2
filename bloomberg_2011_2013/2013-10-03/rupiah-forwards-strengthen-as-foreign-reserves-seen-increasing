Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards
strengthened amid speculation the central bank will report a
second monthly increase in the foreign reserves.  Government
bonds  advanced, pushing the 10-year yield to a one-week low.  Indonesia’s  holdings  of overseas currencies probably rose
in September by between $1 billion and $3 billion, according to
a forecast by PT Mandiri Sekuritas. The figures will be released
no later than Oct. 7. The reserves dropped 18 percent this year
as the central bank intervened to stem a 16 percent slide in the
rupiah. The nation’s  trade balance  swung into surplus for the
first time in five months in August and inflation slowed in
September, official data showed this week.  “The series of positive news will reduce negative
sentiment on the rupiah and see it stabilize and start to
strengthen,” said Leo Rinaldy, an economist at Mandiri
Sekuritas in Jakarta. “The trade balance and inflation have
improved while foreign reserves probably rose, which is a
leading indicator for September’s trade conditions.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards rallied 0.9
percent to 11,396 per dollar as of 4:23 p.m. in Jakarta. The
contracts touched 11,359, the strongest level since Sept. 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts are 1.1
percent stronger than the spot rate, which was little changed at
11,528 per dollar, prices from local banks show.  Weaker Dollar  Asian currencies rose today as the Bloomberg  Dollar Index ,
which tracks the greenback against a basket of 10 leading global
currencies, touched a two-week low. The U.S. government remained
in partial shutdown, spurring speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will hold off from scaling back monetary stimulus that has
fueled demand for emerging-market assets.  A daily fixing used to settle the rupiah forwards was set
at 11,281 per dollar today, from 11,371 yesterday, according to
the Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, fell 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage
point, to 16 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 dropped two
basis points to 8.15 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 25,
according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
