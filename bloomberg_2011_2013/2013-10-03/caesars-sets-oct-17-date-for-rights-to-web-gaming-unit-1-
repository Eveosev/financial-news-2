Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR)  set Oct.
17 as the record date for rights to participate in a planned
$1.18 billion stock sale that will include an interest in its
online gambling business.  Investors as of that date will get the right to buy one
share of Caesars Acquisition Co. for each share of the parent
company they own, the Las Vegas-based casino owner said today in
a  regulatory filing .  The new company will be part owner, with Caesars, of a
business dubbed Caesars Growth Partners that will be home to the
companyâ€™s interactive gaming and two casinos. The parent
company, which carries more than $23 billion in debt after a
2008 leveraged buyout, seeks to raise the money for projects
such as online gaming and new casinos.  In the past week, the company, the largest owner of casinos
in the U.S., refinanced $4.9 billion in mortgage-backed
securities and other debt, while raising $200 million in a stock
offering.  Caesars, controlled by TPG Capital and  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO) , was little changed at $20.67 in  New York . The
stock has almost tripled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
