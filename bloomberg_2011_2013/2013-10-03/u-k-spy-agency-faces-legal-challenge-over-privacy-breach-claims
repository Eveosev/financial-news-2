GCHQ, the U.K. government’s
intelligence and cybersecurity arm, faces a claim in the
 European Court of Human Rights  from three British campaign
groups over the alleged breach of privacy of millions of
citizens.  Big Brother Watch, the Open Rights Group, English PEN and
German Internet activist Constanze Kurz announced the challenge
to the Strasbourg-based court today. They allege the amount of
data, such as e-mails, the U.K. spy agency has collected is
illegal.  U.S. and U.K. authorities have come under intense pressure
over their surveillance policies since journalist Glenn
Greenwald obtained secret documents from a fugitive security
analyst in May. Edward Snowden, who was contracted to work for
the National Security Agency, leaked documents revealing the
extent to which the NSA used phone and Internet data to monitor
U.S. citizens. Snowden has been granted asylum in  Russia .  “The laws governing how Internet data is accessed were
written when barely anyone had broadband access and were
intended to cover old fashioned copper telephone lines,” Nick
Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said in an e-mailed
statement. “Parliament did not envisage or intend those laws to
permit scooping up details of every communication we send.”  The U.K. Foreign Office didn’t immediately respond to a
request for comment on the case at the  human-rights  court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
