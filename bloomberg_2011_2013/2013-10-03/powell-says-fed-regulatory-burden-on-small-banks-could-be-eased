Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said the central bank should consider steps to reduce the
regulatory burden on community banks.  The Fed will “consider whether modifications to rules, or
the ways in which we implement them, could achieve our safety
and soundness aims with a lesser burden on this class of
 depository institutions ,” Powell said in a speech at the
Federal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis . He didn’t comment on the
outlook for monetary policy or the economy in his prepared
remarks.  The central bank is working to implement the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, aimed at repeating the financial crisis that led to
the collapse of several of the country’s largest financial
institutions. Smaller U.S. banks have said their behavior did
not lead to the financial crisis and these regulatory changes
put them at a disadvantage because they lack the resources to
meet the tougher rules.  “The Dodd-Frank Act has spawned a variety of new
regulatory initiatives that add to the already-substantial
regulatory burden faced by community banks,” Powell said.  Powell spoke at the St. Louis Fed’s conference on
“Community Banking in the 21st Century,” a research and policy
conference for bankers, regulators and academics.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking at the same
conference yesterday, said community banks face big challenges
including slow economic growth and compliance with stiffer
regulation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
