Credit-default swaps on U.S.
Treasuries jumped by the most since November 2009 as the
government remained partially shut for a third day.  Swaps rose as much as 11.5 basis points to 44 basis points,
the highest since Jan. 24, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a four-year low of 21 basis points
last month and a peak of 65 basis points in 2011, the last time
Congress played brinkmanship over the nation’s debt limit.  “The market is alerted rather than alarmed,” said  Richard McGuire , an analyst at Rabobank International in  London . “Given
where CDS levels are, it’s possibly not yet pricing in a serious
likelihood they will go over the brink. The longer this
continues, the greater the likelihood that even the unthinkable
will have to be thought.”  Lawmakers have to agree to raise the $16.7 trillion debt
ceiling by Oct. 17 so the nation can continue to meet its
commitments. President  Barack Obama  and congressional leaders
have failed to break a budget impasse, triggering the first
government shutdown in 17 years.  Swaps on Treasuries were the 15th most traded of 1,000
entities tracked by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. in the
week through Sept. 27, up from 147th the previous period.  There were 56 trades covering a gross $2.1 billion of
Treasuries, compared with 10 trades covering $290 million the
previous week, according to DTCC, which runs a central registry
for the market.  The amount of Treasuries protected also increased, DTCC
data show. There are now 886 contracts covering a net $3.4
billion of debt outstanding, the most since March and up from an
almost three-year low of $3.1 billion on Sept. 20. The 8 percent
increase is the biggest since June 2011.  That compares with $13.1 billion of protection on German
bunds and $16.9 billion on Italy’s debt.  “Complacency has clearly been shaken now to some degree,”
said McGuire. “The system lends itself to eleventh-hour
negotiations and stop-gap solutions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
