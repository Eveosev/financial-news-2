The European Union is continuing to
draft a formal complaint against  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  after the bloc’s
competition commissioner said he hasn’t received a settlement
offer to resolve the antitrust probe.  “It would be premature to anticipate when the next steps
might be taken, but we have now moved to the phase of preparing
a statement of objections,” Joaquin Almunia, the EU’s antitrust
chief, said in a speech in Vilnius.  For the EU to hold back from sending a complaint, a company
under investigation needs to make an offer addressing any
competition concerns, Almunia told reporters before the speech.
“So far, I haven’t received any proposals from Gazprom.”  Russia’s state-owned natural gas export monopoly is 
suspected of abusing its dominant market power to impose unfair 
prices in central and eastern Europe by linking what it charges 
for long-term natural gas contracts to oil prices and of 
preventing gas from being traded between countries, the EU said 
when it started the probe last September.  “We’d like the European Commission to stop PRing itself
and start working with the documents, and we would respond to
real claims rather than statements through the media,” 
 Sergei Kupriyanov , a spokesman for Moscow-based Gazprom, said 
today by phone.  Almunia said last month that he plans to present a
statement of objections without specifying any timeline.  The commission plans to complete its Gazprom probe in the
spring of 2014, Dalia Grybauskaite,  Lithuania ’s president, said
in an e-mailed statement after a meeting with Almunia today.  “We are dealing with the complaint by Lithuania, which was
filed after our preliminary probe had started, but the
geographic scope of our investigation is wider, encompassing the
other Baltic states,  Poland , the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
 Hungary  and  Bulgaria ,” Almunia said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
