The show will go on at Carnegie Hall.  Striking stagehands will return to work tonight for a
performance of the  American Symphony Orchestra  as contract talks
continue, said Carnegie Hall spokesman Matt Carlson.  Carnegie Hall canceled its opening-night concert yesterday
after a strike was called by Local One of the International
Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The dispute is about
whether stagehands’ work guarantees extend to a new, upstairs
education wing.  With benefits and overtime, the five full-time stagehands
Carnegie Hall employs earned an average of $420,000 in 2011 from
working its three stages, according to the venue’s tax return.  The American Symphony Orchestra performs a program that
includes Aaron Copland’s “Symphony for Organ and Orchestra”
and will be conducted by Leon Botstein, the president of Bard
College.  Muse highlights include  Rich Jaroslovsky  on  tech  and Jason
Harper on  cars .  To contact the reporter on this story:
