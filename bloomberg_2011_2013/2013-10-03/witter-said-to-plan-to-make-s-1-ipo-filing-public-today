Twitter Inc., the microblogging website with more than 200 million active users, plans to make its S-1 regulatory filing for its initial offering public today, said people with knowledge of the process.  The people asked not to be named because the information is private.  Gabriel Stricker , a spokesman for San Francisco-based Twitter, didnâ€™t immediately respond to a request for comment.
