Rexel SA (RXL)  Chief Executive Officer  Rudy Provoost  said French government measures announced last month to
boost home insulation and heating renovation are insufficient
because they don’t promote “active” energy savings systems.  “Value-added tax cuts on heating and thermal renovation
are limited to a passive approach in which the building is
treated as an envelope,” Provoost told journalists at the
company’s headquarters in Paris today. “It’s not going far
enough,” he said, adding that government policies shouldn’t be
restricted to residential housing and renovation works.  The CEO of the world’s largest listed distributor of
electrical equipment, who was presenting his book “Energy
3.0,” also urged makers of home and building controls to
develop low-cost systems rather than mainly focus on high-end
products.  The French government last week said it will apply a value-added tax of 5 percent instead of 10 percent on home insulation
and heating renovation works from 2014 as rising energy bills
dent households’ purchasing power. The measure may underpin
demand for insulation products made by companies such as  Cie. de
Saint-Gobain SA , while providing little help for makers of home
automation systems such as for controlling air-conditioners and
heating units, including  Schneider Electric SA (SU)  and  Legrand SA. (LR)   Provoost also said a lack of coherence in renewable energy
subsidies have created artificial markets in countries such as
 Germany .  “A lot of countries tend to launch plans, and stop them
after two or three years,” the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
