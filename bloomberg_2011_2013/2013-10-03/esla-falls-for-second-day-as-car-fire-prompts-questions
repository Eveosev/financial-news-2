Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  fell for a second
day after an Oct. 1 fire in one of its vehicles raised questions
about the car’s safety, prompting the electric-car maker to
issue a statement citing a collision as the cause.  Tesla slid 4.2 percent to $173.31 at the close in  New York ,
the lowest since Sept. 18. The shares tumbled 6.2 percent
yesterday after a picture of a Model S on fire in  Washington 
state was published by the Jalopnik website.  The decline, totaling 10 percent over two days, reflects
concerns that the incident may tarnish the automaker, which has
a stock-market valuation of more than $21 billion. Shares of the
company led by Chief Executive Officer  Elon Musk , have soared
fivefold this year as the electric-car maker posted its first
quarterly profit and started expanding to  Europe  and  Asia .  “Although this incident will likely weigh on near-term
sentiment, we do not expect this to derail near-term Model S
orders and delivery momentum,” Craig Irwin, an analyst in New
York for Wedbush Securities, wrote in an investor note today.  Model S buyers are likely to “understand the risks of a
lithium fire and likely calibrate this recent event as of
relatively minor importance,” wrote Irwin, who  rates  the shares
neutral, the equivalent of hold.  The Model S “collided with a large metallic object in the
middle of the road, causing significant damage to the vehicle,”
 Palo Alto , California-based Tesla said in an e-mailed statement.
The driver exited the vehicle safely and called authorities. A
fire caused by damage sustained in the crash was contained,
Tesla said.  Smelled Something  Debris that may be related to the Kent, Washington,
collision was collected by the state’s Transportation
Department, the Washington State Patrol said yesterday in a
statement. The collision report should be available in a few
days, the agency said.  “The driver stated that he began to smell something
burning and a short time later the vehicle caught on fire,”
according to the State Patrol statement. An emergency crew had
to make “several attempts to extinguish the flames as it kept
reigniting,” according to the statement.  Flames also burned in the car’s battery pack, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing comments made by firefighters
in a copy of an incident report the news service said it
obtained under state public records laws.  Government Shutdown  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
normally sends teams of investigators to high-profile or unusual
vehicle crashes. The agency investigated the causes of fires in
a plug-in  General Motors Co. (GM)  Chevrolet Volt and in Fisker
Automotive Inc. Karma sedans. Both of those investigations led
to recalls.  The regulator’s employees who conduct such investigations
are furloughed because of the U.S. government shutdown and the
agency is prohibited from doing any work on vehicle safety
matters or discussing them, the NHTSA said in an e-mailed
statement today. Only those who work on programs such as those
involving roadway safety, funded by the highway trust fund, are
still on the job.  “During the federal government shutdown some key agency
functions have been discontinued until funding is restored,”
the agency said.  NHTSA uses its own investigators and contractors and works
with state safety officials to probe causes of accidents that
may involve vehicle defects. The agency’s results can put an end
to uncertainty and speculation about what may have caused an
accident or fire.  Expansion Plans  Tesla plans this year to deliver 21,000 of its flagship
Model S sedans, priced from about $70,000, and double that
volume next year as sales in Europe and Asia expand. Tesla also
plans to introduce a Model X sport-utility vehicle in late 2014
and a smaller, mass-market electric car.  “Tesla cannot weather a sustained onslaught of consumer
complaints and incidents that could potentially dent the demand
curve for the next vehicle,” James Albertine, an analyst with
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a report today. Albertine has a
hold rating on Tesla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
