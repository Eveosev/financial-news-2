Royal Bank of Canada  sold $18.3
million of three-year notes tied to  Blackstone (BX)  Group LP, the
largest offering linked to the buyout firm since at least
January 2010.  The securities, issued Sept. 27, yield 11.2 percent a year
as long as the company doesn’t fall below 75 percent of its
initial value with all capital at risk, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The notes are automatically redeemed starting in three
months if the stock price hasn’t declined from its initial
value. RBC estimated their value at time of sale at 96.3 cents
on the dollar.  Blackstone, the largest buyout firm, rose 63 percent this
year to $25.35 a share at the close of trading yesterday.  Kait Conetta, a spokeswoman in  New York  for the Toronto-based bank, declined to comment on the securities.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
