Ashvin Desai, a client of  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and the owner of a medical-device company in San
Jose,  California , was convicted of tax crimes relating to
accounts in India valued at as much as $7.7 million.  Jurors in federal court in San Jose yesterday convicted
Desai of all eight counts against him, including filing false
tax returns, aiding in preparing false returns and failing to
file Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBARs,
according to court records. Desai owns Prosurg Inc., which makes
devices for treating urological and gynecological disorders.  U.S. prosecutors have charged about 70 taxpayers and 30
bankers, lawyers and advisers in a five-year crackdown on
offshore  tax evasion . Several clients of London-based HSBC, the
largest European bank, have been convicted, including surgeons
from Virginia and Wisconsin, a New Jersey adult paraphernalia
wholesaler, and a Boston venture capitalist.  Desai, of  San Jose , was convicted of filing false returns
for 2007, 2008 and 2009 that omitted interest income of as much
as $471,324 in the first year on HSBC India accounts. He also
helped his adult son and adult daughter file false returns, and
failed to file FBARs for 2007 through 2009, the jury found.  He faces as long as 10 years in prison. U.S. District Judge
Edward Davila set sentencing for Jan. 27.  Desai’s attorney, Martin Schainbaum, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the verdict.  The case is U.S. v. Desai, 11-cr-00846, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
