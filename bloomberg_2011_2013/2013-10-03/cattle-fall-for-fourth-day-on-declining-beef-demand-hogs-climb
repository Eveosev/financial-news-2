Cattle futures fell for a fourth
straight day on signs of declining demand for U.S. beef as
consumers may be opting for chicken or pork. Hogs rose.  The cost of cattle for slaughter dropped to $1.28 a pound
this week from $1.30 a week earlier, according to Tama Livestock
Auction in Tama,  Iowa . Wholesale-beef prices slid 2.2 percent in
the third quarter, while pork slumped 7.2 percent and a
benchmark cost for  chicken breasts  tumbled 9 percent, government
data show.  “To see better cattle prices, we need to see better meat
prices,” Paul Beere, a market adviser for Prime Agricultural
Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview.
Demand for beef is ebbing because there are “plenty of
alternatives,” he said.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1.31725 a pound at 10:47 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the longest slump in almost a month.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.8 percent to
86.9 cents a pound on the CME. Prices reached a five-week low of
85.5 cents on Oct. 1.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell 0.2
percent to $1.65825 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
