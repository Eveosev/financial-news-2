Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  sold two utility-scale power plants with a capacity of 20 megawatts to a fund
managed by BlackRock Inc.  The sale was conducted at a valuation comparable to other
recent transactions completed by Canadian Solar on a per
megawatt basis in the Ontario market, the company said today in
a statement.  The two plants are located in Demorestville and Odessa,
Ontario. Construction started in the first and third quarter of
2013, with commercial operation expected in the fourth quarter
of 2013 and second quarter of 2014, respectively.  TransCanada Corp. yesterday completed the purchase of two
power plants from Canadian Solar for C$95 million ($92 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
