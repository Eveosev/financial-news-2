A group of executives at  Kuwait ’s
Global Investment House KSCC dropped plans to start their own
private equity firm after disagreeing over what fees the spinoff
would keep, two people with knowledge of the talks said.  Ihsan Sancay had been seeking to raise as much as $350
million for the spinoff, which was to be called Bosphera
Advisory Ltd. and would target  Turkey , said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the talks are private. He
said in a February 2012 interview that he planned to complete
the fundraising by November that year.  The plans foundered after a disagreement over what
proportion of the firm’s management fees Global Investment House
would receive in return for taking a 25 percent stake in the
company, the people said. The Kuwaiti firm had sought a quarter
of the management fees Bosphera planned to charge investors, the
people said. Private-equity firms typically charge an annual fee
of 2 percent of investors’ commitments.  Sancay and his team will remain at Global Investment House,
and plan to continue making investments on behalf of the Kuwaiti
firm’s private equity funds and wealth-management clients, the
people said. Officials at Bosphera and Global Investment House
declined to comment.  European private-equity managers are struggling to raise
funds according to London-based data provider Preqin Ltd., with
28 first-time fund managers in Europe raising a combined 2.9
billion euros ($3.9 million) in 2012, down from 127 managers
raising a total of 19.2 billion euros in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
