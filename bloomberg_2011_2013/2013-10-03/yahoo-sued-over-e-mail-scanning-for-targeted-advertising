Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  was sued over claims that
its scanning of e-mail messages for targeted advertising invades
users’ privacy in violation of state and federal wiretap laws.  The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in San Jose,
 California , was brought on behalf of residents of San Bruno,
California, and seeks class-action status. The case was filed
one week after U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose
issued an order refusing to dismiss a similar suit against
 Google Inc. (GOOG)   The interception of “any and all incoming electronic
communications or e-mails to Yahoo! Mail users” is used to
profit from “targeted advertising, profiling, data collection,
and other Yahoo! Services unrelated to Yahoo! Mail,” according
to the complaint.  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, said in an e-mailed
statement that it doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.  Yahoo has beaten earnings expectations 19 times in the past
20 quarters, the most among global Internet media companies.  The case is Kevranian v. Yahoo! Inc., 13-cv-04547, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
