Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s real estate
unit completed the acquisition of European shopping mall
developer Multi Corp., to add assets on the continent and in
 Turkey .  Multi will be a well-capitalized, growth-oriented company
focused on rental income, Blackstone said in a statement today
that. The takeover comes after the Gouda, Netherlands-based
shopping-mall developer said in March that it couldn’t make
interest payments on its debt.  “Our acquisition has significantly strengthened Multi’s
financial position, and its portfolio includes some of the
highest-quality retail real estate in  Europe ,” Ken Caplan,
Blckstone’s head of European real estate, said in the statement.  Blackstone, the biggest manager of private-equity property
funds, amassed more than 90 percent of Multi’s 900 million euros
($1.2 billion) of debt and a similar share of its equity over a
span of about 15 months, two people with knowledge of the matter
said in August.  The New York-based firm was in talks to buy the rest of
Multi’s loans and stock from a German lender, one of the people
said. Both asked not to be identified because the discussions
were private  Multi owns or manages 56 shopping centers throughout Europe
and most of its assets are in Turkey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
