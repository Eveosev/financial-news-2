The U.K.’s Royal Mint increased gold
sales by 12 percent in July from a year earlier, following a
slump in prices to a 34-month low in June.  The mint sold 10,069 ounces in July, compared with 8,955
ounces a year earlier. The data was obtained by  Bloomberg News 
under a Freedom of Information Act request. While sales of
American Eagle gold coins by the  U.S. Mint  rose 66 percent from
a year earlier to 50,500 ounces in July, demand slowed every
month since sales reached 209,500 ounces in April.  Bullion is set for the first annual drop in 13 years as
some investors lose faith in the metal as a store of value. Gold
advanced as much as 21 percent after slumping to $1,180.50 an
ounce in June as lower prices boosted demand for jewelry, bars
and coins, particularly in  Asia .  India , last year’s biggest
buyer, restricted bullion imports this year to curb a trade
deficit and banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Societe
Generale SA forecast price declines as economies strengthen.  “With physical demand out of Asia having moderated from
the first-half surge and the Indian market still struggling to
get to grips with new import restrictions, we are comfortable in
retaining our bearish” outlook,  Tom Kendall , an analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote today in a report. “Of course,
there will be rallies within the downward trend but we continue
to believe the correct strategy is to sell those rather than buy
dips.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,308.05 an ounce by
1:59 p.m. in  London , set for a 22 percent slide this year.
Credit Suisse sees gold averaging $1,180 next year and Goldman
forecasts prices will drop to $1,050 at the end of 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
