The U.S.  Environmental Protection
Agency  could resume rulemaking for the disposal of toxic coal
ash after a federal judge ruled against the agency in a lawsuit
brought by environmental groups.  In  a decision dated Sept. 30, U.S. District Judge  Reggie Walton  in  Washington  said that “absent extraordinary
circumstances, the court will grant summary judgment” to a
portion of a complaint by Appalachian Voices of Boone,  North
Carolina , and other environmental groups alleging the EPA failed
in its legal duty to issue rules for coal ash.  The agency issued a proposal for regulating coal ash in
2010 and never made it final, triggering the suit, which was
filed in April 2012.  “This decision marks the first step towards federally
enforceable safeguards from coal ash,” the environmental groups
said today in an e-mailed statement. “No one should have to
live in fear of the coal ash dump in their backyard, and we hope
the EPA will finally adopt regulations that protect all nearby
communities.”  The judge said he would explain his reasoning in a memo to
be released within 30 days.  The case is Appalachian Voices v. McCarthy, 12-cv-00523,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
