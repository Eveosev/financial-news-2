U.S. military academy football teams
will play as scheduled this weekend even though much of the
nation’s government remains shut down.  The Air Force Academy’s game at Navy in Annapolis,
 Maryland , on Oct. 5 was approved by the  Department of Defense ,
Navy said on its  website . The rest of Navy’s varsity and club
sports events that were to be held through the weekend are
canceled, the academy said.  Army’s football game at  Boston College  in Chestnut Hill,
Massachusetts, also will be played.  “I’m pleased to announce we will host the U.S. Military
Academy this Saturday,” Boston College Athletic Director Brad
Bates said today on the school’s  website . “I’m thrilled our
students and those from the service academies will get to play
their games this weekend. Thank you, fans, for your patience and
understanding the past couple of days.”  Republicans and Democrats are deadlocked on spending
legislation, which led to a partial government shutdown on Oct.
1 and the furlough of about 800,000 federal employees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
