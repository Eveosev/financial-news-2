Rubber climbed, snapping a four-day
losing streak, as data showed improvement in  China’s economy ,
boosting speculation demand will grow from the largest consumer.  The contract for March delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to end at 256.9 yen a kilogram ($2,631
a metric ton), rebounding from the lowest settlement since Aug.
8. The most-active contract has lost 15 percent this year.  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose
to 55.4 in September from previously reported 53.9 in August,
according to a statement released today by the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics and the Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “Concerns about China’s economic slowdown are easing,”
said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in
 Tokyo . “Futures are supported by speculation that demand from
the nation will pick up.”  Natural-rubber consumption will climb 1.5 percent this year
and 4.1 percent in 2014 from 11.04 million tons in 2012,
Prachaya Jumpasut, managing director at the Rubber Economist
Ltd., said at a conference in  Indonesia  yesterday. Rubber demand
for tires are expected to gain 3.5 percent a year to 2020,
Gerard Stapleton, head of Southeast Asia research at LMC
International, said today at the conference.  Thai rubber  free-on-board fell today for a seventh day,
losing 0.6 percent to 78.25 baht ($2.51) a kilogram, according
to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  Markets in China are closed through Oct. 7 for National Day
holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
