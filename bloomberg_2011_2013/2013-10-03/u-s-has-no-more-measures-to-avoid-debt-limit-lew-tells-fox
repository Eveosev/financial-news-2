U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said he has no more means to avoid hitting the debt limit after
he used final extraordinary measures earlier this week.  “There is the dangerous notion that there’s always
something else in the drawer,” Lew told Fox Business Network in
an interview today, according to a transcript supplied by the
network. “Congress needs to understand that on Tuesday, I took
the last steps I can take to create borrowing capacity. I don’t
have any more, what used to be called extraordinary measures.”  Lew declined to speculate on what the ratings companies
would do if the U.S. hits the debt ceiling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
