A low-pressure system in the
northwestern Caribbean Sea prompted energy companies including
 BP Plc (BP/)  to evacuate workers in the Gulf of Mexico and may
strengthen into a tropical storm today.  The system has the potential to become a tropical storm
“at any time” today, the  National Hurricane Center  in Miami
said on its website before 2 a.m.  New York  time. The area of low
pressure is near the northeastern tip of Mexico’s Yucatan
Peninsula and has gale force winds east of the center.  “Heavy rains could affect portions of Cuba and portions of
the Yucatan Peninsula during the next day or two,” the
hurricane center said. “An Air Force Reserve hurricane hunter
aircraft is scheduled to investigate the low later this
morning.”  Storms in the Gulf can affect U.S. and Mexican oil and
natural gas operations. The region is home to 23 percent of U.S.
crude production, 5.6 percent of gas output and more than 45
percent of petroleum refining capacity, according to the Energy
Department.  The Bay of Campeche in the southwestern Gulf is where
Petroleos Mexicanos,  Mexico ’s state-owned oil company, has its
two largest oil fields. They produce about 1.25 million barrels
a day.  A system becomes a tropical storm and gets a name when its
maximum sustained winds reach 39 miles (65 kilometers) per hour.  Gulf Evacuations  Destin Pipeline Co. evacuated all non-essential personnel
yesterday from operations in the central and eastern part of the
Gulf, according to a company  notice . BP Plc also said it was
pulling non-essential workers at four deepwater production
platforms.  PHI Inc. (PHII) , a Lafayette, Louisiana-based helicopter operator
with clients in the oil and gas industry, said in an e-mailed
statement that one customer has evacuated non-essential workers
from operations in the western Gulf of Mexico.  The system was forecast to cross the Yucatan Peninsula
overnight and enter the Gulf, according to the hurricane center.  Computer forecast models then take it north, where it will
probably go ashore somewhere between Mobile Bay,  Alabama , and
Panama City,  Florida , this weekend, Dan Kottlowski, a
meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College,
 Pennsylvania , said yesterday.  The hurricane center is also tracking Tropical Depression
Jerry, which has top-sustained winds of 35 mph. It was 1,030
miles west-southwest of the Azores and doesn’t pose an immediate
threat to land.  To contact the reporters on this story:
