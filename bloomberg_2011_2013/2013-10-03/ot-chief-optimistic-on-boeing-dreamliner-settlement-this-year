LOT Polish Airlines SA, the first
European carrier to fly  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner, is
optimistic about reaching an accord in 2013 over compensation
for the jets’ grounding, its chief executive officer said.  The 787’s setbacks created “tremendous pressure” for
Warsaw-based LOT, and a Boeing settlement would be important for
2014 profitability, CEO Sebastian Mikosz said today in a meeting
with reporters in  New York .  LOT reported daily losses of $50,000 from the worldwide
grounding ordered by regulators in January when its first 787
was stranded in  Chicago  after the inaugural flight. The airline
said it also found last week that two out of its five
Dreamliners were missing oil filters.  State-controlled LOT has bet on the all-composite 787 to
cut costs and help restore profit. The carrier is replacing its
long-haul fleet with the Dreamliner, whose lightweight materials
and other technology help boost  fuel efficiency .  LOT suffered a fresh reverse on Sept. 29 when a 787 flying
to Warsaw from Toronto had to land in Iceland after the failure
of a system that identifies planes to air-traffic controllers.
Two other jets were sent to retrieve passengers, and LOT flew
the 787 home empty.  That was a separate issue from the battery meltdowns on
787s flown by Japanese airlines that spurred the U.S. to order
the first grounding of an entire model since 1979. Regulators
around the world followed the U.S. action, idling the plane less
than 18 months after its commercial debut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
