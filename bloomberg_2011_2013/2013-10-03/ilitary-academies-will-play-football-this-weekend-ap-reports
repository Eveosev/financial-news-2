U.S. military academy football teams
will play as scheduled this weekend, while future games are
still being evaluated because of the federal government
shutdown, the Associated Press reported.  Army’s game at  Boston College  and the  Air Force  Academy’s
contest at the  U.S. Naval Academy  will go ahead on Oct. 5, AP
said, citing a senior defense official who spoke on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter
publicly.  Navy, which canceled an Oct. 1 soccer game against  Howard
University , said two days ago that it would announce a decision
on the game against Air Force by tomorrow.  At Boston College, Director of Athletics Brad Bates said in
a  statement  posted last night on the school’s website that “we
have just learned that a decision on the status of the BC-Army
game will not be made until tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
