Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs fell
to the lowest level in three years as it met its maximum target
at a bond auction.  The Madrid-based  Treasury  sold 3.51 billion euros of debt
($4.77 billion). Its 10-year borrowing costs fell to the least
since Sept. 2010 as its benchmark was sold to yield 4.269
percent, compared with 4.503 percent the last time it was
offered on Sept. 5.  Its five-year benchmark was sold to yield 3.128 percent,
down from 3.477 percent on Sept. 5, and a note maturing in
January 2018 was sold to yield 2.795 percent.  Spain’s borrowing costs have dropped from euro-era records
last year after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
pledged to do “whatever it takes” to defend the euro. The
nation’s debt fell today for a second day amid volatility on the
financial markets since Oct. 1, when the U.S government
suspended all but essential or self-funded operations after
lawmakers failed to agree on its budget.  Yesterday in Paris, Draghi said the euro region’s central
bank will take any necessary measures to keep money-market rates
in check, reiterating comments he made last month.  Demand for Spain’s five-year benchmark was 2.04 times the
amount sold, down from 2.61 last month, while it was 2.66 for
the notes maturing in January 2018. The bid-to-cover ratio was
1.96 for the 10 year-benchmark, down from 1.98.  The yield on  Spain’s 10-year benchmark  bond rose by four
basis points from yesterday to 4.29 percent at 10:58 a.m. in
 Madrid , compared with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July
2012. The spread with similar German maturities widened to 2.45
percentage points.  The Treasury, which said on Sept. 24 that it had covered 83
percent of its mid- and long-term gross funding needs for 2013,
plans to return to the markets to sell six- and 12-month bills
on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
