Danone (BN)  said it is claiming at least
200 million euros ($272 million) in compensation from Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd. after having to recall milk formula
products because of a contamination scare.  The maker of Activia Yogurt sent a notice of dispute to
Fonterra on Sept. 24 “to give both parties a chance to reach an
amicable agreement prior to any litigation,” Paris-based Danone
said today in an e-mailed statement. The company said it is
“determined that it should be fully compensated for damages”
and regards food safety as “a non-negotiable prerequisite.”  A figure of 200 million euros “is part of what Danone is
asking to Fonterra as a compensation,” the French food maker
said in the statement. “They represent an estimation of the
immediate costs caused by the recall.”  Danone issued a recall of milk formula products in eight
markets in August after Fonterra said the items might have been
affected by a contaminated whey protein ingredient. The scare
proved to be a false alarm.  Fonterra said in an Oct. 2 statement that it “strongly
denies” any legal liability to Danone in relation to the
recall, adding that discussions between the companies continue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
