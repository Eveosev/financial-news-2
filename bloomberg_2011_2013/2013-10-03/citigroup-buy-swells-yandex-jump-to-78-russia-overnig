Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s biggest Internet
company, rallied to a two-year high in New York after Citigroup
Inc. initiated coverage of the stock with a buy.  The shares climbed 1.7 percent to $38.38 yesterday, the
highest close since July 2011. The gains sent valuations to 34
times estimated earnings, a 68 percent premium over the multiple
for  Google Inc. (GOOG)  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index was little
changed at 99.02 yesterday, while RTS stock-index futures
increased 0.3 percent to 142,980.  Yandex’s share of Internet searches in Russia increased to
62.2 percent in September from 60.5 percent a year ago, while
Google’s portion shrank to 26 percent from 26.7 percent, data by
 LiveInternet  show. Yandex has increased its annual  sales
forecast  twice this year as it benefits from rising demand in
Russia for Internet advertising, which is set to jump 26 percent
a year through 2015, according to ZenithOptimedia. Citigroup
said it expects shares to rally 20 percent in 12 months.  “Yandex is an undisputed leader of the market and has
cemented its leadership over Google and others,”  Anna Lepetukhina , an analyst at OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest
lender, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “We are seeing
more triggers for further growth in the stock price.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 0.6 percent to $28.53 in New
York. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings
in the stock futures, slipped less than 0.1 percent to 25.23.  Biggest Gainer  Yandex has jumped 78 percent this year, its biggest annual
gain on record, making it the  biggest gainer  among Russia’s most
traded stocks in the U.S. The stock’s premium versus Google Inc.
reached the highest level in 15 months yesterday.  Internet penetration in Russia was at 53.3 percent in 2012,
which compares with 81% in U.S.,  according  to the World Bank.  Citigroup recommends buying Yandex as the company, which
gets about 90 percent of revenue from text-based advertising,
benefits from economic growth and increasing Internet
penetration in Russia, according to the report. The bank started
coverage of Mail.ru with a buy and a 12-month target price of
$44 per share, implying a 12 percent gain. Mail.ru was also
added to Citigroup’s focus list for the region.  Mail.ru added 0.9 percent to $39.34 in  London  yesterday,
the highest level since May 8, 2012, and  traded  at 25 times
estimated earnings. The company has been trading at a discount
to Yandex since March, the data show.  ‘Totally Unjustified’  “The discount is totally unjustified,” Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow,
said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “There should be no
discount and Mail.ru has a chance to catch up. It looks more
attractive to investors because it’s cheaper and because it is
expected to pay a special dividend following sale of stakes in
Facebook and Qiwi.”  Vengranovich cut his recommendation on Yandex to a hold
July 29 and reiterated a buy on Mail.ru in September.  Advertisement spending in  Russia  rose 12 percent in January
through June to about  156 billion rubles  ($4.85 billion),
according to data by the Association of Communication Agencies
of Russia, or AKAR. Internet advertising remained the fastest-growing segment as it increased 30 percent, the data show.
Russian Internet advertising grew more than fivefold to  56
billion rubles  in the five years to 2012, according to AKAR.  “A new version of Yandex-market expected later this year
will help the company increase its share in e-commerce market
and boost revenue,” Lepetukhina said. “Yandex considers
entering the video content segment, which would allow it to make
money with video advertising.”  Lepetukhina cut her recommendation on Mail.ru to hold from
buy last month and reiterated a buy on Yandex in August.  United Co. Rusal (486) , a Moscow-based aluminum producer,
fell 0.4 percent to HK$2.43 in Hong Kong trading as of
10:32 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
