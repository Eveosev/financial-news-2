Zambia has agreed to a $50 million
loan from the  World Bank  for water projects including the
construction of small dams to help moderate damage from drought
and floods in the southern African nation.  Without the investments, changing rainfall patterns amid
global warming could cost Zambia $4.3 billion over 10 years and
keep 300,000 citizens below the poverty line, Kundhavi
Kadiresan, country director for Zambia, Malawi and  Zimbabwe ,
said today at a signing ceremony in Lusaka.  “Mitigating the impact of droughts and floods through
development of a sound infrastructure platform to secure the
productive use of water resources is central to continued
economic development,” she said.  Less that 5 percent of Zambia’s arable land is irrigated,
Kadiresan said.  Loan proceeds will go toward building and repairing about
100 small dams that will benefit more than 1 million people in
rural areas over the next 10 years, she said. The project will
also reduce water-borne disease in Zambia, Finance Minister
Alexander Chikwanda told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
