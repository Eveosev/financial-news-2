Treasury notes rose, pushing 10-year
yields to a seven-week low, as a budget deadlock that partially
shut down the government persisted into a third day and a gauge
of U.S. service businesses dropped more than forecast.  The benchmark yields erased an earlier advance made as
investors weighed prospects for the government shutdown to merge
with the debate over raising the federal debt limit, which the
Treasury has said will be reached Oct. 17. The negative effects
of a default should the U.S. not raise the debt limit could last
 decades , the department said in a report.  “The market’s starting to feel the pressures of the softer
economic data and the shutdown,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees
$8 billion at SEI Investments Co. in Oaks,  Pennsylvania .
“That’s why you’re starting to see a bid in the marketplace.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.58
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 12, after rising earlier to
2.65 percent. The price of the 2.5 percent debt due in August
2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99 3/32.  Rates on the $93 billion in Treasury bills that mature Oct.
24 increased to 0.13 percent after touching negative 0.01
percent on Sept. 27. Rates on the $120 billion of bills maturing
Oct. 17 advanced to 0.11 percent after falling to negative 0.01
percent on Sept. 24. Those rates reached 0.14 percent on Oct. 1,
the highest since December.  Curve Inversion  Investors seeking to hedge against the risk of a default on
bills maturing closest to the debt-ceiling deadline pushed the
difference in rates between one- and three-month bills to the
biggest gap since the 2008 financial crisis.  One-month bill rates climbed to as high as 0.14 percent,
while rates on three-month bills touched 0.03 percent, the
biggest inversion of the so-called  bill curve  since September
2008.  “You’re seeing an aversion to the bills on and around the
date when the debt ceiling might be breached,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital
Markets in New York. “A lot of these short Treasury bills are
typically held by accounts that use them for collateral. They
don’t want to be in a situation where they can’t make good on a
collateral payment.”  Past Crises  Two years ago, one-month bill rates climbed to a 29-month
high of 0.18 percent as the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by
Treasury to avoid a default approached. They traded at 0.015
percent in December 2012 before a year-end trigger would force
automatic spending cuts and tax increases.  Three-month (USGG3M)  Treasury bill rates touched negative 0.0101
percent on Sept. 27, the lowest level this year. The 2013
average is 0.048 percent. The three-month rate climbed to 0.09
percent before the August 2011 deadline, and rose as high as
0.081 percent in the week before Dec. 31, 2012.  Treasury price swings as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate Index fell for a second day, dropping
2.2 percent to 80.33. The average this year was 72.14.  Trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker
of U.S. government debt, rose for the first time in three days,
increasing 5.1 percent to $339 billion. It was the highest level
since Sept. 19. The 2013 average is $316 billion.  The ISM’s U.S. non-manufacturing index fell to 54.4 in
September from 58.6 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
called for a drop to 57. The figure includes industries that
make up almost 90 percent of the economy.  No Report  The Labor Department won’t issue its September employment
data tomorrow because of the shutdown. An alternative date for
the report, usually released the first Friday of every month,
hasn’t been scheduled, the department said in a statement.  A partial government shutdown lasting one week would shave
0.1 percentage point from economic growth, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with the damage accelerating
if the closure persists. It will cost at least $300 million a
day in lost output at the start, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS) , a
Lexington, Massachusetts-based research company.  The effects of failing to raise the $16.7 trillion debt
ceiling would be even bigger. The “catastrophic” consequences
of a U.S. default may include high interest rates, lower
investment and slow growth and “could last for more than a
generation,” the Treasury said in a report.  ‘Increasingly Concerned’  “The market is becoming increasingly concerned that we’ll
get to a point where the Treasury may not be able to pay its
bills,” said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked
research at Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
directly with the Fed. “Situations where the market is
concerned the U.S. Treasury may not pay its bills on time are
indeed quite rare.”  House Republicans are divided between those aligned with
Senator Ted Cruz of  Texas , who are insisting on confrontation
over the nation’s 2010 health-care law, Obama’s signature
legislative achievement, and at least 15 others who say they
would support Senate Democrats’ spending bill. That legislation
would end the shutdown without conditions attached.  Credit-default swaps that insure U.S. debt from non-payment
for five years climbed to 35.5 basis points yesterday, the
highest in almost six months, according to CMA, which is owned
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. The contracts were the 15th most
traded of 1,000 entities tracked by the Depository Trust &
Clearing Corp. in the week through Sept. 27, up from 147th the
previous period.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for
one day in the repurchase market was 0.071 percent yesterday,
according to a GCF repo index provided by the Depository Trust &
Clearing Corp. The repo rate averaged 0.06 percent since June,
compared with 0.14 percent for the first five months of 2013.  The Treasury said it will auction $64 billion of three-,
10-and 30-year securities next week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
