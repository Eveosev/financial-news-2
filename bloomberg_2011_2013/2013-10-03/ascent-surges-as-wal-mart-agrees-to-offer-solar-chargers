Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI) , a
manufacturer of sun-powered consumer devices, rose the most in
four months after  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  agreed to sell its
products.  Ascent climbed 22 percent to $1.04 at the close in New
York, the most since May 20.  Wal-Mart is offering online Ascent’s EnerPlex products,
including solar-powered charging cases for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy smartphone, Thornton,
Colorado-based Ascent said today in a statement.  Ascent announced the iPhone charger in June 2012. It’s also
pursuing aerospace, transportation and off-grid applications for
its thin-film solar products.  The company hasn’t reported a profitable quarter since it
went public in 2006, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
