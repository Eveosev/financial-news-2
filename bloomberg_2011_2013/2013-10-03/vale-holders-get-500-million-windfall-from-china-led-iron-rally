Vale SA, the world’s largest  iron-ore 
producer, boosted this year’s planned dividend by 13 percent to
$4.5 billion as prices for the steelmaking ingredient gain on
surging Chinese consumption.  Holders of common and preferred stock will get about 43.7
cents a share as the second installment of the minimum dividend,
which amounts to $2.25 billion after an additional $500 million
payment is included, Vale said in a  statement  yesterday. That
increases the total payment to shareholders this year to $4.5
billion, compared with a $4 billion target set by the Rio de
Janeiro-based company on Jan. 28.  Vale, the world’s third-largest mining company, is slashing
costs, selling assets and focusing on its most profitable
projects as it seeks to recover margins and reverse a decline in
its shares. The company  paid  $6 billion in dividends last year,
half the record $12 billion returned to shareholders, including
share buybacks, during 2011.  “Stronger-than-expected iron-ore prices, an improving
demand outlook in  China  and asset sales are the main driver of
the dividend uplift,” Leonardo Correa and Luiz Fornari,
analysts at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a note dated Oct. 2.
“Management is aware the fastest way to generate a re-rating in
the shares is via a higher dividend, which could make Vale the
top dividend payer in its class.”  Vale  fell  1.2 percent to 31.45 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo . The stock is down 23 percent this year, compared with a
14 percent decline for the Brazilian benchmark Ibovespa  index .  Largest Exporter  Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin has averaged $135.40 a ton in 2013, 3.7 percent
more than last year,  according  to The Steel Index Ltd.
 Australia , the largest exporter of the raw material, yesterday
raised its 2014 price estimates to $119 a metric ton from a $112
forecast in June, citing stronger-than-expected import estimates
for China, the world’s largest consumer of metals.  Vale’s board will discuss the dividend proposal during a
meeting on Oct. 17 and, if approved, the $2.25 billion payment
will be made on Oct. 31, it said in the statement. It paid a
first $2.25 billion tranche of this year’s dividend on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
