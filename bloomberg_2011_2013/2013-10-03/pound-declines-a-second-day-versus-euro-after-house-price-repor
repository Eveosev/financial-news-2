The pound fell for the first time in
five days against the dollar amid speculation a rally that
pushed it to a nine-month high this week was excessive.  Britain’s currency dropped the most in two weeks versus the
euro after  Bank of England  Governor Mark Carney said yesterday
policy makers won’t consider raising interest rates until the
economic recovery is assured. U.K. government bonds were little
changed as Debt Management Office sold 4 billion pounds ($6.47
billion) of the securities at an auction. Reports today showed
U.K. service industries expanded and  house prices  rose.  “The pound is toppish at these levels,” said  John Hardy ,
head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “There’s nothing different in the U.K. story. It’s
just risen about as far as it can on the news we’ve had. I don’t
think it will move massively lower soon, but it probably won’t
continue to rally.”  The pound dropped 0.4 percent to $1.6164 at 4:33 p.m.
 London  time after rising to $1.6260 on Oct. 1, the highest level
since Jan. 2. The U.K. currency weakened 0.7 percent to 84.31
pence per euro, the biggest decline since Sept. 19.  Sterling has strengthened 6.9 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
6 percent and the dollar slid 0.7 percent.  Record Low  Bank of England policy makers, who meet next week, have
said they will keep  interest rates  at a record low of 0.5
percent at least until unemployment drops to 7 percent. The
jobless rate was 7.7 percent in the second quarter, the  Office
for National Statistics  said Sept. 11.  “We’re not going to begin to think about raising interest
rates or tightening monetary policy until we see the conditions
in the economy where the economy is really growing,” Carney
said in an interview with ITV Anglia broadcast yesterday.  A gauge of services activity based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  was at 60.3 last month after increasing to
an almost seven-year high of 60.5 in August, Markit Economics
said in London. House prices climbed 0.3 percent in September,
matching the result in August, which was revised down from 0.4
percent, according to Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds
Banking Group Plc.  ‘How Long’  “Investors had been buying sterling as the data proved to
be supportive,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy
at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. “The question
now is how long can that last?”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield was at 2.70 percent after
falling to 2.67 percent on Sept. 30, the lowest level since Aug.
27. The price of the 2.25 percent bond maturing in September
2023 was 96.125.  The Debt Management Office sold 10-year gilts at an average
yield of 2.742 percent, down from 2.976 at the previous auction
on Sept. 12. Investors submitted bids for 1.84 times the amount
sold, versus 1.59 last month.  Gilts lost 2.8 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bunds dropped
1.6 percent and Treasuries fell 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
