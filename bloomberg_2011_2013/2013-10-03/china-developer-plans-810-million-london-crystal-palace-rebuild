A Shanghai Zhongrong Property Group
Co. unit plans to invest 500 million pounds ($810 million)
rebuilding London’s Crystal Palace, a glass and iron commercial
hub that burned down in 1936.  The Chinese company plans to reconstruct the 500-meter
(1,600-foot) long former landmark and restore the surrounding
180-acre park, London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said at a press
conference today.  “I can make Crystal Palace a jewel in the crown for the
U.K. and the world,” Zhongrong Group Chairman Ni Zhaoxing said
at the event.  The project, which requires local-government approvals,
would add to several investments in London real estate projects
by Chinese developers. ABP (China) Holdings Group Ltd. announced
a 1 billion-pound business center in May. Zhongrong may submit a
planning application for Crystal Palace in about a year and
construction would begin in winter 2015, according to a
statement today.  The original Crystal Palace was built for the Great
Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park. It was moved to south London in
1854 to an area that later became known as Crystal Palace. The
new development would include terraces and gardens, a visitor
center, concert hall and a cafe. The restoration of the park
will be based on the original Victorian design, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
