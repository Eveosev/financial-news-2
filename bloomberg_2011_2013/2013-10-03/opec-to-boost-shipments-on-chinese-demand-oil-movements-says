The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase shipments through late October
as refiners in  China  resume operations after seasonal
maintenance, according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
will raise exports by 100,000 barrels a day, or 0.4 percent, to
23.97 million a day in the four weeks to Oct. 19 compared with
23.87 million a day in the period to Sept. 21, the researcher
said today in a report. The figures exclude two of OPEC’s 12
members, Angola and Ecuador.  “Chinese refiners are pulling out of maintenance so their
demand is climbing up,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said
by phone from Halifax,  England . “The West is in maintenance,
and refiners there are in deep trouble, as crude demand in the
West is plummeting.”  Refiners boost operating rates in the fourth quarter to
meet higher demand for heating fuel during the Northern
Hemisphere winter.  Brent crude  was at $109.21 a barrel as of
4:13 p.m. today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London ,
having advanced 6.1 percent in the third quarter.  Middle Eastern shipments will climb 0.6 percent to 17.61
million barrels a day to Oct. 19, compared with 17.51 million in
the month to Sept. 21, according to Oil Movements. Those figures
include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase 2.3 percent to 487.28
million barrels on Oct. 19, data from Oil Movements show. The
researcher calculates volumes by tallying tanker bookings, and
excludes crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
