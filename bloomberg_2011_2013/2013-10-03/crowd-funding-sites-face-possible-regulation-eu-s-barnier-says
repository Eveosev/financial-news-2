Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services chief, said he’s considering possible
regulation of crowd funding, in a bid to protect users and
stimulate the industry.  Barnier said the European Commission, the EU’s executive
arm, is examining the need for a “single European framework”
for crowd-financing services and will consult on possible
measures until Dec. 31, according to a statement on its website
today.  Crowd-financing services, such as Kickstarter Inc., manage
Internet sites that allow entrepreneurs to appeal for funding
for specific projects, and so to raise financing from a large
number of individual contributors.  “The ultimate objective of this consultation is to gather
data about the needs of market participants and to identify the
areas in which there is a potential added value in EU action to
encourage the growth of this new industry, either through
facilitative, soft-law measures or legislative action,” the
commission said.  Global regulators have cited the fledgling industry as “an
important emerging innovation” that could present threats to
market stability if left unregulated.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions, a
group bringing together authorities from over 100 nations said
last month it would “develop guidance” on the regulation of
the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
