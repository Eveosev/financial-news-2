European Central Bank Executive Board
member Benoit Coeure said that loans provided to the financial
system shouldn’t be a substitute for any capital shortage.  Central banks acting as lenders of last resort “can
generate moral hazard in the banking system, lead central banks
to take unwarranted credit risk and, in some extreme cases,
interfere with their primary mandate –-  price stability ,”
Coeure said today in a speech in Toulouse,  France . “Support
that is considered as appropriate during the crisis might have
perverse effects on the incentives of banks at a later stage.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday that the
Frankfurt-based central bank stands ready to deploy instruments
such as another round of long-term loans to banks if needed. At
the same time, liquidity “should not be a replacement for lack
of capital,” he said, a sentiment Coeure reiterated today.  Liquidity “ought to be provided to the banking system as
needed,” said Coeure. “But it should not be a substitute for a
lack of capital.”  “There is a fine line between liquidity and solvency
needs, which in a crisis is often blurred,” he said. “Central
banks should therefore be particularly wary not to substitute
for capital support that should be provided by shareholders,
investors, or in last resort by governments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
