Palm oil  dropped for a second day to
a one-week low on speculation that increasing output from
 Malaysia , the second-largest producer, will add to stockpiles
and as a decline in crude oil prices cut its appeal as biofuel.  The contract for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
2,302 ringgit ($720) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the lowest close for the most-active contract since
Sept. 26. Palm for physical delivery in October was at 2,320
ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles should expand from last month through at least
January as supply climbs, according to Dorab Mistry, director at
Godrej International Ltd. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  has
predicted global reserves gaining 17 percent to a record 9.2
million tons in 2013-2014. West Texas Intermediate oil fell
after the biggest gain in two weeks as U.S. crude stockpiles
increased twice as much as forecast.  “The market is estimating Malaysia’s September end-stock
to be above 2 million tons as the production rise is very
much,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT
International Futures Sdn. U.S. soybeans harvest and weak crude
 oil prices  are pressuring palm oil, he said.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December gained 0.9 percent to
39.72 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery climbed 0.6 percent to $12.8075 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
