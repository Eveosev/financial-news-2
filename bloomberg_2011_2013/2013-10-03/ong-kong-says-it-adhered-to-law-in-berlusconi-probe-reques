Hong Kong said it didn’t compromise
the legal process in assisting Italian prosecutors to seize
documents related to an investigation involving former Italian
Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi .  The government is responding to recent reports in media
including the South China Morning Post newspaper that said Hong
Kong’s former Chief Executive  Donald Tsang  was promised a
meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 if his government could
halt the transfer of evidence.  “The  Department of Justice  has not taken into account any
attempt to arrange a meeting with the Pope,” the government
said yesterday in a statement. The process “has never been
compromised in any way, nor have any irrelevant considerations
been taken into account,” it said.  Hong Kong’s Department of Justice received a letter from
Italy’s public prosecutor in Sept. 2006, seeking help to search
premises and seize documents in the city, the government said in
the statement.  The documents were sent to  Italy  on Aug. 12 this year after
repeated appeals against the search warrants by the parties
involved were rejected by courts in Hong Kong, it said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
