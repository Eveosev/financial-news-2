If you planned a vacation to a national park, museum, or historic site this week, first off, we're so sorry to hear that, and second, there are still some options for salvaging your trip. We found work-arounds for a few popular tourist sites that are closed until Congress makes up its mind… Instead of Hiking in the Grand Canyon, Fly Above It in a Helicopter Arizona absorbed the cost of the Grand Canyon's entrance fees during the 1995–1996 shut down, but the state is not being so kind this time around. The national park is closed to visitors, except those who are already hiking or rafting through the canyon. One loophole: Airspace is still open. Helicopter operators  Maverick Helicopters,  Viator,  and  Papillon  have confirmed they're still offering tours. Instead of Cruising to the Statue of Liberty, Sail by It on the Ferry The Statue of Liberty is closed to visitors, but you can still get your photo op. The (free!) Staten Island Ferry sails past Lady Liberty and runs 24 hours a day. If you've already bought tickets to the Statue of Liberty—or you'd prefer a more tourist-focused sailing—Statue Cruises will accept them in exchange for a sightseeing tour that sails by Liberty Island (but doesn't let you off), and Circle Line Cruises offers four cruises that provide views of the statue. Instead of the Visting the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Explore the Bay Area Discovery Center The official Golden Gate Bridge Recreation Area is closed, so travelers who want to learn a little about the icon could visit the  Bay Area Discovery Center . It's a kid's museum, yes, but Lookout Cove, a 2.5-acre outdoor exhibit, explores the history of the bridge and the Bay Area—and provides some sweeping views of the bridge itself. Instead of Going to the National Museum of American History, Visit the International Spy Museum Sorry, you won't be able to eye Dorothy's sparkling ruby slippers or Michelle Obama's inauguration dress if you're in Washington, D.C. But you can get a clandestine pop culture fix at the International Spy Museum. The privately funded museum is open during the shutdown (and free to furloughed employees), so you can explore the history of James Bond and the real-life  story behind Ben Affleck's Argo . Instead of the Wandering Around the National Museum of Natural History, Visit the National Geographic Museum Okay, it's not the same as ogling dinosaur skeletons at D.C's Museum of Natural History. But the National Geographic Museum's current exhibits provide plenty of fodder for nature lovers: a photography exhibit on  lions, tigers, and bears ; a  behind-the-scenes look  at the society's 125 years of exploration, cartography, and photography; and " One Cubic Foot: Portraits of Biodiversity, " an exhibit that looks at the fascinating creatures that fit inside a 12-inch cube. Instead of Hiking in Muir Woods, Visit California's Coastal State Parks The Muir Woods are the most famous place to marvel at towering redwoods, but you can find other sequoias to hug nearby. Redwood-filled state parks in the Bay Area—including  Samuel P. Taylor State Park ,  Portola Redwoods State Park , and  Butano State Park  —are still open for camping and hiking.
