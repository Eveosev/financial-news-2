Neiman Marcus Group, the luxury
retailer being acquired by Ares Management LLC and the Canada
Pension Plan Investment Board, is seeking a $2.95 billion term
loan as part of its financing to fund the buyout.  Credit Suisse Group AG is leading the transaction, which
includes the seven-year term piece and an $800 million asset-backed loan that matures in five years, according to a person
with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be identified
because the financing is private. The bank will host a meeting
with potential lenders on Oct. 7 at 1:30 p.m. in New York.  Ares and the pension fund are buying the retailer from TPG
Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC, which acquired it for about $5
billion in a 2005  leveraged buyout . Last month the company
obtained $1.56 billion in bridge facilities as part of the
financing.  Lenders to the term loan, which doesnâ€™t contain financial
maintenance requirements, must let the bank know by Oct. 16 if
they will participate in the deal, the person said.  Bridge facilities are short-term loans that usually mature
in one year and are often used as backstops to bond offerings or
longer-dated bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
