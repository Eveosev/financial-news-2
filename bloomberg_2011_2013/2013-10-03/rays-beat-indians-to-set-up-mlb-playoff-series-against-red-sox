Alex Cobb and three relievers
combined for a shutout as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Cleveland
Indians 4-0 in the American League wild-card game to set up a
playoff series against the  Boston Red Sox .  After also playing in New York, Toronto and Texas since
Sept. 24, Tampa Bay now heads to Fenway Park in Boston for the
opener of the best-of-five AL Division Series tomorrow. The 
Red Sox have home-field advantage throughout the Major League 
Baseball playoffs.  The  Detroit Tigers  visit the Oakland Athletics in Game 1 of
the other AL Division Series starting tomorrow. Both National
League Division series get under way tonight, with the Los
Angeles Dodgers at the Atlanta Braves and the  St. Louis
Cardinals  hosting the Pittsburgh Pirates.  A home run by  Delmon Young  in the third inning and a two-run double in the fourth by Desmond Jennings made it 3-0 for the
Rays last night at Progressive Field in Cleveland.  The score remained unchanged until the ninth inning, when
Yunel Escobar’s single drove in  Ben Zobrist  to complete the
scoring for Tampa Bay.  Rays starter Cobb gave up eight hits, struck out five and
walked one batter in 6 2/3 innings for the win, while
Cleveland’s Danny Salazar took the loss after surrendering three
runs on four hits in four innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
