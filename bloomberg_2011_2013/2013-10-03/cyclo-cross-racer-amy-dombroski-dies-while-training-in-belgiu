Amy Dombroski , an American racer in
the bicycle sport of cyclo-cross, died when she was struck by a
truck  while training in  Belgium , according to her team.  Dombroski, who had been a member of Belgiumâ€™s Telenet-Fidea
cyclo-cross team since 2012, was killed in Sint-Katelijne-Waver,
the team said on its  website . Dombroski had been following a
scooter before the accident, and the scooter driver escaped
injury, the team said.  The 26-year-old Dombroski was born in Jericho,  Vermont , and
had lived in Boulder, Colorado, since last year. She flew to
Belgium two days ago to join her team after competing at the
Gran Prix of Gloucester in Massachusetts, where she finished
eighth on Sept. 28 and 11th the following day.  Cyclo-cross requires participants to ride on- and off-road
courses, sometimes dismounting to carry their bicycles through
obstacles.  Dombroski was a three-time under-23 national cyclo-cross
champion, according to Velonews. She is survived by her fiance,
motocross racer Ryan Rozinski, according to the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
