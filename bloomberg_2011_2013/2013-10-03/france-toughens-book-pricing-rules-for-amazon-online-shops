France  is toughening book-pricing
rules for online retailers like  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  with a new law
aimed at supporting bookstores and volumes that aren’t immediate
bestsellers.  France’s national assembly today unanimously approved a
proposed law that blocks online stores from offering free
shipping on top of a 5 percent maximum discount on books. When
delivery costs are waived, they should be accounted for within
the rebate limit, according to the text.  “Free shipping, let’s say it, is a dumping strategy,”
Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti said during the
parliamentary debate. “This law, far from preventing
competition or blocking technological evolution, makes sure
competition is fair between players in a fragile ecosystem.”  Amazon has a 70 percent share of the online book market in
France, said Christian Kert, one of the bill’s authors. Retailer
 Groupe Fnac (FNAC)  runs its own Internet bookstore.  The amendment on shipping, which will next be voted on by
the senate, builds on a 1981 law singling books out as a
“cultural exception”, deserving a distinct set of pricing
rules. In France, a book’s price is fixed by the editor and has
to be the same regardless of the distribution channel, while
discounts should follow strict rules, the law says.  “Any measure raising the price of books on the Internet
will hurt the purchasing power of French people first and
foremost, and discriminate against those who make purchases
online,” Sophie Touchot at Havas SA, which represents Amazon in
France, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
