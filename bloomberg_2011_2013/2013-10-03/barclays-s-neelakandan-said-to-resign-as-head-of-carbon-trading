Nima Neelakandan,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s head
of emissions trading, resigned from the London-based bank, two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Neelakandan, 28, left the bank in September, five months
after taking over the role from Louis Redshaw, who resigned in
April, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the matter is confidential.  Barclays, which calls itself the largest liquidity provider
in the greenhouse-gas emissions market, has traded more than 6.5
billion metric tons of carbon credits worth over 80 billion
euros ($109 billion), according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
