A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
rose as the U.S. government stayed partially closed for a third
day. Honda Motor Co. plans to issue dollar-denominated debt in a
three-part, benchmark offering.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.5 basis points to 81.2 basis points at 1:02 p.m. in New York,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are bracing for a deceleration in the economy as
a result of the shutdown, which has led to furloughed workers
and government service stoppages. Economists estimated that a
week-long closure may  slow  fourth-quarter gross domestic product
growth by more than 0.25 percentage point, according to a report
the Treasury Department released today.  The budget impasse may stretch into next week and “begin
to bump up against the debt ceiling problem,” Adrian Miller,
director of fixed-income strategy at GMP Securities LLC, wrote
in an e-mail. “If there is no clear path to a debt ceiling
resolution, I do expect swaps to widen further.”  The index typically climbs as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Treasury Report  The shutdown may exacerbate the consequences of a prolonged
debate on raising the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit if it
persists, leading to decreased consumer spending and a higher
unemployment rate, according to the Treasury.  “If such projections prove accurate, the weaker-than-expected economic expansion would be even more susceptible to
the adverse effects from a debt ceiling impasse than prior to
the shutdown,” the Treasury wrote in the report.  American Honda Finance Corp., the Japanese automaker’s U.S.
unit, may sell three-year debt in fixed- and floating-rate
portions and five-year fixed-rate debt as soon as today,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction, who
asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set. Benchmark
sales are typically at least $500 million.  The Markit CDX North American High Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade bonds, rose 7.9 basis
points to 396.3 basis points, Bloomberg prices show.  The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds rather than
similar-maturity Treasuries widened 0.3 basis point to 132.2
basis points, Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt rose 3.1 basis points to 671.9.  Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or higher at Moody’s
Investors Service and at least BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
