Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) 
submitted a proposal to develop a new water treatment system for
the crisis-ridden Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today.  The system would be capable of treating 500 metric tons of
water a day, the paper reported, without saying where it got the
information. The government, which has been asking for proposals
for a new system to deal with the buildup of radioactive water
at the power plant, said in September that it would award the
contract through open bidding. More than 10 proposals have been
received, according to the Nikkei.  A Hitachi spokesman who asked not to be identified because
of company policy confirmed a proposal had been submitted while
declining to say if it was with partners or who they are because
the bidding process continues.  Masahiro Yoshimura, a spokesman for Toshiba, said the
company couldnâ€™t immediately confirm the Nikkei report.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the operator of the Fukushima
plant, joined Toshiba and Hitachi in their application, the
paper said. Toshiba is the manufacturer behind a filter system
known as ALPS, which separates out strontium and other
radioactive elements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
