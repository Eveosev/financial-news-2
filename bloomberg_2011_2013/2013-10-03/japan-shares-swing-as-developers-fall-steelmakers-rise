Japan ’s  Topix (TPX)  index retreated for a
fifth day, capping its longest losing streak since November, as
insurance companies and energy explorers led declines.  NKSJ Holdings Inc. dropped 2.3 percent as insurers sank the
most among the 33 Topix subsectors. Inpex Corp., Japan’s largest
energy explorer, slid 1.1 percent as oil fell. Mobile carrier
SoftBank Corp. rose 4 percent, overtaking Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. as the nation’s No. 2 company by value.  The Topix slid 0.1 percent to 1,173.99 at the close in
 Tokyo , capping its first five-day fall since elections were
called that brought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to power. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  decreased 0.1 percent to 14,157.25. Abe
said on Oct. 1 he’d raise the sales levy and prepare measures to
soften its impact, including considering a reduction in taxes on
businesses. Investors are also watching for progress on ending
the impasse over federal spending that shut parts of the U.S.
government for a second day.  “The market is lacking catalysts after the consumption tax
hike was announced,”said Osamu Koizumi, a Tokyo-based executive
officer at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $18 billion in assets. “It’s going to be rather
quiet until talk about cutting corporate taxes gains momentum.
Plus, the U.S. government shutdown is continuing and we don’t
know how long it’ll last.”  The Topix Insurance Index dropped 1.5 percent, with NKSJ
sliding 2.3 percent to 2,463 yen. MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings
Inc. lost 1.9 percent to 2,473 yen.  Oil Falls  Energy explorers retreated after West Texas Intermediate
oil for November delivery dropped as much as 62 cents to $103.48
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Inpex declined 1.1 percent to 1,143 yen. Japan
Petroleum Exploration Co. fell 0.6 percent to 4,130 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. The measure declined 0.1 percent yesterday as the closure
of government continued. A partial shutdown lasting one week
would probably shave 0.1 percentage point from economic growth,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, with the costs accelerating if the standoff persists.  A report yesterday showed U.S. companies added fewer
workers than projected in September, indicating the job market
is struggling to gain momentum. The 166,000 increase followed a
revised 159,000 rise in August that was smaller than initially
estimated. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an advance of 180,000.  ‘Buy on Dips’  “The U.S. debate over funding could fall either way and in
light of the uncertainty it’s hard to take on new risk,” said
Takashi Miyazaki, general manager of strategic research and
investment at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., a unit of the
nation’s biggest bank. “It’s caused the yen to rise but the
feeling is that the bad news has been priced in for now. The
market consensus is to buy on dips.”  Japan’s currency advanced 0.9 percent against the dollar in
the two days after the U.S. shutdown and Japan sales-tax
announcement, before paring gains today.  SoftBank jumped 4 percent to 7,530 yen. Billionaire
Chairman Masayoshi Son is forecasting record domestic earnings
this year as he accelerates the addition of new subscribers and
after buying a controlling stake in Sprint Corp. With today’s
gain, the mobile phone operator’s market value exceeded that of
Mitsubishi UFJ to become Japan’s second-largest company by value
after Toyota Motor Corp.  Daikin Industries Ltd. (6367) , which produces air-conditioners,
climbed 4.8 percent to 5,270 yen after the Nikkei newspaper
reported its free  cash flow  may turn positive this fiscal year.  The Topix traded at 1.23 times  book value  today, compared
with multiples of 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.75 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index yesterday. The Japanese measure’s 30-day
 historic volatility  was at 18.30 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.34.  To contact the reporters on this story:
