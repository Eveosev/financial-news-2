World  food prices  fell for a fifth
month in September to the lowest level in three years, with
grain prices sliding as production of corn and rice is expected
to exceed demand.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO fell to 199.1
points from a revised 201.4 in August, the Rome-based United
Nations agency wrote in an online report today. The gauge is
down from a record 237.9 points in February 2011 and at the
lowest level since September 2010.  The decline in food prices was driven by a 6.1 percent drop
for grains, as all other components of the index rose, led by
sugar, the FAO said. Global corn production will jump to 943.2
million metric tons in 2013-14 from 862.9 million tons in the
previous period, the International Grains Council forecast last
week.  “The sharp decline in September follows an already sizable
drop registered in the previous two months, reflecting a
generally favorable supply outlook, particularly for maize and
rice,” the FAO said, using another name for corn.  The FAO’s grain price index fell to 197.7 points last month
after sliding 7.5 percent to 210.6 in August, slipping to the
lowest level since August 2010.  In a separate report, the FAO cut its outlook for 2013
world grain production by 3.1 million tons to 2.49 billion tons
on a reduced outlook for wheat output, still rising 7.7 percent
from 2.31 billion tons in 2012. The wheat outlook was lowered by
5.2 million tons to 704.6 million tons.  International wheat prices were mostly unchanged from
August on rising demand and a reduced outlook for harvests in
Southern Hemisphere growers, according to the FAO.  Sugar  The FAO’s sugar index rose 1.8 percent to 246 points, after
unfavorable weather hampered harvesting in the center-south
region of  Brazil , the world’s largest producer of the sweetener.
Rising demand in  India  due to festive seasons provided short-term price support, the UN agency wrote.  An index of meat prices advanced 0.9 percent to 175.7
points, while the FAO’s gauge for cooking oils and fats added
0.4 percent to 186.3 points. The dairy price index gained 0.7
percent last month to 240.7.  The global food-import bill will probably be stable this
year at $1.094 trillion as cheaper sugar and cooking oil make up
for rising prices of dairy, fish and meat, the FAO predicted in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
