The ruble climbed to the strongest
level in a week against the dollar as Brent crude oil rose and
Chinese data boosted the appetite for emerging-market assets.  The ruble gained 0.5 percent against the dollar to 32.0675
by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the central bank stops its market
operations. It appreciated 0.4 percent against Bank Rossii’s
target basket of dollars and euros to 37.2782. The yield on
 government bonds  due January 2023 fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 7.26 percent.  Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, added 0.4 percent to
$109.61 per barrel in London, extending a 1.2 percent rally
yesterday. An index of 20 emerging-market currencies compiled by
Bloomberg rose for a fourth day, increasing 0.2 percent to 94.39
after  China ’s non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose
to a six-month high.  “The ruble has been seeking direction against the basket
today, getting support from the higher oil price and risk-on
environment,” Vladimir Miklashevsky, a trading desk strategist
at Danske Bank S/A in Helsinki, said in e-mailed comments.  The Russian currency added 0.3 percent against the euro to
43.6300.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  and congressional leaders
yesterday failed to break a budget impasse in their first face-to-face negotiations since the government began its first
partial shutdown in 17 years on Oct. 1.  Some investors are speculating the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain stimulus for longer due to the shutdown, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by Rashique Rahman said in an e-mailed note.  “Given the impact of the shutdown on growth, markets
assume that Fed policy will stay accommodative for longer,”
they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
