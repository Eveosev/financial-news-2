Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  tumbled for
an 11th day, losing 0.9 percent to 1,864.01 by the close, the
longest decline since the 14 days through Aug. 28, 2008.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  fell for a fifth day, weakening 2.6
percent to 53.69 as of 1:24 p.m. in Nairobi, heading for the
lowest close since Oct. 27. The  Ghana Stock Exchange Composite
Index  gained for the third day, advancing 0.1 percent to 986.84
as of 10:26 a.m. in Accra. The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  was
unchanged at 810.76 at 12:26 p.m. in Windhoek. The  Nigerian
Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  declined for a third day,
weakening 1.3 percent to 19,745.53 in Lagos, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  , the East African
nation’s biggest lender by assets, climbed for the first day in
14, gaining 0.3 percent to 15 shillings, after falling below a
technical level that indicates the stock is poised for a rise.  Kenya Commercial’s 14-day relative strength index closed at
25.2 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A level
below 30 signals to some technical analysts that the stock is
oversold and set for a rise.  Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP)  , a Kenyan retailer,
headed for its lowest level on record, weakening 3.3 percent to
7.3 shillings, as small investors sold their stock ahead of the
Christmas holidays.  “It is purely retail investors building their cash
positions as we head into the festive season, there is a lot of
retail exits from the company,” George Bodo, an equity
strategist at Nairobi-based Apex  Africa  Capital Ltd., said by
phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
