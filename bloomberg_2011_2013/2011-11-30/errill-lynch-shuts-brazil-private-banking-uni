Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the lender
that plans to cut at least 30,000 jobs to control expenses,
closed its Merrill Lynch private-banking operation in  Brazil  and
dismissed about 40 people.  “This was not an easy decision, but necessary given our
goal to maximize shareholder return” Selena Morris, a
spokeswoman for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, said
in an e-mailed statement.  Bank of America is at least the third financial firm to
announce layoffs in Brazil this year as the European sovereign-
debt crisis persists. London-based ICAP Plc, the world’s biggest
broker of transactions between banks, fired about 50 people in
October as part of a restructuring, Alan Gandelman, the firm’s
country head, said on Oct. 6.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said on Oct. 20 that it
decided to cut about 30 jobs as the lender abandons plans to
start an investment bank in Brazil, according to an e-mailed
statement from  Michael Geller , a company spokesman. Carlos
Braga, who headed the office, and senior economist Zeina Latif
are among the employees being fired by RBS.  Morris said that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch are
committed to Brazil and continue to focus on developing the
corporate and investment-banking business and serving private
and institutional clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
