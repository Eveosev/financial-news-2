Thessaloniki Port Authority SA (OLTH) ,
which operates  Greece â€™s second-biggest port, said nine-month
profit more than doubled as it handled more cargo and cut costs.  Net income in the nine months through Sept. 30 rose to 8.4
million euros ($11 million) from 3.4 million euros a year
earlier, the company said in a  statement  on its website.  The number of containers handled increased by 11.3 percent
and general cargo by 17.8 percent; costs were cut by 8.8
percent, according to the statement.  Greece plans to sell part or all of its 75 percent stake in
the port in 2012 as part of a program to raise 65 billion euros
by 2015 from state-asset sales and real-estate development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
