A man carrying a shotgun and a rifle
and wearing an ammunition belt opened fire near Topkapi Palace
in Istanbul, injuring a soldier and a security guard,  NTV 
television reported.  The gunman, shouting “God is great” in Arabic as he
opened fire, was killed, NTV reported. The reason for the
shooting and identity of the shooter were unclear, the news
channel said.  Topkapi Palace, a museum and tourist attraction, was the
home and royal court of the Ottoman sultans who ruled over much
of the  Middle East  until the  Ottoman Empire  crumbled in the
early 20th century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
