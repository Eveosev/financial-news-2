Indonesia ’s rupiah had its biggest
monthly decline since February 2009 on concern  Europe ’s
worsening debt crisis will slow global economic growth.
 Government bonds  dropped the most since January.  Bank Indonesia plans to boost “intervention” in the
market to support the rupiah, Governor Darmin Nasution said in
Jakarta today, a day after the currency reached a 17-month low.
The central bank is committed to buying government bonds in the
secondary market Perry Warjiyo, director for economic research
and monetary policy, said yesterday. The monetary authority
unexpectedly reduced its benchmark  interest rate  by 50 basis
points to 6 percent on Nov. 10 to boost growth.  “On the euro-zone worries, the markets have been looking
for positive signals,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at
Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “The rate cut was premature, so that
is playing on the minds of investors. There are constraints to
how much the central bank can intervene in the market.”  The rupiah slid 3.5 percent this month to 9,170 per dollar
as of 3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It fell 0.2 percent today and reached
9,240 yesterday, the weakest level since June 2010.  Italy had to pay more than 7 percent for its debt this week,
while Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. had their long-term credit grades reduced to A-
from A by Standard & Poor’s yesterday.  Bank Indonesia  lowered its 2012 economic growth forecast to
6.3 percent from 6.7 percent because of the global slowdown,
Halim Alamsyah, a deputy governor at the central bank, said in
Jakarta today.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 increased 39 basis points, or 0.39 percentage
point, this month to 6.73 percent today, according to midday
prices by the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The rate fell 12
basis points today.  Foreign ownership  of Indonesian government debt fell to
217.17 trillion rupiah ($23.6 billion) this month as of Nov. 28,
from 219.78 trillion at the end of last month, according to
finance ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
