RBS Securities Inc. is recommending
investors pay Chilean swap rates as a bet the central bank wonâ€™t
lower its benchmark  interest rate  in December.  The two-year swap rate may rise toward 4.5 percent and
eventually reach 4.72 percent,  Siobhan Morden , a Latin America
strategist at RBS, wrote in a note to clients. The rate climbed
six basis points to 4.26 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
