St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) , maker of
devices to treat heart conditions, surged the most in more than
20 months after receiving U.S. regulatory approval for two
products that may help the company grab a larger share of a $6
billion market.  St. Jude climbed 7.7 percent to $38.44 at the close in New
York, the biggest single-day jump since March 2010. The  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based company said late yesterday that it
received  Food and Drug Administration  approval for Quadra, which
helps synchronize cardiac contractions in heart-failure
patients, and the four-electrode Quartet lead.  The Quartet’s four electrodes enable physicians to adjust
the electrical pulses without surgically moving the wires. The
so-called Quad-Pole technology gives doctors flexibility when
implanting cardiac devices, letting them install the wires where
they are most secure and beneficial, said Larry Biegelsen, a
Wells Fargo Securities analyst in New York, in a note to
investors.  “We estimate Quad-Pole technology from  Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  and
 Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX)  are at least one to two years behind
Quartet, so St. Jude has a meaningful lead,” Biegelsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
