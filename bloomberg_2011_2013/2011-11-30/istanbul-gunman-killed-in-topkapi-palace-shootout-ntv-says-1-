A man carrying a shotgun and another
rifle and wearing an ammunition belt was killed after a shootout
lasting more than an hour at Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, NTV
television reported, citing Police Chief Huseyin Capkin.  The reason for the shooting and identity of the gunman were
unclear, though he appeared to be a foreigner, NTV said citing
Capkin. The man shouted “God is great” in Arabic as he opened
fire, according to NTV, citing witnesses.  Topkapi Palace, now a popular museum in Istanbul’s
touristic Sultanahmet district, was home and royal court to the
Ottoman sultans who ruled over much of the  Middle East  until the
 Ottoman Empire  crumbled in the early 20th century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
