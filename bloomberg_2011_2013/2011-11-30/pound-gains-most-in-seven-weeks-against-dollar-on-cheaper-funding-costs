U.K.  gilts  fell for a second day
after central banks worldwide lowered the cost of dollar funding
and as successful Spanish and French auctions damped demand for
the relative safety of U.K. government debt.  Ten-year yields climbed to a four-week high as the Debt
Management Office attracted fewer bids at a 3 billion-pound
($4.72 billion) auction of the securities. Six central banks led
by the Federal Reserve yesterday agreed to cut the cost of
providing dollar funding via swap agreements and to make other
currencies available as needed. The pound weakened for second
day against the euro.  “Gilt yields rose today as risk sentiment appears to have
improved after the coordinated action by the central banks,”
said Jamie Searle, an interest-rate strategist at Citigroup
Global Markets Ltd. in  London . “Gilts have done really well
this year because of their safe-haven status.”  The 10-year  yield  climbed six basis points to 2.37 percent
at 12:40 p.m. London time after rising to 2.43 percent, the
highest since Oct. 31. The 3.75 percent bond due December 2021
fell 0.58, or 5.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
111.925. The 30-year rate rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 3.24 percent.  Spain  sold 3.75 billion euros ($5.06 billion) of notes with
investors ordering more than twice the amount sold.  France 
auctioned 4.3 billion euros of debt and managed to sell a 10-
year bond at 3.18 percent, less than the rate at a previous
auction on Nov. 3.  Weaker Demand  Investors submitted bids for 1.61 times the 10-year gilts
the government sold, down from a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.76 at
the previous auction of the securities on Oct. 4.  Gilts fell yesterday after the six central banks announced
their agreement to provide cheaper dollar funding. The premium
banks pay to borrow dollars overnight from central banks will
fall by half a percentage point to 50 basis points, the Fed said
in  Washington .  “With month-end demand out of the way and liquidity drying
up into the year-end, gilt yields are rebounding from
exceptionally low levels,” said  Marc Ostwald , strategist at
Monument Securities in London. “Reasonably good auction results
from  Europe  also reduce demand for a safe-haven.”  Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.5730, and climbed 0.3
percent to 122.22 yen. It weakened 0.2 percent to 85.76 pence
per euro.  “We are back in a risk-on phase and sterling will benefit
from that,”  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in
London, wrote in an emailed response to questions.  Manufacturing Shrinks  Gilts fell even as a report showed U.K. manufacturing
shrank in November at the fastest pace since June 2009.  Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said their factory index dropped to 47.6 last month
from a revised 47.8 in October.  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn King today urged banks to
enhance efforts to bolster their defenses against the euro
area’s debt turmoil, which he said now looks like a “systemic
crisis.”  U.K. government bonds have returned 15 percent this year,
while German debt gained 6.5 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 9
percent, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
