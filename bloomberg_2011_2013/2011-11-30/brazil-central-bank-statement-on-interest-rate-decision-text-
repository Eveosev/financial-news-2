Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “Giving continuity to the adjustment process of monetary
conditions, the Copom decided, unanimously, to reduce the Selic
rate to 11 percent a year, without a bias. The Copom understands
that, by timely mitigating the effects coming from a more
restrictive global environment, a moderate adjustment in the
level of the basic rate is consistent with the scenario of
inflation converging to the target in 2012.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
