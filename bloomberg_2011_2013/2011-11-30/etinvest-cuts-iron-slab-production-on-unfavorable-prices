Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, said it will cut output of iron and merchant slab at
its  Azovstal (AZST)  plant in December due to low demand and unfavorable
prices.  Iron production will be 13.7 percent lower next month than
initially planned and merchant slab production will be 29
percent lower than planned for December, the company’s press
service said today in an e-mailed statement.  Metinvest will also cut its production plans for the first
quarter of next year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
