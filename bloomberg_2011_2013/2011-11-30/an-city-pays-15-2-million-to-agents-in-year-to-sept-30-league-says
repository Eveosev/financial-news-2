Premier League leader  Manchester
City  paid almost 9.7 million pounds ($15.2 million) to agents in
the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the most of any club in English
soccer’s top division.  Tottenham, Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle also paid over
6 million pounds to agents during the period, including payments
on behalf of players, the Premier League said in a statement
today.  There were 765 player transactions from Oct. 1, 2010 to
Sept. 30, 2011, not all of which attracted an agent’s fee, the
league said. From the 2009-10 season onwards Premier League
clubs have had to publish the total amount paid.  The overall figure of 71.9 million pounds from the 20
current Premier League clubs is seven percent higher than the
previous year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
