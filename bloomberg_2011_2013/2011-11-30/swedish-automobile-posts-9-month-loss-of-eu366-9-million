Swedish Automobile NV  posted a net
loss of 366.9 million euros ($493 million) in the nine months to
Sept. 30, compared with a net loss of 104.1 million euros in the
seven months to Sept. 30 last year, the company said in a
statement today.  The company posted a third-quarter Ebit loss of 87.5
million euros and sales of 75.8 million euros in the period, it

Automobile’s future and the company faces “much uncertainty”
in completing a deal to structure investments by Zhejiang
Youngman Lotus Automobile and Pang Da Automobile Trade Co.  “We will consider all options for the company, including
an orderly wind-down.” Chief Executive Officer Victor Muller
said in the statement.  Swedish Automobile “foresees a substantial net loss for
2011,” the company also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
