NTPC Ltd. ,  India ’s biggest power
producer, is seeking fresh bids for 4 million metric tons of
coal from overseas after scrapping a previous tender.  The utility has taken steps to promote competition this
time after a disappointing response to the previous invitation,
Chairman Arup Roy Choudhury said by telephone from  New Delhi .  NTPC previously invited bids by May 26 for a single
contract to supply 4 million tons of coal needed at 14 of its
 power plants . This time, orders may be awarded to as many as
five suppliers, Choudhury said.  Coal production growth in India has slowed after delays in
environmental approvals and land acquisition for mines. The
commodity is used to fire more than half of the electricity
generation capacity in  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer.  State-run NTPC is going ahead with coal imports although
the rupee has fallen, the chairman said. The Indian currency
declined 6.7 percent this month 52.21 per dollar, the most since
March 1992.  “If the rupee goes to 100 per dollar, then it becomes a
bigger deal, but right now there’s been no hue and cry from our
buyers,” Choudhury said.  The current bidding opened on Nov. 21 and will close on
Dec. 23, according to documents posted on NTPC’s tenders
website.  -- Editors: John Chacko, Thomas Kutty Abraham  To contact the reporter on this story:
