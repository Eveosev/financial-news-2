 German plant and  machinery orders 
rose in October, supported by domestic demand, the VDMA machine-
makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, rose 1 percent from a year
earlier after increasing at the same pace in September, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders rose 5 percent, while orders from abroad fell 1
percent. In the three months through October, overall orders
climbed 5 percent from a year earlier.  “The slump in orders expected by some still hasn’t
happened,” Ralph Weichers, VDMA chief economist, said in the
statement. “The continued deceleration in demand for machinery
could primarily be due to cyclical factors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
