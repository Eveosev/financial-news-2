OAO Sberbank ,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, rose the most in five months in  New York  after reporting
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates and as the company
raised its forecast for the year.  Moscow-based Sberbank’s American depositary receipts
climbed 10 percent to $11.85 at the close of trading in New
York, the biggest one-day advance since they began trading.  Relative to Europe-based banks, Sberbank is in a much
better financial position, Leonid Slipchenko, a banking analyst
at UralSib Financial Corp., said by phone from Moscow.  “It doesn’t have risky instruments, it has strong margins,
a balanced forex structure, its credit risks are lower,”
Slipchenko said.  Third-quarter profit surged 74 percent to 79.8 billion
rubles ($2.6 billion), the bank said on its website, beating the
average estimate of 75 billion rubles from nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Chief Financial Officer Anton Karamzin said the bank raised its profit forecast for this year
to as much as 310 billion rubles during a conference with
analysts.  The stock also gained after six central banks led by the
 Federal Reserve  lowered the cost of emergency dollar funding for
financial companies in a global effort to ease  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  Sberbank added 6 percent to 87.55 rubles on Russia’s Micex
index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
