The U.S. House of Representatives
passed legislation that would block the  National Labor Relations
Board ’s plan to speed the pace for conducting union elections.  The Republican-led House voted 235-188 today for a bill
that would delay employee balloting on forming a union until at
least 35 days after workers make a request. Businesses say the
NLRB’s plan for quicker union elections would limit their chance
to make a case against establishing a union. Labor officials say
the NLRB proposal removes obstacles that deny workers a chance
to vote.  The bill must be passed by the Democratic-Senate, and
signed by President Barack Obama -- a union supporter --  to
become law.  The bill is H.R. 3094.  To contact the reporter on this story:
