Coal supply fell to “critical”
levels at plants with 70 percent of  India ’s electricity-
generating capacity after they received less fuel or produced
more power than forecast, the Central Electricity Authority said.  Fifty-two coal-fired generators, more than half of the 89
thermal-power plants in India, had stockpiles of less than seven
days’ supply on Nov. 27, the supervisory body said in a report
on its  website.  That compared with 46 such plants a month
earlier and  29  units a year ago.  Among those plants, 31 were at a “super critical” status,
with less than four days of stock. That compares with 14 such
plants a year earlier, according to the government. Typical
stocks are 15 to 30 days, it said.  Indian power utilities fell short by 85 percent of the
capacity needed to meet the government’s target in October,
according to government data. Electricity production last month
rose 4.9 percent to 74,083 million kilowatt-hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
