Ukraine’s  current-account  deficit
widened to $1.5 billion in October from the previous month,
spurred by imports of machine-building equipment, the central
bank said.  The gap compares with a $1 billion deficit in September,
the  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy , based in the capital, Kiev, said
today in a statement on its website. Ukraine had a $7 billion
shortfall in the first ten months of 2011, compared with a $1.4
billion gap in the year-ago period, according to the regulator.  While increased imports of machine-building equipment
worsens the current account, it “lays the ground for better
competitiveness among domestic companies and improved economic
growth,” the bank said in the statement.  Exports rose 21 percent from a year earlier in October,
while imports jumped 54 percent, it said. The capital-account
deficit shrank to $96 million in October from $1 billion the
previous month, it added.  Foreign direct investment declined to $287 million last
month from $732 million in September, according to the bank. It
totaled $5.5 billion from January through October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
