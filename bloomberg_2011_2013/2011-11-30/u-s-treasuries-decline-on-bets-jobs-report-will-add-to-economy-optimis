Treasuries slipped, paring their
monthly gain, before a report economists said may show U.S.
employers added workers last month, fueling bets that yields are
too low given the outlook for economic growth.  The yield on 10-year bonds are bound for a monthly drop
that pushed them within 20 basis points of a record low. U.S.
companies added 130,000 workers in November, up from 110,000 in
October, according to a Bloomberg survey before a report by ADP
Employer Services. The Conference Board’s  index  of  consumer
confidence  jumped more than economists predicted in November,
according a report yesterday. Euro-area finance ministers
yesterday approved enhancements to the region’s  bailout  fund.  “The market is caught between a rock and hard place” amid
the European sovereign-debt crisis and an economic recovery in
the U.S., said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument Securities
Ltd. in  London . “There are buyers on setbacks but there are not
many buyers who will chase it through 2 percent yields on 10-
year” securities, he said.  The 30-year  yield  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.98 percent at 7:05 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
security due November 2041 lost 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face
amount, to 102 29/32.  Euro-area Turmoil  Ten-year yields were little changed at 2 percent and have
decreased about 11 basis points since Oct. 31 while  Germany ’s
10-year bund yield increased 27 basis points, set for the
biggest advance since December 2010.  Demand for the perceived safety of U.S. government
securities resulted in a 1.1 percent gain this month as of
yesterday, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. German
debt lost 0.9 percent and Japanese bonds were little changed,
the indexes show. The MSCI All Country World  Index  of stocks
lost 6.6 percent this month.  Treasuries fluctuated the past three months as European
leaders tried to convince investors that nations in the region
will be able to pay their debts. The U.S. 10-year yield rose to
2.42 percent on Oct. 28, after reaching a record low 1.67
percent on Sept. 23.  “We still have a long, long way to go to settle the
European debt problem,” said Tsutomu Komiya, one of the bond
investors at Daiwa Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo , which oversees
the equivalent of $118.7 billion and is a unit of  Japan ’s
second-biggest brokerage. “It will help keep yields down,” he
said of  U.S. Treasuries .  The  Federal Reserve  is  scheduled  to sell as much as $8.75
billion of Treasuries due 2013 today as part of a plan announced
in September to replace $400 billion in shorter maturities with
longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
