Mark Williams , a London-based
economist at Capital Economics Ltd., comments on  China ’s
monetary policy after the nation cut the amount of cash that
banks must set aside as reserves for the first time since 2008.  Reserve ratios will decline by 50 basis points effective
Dec. 5, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement on its
website today. Before the announcement, the level was a record
21.5 percent for the biggest lenders, based on previous PBOC
statements.  “This is a clear signal from China’s policy makers that
they are changing direction. Further reserve-requirement cuts
will follow over the next few months and we can expect to see a
significant rebound in lending as well to counter the economic
slowdown.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
