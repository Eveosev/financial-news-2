The Court of Arbitration for Sport
won’t consider a request by Swiss anti-doping authorities to ban
1997 Tour de France champion Jan Ullrich from cycling, saying
the case falls outside its jurisdiction.  The Lausanne, Switzerland-based tribunal said in a
statement it would rule on a separate appeal by cycling’s ruling
body seeking sanctions against Ullrich in six weeks. Both
appeals are linked to the ‘Operacion Puerto’ blood-doping
investigation in 2006. Ullrich, a German who raced with a Swiss
license, quit cycling in 2007 when he denied doping.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
