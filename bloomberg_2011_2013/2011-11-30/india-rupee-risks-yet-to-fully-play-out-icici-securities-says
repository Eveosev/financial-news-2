T.S. Harihar, co-head of
institutional derivatives at ICICI Securities Ltd., comments on
 India ’s economic growth outlook. He spoke by phone from Mumbai.  India’s $1.7 trillion economy expanded last quarter at the
slowest pace in more than two years after the nation’s central
bank raised borrowing costs by a record to tame the fastest
inflation among the so-called BRIC nations.  Gross domestic product increased 6.9 percent in the three
months ended Sept. 30, government data showed today. That’s the
weakest since the second quarter of 2009, and matches the median
of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  On GDP data:  “While GDP numbers are in line with street estimates, the
risks related to company balance sheets due to a weak rupee are
yet to fully play out. Company balance sheets will be impacted
by foreign-exchange losses and banks will be hit by rising non-
performing assets.  ‘‘The rupee slide will contribute as much as 45 percent to
50 percent to the decline in profits of Nifty companies in the
next two quarters. In the three months ended September, rupee
weakness may have contributed 30 percent to the earnings drop.  ‘‘Industries importing will inevitably take a hit. Even
exporters like software companies will lose out due to cuts in
client-spending. Rupee does not look like it will come back to
46 levels anytime soon. There is pain for the next two to three
quarters.’’  India’s rupee has slumped 14.6 percent against the dollar
since Jan. 1, the most in  Asia , increasing the cost of repaying
foreign debt. Foreign convertible bonds of 25 of 28 companies in
the BSE-500 Index may be redeemed when they mature by March
2013, causing an outflow of 330 billion rupees, Edelweiss
Securities Ltd. said in a Nov. 23 note.  On derivative activity:  ‘‘Traders are buying put options at 4,500 and 4,600 strikes
anticipating a further downside. Big institutions are buying the
naked put options, which indicate that Nifty may fall to as low
as 4,200 levels by the end of this fiscal’’ on March 31, 2012,
he said.  The  S&P CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. fell 0.3 percent to 4,791.3 at 2:38 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
