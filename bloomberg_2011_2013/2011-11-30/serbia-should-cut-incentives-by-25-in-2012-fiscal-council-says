Serbia  must reduce subsidies and
credit support for the economy by a quarter next year to avoid
exceeding a budget gap limit, a member of the country’s Fiscal
Council said.  The incentives totaled some 80 billion dinars ($1.02
billion) this year and must be slashed in 2012 if all
expenditures are to fit into the deficit of 4.25 percent of
gross domestic product, as agreed with the  International
Monetary Fund , said Vladimir Vuckovic. The commitment is part of
Serbia’s $1.48 billion precautionary loan deal with the IMF.  “There are many inelastic items in the budget, such as
public wages and pensions whose adjustment for inflation is
mandatory, so it’s necessary to cut where possible,” Vuckovic
said, speaking at a debate on fiscal planning in Belgrade today.
The government is to present its 2012 budget by Dec. 15.  Reducing the support may backfire with a drop in foreign
direct investment, Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said at the
same event, citing the government subsidy of as much as 10,000
euros paid to investors for each new job created. Also, many
businesses struggle with liquidity and if they shut down, budget
revenue will dwindle, he said.  “Nominally, we’ve been out of recession for many months,
but in reality the crisis is still strongly felt and helping the
real economy stay afloat is vital,” Ciric said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
