Salzgitter AG , the German
steelmaker, said its 2011 profit after tax will be about 100
million euros ($135 million) higher after it combined its
domestic holdings into a single unit for tax purposes.  The company’s forecast of about 200 million euros in fiscal
2011 pretax profit will be unchanged, it said in a statement
issued today on PR Newswire. Salzgitter said the overhaul won’t
involve changes in the company’s management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
