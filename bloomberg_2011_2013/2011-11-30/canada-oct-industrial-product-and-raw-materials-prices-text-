The following is the text of
the industrial product and raw material prices report as
reported by  Statistics Canada .  Between September and October, the Industrial Product
Price Index (IPPI) and the Raw Materials Price Index
(RMPI) declined 0.1% and 1.2% respectively, as a result of
a sharp decrease in the price of metals.  Prices for industrial goods decline slightly  The IPPI edged down in October, following increases of
0.4% in August and 0.5% in September. The decline in the
index was mainly attributable to primary metal products 
(-4.4%).  The decrease in the demand for primary metals was more
pronounced in October, particularly for precious metals.
Prices were down 16.3% for silver and platinum, 12.5% for
precious metal basic manufactured shapes, and 5.0% for
gold and gold alloy in primary forms.  All other metal groups except iron and steel products
posted substantial declines. Prices for primary copper
products (-12.7%), primary aluminum products (-3.9%) and
primary nickel products (-5.8%) were particularly
sensitive to the global economic slowdown.  The decrease in the IPPI in October was moderated by
higher prices for motor vehicles (+1.2%), petroleum and
coal (+0.6%) and pulp and paper products (+0.7%).  In October, the decline of the Canadian dollar relative
to the US dollar continued for a third straight month. The
decrease in the exchange rate (-1.7%) led to higher
prices, especially for motor vehicles and pulp and paper
products.  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
generally paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the weakness of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar in October had the effect of
increasing the corresponding prices in Canadian dollars.
Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI would
have declined 0.5% instead of edging down 0.1%.  Excluding petroleum and coal prices, the IPPI declined
0.2% in October following a 0.6% increase in September.  12-month change in the IPPI: Slower growth in October  The IPPI rose 4.7% in October compared with the same
month a year earlier, a slightly lower growth rate than
those observed from June to September. Of the 21 major
commodity aggregations, 19 were up in October compared
with 14 in September.  Relative to October 2010, the IPPI was pushed upward
mainly by higher prices for petroleum and coal products
(+25.2%). Chemical products (+7.5%), and fruit, vegetables
and feeds (+5.2%) also contributed to the advance.  Year over year, petroleum and coal products continued
their upward trend, having posted increases since November
2009. The growth of prices in October was slower than in
September (+30.2%), but remained comparable with the rates
observed since March.  Year over year, excluding petroleum and coal prices,
the IPPI rose 2.3% in October, comparable to the average
year-over-year growth rate for the first 10 months of
2011.  Year over year, primary metal products had little
impact overall on the growth of the IPPI in October.
Increases in precious metals and iron and steel products
were almost completely offset by declines in nickel,
copper and aluminum products.  Raw Materials  Price Index : Pushed upward by non-ferrous
metals  The RMPI declined 1.2% in October after increasing 1.4%
in September. The index was pulled downward mainly by the
prices of non-ferrous metals (-8.8%) and vegetable
products (-3.5%).  Prices decreased in October for all non-ferrous metals
except radioactive concentrates, which rose 2.8%. The
largest contributors were copper and nickel concentrates 
(-12.0%), non-ferrous metal scrap (-13.4%), precious metals
(-7.9%) and zinc concentrates (-9.2%).  The declines in vegetable products in October were
observed for grains (-2.3%), unrefined sugar (-13.0%) and
natural rubber (-6.8%). Increased supply affected the
price of corn (-8.1%) and unrefined sugar, while the
decline in natural rubber prices was attributable to lower
demand in  Asia .  In October, the decline in the RMPI was moderated by
increases in animal products (+3.4%) and mineral fuels
(+0.7%).  Prices for hogs for slaughter rose sharply (+11.3%) as
a result of heavy demand, both domestic and foreign, and
limited supply. Prices for cattle and calves for slaughter
increased 4.4%.  Crude  oil prices  were very volatile in October,
resulting in a slight increase of 0.9%. Crude oil
inventories were down in the  United States , and prospects
for economic growth were better.  Excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI would have declined
2.9% in October following a 1.0% decrease in September.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI
rose 11.3% in October, a lower growth rate than in
September (+15.1%). The main factors in the year-over-year
increase were higher prices for mineral fuels (+19.2%),
animals and animal products (+14.8%) and vegetable
products (+12.7%). Non-ferrous metals (-4.2%) moderated
the growth of the RMPI, posting their first decline since
September 2009.  Year over year, excluding mineral fuels, the RMPI rose
4.7% in October. This marked the fourth consecutive
decline in the growth rate since the 19.4% increase in
June.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months
(for example, when the July index is released, the index
for the previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave
the plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer
pays. Unlike the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes
indirect taxes and all the costs that occur between the
time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user
takes possession of it, including transportation,
wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often
indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in
US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian
dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor
vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products. Therefore, a rise
or fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US
counterpart affects the IPPI. But the conversion into
Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents provide
their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that
is a more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is
based on the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot
rate) established by the  Bank of Canada , and it is
available on CANSIM in table 176-0064 (series v37426).
Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as
described in the text, are calculated according to the
indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example,
CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the
prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw
materials. Many of those prices are set on the world
market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign
currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has
only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
