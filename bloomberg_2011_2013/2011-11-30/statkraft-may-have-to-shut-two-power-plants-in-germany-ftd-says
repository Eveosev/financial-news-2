Statkraft AS may have to shut two
gas-fired  power plants  in northern  Germany  because of too much
wind power in the region,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing Statkraft Markets head Juergen Tzschoppe.  The company is “checking whether it can keep” the Emden
and Landesbergen units in Lower Saxony with a combined capacity
of about 1 gigawatt, Tzschoppe told the FTD. The expansion of
wind power in the region has reduced the plants’ yearly
operating hours from between 1,000 and 2,000 to a few hundred,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
