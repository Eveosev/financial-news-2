Australia ’s dollar fell from almost a
two-week high versus its U.S. counterpart after government
reports showed consumer spending slowed and building approvals
dropped, strengthening the case for  interest-rate  cuts by the
central bank.  The Aussie declined versus all of its 16 most-traded peers
and New Zealand’s currency snapped a three-day gain against the
greenback as an index of Chinese manufacturing indicated a
contraction for the first time since February 2009.  China  is
Australia’s largest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-
biggest export destination.  “Housing and the consumer are still a very big part of the
Australian economy, so this is not a great result and adds to
the case that there should be further monetary policy easing,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in Singapore at
Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest lender. “The
data has given the Aussie a kick lower, and it should trend down
a little from here.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.7 percent to $1.0213 at 12:21
p.m. in  New York . It touched $1.0328 yesterday, the strongest
since Nov. 14. The Aussie depreciated 0.6 percent to 79.32 yen.
New Zealand’s dollar weakened 0.5 percent to 77.68 U.S. cents
and declined 0.4 percent to 60.32 yen.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments in Australia fell 10.7 percent in October from
the previous month, when they dropped a revised 14.2 percent,
the Bureau of Statistics said today. None of the 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a decline.  A purchasing managers’ index compiled by the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing fell to 49 in November
from 50.4 in October. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 18 economists was 49.8. A level above 50 indicates expansion.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut its benchmark interest
rate on Oct. 31 to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent. It meets next
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
