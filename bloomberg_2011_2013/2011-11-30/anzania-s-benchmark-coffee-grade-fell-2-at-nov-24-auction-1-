Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 2 percent at an auction on Nov. 24, tracking a decline in
global markets, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the benchmark AA grade dropped to
$286.85 for 50 kilograms (110 pounds) from $292.79 a week
earlier, the board said today by e-mail from Moshi, in northern
Tanzania. The grade sold for as much as $340.80 for 50
kilograms, up from $321 a week earlier, according to the board.
Supplies of the grade fell 28 percent to 4,152 bags, it said.  Total supplies at the 13th auction of the 2011-12 season
rose 19.5 percent to 21,972 bags from 18,391 bags a week
earlier, the board said. Sales at the auction climbed 9.9
percent to 18,469 bags from 16,806 bags, the agency said.
Tanzania prices its coffee per 50 kilograms while offers and
sales are in 60-kilogram bags.  The country harvests the crop from April to August.
Arabica accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output.  The following are details of the Nov. 24 auction in U.S.
