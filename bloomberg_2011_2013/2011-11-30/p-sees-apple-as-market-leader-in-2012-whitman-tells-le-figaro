Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  Chief Executive
Officer  Meg Whitman  expects Apple Inc. to overtake the company
as the market leader in personal computers in 2012, she told  Le
Figaro  in an interview.  “It’s possible if you integrate the tablets,” she was
cited as saying by the French daily. “We will try to be
champion again in 2013. It will take time for the products that
I have influence on to make it to the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
