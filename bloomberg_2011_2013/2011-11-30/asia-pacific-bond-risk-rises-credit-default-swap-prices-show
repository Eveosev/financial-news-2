The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment climbed,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3 basis points to
214 as of 11:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. Thatâ€™s set for its first increase since Nov. 25, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc., and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 2 basis points to 226 as of
8:11 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 0.5 basis points to
205.5 basis points as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
