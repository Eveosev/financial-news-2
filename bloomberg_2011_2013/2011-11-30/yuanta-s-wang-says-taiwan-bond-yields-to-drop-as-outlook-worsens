James Wang , a fixed-income trader at
Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei, comments on Taiwan’s bond
market in a phone interview today.  “There’s still speculation of lower rates out there.
Together with some pessimism over the economic outlook, yields
should edge slightly lower in the near term.  “Bonds will be range-bound before the central bank reviews
borrowing costs in December.  “Personally, I don’t think the central bank will lower
 interest rates . It’s already at a very low level, cutting it
won’t create much impact on the markets.”  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 was little
changed at 1.037 percent from 1.04 percent yesterday, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate on the 10-year
notes maturing in September 2021 was 1.319 percent.  “Some people have been doing flattener trades recently,”
Wang said. “They like to long 10- and 20-year bonds and short
the five-year ones.  “Ten-year yields will reach as low as 1.3 percent by year-
end, while five-year rates could test the 1 percent level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
