Rompetrol Group NV,  Romania ’s
second-biggest oil company, began drilling a test well in the
central Romanian county of Prahova to search for oil for  OMV
Petrom SA (SNP)  as part of contract between the two companies.  Rompetrol’s drilling unit plans to invest about $8.5
million in operating the well, which is part of a $29 million
service-providing contract with Petrom, Romania’s biggest oil
company, Rompetrol said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The investment was focused on the purchasing of a
performance-drilling unit,” said Gheorghe Georgescu, the unit’s
general manager. “The company experience in drilling services
and repairing of wells in 15 countries will allow us to develop
these activities in Romania, both onshore and in the  Black
Sea .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
