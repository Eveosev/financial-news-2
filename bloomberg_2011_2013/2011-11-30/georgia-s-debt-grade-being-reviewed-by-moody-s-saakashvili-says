Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Moody’s Investors Service is reviewing the
Black Sea nation’s debt rating, a week after it was raised one
level to BB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  “ Georgia  was one of few countries to have its rating
upgraded and we’re proud of it,” Saakashvili told a Georgian-
Armenian business conference today in the capital, Tbilisi.
Economy Minister Vera Kobalia said in an interview today that
she is scheduled to meet with Moody’s tomorrow.  Georgia is rated Ba3 by Moody’s, three levels below
investment grade and equivalent to S&P’s assessment. S&P has a
stable outlook on Georgia, meaning its credit score, which is
one level higher than Ukraine and Albania, is more likely to
remain unchanged than to be lowered or increased, the ratings
company said in a Nov. 22 statement.  Georgia is seeking to revive its $11.7 billion economy by
luring investments in energy and tourism. Gross domestic product
grew 6.3 percent in 2010 after shrinking 3.8 percent the
previous year. Economic growth may to accelerate to 7 percent
this year, Saakashvili said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
