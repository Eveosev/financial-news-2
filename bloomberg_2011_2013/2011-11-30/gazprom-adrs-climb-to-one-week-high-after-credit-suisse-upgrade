OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , Russia’s gas export
monopoly, rose the most in more than a month in  New York  after
Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded the company’s stock.  Gazprom’s American depositary receipts climbed 5.3 percent
to $11.50 at the close of trading in New York, after earlier
gaining as much as 5.8 percent to $11.55, the biggest gain since
Oct. 27.  Credit Suisse raised Moscow-based Gazprom to “neutral”
from “underperform” and lifted the target price for the ADRs
to $5.70, from $5.30. Investors have already “priced in” the
company’s increased capital expenditure and the slowdown in
growth of gas tariffs, analysts led by Andrey Ovchinnikov at
Credit Suisse in Moscow wrote in a research note e-mailed today.  “The negative news flow has ended, we don’t see a big
downside in the near term,” Ovchinnikov said by phone from
 London .  Gazprom  added 2.8 percent to close at 175.39 rubles on
Russia’s Micex index, the highest level since Nov. 18. One
Gazprom ADR is equal to two ordinary shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
