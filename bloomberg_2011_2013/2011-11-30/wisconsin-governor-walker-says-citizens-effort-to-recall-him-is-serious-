(Corrects timing of action in first paragraph of story
originally published Nov. 30.)  Wisconsin  Governor  Scott Walker , a
Republican who this year limited the bargaining rights of some
public-sector workers, said he views the attempt by unions to
oust him as a credible threat.  “Do I take the recall seriously? Absolutely,” Walker told
reporters today at a meeting of the  Republican Governors
Association  in Orlando,  Florida . “Unions spent $40 million on
six state Senate recall elections in my state. I spent $13
million running for governor. So if there’s that much outside
influence, I’m going to take that seriously no matter what.”  Walker, 44, who took office in January, drew the wrath of
unions and faced protests after pushing through a measure
restricting collective bargaining for public employees other
than police and firefighters. In August, voters ousted two
Republican state senators in recall elections aimed at lawmakers
who backed Walker’s legislation.  The governor’s opponents said Nov. 28 they had collected
300,000 signatures of the 540,208 they need by Jan. 17 to force
a recall election next year, the  Associated Press  reported.  Walker said he doesn’t see a parallel in  Ohio , where voters
last month overturned Republican Governor John Kasich’s
legislation restricting unions.  “Every day, every week and every month that goes by, the
voters of my state will more clearly see the benefits of the
reforms,” he said. “People have a clear choice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
