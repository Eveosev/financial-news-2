Real estate investment growth in
 China  will slow next year from 2011 because of a correction in
the  property market , said Qin Hong, head of the policy research
center under the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  “Massive” spending for public housing projects in 2012
and 2013 won’t be enough to make up for a slowdown in
construction of commercial residential property, Qin told
reporters at a conference in Beijing today. Forecasts for zero
growth or a decline in  investment  next year would be “too
pessimistic,” Qin said.  Slowing property investment prompted by China’s campaign to
rein in home prices with mortgages and purchase restrictions
would also limit cement, steel and power demand and reduce
 economic growth , according to economists including Nomura
Holdings Inc.’s Zhang Zhiwei.  Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  said this month that the curbs
imposed to prevent a property bubble and boost affordability
should be maintained after  home prices  in October fell in 33 of
70 cities monitored by the government.  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
