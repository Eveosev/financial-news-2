Emerging-market stocks advanced,
paring a monthly loss, as the  Federal Reserve  and five other
central banks cut the cost of emergency dollar funding for
European banks to help alleviate the region’s debt crisis.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  gained 2.1 percent to
928.32 by 4:52 p.m. in  New York , reducing its drop in November
to 6.7 percent.  Brazil ’s Bovespa index rose 2.8 percent, the

six regulators, including the Bank of  Japan  and the  Swiss
National Bank , cut the  interest rate  to the dollar overnight
index swap rate and extended the program aimed at easing access
to cash until 2013.  China  also reduced the amount banks are
required to keep in reserve for the first time since 2008 as the
euro-area crisis threatens exports and growth in the world’s
fastest growing major economy.  The move by global central banks “shows there is concerted
international action and that’s what people want to see,” Simon Quijano-Evans, the chief economist and head of emerging markets
research at ING Bank NV in  London , said by phone. “We needed
some sort of action to reduce the pressure on money markets and
an increase in liquidity to bridge over this confidence gap.”  Bovespa (IBOV) , Real  The emerging markets index earlier dropped as much as 0.6
percent after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the credit ratings of some

shares  gained as much as 9.9 percent.  Brazil’s real jumped 2 percent to 1.8085 per dollar.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, added 3 percent to 22.05 reais as crude  oil prices  in
New York jumped to a two-week high and the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said it had found “good-quality” oil in the  Santos
Basin  off Brazil’s coast. Consumer-goods maker  Hypermarcas SA 
rose 2.5 percent to 8.15 reais.  Cemex,  Mechel (MTLR)   Oil for January delivery gained as much as 2 percent to
$101.75 a barrel as the coordinated central bank action and a
report showing U.S. companies added more workers than projected
bolstered prospects for global energy demand.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker in the Americas,
climbed for a third day on the IPC in Mexico City and gained 6.9
percent to 6.34 pesos. OAO Mechel,  Russia ’s largest coal
producer for steelmakers, was the biggest gainer on the Micex,
rising 10 percent to 328.10 rubles.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 raw materials
climbed as much as 1.7 percent to a two-week high, led by gains
in industrial and precious metals.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , Poland’s largest bank, rose 5.8 percent
to 33.42 zloty in Warsaw after the  Central Statistics Office

months to Sept. 30 from a year earlier, compared with the 4
percent median estimate of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Mexican Peso, Ruble  The Mexican peso strengthened for a third day, adding 1.5

4.7 percent to 54,517.76.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or  Sensex (SENSEX) , rose 0.7 percent
to 16,123.46, paring its monthly loss to 8.9 percent.  India’s
economy  expanded 6.9 percent in the third quarter, a government
report released today showed, the slowest pace in more than two
years.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  tumbled 3.3 percent to
2,333.414 before the cut to bank reserve requirements, the
biggest one-day drop in almost four months, after central bank
adviser Xia Bin said China’s monetary policy “fine-tuning”
doesn’t mean credit controls will be loosened and that people
shouldn’t expect a reversal of curbs to the property market.  China Citic Bank Corp. (601998)  dropped 3.6 percent to 4.04 yuan in
 Shanghai  and  Poly Real Estate Group Co.  slipped 1.1 percent to
