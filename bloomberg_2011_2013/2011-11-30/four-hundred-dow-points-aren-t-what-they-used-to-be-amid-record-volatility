(Corrects story published Nov. 30 to restore “there have
been concerns” to comment in 10th paragraph.)  What does today’s stock rally equal
in past markets? About half as much.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  reached 12,045.68, up
490.05 points from yesterday’s close. Adjusting for the market’s
volatility in 2011, the gain is equal to about 240 points in the
first nine years of the last decade, Bloomberg data show.  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis has fueled some of the
biggest stock swings ever during the last four months. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has moved 1.7 percent on average
each day, compared with 0.8 percent before September 2008, when
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “It feels like a good day, but whether or not it’s
sustainable is another thing,”  Hayes Miller , who helps oversee
about $43 billion as the Boston-based head of  asset allocation 
in  North America  at Baring Asset Management Inc., said in a
telephone interview. “We’re not buying it. This rally isn’t
going to shake us from being more cautious on risk assets for
the first half of 2012.”  The Dow surged 4.2 percent, the most since March 2009,
after central banks acted to make additional funds available to
lenders.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Bank of America Corp. advanced
at least 7.3 percent today as the  Federal Reserve  and five
central banks lowered  interest rates  on dollar swaps and  China 
cut banks’ reserve requirements.  Central Banks  The S&P 500 gained 4.3 percent to 1,246.96 today as only 10
stocks fell. The index has risen 7.6 percent in three days, the
most since March 2009. More than 10 billion  shares  changed hands
on U.S. exchanges today, compared with the three-month daily
average of 8.77 billion.  The S&P 500 has climbed 3 percent or more in a day 36 times
in the three years since Lehman’s collapse, or about once a
month. That compares with 27 times for the nine years before, or
about 0.3 times a month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Dow’s intraday move has exceeded 100 points every day in
November except one, Nov. 18.  Equity markets worldwide have been tumbling since July 22
as the U.S. had its  credit rating  slashed by S&P and investors
speculated the European debt crisis is spreading. The  VIX (VIX) , as
the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known,
has averaged 33.5 since then. While it fell 9.3 percent to 27.80
today, dropping below 30 for the first time since Nov. 11, it’s
still 35 percent above its average since 1990.  ‘Human Behavior’  “In terms of natural human behavior, markets become more
volatile when there’s higher level of uncertainty as to the
economic outlook worldwide,” Richard Skaggs, the Boston-based
senior equity strategist at Loomis Sayles & Co., which manages
about $160 billion, said in a telephone interview today.  “In 2011, we faced a number of questions -- is China
slowing and by how much?” he said. “In Europe, we have moved
from a slow-growth forecast to a consensus that it’s due for at
least a mild recession. In the U.S., there have been concerns on
the potential for a double-dip recession.” Skaggs said that
based on data since the summer, there’s no chance for another
economic contraction.  Speculation about Europe’s debt crisis has been spurring
near-lockstep movement in equity prices. The correlation of  S&P
500 (SPX)   companies  to gains or losses in the full index increased to
a record 0.86 last month, according to data compiled by Birinyi
Associates Inc. in Westport,  Connecticut . A level of 1 would
mean all 500 stocks moved together. Correlation was 0.79
yesterday, 74 percent higher than its average since 1980.  400-Point Moves  The  Dow  alternated between gains and losses of more than
400 points on four days in August, the longest streak ever.  The swings have taken a toll on professional investors.
Less than 24 percent of 542 categories of funds tracked by
Morningstar Inc. have topped their benchmark indexes this year,
the fewest since at least 1999. A Hedge Fund Research Inc.  index 
of industrywide performance has fallen 3.3 percent this year.
It’s only the third annual loss since 1990 and the biggest
decline since 2008, when it plunged 19 percent, according to
data from the Chicago-based firm.  “We had the worst Thanksgiving week since the ‘30s and
then you turn around, you have a 8 percent rally in three
days,’’  William Nichols , senior managing director in equity
trading at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, said in a phone
interview today. ‘‘Everything is great in terms of this nice
move, but you look year-to-date, the Dow is up 3 percent, the
S&P is still down and the U.S. is outperforming other markets.’’  Record Earnings  Investors who ignore the swings and focus on record
corporate earnings may be better off,  David Kelly , who helps
oversee $394 billion as chief market strategist for JPMorgan
Funds in New York, said in a phone interview.  The  S&P 500  gained or lost 2 percent or more almost three
times a month during the  bear market  that began in 2000, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s about three times the average
between 2002 and September 2008. Stocks ended up recovering and
the S&P 500 went on to reach a record high of 1,565.15 in
October 2007.  ‘‘If I’m a long-term investor, I’d try to ignore the
volatility,” Kelly said. “To me the most remarkable thing in
all these screens today, the S&P 500 is within 10 points of
where we are at the start of the year,” he said. “It’s very
important for long-term investors to recognize that most of the
zigs were offset with zags.”  Lehman’s Bankruptcy  After Lehman’s bankruptcy spurred the biggest financial
crisis since the Great Depression, the S&P 500’s daily moves
averaged 2.8 percent through March 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. While the index has surged 84 percent
since March 9, 2009, it has fallen 8.6 percent since April 29
and dropped 0.9 percent in 2011.  Strategists expect the S&P 500 to end the year at 1,274,
according to the average of 12 projections in a Bloomberg
survey. Their forecasts range from 1,130 to 1,425.  The benchmark measure of U.S. equities has averaged a 2.1
percent move between its intraday lows and highs during the past
month, compared with the 1.3 percent average since 1982,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 30-day average
reached 6.9 percent in October 2008, the highest in record.  “Uncertainty is high,” said  Brian Belski , Oppenheimer &
Co.’s New York-based chief investment strategist, in an
interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with
Betty Liu. “Investors aren’t investing, they’re just trading
and reacting to these sound bites.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
