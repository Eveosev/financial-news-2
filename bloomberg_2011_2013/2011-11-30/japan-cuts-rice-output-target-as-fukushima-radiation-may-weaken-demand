Japan  cut its production target of
rice for food after this year’s harvest exceeded consumption and
as demand may decline further after discoveries of grain tainted
by radioactive cesium.  Output will be 7.93 million metric tons in 2012, down from
this year’s target of 7.95 million tons, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in a report today. The
harvest reached 8.13 million tons as of Oct. 15, outpacing
demand of 8.05 million tons in the year to June 30, 2012.  Good weather boosted grain production in Japan this year
even after a record earthquake and tsunami in March destroyed
some paddy fields in the nation’s northeast. Fallout from a
crippled nuclear plant in Fukushima prefecture contaminated rice
in the region with cesium, triggering a shipment ban and
boosting food-safety concerns.  “Safety concerns may weaken consumer demand for the
grain,” Takeharu Imashiro, director-general for the ministry’s
crop production department, said today. “We will take
appropriate measures to address the concerns.”  Farmers adjust their planting of the grain every year in
line with the government’s production target. Some fields may be
barred from planting next year because of contaminated soil,
according to the ministry.  Inventories Climb  Inventories of rice for food held by producers and
distributors will increase to 1.89 million tons at the end of
June 2012 from 1.81 million tons a year earlier, according to
the report today. The volume will be the highest since 2010, the
ministry said, revising its July forecast that stockpiles may
drop to a four-year low of 1.7 million tons.  The government plans to hold 910,000 tons of domestic rice
for food in reserves at the end of June next year, up from
880,000 tons a year earlier.  Japan extended a ban on rice shipments beyond Fukushima
City yesterday after authorities found grain with cesium levels
exceeding the official limit had been sold to consumers.  The ban includes the Oguni and Tsukidate areas of Date City,
which neighbors Fukushima City where the first case of rice
exceeding the limit was detected earlier this month. About 9
kilograms of rice from Oguni was sold to local buyers.  Japan, the largest corn importer, is self-sufficient in
rice and the government protects growers from foreign
competition with an import tariff of 341 yen ($4.38) a kilogram.  The country agreed to give minimum-market access to rice-
exporting countries at the  Uruguay Round  of world trade talks in
1993, buying 770,000 tons a year.  Japan imported 11.29 million tons of rice from April 1995
to October 2011. Of the total, 3.75 million tons was sold to
domestic food processors, 2.74 million tons was used as aid to
foreign countries, 2.44 million tons was sold to Japanese feed
makers and 1.12 million tons was used as table rice, the
ministry’s report showed today.  Stockpiles of foreign rice stood at 960,000 tons at the end
of October, up from 870,000 tons on March 31, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
