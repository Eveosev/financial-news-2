Bank Indonesia  lowered its 2012
economic growth forecast, anticipating a global slowdown will
lead to a reduction in exports and damp domestic demand, Deputy
Governor Halim Alamsyah said.  The central bank estimates gross domestic product will
expand 6.3 percent next year, down from its previous forecast of
6.7 percent, Alamsyah said during a seminar in Jakarta today on
the global crisis’s effect on  Indonesia ’s economy. Bank
Indonesia expects economic growth this year of 6.6 percent.  “It’s possible to reach growth between 6.3 percent and 6.5
percent next year if there’s acceleration of fiscal expansion,”
Alamsyah told reporters after the seminar.  Europe’s debt crisis and a slowdown in the U.S. are sapping
export demand. UBS AG predicts the world economy will expand 2.7
percent next year, down from a previous estimate of 3.1 percent,
Hong Kong-based economist Wang Tao said in a note Nov. 29.
Citigroup Inc. cut its estimate to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent,
the sixth-straight monthly downgrade, economists led by  Willem Buiter  and  Michael Saunders  said in a report dated Nov. 28.  Bank Indonesia  cut its benchmark interest rate to a record-
low 6 percent Nov. 10 to encourage domestic consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
