The  International Monetary Fund 
doesn’t expect the Chinese economy to stagnate in the near
future, though growth will slow, El Comercio  reported , citing
comments by IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde .  The Asian country probably isn’t facing a significant
slowdown, Lagarde said in an interview with the Lima-based
newspaper.  While China will continue to  import  raw materials from
Latin America, the region must be braced for episodes of
instability, Lagarde said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
