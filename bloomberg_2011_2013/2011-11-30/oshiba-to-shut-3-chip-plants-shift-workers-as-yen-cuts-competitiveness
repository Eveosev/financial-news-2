Toshiba Corp. (6502)  will shut three
semiconductor factories in Japan and transfer about 1,700
workers by the end of September 2012 to boost competitiveness
eroded by a stronger yen.  The industrial group will consolidate single-function chip
production into three domestic factories after the closures,
Toshiba said in a  statement  today. It plans to relocate 1,200 of
the workers to group companies, and another 500 employees will
be moved under plans to halve output of 150-millimeter wafers at
one factory, spokesman  Keisuke Ohmori  said.  Toshiba is reorganizing production of less-profitable
discrete semiconductors, which are used for single functions
such as transistors, as a rising yen and slowing global economy
sap demand for consumer electronics. The Tokyo-based maker of
computers, nuclear reactors, televisions and home appliances
said it plans to cut output of discrete chips and system LSI
chips in  Japan  until the beginning of January.  The company plans to book charges for the closures next
fiscal year and has yet to determine the amount, Ohmori said.  Toshiba fell 1.1 percent to 347 yen at the close of trading
in  Tokyo  today.  The yen, which reached a post-World War II record last
month, has gained more than 9.6 percent in the past six months,
the best performance among 10 developed-nation peers tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  The currencyâ€™s advance hurts the overseas competitiveness
of Japanese manufacturers and reduces the value of repatriated
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
