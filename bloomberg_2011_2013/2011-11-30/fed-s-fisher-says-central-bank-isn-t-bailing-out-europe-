President  Richard Fisher  said the central bank is not “bailing
out Europe” with its decision to lower the cost of emergency
dollar funding for financial companies.  The Fed’s actions are not “bailing out European socialism,
or bailing out Europe,” he said in an interview with the Fox
Business Network that airs tonight. They are instead “trying to
meet a shortage of dollars.”  Fisher told the network “there is no dramatic event” that
prompted the action, which is part of an effort to make sure
“the recovery is gaining momentum.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
