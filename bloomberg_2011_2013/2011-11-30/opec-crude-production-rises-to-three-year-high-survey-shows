Oil production this month by the
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  rose to the
highest level in three years, led by surging Libyan output, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production  increased 390,000 barrels, or 1.3 percent, to an
average 30.355 million barrels a day from a revised 29.965
million, the most since November 2008, according to the survey
of  oil companies , producers and analysts. Daily output by the 11
members with quotas, all except  Iraq , climbed 340,000 barrels to
27.65 million, 2.805 million barrels above their target.  Libyan output  rose 155,000 barrels to 500,000 a day, the
highest level since February, the survey showed. Production in
the North African nation had tumbled from 1.585 million barrels
a day in January, the last month before an uprising against the
government of  Muammar Qaddafi  disrupted output.  Saudi Arabia , OPECâ€™s biggest producer, increased output by
65,000 barrels, or 0.7 percent, to 9.55 million barrels a day
this month. October production was revised 175,000 barrels a day
lower. The kingdom exceeded its daily quota by 1.499 million
barrels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
