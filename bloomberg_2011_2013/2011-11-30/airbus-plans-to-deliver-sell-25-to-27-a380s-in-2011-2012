Airbus SAS will deliver 25 to 27 of
its A380 superjumbo jets by the end of this year and next year,
and projects sales of about the same number, as the company
works toward a goal of three a month, an executive said.  The Toulouse, France-based planemaker is considering adding
about 150 seats to the world’s largest airliner by around 2020,
Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said today at a Credit Suisse
Group AG conference in  New York . The double-decker A380
currently can carry as many as 525 passengers.  Customers that operate the plane are winning market share
and are requesting a version with more capacity, said Leahy.  Air
travel  continues to expand, overwhelming airports’ capacity for
takeoff and landing slots and requiring larger planes, he said.  Shares of Airbus’s parent company, European Aeronautic
Defence & Space Co., rose 3.7 percent to 22.20 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
