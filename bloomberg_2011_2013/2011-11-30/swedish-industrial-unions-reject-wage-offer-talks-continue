Swedish industrial unions rejected a
wage offer by independent mediators before the end of the
current agreement tomorrow, setting up another week of talks
before strikes may become an option.  Five unions representing 500,000 industrial workers turned
down a 2.6 percent wage increase over the next 13 months, the
Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers, Unionen, IF Metall,
GS and Livsmedelsarbetarefoerbundet said today in separate
statements. The parties have until Dec. 7 to resolve their
differences before strikes may become an option.  Unions and employers’ organizations representing almost 3
million, or about two-thirds, of Swedish workers are or will
negotiate pay deals by the end of next year with most current
agreements expiring in March and April. Deals agreed on by
industrial workers traditionally guide those in other areas.  Swedish salaries will grow an average 3.3 percent a year
between 2012 and 2014, the  central bank predicted on Oct. 27  as
it kept its  benchmark lending rate  at 2 percent and forecast
inflation will average 1.9 percent next year.  New wage deals are expected to be “compatible” with the
bank’s 2 percent inflation target, it said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
