Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in two weeks, as demand for higher-yielding
assets rose after central banks lowered the cost of emergency
dollar funding in an effort to ease  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.71 percent at 12:28 p.m. Lima time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the yield’s
steepest fall since Nov. 11. The security’s price rose 0.26
centimo to 114.40 centimos per sol.  Six central banks led by the  Federal Reserve  moved to ease
strains in markets today after the cost for European banks to
fund in dollars rose to the highest levels in three years as
concerns about a possible breakup of the euro area increased.  The measure sparked “a rally in risky assets,” said Bret Rosen, a Latin America strategist at  Standard Chartered  in  New
York .  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.7 per U.S. dollar
from 2.7060 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 10 basis points to 228,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
