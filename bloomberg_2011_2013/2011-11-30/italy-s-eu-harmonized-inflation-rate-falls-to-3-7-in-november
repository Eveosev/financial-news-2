Italy’s inflation rate calculated
using European Union standards declined in November.  The EU-harmonized inflation  rate  fell to 3.7 percent from
3.8 percent in October, Rome-based national statistics institute
Istat said today. That was less than the 3.8 percent median
forecast of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Consumer
prices declined 0.1 percent from the previous month.  Inflation calculated using national methodology slowed to
an annual 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
