The French government is seeking to
withdraw free “bonus” channels that it had offered to  Societe
Television Francaise 1 (TFI) , M6- Metropole Television SA (MMT)  and Canal
Plus, daily  Les Echos  reported, without citing anyone.  The government had offered the channels in compensation for
the early ending of an agreement on free-to-air analogue
transmissions, Les Echos said. Under pressure from the European
Commission, the governement has introduced legislation
withdrawing the channels, Les Echos said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
