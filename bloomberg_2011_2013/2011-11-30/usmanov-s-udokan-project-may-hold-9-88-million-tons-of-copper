Baikal Mining Co., a unit of
billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s OAO Metalloinvest, said its Udokan
project in East Siberia may contain about 9.88 million metric
tons of copper.  Udokan’s probable reserves at the open-pit mine were
estimated at 795 million tons, with a 1.24 percent average
copper content, Baikal Mining said in an e-mailed statement
today, citing data based on international Joint Ore Reserves
Committee standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
