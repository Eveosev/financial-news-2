At least five people died when a
suicide bomber dressed as a government soldier attacked
Somalia’s military heaquarters in Mogadishu, the capital, said
Colonel Ahmed Khalif, an army commander.  An unspecified number of other people were wounded, Khalif
said in a phone interview today from the city. The head of
Somalia’s military, General Abdikarim Yusuf Adan Dhagabadan, was
at the base when the explosion occured though he wasn’t hurt,
Khalif said.  “A suicide bomber dressed in Somali military uniform tried
to blow himself up inside the military headquarters, but
fortunately he didn’t reach his destination,” Kalif said. No one
has claimed responsibility for the attack.  Al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda-inspired rebel group, has led an
insurgency against President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’s United
Nations-backed government for the past four years. The militia
withdrew its fighters from Mogadishu in August, leaving the city
under the control of the government backed by African Union
peacekeepers. It still controls most of southern and central
Somalia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
