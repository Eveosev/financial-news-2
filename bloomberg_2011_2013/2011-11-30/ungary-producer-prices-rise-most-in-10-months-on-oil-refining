Hungarian  producer prices , which
indicate future inflation trends, rose the most in 10 months in
October as costs in oil refining soared.  Factory-gate prices rose 7 percent from a year earlier,
matching the January pace as well as the median estimate of
eight economists in a Bloomberg survey, the Budapest-based
 statistics office  said today in an e-mail. Prices rose 1.9
percent from September.  The depreciation of the forint, the world’s worst-
performing currency in the second half of this year, threatens
the central bank’s 3 percent inflation target, policy makers
said yesterday after raising the benchmark  interest rate  to 6.5
percent from 6 percent, the first increase since January.  The manufacturing of coke and refined petroleum products
rose 38.7 percent in October from a year earlier after jumping
28.8 percent in September, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
