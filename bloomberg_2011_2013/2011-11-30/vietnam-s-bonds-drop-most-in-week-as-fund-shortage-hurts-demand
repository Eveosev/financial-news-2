Vietnam ’s five-year  government bonds 
fell the most in a week on speculation a cash shortage at local
banks damped demand for debt. The dong was steady.  Yields rose to the highest level since Nov. 24 after
National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Sinh Hung told lawmakers over
the weekend that containing  inflation  will remain a priority for
policy makers in 2012. The State Bank of Vietnam raised its
refinancing rate to 15 percent from 14 percent last month to cap
consumer-price gains that have averaged almost 19 percent this
year, according to official data.  “Commercial banks, which are the main domestic investors
in government bonds, are coping with liquidity issues due to
monetary policy tightening and seasonal effects of year-end
holidays,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based bond trader at
Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The  yield  on five-year bonds rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 12.48 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged today at 21,009 per dollar as of
4:50 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,803,
unchanged since Oct. 28, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
