Group Five Ltd. , a South African
construction company, is participating in at least seven bids to
build renewable-energy plants in the continent’s biggest economy
for about 9 billion rand ($1.1 billion).  The company will bid to construct a concentrated-solar
plant for 5 billion rand in phases to a maximum capacity of 400
megawatts, Johannesburg-based Group Five said in an e-mailed
response to a query today. The deadline for bids is March 5.  South Africa  on Aug. 3 invited proposals for renewable-
energy plants with a combined capacity of 3,725 megawatts to be
built by the end of 2016 at a combined estimated cost of as much
as $12 billion. The country is looking to expand generation
capacity and boost the portion from renewable sources to help
overcome a shortage that shut mines temporarily on 2008. Most of
its electricity is generated from coal.  Group Five is a participant in three wind and three solar-
voltaic plant plans already submitted with a combined value of 4
billion rand and collective capacity of 250 megawatts, the
company said. It’s participating with international energy
companies in the proposals, it added.  The company gained 1.2 percent to 22.86 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, paring this year’s drop to 37 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
