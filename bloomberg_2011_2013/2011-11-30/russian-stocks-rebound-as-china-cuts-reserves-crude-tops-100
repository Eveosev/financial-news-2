Russian stocks jumped to the highest
in three weeks after the  Federal Reserve  and five other central
banks reduced the cost of emergency dollar funding for European
lenders and  China  cut banks’ reserve requirements.  The Micex Index surged 3.1 percent to 1,499.62 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its highest level since Nov. 8 after
paring an earlier loss of as much as 0.5 percent. Russia’s
biggest lenders  OAO Sberbank  and VTB Group leapt 6 percent and
5.8 percent, respectively. OAO Mechel, the Russian coal
producer, jumped 10 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
rose 5.1 percent to 1,540.81, its biggest gain since May 2010.  Stocks and futures rose globally after the six central
banks, including the Federal Reserve, agreed to reduce the
 interest rate  on dollar liquidity swap lines by 50 basis point.
China cut the amount of cash that banks must set aside as
reserves for the first time since 2008 to safeguard growth.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, jumped as much as 0.6
percent to $100.35 a barrel in  New York . Stocks fell earlier as
investors bet  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade yesterday of some of
the world’s biggest lenders may exacerbate  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “This coordinated positive jolt by global central banks
has been positive for commodity-focused  emerging markets  like
Russia.” Marco Casas, vice-president of equity sales at
Otkritie Capital in New York, said in e-mailed comments today.  All but two of the  Micex (INDEXCF) ’s 30 component stocks gained.
Sberbank rose 6 percent to 87.55 rubles after posting a better-
than-expected profit jump in the third quarter as it increased
lending and released reserves set aside to cover bad loans.  Enhancements Approved  Net income rose to 79.8 billion rubles ($2.54 billion) from
45.8 billion rubles a year earlier, according to a statement on
the Moscow-based lender’s website today. That beat the average
estimate of 75 billion rubles from nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Euro-area finance ministers approved enhancements yesterday
to the European Financial Stability Facility, while backing off
setting a target for its firepower and seeking a greater role
for the  International Monetary Fund  in fighting the debt crisis.  Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.30, or 1.3 percent,
to $101.09 a barrel at 9:16 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures touched $101.75, the highest level since Nov.
17. Prices are up 11 percent this year. Copper for March
delivery gained 3.8 percent to $3.5205 a pound on the Comex in
New York, cutting this month’s drop to 3.1 percent.  The Micex has lost 11 percent this year as Europe’s debt
crisis spread. The measure trades at 5.2 times analysts’
earnings estimates for member companies.  Russian Steelmaker Tumbles  The Micex’s drop compares with a 17 percent slide for
 Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which trades at 10.4 times estimated
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai
Composite Index trades at 11.1 times estimated earnings, and the
BSE India Sensitive Index has a ratio of 14.  OAO Severstal ,  Russia ’s largest steelmaker by market value,
tumbled the most in more than a week, dropping 4.2 percent to
424.7 rubles. The stock gained 11 percent in the previous three
days.  The company plans to spin off its Nordgold NV mining unit
by “late January 2012,” according to a regulatory filing
today.  The spinoff will be carried out by exchanging Severstal
shares and global depositary receipts for Nordgold shares, which
are owned 100 percent by Severstal’s indirect unit, Lybica
Holdings BV, Severtsal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
