Incentives offered to South African
clothing manufacturers have stabilized the industry and support
will be offered to other manufacturers in the country, Business
Day said, citing Trade and Industry Minister  Rob Davies .  Clothing incentives worth 112 million rand ($13 million)
have been taken up by 105 companies, while production incentives
have been paid to 199 companies, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper reported. Approvals have reached 624 million rand, it
said.  Employment in the clothing industry increased to 58,000 at
the end of September compared with 56,985 in December 2010, as
the competitiveness program helped stimulate its growth,
Business Day cited Davies as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
