Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and  General Electric
Co. (GE)  have proposed building a nuclear reactor powered by the
U.K.’s 87-metric ton plutonium stockpile, the world’s largest
civilian accumulation of the waste.  The venture’s 600-megawatt Prism Fast Reactor could power
as many as 750,000 homes, according to nuclear plant project
Vice President Danny Roderick. The plant would take about five
years to build and be operational for 60 years, he said. During
that period it would burn 100 metric tons of plutonium.  The British government is consulting on ways to manage its
stockpile of plutonium, stored at Sellafield in northwest
 England . One option is to turn the radioactive metal, a
byproduct of uranium-fueled plants, into mixed-oxide fuel, known
as MOX, which could be burned in conventional reactors. Building
a fast reactor is a much more direct way of dealing with the
waste, Roderick said.  “The advantage we have is that we take something people
are trying to get rid of and turn it into something people can
use,” the executive said in a telephone interview. “It’s going
to be an investment of several billion dollars, but our analysis
shows that if you add the total cost of using MOX fuel, this is
much more economical.”  The GE Hitachi Prism reactor is the commercial product of a
plant developed by the U.S. government, a plutonium-fueled fast
reactor, the EBR II, that operated for 30 years. Within five
years of first being used to fuel the fast reactor, the spent
fuel bundles are safe for disposal, GE Hitachi Chief Consulting
Engineer Eric Loewen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
