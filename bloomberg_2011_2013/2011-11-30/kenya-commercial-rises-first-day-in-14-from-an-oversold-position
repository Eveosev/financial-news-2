Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s biggest lender by assets, climbed for the first
day in 14 after falling below a technical level that indicates
the stock is poised for a rise.  The shares advanced 0.3 percent to 15 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi.  Kenya Commercial’s 14-day relative strength index closed at
25.2 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A level
below 30 signals to some technical analysts that the stock is
oversold and set for a rise.  The RSI identifies possible turning points in indexes or
securities by measuring the degree to which gains and losses
