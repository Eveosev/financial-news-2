Gulf Coast diesel slipped to the
lowest level against futures since January after  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO)  restarted a hydrotreater and  Total SA (FP) ’s operations
returned to normal at its Port Arthur refinery in Texas.  Valero started the hydrotreater after work on a compressor
was completed, Bill Day, a company spokesman in  San Antonio ,
said in an e-mail Nov. 28.  The  discount  for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf Coast
widened 1.2 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:52 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the lowest level since Jan.
31. Prompt delivery rose 0.37 cent to $2.9993 a gallon.  Operations at Total’s Port Arthur plant in Texas returned
to normal at 10:15 a.m. local time after an upset at 9:53 a.m.
during preventative maintenance on the fluid catalytic cracker,
Jennifer Walsh, a spokeswoman for the company in Houston, said
in an e-mail.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf widened 0.1 cent to 5.6 cents a gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
