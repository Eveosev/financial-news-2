Lynas Corp. (LYC) , an Australian rare
earths developer, said it’s near to completing its Malaysian
refinery and will be ready to receive concentrate in the first
quarter of 2012, pending regulatory approvals.  “We are in the final stages of the regulatory approvals
process in  Malaysia ,” Nicholas Curtis, chairman of the Sydney-
based company said today in a statement. “We have submitted all
the requested documentation and the Malaysian Atomic Energy
Licensing Board is now reviewing those documents ahead of making
a decision.”  Malaysia imposed tighter environmental safety standards on
the proposed plant in June following protests by local residents
concerned about radiation. Shares in Lynas have dropped 39
percent since the June ruling, compared with the 13 percent
decline in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Once in production, the plant will provide an alternative
source of rare earths to  China , which currently produces more
than 90 percent of global supply of the 17 chemically similar
elements used in magnets, hybrid cars and iPods. China has
restricted rare-earth mining and cut exports to conserve
resources and protect the environment.  Lynas climbed 3 percent to A$1.215 at the close of trading
in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
