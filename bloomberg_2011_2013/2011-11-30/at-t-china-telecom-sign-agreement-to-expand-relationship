AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S.
telephone carrier, and  China Telecom Corp. (728)  agreed to expand an
11-year partnership to provide more communication services to
multinational companies in both countries.  AT&T will offer more services China, including so-called
virtual private networks and provide additional technology,
according to a statement today. The agreement will give Beijing-
based China Telecom better network access to provide data
services to Chinese companies with units in the U.S.  AT&T is using its global data network, which spans 886,000
miles of fiber worldwide, to win contracts from multinational
companies to provide communication services in emerging markets
in Asia and  Latin America . In 2000, AT&T formed the first Sino-
foreign telecommunications services joint venture in China,
known as the Shanghai Symphony Telecommunications Co., with
partners China Telecom and Shanghai Information Investment Co.  As part of todayâ€™s accord, AT&T will connect China Telecom
to its data networks in the U.S. to provide service to Chinese
multinationals. The two companies also said they will consider
providing mutual support in other regions of the world.  AT&T, based in  Dallas , rose 0.4 percent to $28.06 yesterday
in New York. China Telecom, the largest fixed-line phone company
and broadband Internet service provider in China, increased 0.7
percent to HK$4.60 in Hong Kong.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
