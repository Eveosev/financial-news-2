Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and  CEZ AS (CEZ)  led the
Czech stock index’s biggest rally in two months after the
Federal Reserve and five central banks cut the cost of dollar
funding to help ease Europe’s debt crisis.  The  PX (PX)  equity gauge jumped 4.2 percent to 878.9 at the
close in Prague, the biggest gain since Sept. 26. Komercni, a
unit of Societe Generale SA, Erste Group Bank AG of Austria and
CEZ, the biggest Czech power utility, rose at least 5 percent.
The three stocks combined make up 56 percent of the benchmark.  Global stocks rallied after the central banks of the U.S.,
the euro region, Canada, the U.K., Japan and Switzerland agreed
to cut the cost of dollar funding via swap arrangements. China
said earlier today it will cut the reserve requirement ratio for
banks by 0.5 percentage points from Dec. 5.  The koruna appreciated as much as 1.8 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since May 2010, after the central banks’ report
and last traded 1.4 percent stronger to 25.199 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
