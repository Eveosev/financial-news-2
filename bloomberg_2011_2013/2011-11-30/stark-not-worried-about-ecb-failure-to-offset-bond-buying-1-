European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said he’s not concerned about today’s
failure by the ECB to fully offset the extra liquidity created
by its bond purchases.  “This is over interpreted now,” Stark said after a speech
in  Dallas  today. “I’m not worried about it.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today that 85 banks bid a
total of 194.2 billion euros ($259 billion) for seven-day term
deposits. It had aimed to drain 203.5 billion euros, the amount
its bond purchases have created since the program began in May
last year. It last fell short of its intended total on April 26.  Banks are hoarding cash as the region’s debt crisis
worsens, driving up government borrowing costs and increasing
the risk of sovereign defaults. The ECB’s  balance sheet  rose to
a record 2.42 trillion euros in the week through Nov. 25, about
500 billion euros more than a year ago, as banks tapped it for
funds rather than trading with one another. The ECB, which lends
banks as much cash as they want at its  benchmark interest rate ,
also said today that weekly lending rose to a two-year high.  While the ECB has failed to “sterilize” its bond program
at least four times before, this is the first time it has
happened since the central bank expanded the program to buy
Italian and Spanish bonds in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
