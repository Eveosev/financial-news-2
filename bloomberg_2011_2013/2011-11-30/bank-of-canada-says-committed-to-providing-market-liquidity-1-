The  Bank of Canada  said it has
agreed to reduce the  interest rate  on dollar liquidity swap
lines by 50 basis points and extend their authorization through
Feb. 1, 2013, as part of a global coordinated effort with five
other central banks.  The Bank of Canada and the  Federal Reserve  have agreed to
extend the $30 billion swap facility, the Ottawa-based central
bank said in a statement.  “The Bank of Canada judges that it is not necessary for it
to draw or offer operations on any of these swap facilities at
this time, but that it is prudent to have these agreements in
place,” it said in the statement. “Should these facilities be
drawn on, the details of the liquidity facilities provided would
depend on the specific market circumstances at the time.”  The Bank of Canada said it is closely monitoring
developments in financial markets and remains committed to
providing liquidity to support the stability of the Canadian
financial system.  The central banks today also announced they agreed to set
up temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements as a
contingency measure.  The Bank of  Canada  said the introduction of the “expanded
network of temporary swap lines” will enable the Bank of Canada
to provide liquidity in the other currencies to financial
institutions in Canada, and Canadian dollars to other central
banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
