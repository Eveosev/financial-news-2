Lithuania’s  Finance Ministry  lowered
its forecast for the  economy  next year as European demand for
exports wanes and said slower growth may require an increase in
value-added tax to meet the government’s budget-deficit target.  Gross domestic product will probably expand 2.5 percent in
2012, compared with a September forecast of 4.7 percent, the
ministry, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  As a result, Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte  said
additional budget measures will be needed to meet a planned 2012
deficit goal of 2.8 percent of GDP, with no “other serious
alternatives” to higher VAT, the  Baltic News Service  reported.
The tax may be raised by 2 percentage points to 23 percent, she
added, according to BNS.  Lithuania’s economy expanded 6.7 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter, the second-fastest rate in the
European Union. Growth in the Baltic nation, which sells 61
percent of its exports to the 27-member bloc, will slow to 3.4
percent next year, the European Commission estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
