Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir
appointed five presidential aides and seven advisers, according
to a statement published by the state-run  Sudanese Media Centre .  Abdel-Rahman al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, son of the leader of
 Sudan ’s main opposition Ummah Party that announced earlier it
will boycott al-Bashir’s Cabinet, was among the newly appointed
assistants. Jaffar al-Sadiq Mohamed Osman al-Mirghani, son of
the head of the Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP, was also
among the newly appointed aides.  Ruling National Congress Party deputy Chairman Nafie Ali Nafie and Moussa Mohamed Ahmed were re-appointed as presidential
assistants, the list showed.  Sudan delayed the appointment of its new Cabinet since
August as the NCP tried to persuade the main opposition parties
to join the government. In addition to the Ummah Party, the
Sudanese Communist Party also boycotted the Cabinet. The DUP
agreed on Nov. 24 to join amid internal resistance from factions
opposed to working with the NCP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
