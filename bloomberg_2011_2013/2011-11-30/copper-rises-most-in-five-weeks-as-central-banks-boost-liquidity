Copper rose the most in five weeks
after central banks from the U.S. to  China  moved to ease strains
in financial markets and spur growth.  The  Federal Reserve  and five other central banks agreed to
cut the cost of emergency funding for banks in  Europe  as part of
a global effort to stem the region’s debt crisis. Separately,
China cut the amount of cash that lenders must set aside as
reserves for the first time since 2008.  The coordinated efforts among central banks “along with
the Chinese reserve cut are the obvious short-term drivers,”
James Dailey, who manages $215 million at TEAM Financial
Management LLC in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said in an e-mail.  Copper futures for March delivery jumped 6.7 percent to
$3.6165 a pound at 10:53 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . A close
at that level would mark the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since Oct. 24.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
advanced as much as 1.7 percent today, with all commodities
rising except natural gas.  Copper also increased after a private report signaled U.S.
companies added more workers than anticipated in November. The
U.S. is the world’s largest consumer after China.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 6.3 percent to $7,960 a metric ton ($3.61 a pound).  Aluminum, nickel, tin, lead and zinc also climbed in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
