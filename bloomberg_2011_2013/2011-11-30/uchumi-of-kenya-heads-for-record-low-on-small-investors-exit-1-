Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP) , a Kenyan
retailer, declined in Nairobi, headed for its lowest level on
record as small investors sold their stock ahead of the
Christmas holidays.  The stock dropped 3.3 percent to 7.30 shillings at 9:48
a.m. in the Kenyan capital. A close at that level would be the
lowest since at least May 1997.  “It is purely retail investors building their cash
positions as we head into the festive season, there is a lot of
retail exits from the company,” George Bodo, an equity
strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital Ltd., said by
phone today.  The shares resumed trading in May, following a five-year
suspension after the company went into receivership in June 2006
with debts of 2.2 billion shillings ($24.5 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
