Only five of 35 loans linked to
European commercial-mortgage backed securities were repaid when
they came due at the end of October, according to a report today
by  Standard & Poor’s .  The loan maturity “performance in October was more
dismal” than anticipated, the ratings company said in its
November CMBS bulletin.  “The tally of defaulted loans is set to rise further,”
S&P said. “These events are contributing to the rising number
of loans going into special servicing, which, in turn, has led
to increased costs, and in some cases, interest shortfalls.”  About 60 percent of the 17 billion euros ($23 billion) of
European CMBS due to mature by the end of next year could
default, S&P said Nov. 1. In the past 12 months, borrowers have
managed to repay only about 4.5 billion of the 13 billion euros
of loans that were scheduled to mature between November 2010 and
October 2011, the New-York based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. said.  Almost 150 loans linked to CMBS are now scheduled to
mature in 2012, representing 14.8 billion euros of loans by
balance, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
