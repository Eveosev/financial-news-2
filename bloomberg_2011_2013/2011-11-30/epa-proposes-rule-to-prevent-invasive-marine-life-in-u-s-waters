(Corrects to delete reference to Asian carp in first,
fifth paragraphs in story published Nov. 30.)  The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency proposed regulations aimed at preventing invasive
species, such as zebra mussels, from entering American waters
from commercial ships.  The proposal would set the first cap on ballast water
dumping for most commercial vessels, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the EPA in  Washington .  The EPA said it also eased the administrative requirements
for the ship operators, allowing electronic recordkeeping. The
rule will take effect in 2013, according to the statement.  Ocean-going ships fill internal tanks with pumped-in water
that acts as ballast to maintain stability while at sea. That
water can also transport non-indigenous marine species into new
environments such as the  Great Lakes , where they can harm the
ecosystem if untreated water is discharged. The cost to the
economy from of biological invaders in the Great Lakes region is
more than $5 billion a year, according to a 2008 EPA report.  The razor-edge zebra mussels wreak havoc along waterways,
jamming pipes in utility plants and dams. They spread rapidly
because they have few natural predators.  The Coast Guard also has jurisdiction over the shipsâ€™
ballast water and is preparing standards as well.  To contact the reporters on this story:
