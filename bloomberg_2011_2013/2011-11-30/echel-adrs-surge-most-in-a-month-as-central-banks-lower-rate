OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest coal
producer for steelmakers, surged the most in a month in New York
as European central banks took actions to ease the region’s debt
crisis, boosting the outlook for importers.  American depositary receipts of Mechel rose 10 percent to
$10.65 at 11:21 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday advance
since Oct. 27. In Moscow,  shares  jumped 10 percent to 328.10
rubles, or the equivalent of $10.69.  The U.S. Federal Reserve and five other central banks
including the  European Central Bank  agreed to reduce the
interest rate on dollar liquidity swap lines in an effort to
prevent the euro zone’s credit crisis from threatening global
growth. Europe accounted for 19 percent of  Mechel (MTLR) ’s 2010 sales
while Asia represented 13 percent.  “Mechel has been a very volatile stock,” said  George Buzhenitsa , analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Moscow, in a phone
interview. “It’s a strong day for the entire steel space in
Russia because of news out of Europe.”  Mechel’s ADRs had fallen 72 percent from a 2011 peak on
Feb. 1 to yesterday. Buzhenitsa rates Mechel a “hold” with a
12-month price target of $16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
