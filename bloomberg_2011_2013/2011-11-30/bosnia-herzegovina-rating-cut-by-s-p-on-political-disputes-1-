Bosnia and Herzegovina’s long-term
foreign-currency sovereign-credit ratings were cut to B from B+
by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which cited political
disputes that are preventing the formation of a government.  S&P also put the Balkan country’s debt score, which is one
level above Belarus, on “CreditWatch” with negative
implications, meaning another downgrade is more likely than an
upgrade, citing risks to approving a 2012 budget, economic
growth and European Union membership.  “The political environment and lack of a financing
resolution have materially detracted from Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s institutional management and medium-term growth
prospects, and have further weakened prospects for EU
accession,” S&P said today in a statement from  London .  Domestic politics and  Europe ’s debt crisis, which affects
some of Bosnia’s key trading partners, will keep 2012 economic
growth at near zero, while the fiscal deficit will narrow to 3
percent of gross domestic product from 3.2 percent this year,
S&P said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
