Oil fell from the highest in two
weeks in New York after Standard & Poor’s cut credit ratings on
some of the world’s biggest lenders, and amid signs of rising
crude supplies in the U.S.  West Texas Intermediate futures slid as much as 0.9
percent, paring a second monthly gain. The industry-funded
 American Petroleum Institute  said yesterday crude inventories
climbed by 3.44 million barrels last week. S&P lowered the
ratings of banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and UBS AG. Prices rose yesterday after U.S.
consumer confidence climbed the most in more than eight years
and Iranian protesters vandalized the British Embassy’s compound
in Tehran.  “The debt crisis is a very, very bearish factor in the
market,” said Gerrit Zambo, a trader at  Bayerische Landesbank 
in Munich who correctly predicted crude’s slump in September.
“On the other hand, we’re at the start of winter now with some
oil supplies at little bit tight, and some positive macro data
in the U.S.”  Crude for January delivery fell as much as 87 cents to
$98.92 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile. It was at $99.27 at 10:30 a.m. in  London . The
contract yesterday advanced 1.6 percent to $99.79, the highest
close since Nov. 16. Prices have risen 6.5 percent this month,
after climbing 18 percent in October.  $100 Brent  Brent oil for January settlement was down 90 cents at
$109.92 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. It closed yesterday up 1.7 percent at $110.82. The
European benchmark contract’s premium to New York’s West Texas
Intermediate was at $10.65, compared with yesterday’s close of
$11.14 and a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Brent may average $100 a barrel next year as Libyan supply
returns and new projects start,  Hussein Allidina , an analyst at
Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a report yesterday. Prices
may be “significantly weaker” in the first half of next year,
falling to as low as $85, Allidana said.  U.S. crude inventories rose to 339.2 million barrels as
imports surged 10 percent in the week to Nov. 25, the API report
showed. An Energy Department report today will probably show
 supplies  increased 50,000 barrels, according to the median of
responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles slipped 173,000 barrels to 209.4
million, according to the API. Distillate fuels, including
diesel and heating oil, gained 1.35 million barrels to 139.5
million. Oil-product imports rose 8.5 percent, the group said.  Analysts in the Bloomberg survey predicted the Energy
Department will say motor-fuel supplies climbed 1.45 million
barrels while distillates declined 1.25 million. The department
is scheduled to release its inventory data today at 10:30 a.m.
in  Washington .  “We’ve got profit-taking today off the rally driven by the
attack on the U.K. embassy,” said  Victor Shum , a senior
principal at Purvin & Gertz Inc., a consultant in  Singapore .
“That provided support on top of the good economic data out of
the U.S. The API data poured some cold water on that bullish
news.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
