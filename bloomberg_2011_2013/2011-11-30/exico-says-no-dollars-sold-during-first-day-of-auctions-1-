Mexico ’s central bank said it didn’t
sell dollars or receive offers in the three auctions it held
today.  Mexico’s currency commission announced yesterday that the
central bank will auction $400 million daily. To provide market
liquidity, the bank will offer the dollars at a peso  exchange
rate  that’s at least 2 percent weaker than the previous day’s
level, the commission said.  No offers were received or dollars were sold during the
today’s auctions, the bank said on its  website .  Auctions take place daily from 9 a.m. to 9:05 a.m., 12 to
12:05 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 3:05 p.m. in Mexico City.  The peso has lost 15 percent in the last six months, the
biggest decline among the six most-traded Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s foreign currency reserves have climbed $26 billion
since the start of the year to $140 billion in the week ending
Nov. 25, central bank data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
