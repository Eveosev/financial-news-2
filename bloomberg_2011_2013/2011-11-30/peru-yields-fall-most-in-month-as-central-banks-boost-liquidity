Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in a month, as demand for higher-yielding assets
climbed after central banks lowered the cost of emergency dollar
funding in an effort to ease  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.70 percent at 2:43 p.m. Lima time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the yield’s
steepest fall since Oct. 27. The security’s price rose 0.34
centimo to 114.47 centimos per sol.  Six central banks led by the  Federal Reserve  moved to ease
strains in markets today after the cost for European banks to
fund in dollars rose to the highest levels in three years as
concerns about a possible breakup of the euro area increased.  The measure sparked “a rally in risky assets,” said Bret Rosen, a Latin America strategist at  Standard Chartered  in  New
York .  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 227,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.7005 per  U.S. dollar 
from 2.7060 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  Peru’s central bank purchased dollars today for the first
time since Nov. 18 to slow the sol’s advance. The bank purchased
$114 million and paid an average 2.7 soles per dollar, it said
on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
