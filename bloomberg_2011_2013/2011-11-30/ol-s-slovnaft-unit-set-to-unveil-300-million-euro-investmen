Slovnaft AS (SLOVN) , a Slovak refiner
controlled by  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , is set to unveil an investment project
worth more than 300 million euros ($405 million), according to
an invitation for a news conference scheduled for tomorrow.  The Bratislava, Slovakia-based company will hold a meeting
with journalists about the project at 10:30 a.m. local time with
Chief Executive Officer Oszkar Villagi and Ivan Dezd, the
director of the petrochemical unit. Spokesman Anton Molnar
declined to provide further details when contacted by phone.  Slovnaft in October last year said it was considering
investing several hundred million euros in building a new
petrochemical plant for products with higher added value to tap
new customers such as tire makers. The project would be part of
a push to boost output of non-fuel products to make Slovakia’s
sole refiner less dependent on economic swings.  The investment will have “significant economic and
ecological impact on the whole region,” e-mailed invitation
said.  The refiner, in which Mol has more than 98 percent, posted
a 30 million-euro loss in the third quarter, compared with an
after-tax profit of 38 million euros a year earlier, as higher
 oil prices  and lower petrochemical margins eroded gains from an
increase in sales. The nine-month after-tax profit declined to
25 million euros from 26 million euros in the same period 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
