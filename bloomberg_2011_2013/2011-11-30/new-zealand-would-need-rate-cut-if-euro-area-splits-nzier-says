New Zealand ’s central bank would need
to lower the official cash rate if the euro region splinters,
the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research said, citing a
one-in-four chance of such a scenario.  “If the euro area splits, New Zealand firms should prepare
for another global crisis,”  Shamubeel Eaqub , principal
economist at the Wellington-based organization, said in a report
today. “New Zealand would likely experience another recession
and the  Reserve Bank  would need to cut  interest rates .”  New Zealand’s benchmark rate is already at a record-low 2.5
percent and should be left at that level until mid-2013 even if
a political solution is found in Europe, Eaqub said. The economy
will likely grow 1.5 percent in 2012, less than the 2.6 percent
pace forecast in August, amid weakened domestic demand, exports
and investment, according to the institute’s quarterly
predictions.  “There is little domestic demand growth,” Eaqub said.
“Households are saving, the housing market is struggling,
businesses are cautious about investing and the government is in
a period of fiscal consolidation.”  The central bank doesn’t need to be concerned about
inflation accelerating because an elevated  unemployment rate 
will keep a lid on wage growth and companies will hold prices to
remain competitive, he said.  ANZ National Bank Ltd. and ASB Bank Ltd. this week said
central bank Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard is likely to
keep rates unchanged until December next year. Previously they
forecast an increase in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
