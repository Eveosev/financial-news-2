The Polish zloty advanced from a 29-
month low as the  Federal Reserve  cut the cost of emergency
dollar funding for European banks while state-owned Bank
Gospodarstwa Krajowego sold dollars to local commercial lenders.  The zloty jumped 0.8 percent to 4.4966 per euro as of 4:51
p.m. in Warsaw after falling to the weakest since June 2009.
Bonds rallied, pushing the yield on five-year notes 15 basis
points lower to 5.26 percent. BGK sold dollars on the currency
market, said two Warsaw-based traders, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The central banks of the U.S., the euro region, Canada, the
U.K., Japan and Switzerland agreed to cut the cost of providing
dollar funding via swap arrangements, the Federal Reserve said,
and agreed to make other currencies available as needed. The
 interest rate  has been reduced to the dollar overnight index
swap rate plus 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, from
100 basis points, it said in a statement in Washington.  “It’s definitely good news,”  Luis Costa , senior emerging-
market strategist at Citigroup Inc, said by phone from  London .
“This eases a lot of strain in hard currency funding, at least
in the short term, which we all knew was a problem for the last
three, four months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
