Sugar refiners will expand capacity
by more than 25 percent by 2013 with global production set to
exceed demand, according to Abhishek Nanda, trading manager at
Dubai’s Al Khaleej Sugar Co., the world’s biggest sugar refiner.  Refining capacity will expand by about 3.8 million metric
tons by 2013, from a base of about 14.5 million tons, Nanda said
today at an International Sugar Organization conference in
 London . Refiners will need to be more efficient to survive, he
said. Demand grew 2.4 percent to 2.5 percent this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
