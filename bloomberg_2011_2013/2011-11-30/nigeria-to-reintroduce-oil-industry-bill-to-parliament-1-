The Nigerian government will send a
proposed law to regulate the country’s oil and gas industry to
the parliament a second time after a previous bill stalled,
Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said.  “We will re-present the bill to ensure that the right and
final version is given,” she said today at a conference in
Lagos, the commercial capital. “We expect that we will move
more quickly than now.”  The first bill sent to lawmakers in 2008, which sought to
give Africa’s top oil producer more control and a greater share
of hydrocarbons revenue, was opposed by international energy
companies that said its fiscal terms would’ve made investing in
the country’s deep-offshore fields unprofitable. Communities in
the Niger River delta, home to the country’s oil industry, also
criticized the bill for not addressing their demands.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
Total SA and  Eni SpA (ENI)  run joint ventures with state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. that pump most of the
country’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
