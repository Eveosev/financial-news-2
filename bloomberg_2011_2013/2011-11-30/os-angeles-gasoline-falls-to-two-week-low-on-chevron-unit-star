California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  fell to a two-week low against futures after  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  said the  El Segundo  refinery in Southern  California  was
operating normally.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  weakened 1.88 cents to a discount of
0.88 cent a gallon versus gasoline futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:20 p.m. New York time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first time the fuel
has traded at a discount in Los Angeles since Nov. 15.  Chevron’s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo plant,
California’s largest oil refinery, is “operating normally,”
Rod Spackman, a company spokesman based in El Segundo, said in
an e-mail. The  San Ramon , California-based company was scheduled
to start a fluid catalytic cracker at the plant yesterday after
repairs, a person with knowledge of the work said Nov. 21.  Chevron also restored service to a crude unit at the
240,000-barrel-a-day  Richmond  refinery that was shut Nov. 14
after a fire, two people familiar with the plant’s operations
said yesterday.  Carbob in  San Francisco  slipped 0.38 cent, extending its
largest discount to futures since August to 1.38 cents.  California-blend diesel in  Los Angeles  fell 0.13 cent to a
discount of 0.13 cent against heating oil futures traded on the
Nymex. The same fuel in  San Francisco  fell 0.88 cent to a
discount of 0.88 cent to futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
weakened 2 cents to a discount of 5.5 cents to futures,
extending the fuel’s lowest level since Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
