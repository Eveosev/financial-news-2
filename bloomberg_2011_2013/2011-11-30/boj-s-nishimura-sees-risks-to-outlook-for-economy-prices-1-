Kiyohiko Nishimura, a deputy
governor of the  Bank of Japan (8301) , said the central bank needs to be
mindful of risks to economic growth.  The central bank is aware that its assessment of the
outlook for the economy and prices has the potential to be cut
“depending on developments in global financial markets and
overseas economies,” Nishimura said in a speech in Kyoto,
western Japan today. He noted a slowdown in overseas economies
and gains by the yen.  More time is needed to confirm that  price stability  is in
sight, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
