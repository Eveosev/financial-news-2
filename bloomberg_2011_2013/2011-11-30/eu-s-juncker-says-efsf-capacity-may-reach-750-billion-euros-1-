Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said the region’s rescue fund may have a capacity of
about 750 billion euros ($1 trillion).  “We’re now in discussions with the financial markets, with
the  International Monetary Fund , with others to seek to gather
as much money as possible,” Juncker said on Luxembourg RTL
Radio today. While governments probably won’t be able to boost
the fund’s firepower to 1 trillion euros as initially hoped, “I
expect we will end up getting about 750 billion,” Juncker said.  “Gradually more investors are avoiding  Europe ,” Juncker
said. He also said the  European Central Bank  is independent and
should remain so during a crisis. “We have to let the bank do
its own thing.”  Juncker said  Germany  remains opposed to common euro bonds.  “Still, I am of the view that if we strengthen budgetary
discipline, if we get more coordination of economic policy, if
we all take care of the budgets of everyone, then conditions
would be created that one could, in such an optimal case of
integral coordination, emit euro bonds,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
