Employers in the U.S. announced
fewer job cuts in November than a year earlier, showing the
world’s largest economy is growing enough to deter firings.  Planned firings  dropped 13 percent to 42,474 from November
2010, according to figures released today by Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. So far this year, there have
been 563,297 announced job reductions, more than the 529,973 for
all of 2010.  Government agencies, which had the most cutbacks in
November, may continue to shed military and civilian positions
in 2012 amid budget cuts, Challenger said. A report later this
week may show the pace of hiring failed to reduce an
 unemployment rate  that’s been hovering around 9 percent,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “There is still immense pressure to cut costs,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray &
Christmas, said in a statement. “We definitely have seen a
shift away from the heavy government job cuts at the state and
local level toward increased job cuts at the federal level. The
worst may be yet to come, as cutbacks spread from the military
to every other agency in Washington,” he said.  Compared with October, job-cut announcements were down 0.7
percent. Because the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal
effects, economists prefer to focus on year-over-year changes
rather than monthly numbers.  Government Job Cuts  Government and nonprofit entities led the firings with
18,508 announcements in November. Of those, 13,500 were the
result of civilian workforce cuts by the U.S. Air Force, marking
the third straight month of “significant” civilian and military
personnel reductions, the report said.  Government agencies have accounted for 32 percent of all
announced job cuts this year.  The financial services industry’s 1,681 announced firings
this month brought the 2011 total so far to 56,191, which is up
162 percent from the same time a year earlier, the report
showed.  California led all states with 4,121 announced job cuts in
November. The  District of Columbia  had 15,132 reductions.  Employment cooled, the report showed. Employers announced
plans to take on 63,527 workers, including about 55,000 seasonal
workers hired by United Parcel Service Inc., according to
Challenger. That’s down from the prior month’s 159,177 figure
that mainly reflected holiday hiring at retailers.  A report from the Labor Department on Dec. 2 may show
payrolls climbed by 120,000 workers in November, while the
unemployment rate held at 9 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Private
companies may have added 146,000 jobs after a 104,000 gain the
prior month.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose job are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
