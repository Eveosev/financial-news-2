The biggest test for Italian Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  will be whether he can persuade a
parliament inherited from  Silvio Berlusconi  to accept austerity,
said European Union Trade Commissioner Karel  De Gucht .  De Gucht said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg News
headquarters in New York that, while Monti has a “very sharp
mind” and has put together an unelected government of
“heavyweights,” he must convince investors he can impose debt-
reducing measures on a parliament that is unchanged from that of
his predecessor, who resigned Nov. 12.  “They can certainly make the proposals that will get them
out of the crisis,” said De Gucht, who served as Belgium’s
foreign minister from 2004 to 2009. “But they still have to
demonstrate that they can get it through parliament because that
old parliament is still there.”  The Italian Cabinet is due to approve on Dec. 5 an urgent
package of measures and structural reforms aimed at preventing
the euro area’s third-biggest economy from succumbing to the
debt crisis. After that, it must be approved by the Chamber of
Deputies and the Senate to take effect. While Monti has declined
to put a value on the package, Ansa newswire has reported the
measures may total about 20 billion euros ($26.9 billion).  “Italy is certainly an economy that has the capacity to
rebound,” said De Gucht. “They have an industrial backbone,
much more than, for example,  Greece . They are still highly
valued in the market.”
