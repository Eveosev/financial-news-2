Ex- Olympus Corp. (7733)  Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Woodford , the whistle-blower who questioned fees
paid by the camera maker, said he resigned as a director after
earlier offering to return to the top post.  Woodford said at a press conference in New York that he
decided to resign at 4 a.m. this morning.  “I only had four hours of sleep, but when I woke up I was
very clear,” he told reporters.  Woodford was fired as president and CEO on Oct. 14 after he
confronted the Olympus board about oversized payments made to
advisers in the acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008.  Olympus revealed this month that it used the purchase of
Gyrus and three other takeovers to hide decades-old investment
losses.  He had remained a director of the Tokyo-based company after
being fired and has met with prosecutors and regulators in
 Japan , the U.K. and the U.S. He said those investigations
weren’t related to his decision to resign from the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
