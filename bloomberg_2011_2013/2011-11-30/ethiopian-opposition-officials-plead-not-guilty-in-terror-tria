Two political opponents of the
government and a journalist accused of conspiracy to commit
terror attacks were among those who pleaded not guilty at an
Ethiopian court today, opposition leader Negasso Gidada said.  Also charged with being members of the banned Ginbot 7 and
receiving support from Eritrea are 16 others, including Ginbot 7
leader Berhanu Nega, who are not in the country.  Defendants including Andualem Arage and Natnael Mekonnen
from the Unity for Democracy and Justice Party complained that a
recent broadcast on state-owned television that branded them
“criminals” was prejudicial to the case, said Negasso, who
attended the hearing. The court rejected the complaint, he said
by phone from the capital,  Addis Ababa , today.  Since June 2011, the Ethiopian government has charged at
least 33 people under its Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009,
 Amnesty International  and  Human Rights Watch  said in a joint e-
mailed statement on Nov. 21, calling for an end to the use of
the “overly broad law” against “peaceful political
activists.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
