Sugar exports from  India , the
world’s second-biggest producer after Brazil, may fall in the
current season from the previous period, according to Czarnikow
Group Ltd.  Shipments in the 2011-12 year that started in October are
unlikely to top last season’s 3 million metric tons, Toby Cohen,
a director at the London-based broker and researcher, said at a
conference in the city today.  “We would need to see a very strong crop” in India for
exports to rise above the 2010-11 level, he said.  Raw sugar fell 9.1 percent over the past month in New York
trading on speculation India’s exports would increase. The
nation has already allowed 1 million tons of shipments and may
permit another million, Cohen said.  Exports are unlikely to reach market expectations of 4
million tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
