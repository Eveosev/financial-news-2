QGEP Participacoes , a unit of
Brazilian engineering and construction company Queiroz Galvao
SA, and state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA rose after
reporting a discovery off the coast of Brazil.  QGEP rose 80 centavos, or 5.3 percent, to 15.98 reais in
 Sao Paulo  at 12:14 p.m., after earlier touching 16 reais, the
highest since Nov. 18. Petrobras, the operator of the BM-S-8
block where the discovery was made, increased 3.1 percent to
22.08 reais.  Petrobras found “good quality” oil while drilling the
Bigua well at the exploration block, the Rio de Janeiro-based
producer said in a statement last night. The discovery is near
the Bem-Te-Vi field, which is also located in the BM-S-8 block,
Petrobras said.  Petrobras said it will start drilling a third well at the
exploration block “in the coming days.” The company plans to
more than double oil production in  Brazil  over the next decade
as it develops fields in the so-called pre-salt area where the
BM-S-8 block is located.  QGEP has agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the BM-S-8
block from Royal Dutch Shell Plc. and is waiting for the
country’s oil regulator to approve the transaction, QGEP said in
a statement last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
