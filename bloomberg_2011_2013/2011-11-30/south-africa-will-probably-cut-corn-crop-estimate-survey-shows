South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably cut its forecast for
this season’s harvest of the grain, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The country may say farmers will reap 10.4 million metric
tons of corn in the season that started on May 1, down from the
10.6 million tons projected in September, according to the
median estimate of eight traders Bloomberg surveyed. Forecasts
ranged from 10.1 million to 10.6 million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  will issue its
final assessment of this year’s harvest on Dec. 1 at 3:30 p.m.
in Johannesburg.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, fell 0.1 percent to 2,435
rand ($293) a ton by the noon close in Johannesburg trading.  Yellow corn for July delivery climbed 1.3 percent to 1,925
rand a ton. The grain is mainly used as  animal feed  in South
Africa. The U.S. and  Argentina  are the world’s biggest corn
exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
