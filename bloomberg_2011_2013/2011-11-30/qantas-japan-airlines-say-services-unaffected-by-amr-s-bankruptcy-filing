Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  and  Japan
Airlines Co. , partners with  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American Airlines in the
Oneworld alliance, said their services are unaffected by the
U.S. company’s bankruptcy filing.  Qantas passengers booked on American Airlines-operated
services with shared flight codes won’t be affected, the Sydney-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. Japan Air’s
codeshare flights with the AMR unit will operate as normal, said
Satoru Tanaka, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based carrier.  AMR, owner of the world’s third-largest airline, filed for
bankruptcy yesterday after failing to secure cost-cutting labor
agreements. Other members of Oneworld include  Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. (293) , British Airways and  Finnair Oyj. (FIA1S)   “We will continue our business activities with American
Airlines as usual,”  Carolyn Leung , a spokeswoman for Hong Kong-
based Cathay, said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News today.  Qantas said its joint business agreement with American is
also unaffected, with the companies continuing to cooperate on
services across the Pacific Ocean. The Australian carrier flies
four times a week to Dallas/Fort Worth, AMR’s largest hub, with
the frequency to increase to daily by July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
