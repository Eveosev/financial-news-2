The Polish zloty slid to a 29-month
low against the euro and fell to the weakest since September
versus the  Swiss franc  as  Standard & Poor’s  cut the credit
ratings of some of the world’s largest banks.  The zloty lost 0.5 percent to 4.5568 per euro as of 9:01
a.m. in Warsaw, the lowest intraday level since June 2009. It
declined 0.5 percent to 3.7132 against the Swiss franc, its
eighth day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
