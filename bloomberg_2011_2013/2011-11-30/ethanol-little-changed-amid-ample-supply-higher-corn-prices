Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  on signs of ample supply and as corn gained amid
economic optimism.  Futures snapped a two-day winning streak after the Energy
Department reported  output  climbed to the highest level since
Dec. 10 and  production of conventional gasoline blended with
ethanol  sank the most in more than six months. The biofuel
averaged a 3.6-cent premium to gasoline in November, versus a
22.14-cent discount over the past year.  “You get ethanol trading at a premium to gasoline like
that, that’s a dog that’s not going to hunt,” said Mike
Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.484 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The futures fell
9.9 percent in November and have climbed 4.5 percent this year.
The discount to gasoline ended the month at 8.37 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.775 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.925, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  dropped 10 cents, or 3.4 percent, to
$2.825 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive plunged 6.5
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.885.  Output of the biofuel jumped 1.4 percent last week to
930,000 barrels a day, the Energy Department report showed.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
plunged 3.7 percent to 4.94 million barrels a day, the biggest
drop and lowest amount since May 6. Refiners get a 45-cent tax
credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Corn for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to $6.08 a
bushel in Chicago. The grain is the primary input for making
ethanol in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
