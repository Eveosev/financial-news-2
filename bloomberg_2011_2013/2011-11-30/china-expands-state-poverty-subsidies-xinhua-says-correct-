(Corrects time period in second paragraph of story
originally published Nov. 28.)  China  raised its income standard for
identifying individuals living in poverty, making more people
eligible to receive government subsidies, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported today.  Those earning 2,300 yuan a year ($362) will now be
classified as living in poverty, making at least 100 million
people eligible for state assistance, Xinhua reported. The
income standard was increased 92 percent from the 2009 level,
according to Xinhua.  Chinese leaders including Premier Wen Jiabao have pledged
to narrow the nation’s widening income gap as the government
seeks to assuage social discontent that could spark unrest.
China is home to more than 150 million people who live on less
than $1 a day, Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  said in January.  The nation had reduced the number of people living in
poverty in rural areas to 26.88 million by the end of 2010,
Xinhua reported, citing a government white paper released last
month. Xinhua cited President  Hu Jintao  as saying at a meeting
on poverty today that the nation’s “general target” was to
ensure that its impoverished would by 2020 no longer need to
worry about food and clothing.  Hu also said that the nation would reverse the widening gap
between rich and poor, Xinhua reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
