Nomura Holdings Inc. ,  Japan ’s
largest brokerage, named Kieran Poynter chairman of its
international unit to replace Colin Marshall, who is stepping
down because of ill health.  Poynter, 61, is a former chairman of accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and joined the board of Nomura
International Plc and Nomura Europe Holdings Plc in November
2009, the Tokyo-based bank said in a statement today. Marshall,
78, will remain a director of both units and advise the firm on
its strategic plans, the lender said.  Poynter “has already proved to be a great asset to our
company in his non-executive director roles,” said John Phizackerley, chief executive officer of Nomura’s European,
Middle Eastern and African unit.  Nomura is cutting jobs and slashing annual costs by $1.2
billion, mostly in  Europe , as it seeks to return to profit after
posting its first quarterly loss in 18 months. The loss from the
lender’s international operations swelled to 52.4 billion yen
($670 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30. The firm this
week cut its assets linked to  Italy  and southern European
nations as the region’s debt crisis intensifies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
