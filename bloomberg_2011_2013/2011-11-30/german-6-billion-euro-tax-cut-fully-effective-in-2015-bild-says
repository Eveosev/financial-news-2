Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s planned
tax relief for  Germany  won’t take full effect until four years
from now,  Bild Zeitung  said, citing a Finance Ministry draft
paper.  Income tax reductions would total 1.9 billion euros ($2.5
billion) in 2013, rising to 5.6 billion euros in 2014 and the
full amount of more than 6 billion euros in 2015, the newspaper
reported today.  Merkel announced plans on Nov. 6 to cut taxes, starting in
2013, saying the move would help boost economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
