Company consolidation will be a main
theme in Turkey next year as indebted businesses are forced to
sell,  Alarko Holding (ALARK)  Chief Executive Officer Ayhan Yavrucu said
in an interview with  Dunya .  Turkish companies should be aggressive in expanding into
the  Middle East  and Africa, where opportunities for growth
abound, Yavrucu told the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Maintaining liquidity in the next two years will be
crucial; global spending cuts will affect Alarkoâ€™s results,
though the company still expects to grow in 2012, Dunya cited
him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
