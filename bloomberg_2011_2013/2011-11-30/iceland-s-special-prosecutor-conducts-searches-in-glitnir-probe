Iceland’s special prosecutor
searched houses and arrested an unspecified number of
individuals in its investigation into loans and share
transaction at failed lender  Glitnir Bank hf .  “Among the matters being investigated are the purchases by
Glitnir’s proprietary trading of shares issued by the bank,”
prosecutor Olafur Hauksson said in an e-mailed statement from
Reykjavik. “Also the bank’s purchases and arrangements of
shares issued by FL Group.”  A total of 10 cases related to Glitnir are being
investigated, including nine that were initiated today. In
addition to Glitnir’s proprietary trading, matters under
investigation include share issues in 2007 and 2008 and
transactions related to future contracts, according to the
statement.  Glitnir was the first of Iceland’s biggest banks to fail in
October 2008, precipitating the collapse of the island’s
financial system and sending the krona down as much as 80
percent against the euro on the offshore market.  Kaupthing Bank
hf ,  Landsbanki Islands hf  and Glitnir together left $86 billion
in debt, compared with Iceland’s 2010 gross domestic product of
$13.3 billion.  Glitnir creditors have brought a total of $29.7 billion in
claims against the bank, its 2010 financial statement showed.
Investors who bought bonds in the bank can expect 25 cents back
on the euro, data provided by brokerage H.F. Verdbref hf  show .  To contact the reporter on this story:
