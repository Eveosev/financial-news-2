Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) ,  India ’s
biggest drugmaker, won U.S. clearance to sell a generic version
of  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s $10.7 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill.  The Food and Drug Administration approved Ranbaxy’s copy of
the world’s top-selling drug, which will be manufactured by Ohm
Laboratories in  New Brunswick ,  New Jersey , the agency said today
in a statement.  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  today began selling
a copy of Lipitor in the U.S. under an agreement with New York-
based Pfizer. Watson’s version didn’t require FDA clearance
because Pfizer is providing the drug to sell without the brand
label in return for a share of the revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
