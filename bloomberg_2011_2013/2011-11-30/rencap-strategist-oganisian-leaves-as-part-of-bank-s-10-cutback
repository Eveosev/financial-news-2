Ovanes Oganisian, an equity
strategist at  Renaissance Capital , has left the Russian
investment bank as part of a 10 percent cut in its workforce.  Oganisian was a “layoff” as part of reduction in staff
announced in September, Preston Mendenhall, a Moscow-based
spokesman, wrote in e-mailed comments today. Oganisian, a 14-
year bank veteran, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Renaissance, partly owned by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
said in September it is cutting 10 percent of its global
workforce, or 125 jobs, to “align” costs with market
conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
