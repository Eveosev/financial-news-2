Airbus SAS and rival U.S. planemaker
 Boeing Co.  agree that  American Airlines ’ bankruptcy won’t scrap
the carrier’s plans for a record purchase of their best-selling
single-aisle jets.  American signed commitments for 260 Airbus A320 jets and
200 of Boeing’s 737s this summer to refresh its aging fleet.
Among them were the A320neo and the 737 MAX, more fuel-efficient
upgrades of aircraft models that are the workhorses of the
 airline industry .  Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said American
Chief Executive Officer Tom Horton has “been very clear
verbally to us” that he intends to keep the contract.  Jim Albaugh , head of Chicago-based Boeing’s commercial airplanes,
expressed similar optimism yesterday.  “They think their future is tied to the neo and the MAX
order,” Albaugh said. “I’m assuming that they will go through
this and they will emerge and sign the deal and take the
planes.”  Horton describe the purchase plans yesterday as “rock
solid” and said the newer, more fuel-efficient jets offer “a
great opportunity for us. If we get our cost and capital
structure where we need it to be, we have ample opportunity to
grow the company.”  The Airbus deal is a firm order, as is  Boeing (BA) ’s contract
for 100 of its current 737s, while the agreement for the 737 MAX
is provisional. The deal hadn’t been completed because Boeing is
still finalizing adjustments to the plane, which requires
structural changes because its engines will be larger than those
on the current 737.  Boeing decided to offer the 737 MAX, an upgrade with more
fuel-efficient engines, to fend off the A320neo and help capture
half of a $2 trillion market in the next 20 years.  The company had intended to replace its single-aisle
aircraft with an all-new plane. It switched strategies in August
after the Airbus neo became the fastest-selling jet ever,
winning more than 1,000 orders and commitments from December
through July. The neo also prompted American to order Airbus
planes for the first time since 1987.  New A320s are 15 percent more fuel-efficient than the MD-
80s they would replace in American’s fleet, and the A320neos
will add another 15 percent to operating efficiency, Leahy said
today at a Credit Suisse conference in  New York .  Airbus will convert about 200 commitments for its neos in
the next two to three months, adding to the 1,250 contracts
already signed, Leahy said.  Orders Top Deliveries  Some of Boeing’s 700 preliminary orders for the  737 MAX 
will be confirmed this year, Albaugh said yesterday in an
interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. Pending deals
include 100 planes for American Airlines and 201 for Indonesian
budget carrier Lion Air.  Boeing has already more than doubled its internal goal for
total commercial-jet orders this year, Albaugh said. The
planemaker had won 516  contracts  through Nov. 22, after saying
in March it wouldn’t be able to match the 530 orders in 2010.  The company expects to sell more jets than it delivers each
year through 2013, with a production plan for 500 to 600 jets a
year.  “We’ve got more orders we’re going to announce this year,
and this is all in the face of a lot of bad economic news,”
Albaugh said.  Airbus’s overall jet orders will decline in 2012 from this
year’s all-time high, Leahy said.  One of the orders the planemakers are competing for is from
 United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  Leahy said in an interview that
the airline will probably order a mix of the current single-
aisle planes and the neos or MAXes “later this year, but most
likely next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
