Takefuji Corp. (8564) , whose bankruptcy
exit plan was approved by a Japanese court in October, said it
may delay a split of the company into two entities until the end
of next month.  The timing will be decided by Eiichi Obata, the attorney
overseeing the turnaround process, the company said in a
statement on its website today.  Japan ’s Nikkei newspaper had
reported that the company might split as early as the beginning
of next month.  South Korean consumer loan company A&P Financial Co. is in
the process of buying Takefuji. A&P Financial was selected as a
preferred bidder for the Japanese company on April 11, among
rival bids from J Trust Co., a Japanese financial-services firm,
TPG Capital and two others.  The plan for Takefuji, crafted by lawyers including Obata,
entails splitting the company into two entities, one responsible
for repaying creditors and another as a viable consumer lending
business. Takefuji’s debt has more than tripled to about 1.5
trillion yen ($19.2 billion) since it filed for bankruptcy in
September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
