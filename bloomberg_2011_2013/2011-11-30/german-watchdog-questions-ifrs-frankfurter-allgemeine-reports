A German accounting watchdog says
the International Financial Reporting Standards are unreliable,
particularly in determining fair value, the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung reported, citing a letter by the group.  The Berlin-based Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel, a
private group, has written to the  International Accounting
Standards Board  saying that the IFRS rules, which are mandatory
for public companies in the European Union, allow too much room
for subjective valuation, the  newspaper  reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
