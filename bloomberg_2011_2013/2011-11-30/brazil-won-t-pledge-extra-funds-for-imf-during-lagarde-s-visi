Brazil  won’t pledge extra resources
for the International Monetary Fund during the visit tomorrow of
the organization’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said
Carlos Cozendey, a Finance Ministry official.  “I don’t expect any announcement to help the IMF because
this is a matter for the next G-20 ministerial meeting scheduled
for February,” Cozendey, the international affairs secretary,
told reporters in Brasilia today.  Lagarde and Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  will
discuss the international situation, the debt crisis in Europe
and how the IMF may help European nations, Cozendey said. They
will also debate the quotas system, which determines how much
clout a country has in the Washington-based organization.  Bilateral loans to the IMF are the best way to help  Europe 
through the organization, Cozendey said. This proposal was
discussed in November at the G-20 summit.  “This is the fastest way to help these countries,”
Cozendey said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
