Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today he expects more coordinated efforts among
central banks could take place.  Policy makers have been working together in terms of
foreign exchange interventions, Flaherty said at a panel
discussion in New York today, and “there was also coordination
in what was proposed this morning.”  Earlier today, the  Federal Reserve  and five other central
banks cut the cost of emergency dollar funding for European
banks as part of a globally coordinated central-bank response to
the continent’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Asked if he expects more of these types of actions,
Flaherty said, “Yes, I do.”  Speaking to reporters after the event, Flaherty called
today’s moves “a positive step,” adding “it will help create
additional liquidity in the financial system, which is good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
