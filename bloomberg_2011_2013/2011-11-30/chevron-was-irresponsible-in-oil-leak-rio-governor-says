Chevron Corp. (CVX)  was “irresponsible”
and acted with an “absolute lack of caution” in operations that
led to a leak in the Frade oilfield off the coast of  Rio de
Janeiro , the state’s governor said.  “The company’s going to pay for this and it’s going to be
expensive,” Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral told reporters
in New York today, according to a statement e-mailed by his
office. He said Chevron used “medieval techniques” in the
operations.  Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27.6 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked,  Haroldo Lima ,
head of  Brazil ’s oil regulator, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
said Nov. 22.  The company will be fined for falsifying information to ANP
and also for failing to meet a plan to counter the accident, the
regulator has said.  Cabral’s statement did not specify if further actions would
be taken against Chevron.  In an e-mailed statement, Chevron said it quickly moved to
address the leak.  “Our combined efforts greatly diminished the size of the
sheen and stopped the source of the seep flow within only four
days of first detection,” the company said in an e-mail from its
press department. “Up to 18 vessels have been in rotating
operation to support well plugging operations and sheen
cleanup.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
