Sloveniaâ€™s  economy  unexpectedly
contracted in the third quarter from a year earlier as
industrial output and export growth lost pace.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.5 percent from a year
earlier, compared with revised growth of 0.8 percent in the
second quarter, the statistics  office  in Ljubljana said today on
its website. The median estimate of seven economists in a
Bloomberg  survey  called for GDP rising 0.8 percent.  Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent in November from a year
before, the same pace as the previous month, and 0.3 percent in
the month. Retail sales rose 1.8 percent in the year in October
and 0.8 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
