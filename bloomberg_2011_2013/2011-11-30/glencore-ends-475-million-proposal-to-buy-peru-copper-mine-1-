Glencore International Plc , the
biggest publicly traded commodities trader, ended a proposal to
buy a majority stake in a South American copper project for $475
million,  CST Mining Group Ltd. (985)  said.  Glencore terminated the deal to buy a 70 percent stake in
the Mina Justa project in  Peru  because it couldn’t reach
agreement with joint-venture partner Marcobre S.A.C., Hong Kong-
based CST Mining said in a statement today.  “The company will continue to explore its options in
relation to the Mina Justa project,” CST Mining said in the
statement. The company’s vice-chairman is Owen Hegarty, who’s
also vice-chairman of Hong Kong-based G-Resources Group Ltd.  Glencore had agreed to buy CST Resources Ltd., a CST unit
that owns 70 percent of Marcobre, CST Mining said in July.  CST fell 10 percent to 9 Hong Kong cents at 10:22 a.m. The
stock has fallen 54 percent this year, compared with a 21
percent drop in the  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
