Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  jumped 105.54,
or 4.8 percent, to 2,288.07 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
the biggest gain since May 2010. The benchmark dropped 5 percent
this month.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  , Poland’s biggest bank, soared
5.8 percent to 33.42 zloty, the biggest gain in more than a
month.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , controlled by UniCredit SpA,
climbed 6.8 percent to 146.3 zloty and  Bank Handlowy SA (BHW)  , a unit of Citigroup Inc., rose 8.4 percent to 71.6 zloty.  Financial shares soared in Europe as the  Federal Reserve 
and five other central banks lowered the cost of dollar funding
and China cut its reserve ratio for lenders.  Separately, PKO will report record net income this year,
Chief Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello said in an interview
on Radio PiN.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, added
4.6 percent to 25 zloty, the biggest gain in a month. Oil
futures climbed as much as 2 percent following the move by the
central banks.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , a copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, gained the most in two weeks,
adding 4.3 percent to 132.5 zloty as the price of the metal
advanced.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s largest oil company, gained
5.8 percent to 40.19 zloty, the highest close in three weeks.
Refining margins at Poland’s largest oil company are likely to
be better in the fourth quarter than the third, Chief Financial
Officer Slawomir Jedrzejczyk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
