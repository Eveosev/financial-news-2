The cost for European banks to fund
in dollars rose for a sixth day to the highest levels in three
years, according to money-market indicators.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 159 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:25 a.m. in  London ,
from minus 158 yesterday. The measure is the most expensive on a
closing basis since October 2008.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 105 basis
points under Euribor, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, a measure of banksâ€™ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe , was little changed at 97 basis
points. The spread, which is the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was 98 basis
points on Nov. 3, the widest since March 2009.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 297 billion euros ($394 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 281 billion euros on Nov.
28. That compares with a year-to-date average of 80 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
