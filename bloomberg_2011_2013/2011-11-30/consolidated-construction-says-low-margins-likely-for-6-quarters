S. Sivaramakrishnan, managing
director of  Consolidated Construction Consortium Ltd. (CCCL) , comments
on the company’s expected performance for the next six quarters
after posting a loss in the three months ended Sept. 30. He
spoke by telephone from the southern city of Chennai, where the
provider of construction services is based.  “Until the middle of 2013-14, we expect our margins will
be low because of interest costs and overheads not getting
covered by the business.  ‘‘Slowly, we are coming out of fixed-price contracts.  ‘‘However, for the quarter ended March 2012, we may be back
in the black as we expect to complete three or four projects
between 500 million rupees and 3 billion rupees and expect money
to come in.  ‘‘Whatever new contracts we are bidding now, we have price
protection and we will be able to pass on the increase in costs
to our customers.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
