Red Bull  GmbH, an Austrian energy-
drink maker, lost a court bid to stop a maker of Scalextric
racing games from putting its brand name on toy cars.  A court in Alicante,  Spain , that frequently rules on
European Union trademark cases dismissed the complaint against
 Tecnitoys Juguetes S.A. , Tomas Fornesa a lawyer for the
Barcelona-based company, said by phone. Red Bull initially
sought 9 percent of game sales, he said.  Red Bull’s sponsorships in car racing have included backing
Volkswagen AG’s entry in the Dakar Rally. Tecnitoys replicates
the advertising logos on the racing cars. The toy-maker doesn’t
make a version of the Formula One cars from Red Bull’s two
Formula One teams, Fornesa said.  “Nobody buys our games for the Red Bull branding,”
Fornesa said. “That would be like someone buying a Real  Madrid 
soccer shirt because of the sponsor’s name.”  Tecnitoys and other Scalextric makers typically pay
licensing fees of between 4 percent and 10 percent of sales to
carmakers including McLaren Group Ltd. and Daimler AG’s  Mercedes
Benz  to replicate their racing cars, Fornesa said.  Red Bull’s deadline to appeal has expired, Fornesa said.

Bull, didn’t return two e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
