RusPetro Plc, an oil and gas company
with its main assets in  Russia , will start gauging investor
demand for its $300 million initial public offering in London
tomorrow, according a sales document obtained by Bloomberg News.  All shares being sold in the IPO will be primary, the terms
show, meaning the company will receive all the proceeds from the
sale. The managers for the offering,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
Mirabaud Securities LLP and Renaissance Capital Ltd., are
scheduled to start taking orders on Dec. 7, the terms show.  RusPetro is pressing ahead with its share sale as IPOs came
to a near standstill in western  Europe  amid the region’s
sovereign debt crisis. About $1.3 billion has been raised since
August, compared with $10.7 billion in the same period last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European companies including Spain’s lottery operator
Sociedad Estatal Loterias y Apuestas del Estado and  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s
lighting unit Osram AG have postponed or withdrawn IPOs valued
at at least $20 billion in the past four months, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
