Louis Freeh , the former director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said his work is “under
way” as the court-appointed trustee for bankrupt  MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MF) , the parent of a defunct futures brokerage.  Freeh, whose job is to work with regulators and promote a
quick return of funds to creditors, spoke today at a hearing in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan , where he updated the judge
presiding over the case on his progress.  “We’re under way,” he said.  Freeh told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn that he has
met with representatives of New York-based MF Global and
understands the “urgency” of those involved in the collapse of
the firm, which filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31.  Freeh declined to comment after the hearing.  Glenn asked for a status report on the case at a future
hearing, saying he reads regularly in the media about the
fallout from the bankruptcy, while there is “very little said
in court.” The court has been “flooded” with communications
from customers of the firm, he said. Parties involved in the
case are entitled to more information, the judge said.  Martin J. Bienenstock, a lawyer for the MF Global creditors
committee, supported the judge’s request.  “We, too, read in the papers and see figures and facts or
what may or may not be facts,” he said.  The parent’s bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd.,
11-bk-15059,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
