Saudi Arabia ’s Prince Turki al- Faisal, a former ambassador to the U.S. and head of
intelligence, warned against an attack on  Iran  to halt its
nuclear program, the  Jordan Times  reported.  “It is important to remember there are other non-
military policy alternatives, as yet unexplored, that could
have the desired result without the unwanted consequences,” the
Amman-based  newspaper  cited Turki as saying at a conference in
Jordan yesterday. “We are sending messages to Iran that it is
their right, as it is in any nation’s right, and as we ourselves
are doing, to develop a civilian nuclear program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
