Mexico ’s central bank will cut
 interest rates  25 basis points to 4.25 percent this week
following the global coordinated response to  Europe ’s debt
crisis, Nomura Securities Inc. said.  “The door has been opened for the central bank of Mexico
to cut its policy rate,” New York-based strategist  Benito Berber  wrote in an e-mailed report. “The one obstacle for
Banxico to cut was the weakness of the Mexican peso.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
