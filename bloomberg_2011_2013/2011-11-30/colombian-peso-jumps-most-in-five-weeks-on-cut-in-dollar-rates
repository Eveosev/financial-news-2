Colombia’s peso rose the most in
five weeks after central banks including the  Federal Reserve  cut
the cost of emergency dollar funding, helping easing strains in
global financial markets caused and shore up demand for
emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 0.9 percent to 1,946.69 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:45 a.m. Bogota time, from 1,963.39 yesterday. The gain is
the biggest since Oct. 27.  The central banks of the U.S., the euro region, Canada, the
U.K.,  Japan  and Switzerland agreed to cut the cost of providing
dollar funding via swap arrangements, the Federal Reserve said,
and decided to make other currencies available as needed. China
said earlier today it will cut the reserve requirement ratio for
banks by 0.5 percentage point from Dec. 5.  “Latin American currencies are rallying,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota. “A boost
in liquidity favors the foreign-exchange market.”  Easing inflation concerns in  Colombia , spurred by the
central bank’s move to boost the benchmark overnight rate last
week, are also helping fuel gains in bonds, according to Lozano.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.62
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.580 centavo to 118.810 centavos per peso.  Banco de la Republica raised the overnight lending rate by
25 basis points to 4.75 percent on Nov. 25, making Colombia the
only country in  Latin America  to raise rates in the past four
months. Brazil started cutting borrowing costs in August as
countries across  emerging markets  began to protect their
economies from the global slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
