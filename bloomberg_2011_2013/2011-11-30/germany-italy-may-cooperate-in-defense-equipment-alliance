Germany  and Italy plan to extend
cooperation over procurement for defense equipment and the
modernization of armed forces as governments look for ways to
shrink budgets.  “It is a declaration of intent that the two countries
would like to cooperate in regards to the equipment of the armed
forces within the framework of existing EU and Nato
initiatives,” a spokesman at the German Ministry of Defense
said in a telephone interview today.  The two nations signed a letter of intent yesterday. It
follows an agreement between Britain and  France  last year
allowing those nations to share nuclear-testing facilities and
aircraft carriers, as well as the formation of a joint troop
expeditionary force.  Cooperation on defense equipment between Italy and Germany
could span areas such as unmanned systems, ground vehicles,
missiles and counter measures, with weapons providers in each
nation partnering.  Since the Anglo-French treaty, Dassault Aviation SA has
teamed up with BAE Systems Plc to develop their Telemos drone.
Paris- and Munich-based European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.
has been developing its Talarion vehicle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
