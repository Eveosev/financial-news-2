Oil rose to the highest in almost
two weeks after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the cost of
emergency dollar funding for European banks as part of a
coordinated response to the continent’s sovereign-debt crisis.  West Texas Intermediate crude jumped as much as 1.9 percent
after the Fed said in a statement that the joint action with the
Bank of Canada, the  Bank of England , the Bank of  Japan , the
 European Central Bank  and the Swiss National Bank was undertaken
to ease strains on financial markets and help foster economic
activity. The dollar index declined 0.7 percent.  “News that the Fed and five central banks lowered  interest
rates  on U.S. dollar swaps weighed heavily on the dollar, with a
result of a strong rally in crude oil prices,” Myrto Sokou, a
London-based analyst at Sucden Financial Ltd., said by e-mail.  Crude for January delivery rose as much as $1.85 to $101.64
a barrel and was at $101.22 in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:49 p.m. London time.  Brent oil for January settlement was up 68 cents at $111.50
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, having
earlier dropped 1.1 percent. It closed yesterday up 1.7 percent
at $110.82.  The European benchmark contract’s premium to  New York ’s
West Texas Intermediate was at $10.28 a barrel, compared with
yesterday’s close of $11.14 and a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Oil rose earlier in the session after  China  cut the amount
of cash that banks must set aside as reserves for the first time
since 2008 as Europe’s debt crisis dims the outlook for exports
and growth.  Jobs Growth  U.S. companies added more workers than anticipated in
November, easing concern the job market is stagnating in the
third year of the nation’s recovery, according to a private
report based on payrolls.  The 206,000 increase was the biggest this year and followed
a revised 130,000 gain the prior month, Roseland, New Jersey-
based ADP Employer Services said today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an advance of
130,000.  U.S. crude inventories rose to 339.2 million barrels as
imports surged 10 percent in the week to Nov. 25, the API report
showed. An Energy Department report today will probably show
 supplies  increased 50,000 barrels, according to the median of
responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles slipped 173,000 barrels to 209.4
million, according to the API. Distillate fuels, including
diesel and heating oil, gained 1.35 million barrels to 139.5
million. Oil-product imports rose 8.5 percent, the group said.  Analysts in the Bloomberg survey predicted the Energy
Department will say motor-fuel supplies climbed 1.45 million
barrels while distillates declined 1.25 million. The department
is scheduled to release its inventory data today at 10:30 a.m.
in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
