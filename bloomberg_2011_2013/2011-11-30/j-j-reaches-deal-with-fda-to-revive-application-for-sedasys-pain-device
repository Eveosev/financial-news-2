Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s
second-biggest seller of health products, reached an agreement
with U.S. regulators to reopen its application for the Sedasys
sedation system for endoscopy patients.  The company said it withdrew an appeal of the  Food and Drug
Administration ’s April 2010 denial of the Sedasys application
because of the agreement. An FDA advisory panel was scheduled to
meet Dec. 14 on the appeal.  Sedasys is a computer-assisted system that administers
propofol for patients being screened for colorectal cancer or
undergoing upper gastrointestinal procedures. A trial showed
patients who used Sedasys had a lower risk of over-sedation than
those given benzodiazepine and opioids,  New Brunswick , New
Jersey-based J&J said.  “We’ve worked cooperatively with the FDA in recent months
to address the agency’s concerns and we’re optimistic that we
now have a path forward that will allow us to bring this
important innovation to market,” Karen Licitra, company group
chairwoman and worldwide franchise chairwoman for J&J subsidiary
Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
