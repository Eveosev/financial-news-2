Tim Condon , head of Asian research
for ING Groep NV, comments on the People’s Bank of  China ’s
announcement that it will cut the reserve requirement for the
nation’s lenders by 0.5 percentage points effective Dec. 5.  The reserve requirement cut “signals that the PBOC’s
 interest rate  hiking cycle is over. I don’t think it signals an
interest rate cut.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
