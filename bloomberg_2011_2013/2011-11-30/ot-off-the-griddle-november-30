Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Griddle, a morning menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. Violent thunderstorms marred the opening of international talks on  climate change  this week, and the news out of Durban remains turbulent.  China , Brazil and other developing nations want to extend the soon-to-expire  Kyoto Protocol , which legally limits greenhouse gas emissions in participating industrial countries. The U.S. prefers to scrap Kyoto, which it never joined anyway, and focus on non-binding agreements like those reached in Cancun last year that include both rich and poor nations.  Su Wei , Beijing's lead negotiator, told Bloomberg News's Alex Morales  yesterday: "If we cannot get a decision for the future of the second commitment period, the whole international system on climate change will be placed in peril."
