Beiersdorf AG , the maker of Nivea
skin creams, said it plans to cut as many as 1,000 jobs over the
next three years as it seeks to reduce expenses by 90 million
euros ($121 million) annually by 2014.  The job reductions will be spread across the world,
including as many as 230 in  Germany , the Hamburg-based company
said today. Beiersdorfâ€™s global workforce will shrink to about
17,000, spokesman Thomas Schonen said in a telephone interview.  Beiersdorf , which cut profit forecasts twice at the end of
last year, is seeking to address shrinking margins and stagnant
sales at its consumer unit. The German company is reducing its
beauty-products lineup to focus on skin care.  The cost-cutting measures will produce annual savings of
about 25 million euros in 2012, 75 million euros in 2013 and 90
million euros in 2014, Schonen said.  Beiersdorf  anticipates one-
time costs of about 265 million euros, most of which will be
incurred this year. These include 140 million euros for a
reduction in the value of a hair-care business in  China .  Beiersdorf rose  as much as 4 percent in Frankfurt trading
and was up 3.5 percent at 42.54 euros at 4:28 p.m. Maxingvest
AG, the Herz family investment vehicle that controls the Tchibo
coffee retailer, owns a majority of the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
