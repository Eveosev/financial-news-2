Medicare paid nursing homes to
administer powerful anti-psychotic drugs to elderly residents
who shouldn’t take the medicines, the program’s inspector
general told Congress.  Medicare improperly paid about $116 million in the first
half of 2007 for prescriptions filled in nursing homes for a
class of drugs called atypical anti-psychotics, Daniel Levinson
told the Senate Committee on Aging in a hearing today.
Psychiatrists reviewing claims determined they weren’t for
“medically accepted indications,” a violation of Medicare
payment rules, he said.  Medicare is the U.S. program for the elderly and disabled.
Brian Cook, a spokesman for Medicare, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  Anti-psychotics include  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s Seroquel and  Eli
Lilly & Co. (LLY) ’s Zyprexa. The drugs are customarily used to treat
conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Levinson didn’t name specific drugs in his testimony.  The “large majority” of the prescriptions were written
for elderly patients with dementia, who face an increased risk
of death from using anti-psychotics, Levinson said.  “Medicare is paying for drugs that it should not,” he
told the committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
