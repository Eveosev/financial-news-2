Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , the
maker of Subaru-brand cars, forecast an increase in sales in the
U.S. next year.  “Sales next year will definitely top this year’s and reach
about 300,000 units,” President Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said in an
interview today at the Tokyo Motor Show. “Sales in the U.S. may
beat last year’s as early as this year.”  The company plans to introduce a hybrid vehicle in 2013,
and sales in  China  may reach 58,000 units this year, Yoshinaga
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
