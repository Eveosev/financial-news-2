Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-
largest carmaker, plans to introduce a hybrid version of its
Accord sedan next year, President Takanobu Ito said.  “We are currently developing a hybrid engine system for
mid- to large-sized vehicles,” Ito said in an interview at the
Tokyo Motor Show today.  Toyota Motor Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker, said yesterday
it plans to introduce a plug-in version of the best-selling
Prius in Japan at the end of January, with prices starting from
3.2 million yen ($41,030). The new Prius PHV has a fuel-economy
rating of 61 kilometers per liter and a cruising range of 26.4
kilometers on its lithium-ion battery, which can be charged
using a household electricity outlet, according to the company.  Honda expects hybrid cars to account for half of its annual
Japanese sales by the end of March, Managing Officer Sho Minekawa said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
