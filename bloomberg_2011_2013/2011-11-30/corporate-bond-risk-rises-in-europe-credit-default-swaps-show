The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate and sovereign debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped three
basis points to 788.5 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. at 11:30 a.m. in London. A decline signals improved
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down 1.75 at 194 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers dropped six basis points to 325 and the
subordinated gauge was down 10 at 565.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 12 basis points to 356 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
