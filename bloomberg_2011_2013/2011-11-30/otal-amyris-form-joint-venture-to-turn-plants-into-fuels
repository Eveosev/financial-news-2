Total SA (FP) , Europe’s largest refiner
by capacity, will form a joint venture with  Amyris (AMRS)  Inc. to
produce and sell diesel and jet fuel made from plants.  The venture will begin operations in the first quarter of
2012, the companies said today in a statement. Total will also
contribute $105 million to an existing $180 million research
program that’s aimed at commercializing a process that converts
organic sugars from plants into transportation fuels.  Amyris, the Emeryville, California-based biofuel company
that’s 21 percent owned by Total, sells chemicals and
transportation fuels made from plant sugars. The collaboration
is an expansion of a partnership created in June 2010, when
Total invested in Amyris. The venture will help Amyris
commercialize its fuel products and provides Total with a new
supply of fuel.  Shares of Amyris fell 0.2 percent to $10.40 at 10:15 a.m.
in  New York . Total rose 3 percent to 38.38 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
