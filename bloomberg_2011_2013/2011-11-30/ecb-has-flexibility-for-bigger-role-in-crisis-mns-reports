Some European Central Bank policy
makers are open to expanding the bank’s role in fighting the
sovereign debt crisis, Market News International reported,
citing unidentified people.  “The mood on the Council is shifting,” the  news agency 
quoted one Eurosystem official as saying. “Even some
traditionally more hawkish national central banks” are “open
to a more pro-active role.”  At the same time, Market News reported that members willing
to do more face resistance from a German-led contingent that may
make larger-scale bond purchases or other forms or assistance
harder to push through. The ECB “stands ready” to cut  interest
rates  further if necessary, MNS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
