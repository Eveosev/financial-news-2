The customs union of Russia, Belarus
and  Kazakhstan  may extend a restrictive duty on raw sugar
imports by three months due to a record harvest of sugar beets,
Interfax reported, citing Ivan Danchenko, head of the Belarusian
state-run producer Belgospischeprom.  Sugar producers asked customs to extend the seasonal duty
of $140 a metric ton to Aug. 1 instead of decreasing it to $50 a
ton on May 1, the Moscow-based newswire reported. Andrey Bodin,
head of Russian Sugar Producersâ€™ Union, declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
