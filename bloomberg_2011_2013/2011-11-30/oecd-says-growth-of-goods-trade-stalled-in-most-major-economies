The  Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development  said trade in merchandise stalled in
most major economies in the third quarter.  Imports in the Group of Seven nations, along with Brazil,
Russia, India, China and  South Africa , contracted 1 percent
after growing 4.2 percent in the second quarter, the OECD said
today in an e-mailed statement. Export growth slowed to 1
percent from 4.6 percent.  The Paris-based OECD cut growth forecasts for its 34 member
states this week to reflect doubts that the European monetary
union will survive the sovereign debt crisis. The region’s
finance ministers meeting in Brussels today will seek a greater
role for the International Monetary Fund to fight the turmoil.  Today’s OECD report showed export growth in  China  slowed
“sharply” to 3.2 percent in the third quarter from 10.1
percent in the previous three months. Import growth accelerated
to 2.8 percent from 0.9 percent. U.S. imports shrank 2.7 percent
in the third quarter, while export growth slowed to 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
