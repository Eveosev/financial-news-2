MBIA Inc. (MBI)  had the BBB ratings on its
municipal bond insurance unit affirmed by Standard & Poor’s
today after an overhaul of the ratings company’s criteria. Its
shares rose by the most since September 2009.  S&P said the business and financial risk profile of MBIA’s
National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. unit was “strong”
based on the updated criteria. The outlook remains
“developing” because of two-year-old litigation that is
challenging MBIA’s 2009 restructuring. This allowed the insurer
to spin off the municipal insurance business into the new unit
and separated it from a subsidiary that guaranteed soured
mortgage-backed debt.  National Public Finance has been shut out of the market for
writing new bond insurance while the litigation continues.  “We believe the strong and stable stream of earned
premiums and investment income contribution will support
National while it remains inactive, and its strong distribution
and management team may position it well in the market once the
litigation is settled,” S&P said in the statement.  S&P also affirmed its B rating on MBIA Insurance Corp., the
old subsidiary that held onto the mortgage security guarantees.
The outlook on the unit remained negative.  MBIA extended gains after the statement, climbing as much
as 19.6 percent to $9.77, before falling to $9.70 as of 4 p.m.
