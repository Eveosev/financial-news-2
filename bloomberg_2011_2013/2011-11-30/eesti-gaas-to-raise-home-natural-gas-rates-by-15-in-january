Eesti Gaas AS, the Estonian gas
monopoly, said it will raise natural gas rates for households by
15 percent from January because of higher global gas and oil
prices and the debt crisis in  Europe .  The rate for the largest group of household clients, who
consume as much as 100,000 cubic meters of gas per year, will
rise to 40 euro cents per cubic meter, including VAT, from 35
cents, the company said in a statement on its  website .  Eesti Gaas, whose biggest owner and only supplier is
 Russia â€™s OAO  Gazprom , said its contract with Gazprom is based on
 heavy fuel oil prices  that have risen substantially from an
average $514 per ton last January.  A weaker euro-dollar  exchange rate  because of the euro area
sovereign debt crisis is also negatively affecting purchase
prices, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
