Taiwan ’s dollar rose to the
strongest level in a week on speculation exporters are taking
advantage of a relatively favorable  exchange rate  to repatriate
income.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Global investors bought $284 million more Taiwanese shares
than they sold in the past three days, ending an eight-day run
of net sales, exchange data show. The local dollar lost 1.4
percent this month after $1.7 billion was pulled from the stock
market as the lingering European debt crisis damped demand for
riskier emerging-market assets.  “Foreign funds have poured quite a big amount of money
into the market lately, and exporters are selling the greenback
as well,” said Tarsicio Tong, a trader at Union Bank of Taiwan
in Taipei. “Trading volumes are getting significantly less as
we approach the end of the year.”  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.2 percent to NT$30.345 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It hit the high
of NT$30.266 earlier.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 was little
changed at 1.036 percent from 1.040 percent yesterday, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate has dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, in November. The central
bank is scheduled to review borrowing costs before year-end,
with a date yet to be announced.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was at 0.397 percent compared with 0.396
percent yesterday, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
