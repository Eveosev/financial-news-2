Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689)  and  Rakuten Inc. (4755) 
rose for a second day on optimism that the companies’ shopping
sites may lure more customers during next month’s holiday season,
mirroring a surge in U.S. online sales on Cyber Monday.  Yahoo  Japan  advanced the most in two months, rising as much
as 6.3 percent to 24,500 yen, and traded at 23,710 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange at the 11:30 a.m. trading break. Rakuten
added as much as 2.9 percent to 84,100 yen on the Osaka
Securities Exchange’s Jasdaq market.  U.S. online sales increased more than 20 percent from a
year earlier on Cyber Monday, the first Monday after
Thanksgiving. E-commerce sites clamor to reach consumers on the
day, aiming to get workers to shop from their office computers
after the long holiday weekend.  “The report triggered some investors to buy companies like
Yahoo,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at
Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.  In the U.S., Cyber Monday online revenue jumped 33 percent,
according to International Business Machines Corp., while
 ComScore Inc. (SCOR)  put the increase at 22 percent.  Separately, Yahoo! Inc. aims to find a buyer for a minority
stake by the end of this year, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar with the matter. There are at least three
bidders including TPG Capital for about a 20 percent stake in
Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, according to the report. The
website operator owns about 35 percent of Tokyo-based Yahoo
Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
