Chinese equities traded in the U.S.
rose the most in three months after the nation cut banks’
reserve requirements for the first time since 2008 to bolster
growth.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  jumped 4.7 percent to
101.05 at the close of trading in  New York  yesterday, its
biggest gain since Aug. 11. The surge pushed the benchmark up
1.3 percent for the month.  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , the

percentage point effective Dec. 5, the People’s Bank of China

U.S. Federal Reserve, the  European Central Bank  and the monetary
authorities of the U.K.,  Canada , Japan and  Switzerland  said they
were cutting the cost of emergency dollar funding to ease
strains in financial markets.  “The impact of the reserve ratio cut is definitely going
to be positive, at least for the next few days,” said  John Wong , a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Oberweis Asset
Management Inc. “The timing could not have been better because
the Chinese would like to improve liquidity before the Chinese
New Year holiday in January.”  Reduced Forecasts  The 34 member nations of the Organization for Economic

two years. UBS AG this week lowered its prediction for growth in
2012 to 8 percent from its previous call of 8.3 percent, and
Citigroup Inc. cut its forecast to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  rose 4.3 percent to
1,246.96, the most since August, after the central banks’
announcement. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 3.3 percent, the
most in almost four months, before the Chinese government
announced the reserve ratio cut.  A Chinese report due today may show November manufacturing

October, according to the median forecast of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Melco Surges  Melco Crown leaped the most since Oct. 6 to $9.92. It said

during broadcasts of dramas starting Jan. 1, the nation’s
regulator of radio, film and television said on Nov. 28.  “The new restriction may lead to a shifting in advertising

services,” Paul Wuh, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Samsung
Securities Co., wrote in a research note yesterday.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the fifth-largest solar-panel maker in
