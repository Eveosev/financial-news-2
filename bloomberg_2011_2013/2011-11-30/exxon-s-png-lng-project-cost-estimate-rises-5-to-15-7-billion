Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  increased the cost
estimate for its liquefied natural gas project in  Papua New
Guinea  by about 5 percent to $15.7 billion because of a stronger
Australian dollar, according to partner  Santos Ltd. (STO)   The LNG venture remains on schedule to begin exports in
2014, the Adelaide-based company said today in a statement.
Santos, Australia’s third-largest oil and gas producer, said its
share of the additional cost is about $100 million.  The Exxon project is among more than A$200 billion ($205
billion) of LNG ventures planned in Australia and Papua New
Guinea to meet Asian demand for cleaner-burning alternatives to
coal. Australian LNG projects face rising costs and delays as
the nation moves to challenge Qatar for the top spot in global
rankings of LNG exporters,  Standard & Poor’s  said Nov. 29.  “If the costs were to increase again, you’d be concerned,
but if this is the extent of it then it’s still looking like a
reasonably attractive project,” Ivor Ries, a Melbourne-based
analyst at E.L. & C. Baillieu Stockbroking Ltd., said by phone.  The $14 billion of financing arranged by the partners
covers the part of the increased cost that will be funded by
debt, partner  Oil Search Ltd. (OSH)  said in a statement.  “Costs of project components often fluctuate throughout
the life of a project,” Port Moresby-based Oil Search said.  Shares of Santos rose 1.3 percent to A$13.25 at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney, compared with a 2.6 percent gain in the
S&P/ASX 200 Index. Oil Search climbed 1.6 percent to A$6.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
