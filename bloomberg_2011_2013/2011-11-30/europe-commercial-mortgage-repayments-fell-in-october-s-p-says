Commercial mortgage borrowers in
 Europe  are struggling to repay loans as declining asset values
make it difficult to get new funding,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Only five out of 35 loans maturing last month were repaid
in full, S&P said in a report based on data from commercial
mortgage-backed securities it rates. That compares with 13 loans
extended, eight declared in default and three loans held in a
so-called standstill.  “Four of the five loans that repaid had reported loan-to-
value ratios below 70 percent,” according to S&P analysts
including Judith O’Driscoll and Robert Leach. “Seven of the
eight loans that defaulted had an LTV ratio greater than 70%.”  Banks create mortgage-backed securities by pooling loans
and selling them to investors as notes. The bonds typically
allow lenders to raise capital more cheaply than by issuing
unsecured debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
