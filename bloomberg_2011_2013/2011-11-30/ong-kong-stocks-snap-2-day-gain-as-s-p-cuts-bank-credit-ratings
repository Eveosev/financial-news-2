America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  fell 2.1 percent after S&P also cut
 Europe ’s biggest lender to A+ from AA-.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  and

sentiment,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank
Ltd. in  Tokyo . “What investors are really paying attention to
is whether policy makers are going to take steps to resolve the
European debt situation.”  Downgrades  Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup had their
long-term credit grades reduced to A- from A by S&P after the
ratings firm revised criteria for dozens of the largest global
lenders. It made the same cut to Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America’s Merrill Lynch unit. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was reduced
one level to A from A+.  Financial firms were the biggest drag on the Hang Seng

Asia Pacific, slid 1.6 percent to HK$159.40.  Chinese banks fell even after Bank of China and China

its A rating on Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
giving all three lenders higher grades than most big U.S. banks.  Bank of China lost 1.6 percent to HK$2.41, and China

confirmed the letter had been issued, without giving details of
its contents.  In Europe, the region’s effort to expand its bailout fund
is falling short, forcing euro-area finance ministers to
consider greater roles for the  International Monetary Fund  and
