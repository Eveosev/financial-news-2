Sugar gained for the third straight
day after central banks moved to ease strains from  Europe ’s debt
crisis, bolstering prospects for global growth and commodity
demand.  The  Federal Reserve  and five other central banks cut the
cost of emergency dollar funding for European banks, as part of
a global effort to ease the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials gained as much
as 1.7 percent. The dollar fell as much as 1.4 percent against a
basket of major currencies, boosting the appeal of commodities.  “The Fed’s maneuver this morning in concert with other
central banks” is lifting the liquidity line, Sterling Smith,
an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul , Minnesota, said
in a telephone interview. “It’s risk-on.”  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.9 percent to settle
at 23.69 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The commodity has dropped 26 percent this year.  Exports from India, the world’s second-largest producer,
may fall in the season that started in October from a year
earlier, said Toby Cohen, a director at London-based Czarnikow
Group Ltd., a broker and research. Prices have fallen 8.1
percent this month partly on speculation India’s shipments would
increase.  Brazil is the top grower and exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
