Visteon Corp.  and  BorgWarner (BWA)  Inc.
each rose more than 6 percent after the U.S.-based automotive
suppliers announced plans to divest units.  Visteon rose 5.8 percent to $55.52 at 11:23 a.m. New York
time, after touching $56.05, or 6.8 percent. BorgWarner gained
6.2 percent to $66.04 after reaching $66.33, or 6.7 percent.
Before today, Visteon, a maker of car interiors and other parts,
had plunged 29 percent this year, while BorgWarner, which makes
turbochargers, had slid 14 percent.  BorgWarner and Visteon are moving to divest the units to
concentrate on subsidiaries they say represent their main
businesses. Visteon, spun off from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2000, is
narrowing its operations after exiting a 16-month bankruptcy
last year.  Visteon today said it signed a memorandum of understanding
to sell most of its interiors unit, which represented 29 percent
of last year’s sales, to Yanfeng Visteon Automotive Trim Systems
Co., a Chinese joint venture with  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)   A sales agreement may be reached in early 2012, Visteon
said. If a transaction occurs, the company would no longer
record revenue from the interiors unit.  Visteon, based in Van Buren Township, Michigan, has been
shopping its lower-margin interiors and lighting units to focus
on faster-growing operations in  Asia , five people familiar with
the sale process said in October.  Unit’s Profit Margin  Visteon received  $2.16 billion  of its $7.47 billion in
revenue last year from the interiors unit, which is focused on
 Europe , Asia and  South America . The unit’s gross margin was 6
percent last year, compared with 10.2 percent for Visteon as a
whole, Visteon said in a July investor presentation.  BorgWarner said today it agreed to sell its tire-pressure
monitoring unit to Huf Electronics GmbH, based in Velbert,
 Germany . Terms were not disclosed. The sale includes a factory
in Bretten, Germany, where about 230 people work.  BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, gained the
unit in 2005 when it acquired Beru AG, a maker of starting
systems for diesel engines. The company said the tire-pressure
monitoring unit “departs from BorgWarner’s strong focus on
powertrain technologies.”  The 24-member Bloomberg Americas Auto Part/Equipment Index
has risen 5.9 percent today to 60.71.  To contact the reporter on this story:
