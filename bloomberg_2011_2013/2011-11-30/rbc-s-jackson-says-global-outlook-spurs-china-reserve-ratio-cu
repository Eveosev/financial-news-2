Brian Jackson , a Hong Kong-based
strategist with Royal Bank of Canada, comments on the People’s
Bank of  China ’s announcement that it will cut the reserve
requirement for the nation’s lenders by 0.5 percentage points
from Dec. 5.  “Today’s reserve requirement ratio cut comes a little
earlier than we expected but in line with our view that Beijing
will prefer to use this tool as the first option to adjust
policy stance.”  “Reserve requirement ratios were also one of the initial
tools used when policy began to be tightened in 2010 and have
been at historically high levels throughout 2011, so this move
provides a quick and easy way to free up reserves and loosen
credit conditions ahead of the usual seasonal surge in bank
lending in the first quarter.”  “More reserve requirement ratio cuts are likely in coming
months as policy-makers respond to the weaker global growth
outlook, though we continue to expect no change to benchmark
policy rates for the time being.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
