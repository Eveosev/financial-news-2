Mazda Motor Corp.  may revise its
plan to raise exports because of stagnating demand in the U.S.,
said Chief Executive Officer Takashi Yamanouchi.  “We will keep our overall framework for our midterm plan,
but we may change some parts,” Yamanouchi said in an interview
at the Tokyo Motor Show today. “We’re studying about whether to
maintain our plan to raise our export ratio to 85 percent” from
80 percent, he said.  The Hiroshima, Japan-based automaker had hoped to boost
U.S. sales to about 400,000 units by 2016 as part of a strategy
to sell 1.7 million autos worldwide in the same period,
Yamanouchi said earlier this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show.  Mazda, along with other Japanese automakers including
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., is struggling to stay
competitive in the U.S. as the yen’s gain against the dollar
makes Japan-built autos less profitable to export.  Mazda’s U.S. sales rose 8.7 percent this year through
October to 209,641 units. The carmaker expects sales in  North
America  to climb 10 percent from a year earlier to 376,000 units
in the 12 months ending March, according to its earnings
forecast given on Nov. 2.  Its  shares  fell 2.1 percent as of 10:34 a.m. in Tokyo
trading today, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
dropped 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
