Creditors of Battersea Power
Station, led by  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Ireland’s National
Asset Management Agency, asked a court to put the building into
receivership, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The lenders sought a court hearing in Jersey today to
place Battersea Power Station Shareholder Vehicle Ltd., the
company set up to own the derelict buildings and the 38-acre
site, in receivership, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private.  The lenders rejected a 262 million pound ($412 million) bid
last week from SP Setia Bhd.,  Malaysia ’s biggest public traded
property developer by sales, to purchase the senior debt related
to the London landmark.  Real Estate Opportunities has been seeking a partner to
help develop the site, which it bought about five years ago.
Following a debt for equity swap the company is now owned by
Battersea Power Station Shareholder Vehicle Ltd.  Real Estate Opportunities (REO)  spokesman Gordon Simpson declined
to comment, as did Lloyds spokesman Emile Abu-Shakra and David
Clerkin, a spokesman for NAMA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
