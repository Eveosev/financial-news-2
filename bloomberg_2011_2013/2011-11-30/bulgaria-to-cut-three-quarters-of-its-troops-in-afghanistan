Bulgaria will cut three quarters of
its 600 troops serving in the U.S.-led  International Security
Assistance Force  fighting Taliban insurgents in  Afghanistan .  The troops will be gradually reduced in three stages from
next year, Defense Minister Anyu Angelov told reporters in Sofia
today. Western forces are preparing to transfer security to
Afghan forces in all the countryâ€™s provinces by 2014, a target
date set by NATO leaders at a summit meeting in Lisbon last
November.  Bulgaria will first remove its medical teams from the Herat
hospital by the of next year, then will withdraw the combat unit
guarding the airport in Kabul in 2013. A unit guarding the
Kandahar airport will return in 2014, Angelov said.  Some Bulgarian soldiers will remain into the second half of
2014 to train Afghan troops, Angelov said.  Bulgaria joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in
2004 and also has peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and  Kosovo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
