Dennis Gartman , editor of the
Gartman Letter, and Mark Fisher, founder of MBF Asset Management
in  New York , are starting two exchange-traded notes off the
Fisher-Gartman Risk Index to bet on higher or lower prices
across commodities, stocks, bonds and currencies.  The ETRACS Fisher-Gartman Risk On ETN is expected to rise
during economic growth and the ETRACS Fisher-Gartman Risk Off
ETN would gain when the outlook is negative, the NYSE Euronext
said in a statement today.  The Risk On ETN, under the symbol ONN, and Risk Off ETN,
trading under OFF, include weightings in the Dow Jones-UBS Crude
Oil Subindex, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, the Dow Jones-UBS
Corn Subindex, the Dow Jones-UBS Copper Subindex, the Dow Jones-
UBS Silver Subindex, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and the euro,
the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
