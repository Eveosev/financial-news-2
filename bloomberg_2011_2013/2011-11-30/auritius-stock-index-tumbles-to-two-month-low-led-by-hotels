Mauritius’s stock index declined to
the lowest in more than two months on speculation a weaker euro
will hurt revenue of hotel groups during the peak season.  The 38-member  SEMDEX (SEMDEX)  gauge dropped 0.5 percent to 1,871.86,
the weakest intraday level since Sept. 28, by 12:45 p.m. in  Port
Louis , the capital.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the country’s largest leisure
operator by market value, led the retreat, losing 2.6 percent to
75 rupees, the weakest since Sept. 27.  Sun Resorts Ltd. , the
second-biggest group, lost 2.9 percent or 1.4 rupees, the most
since Nov. 16, to 47.20 rupees, heading for its lowest level
since May 2009.  “It’s related to the weak euro,” Kishen Nadassen, a
senior research analyst at CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a
phone interview from the city. “It will impact on revenue of
hotels as we enter the best months of the peak season.”  The euro accounts for about 41 percent of the nation’s
foreign currency earnings, according to the Bank of Mauritius.
The rupee weakened 0.5 percent to 39.1963 per dollar by 1:17
p.m., paring its advance this month to 4.2 percent, the biggest
gain since June 2010.  Europe  is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main market for
tourism visitors, with a share of 63 percent for the ten months
through October, data from Statistics Mauritius show. The peak
season runs from October to March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
