Shen Jianguang, a Hong Kong-based
economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., comments on the
People’s Bank of  China ’s announcement that it will cut the
reserve requirement for the nation’s lenders by 0.5 percentage
points from Dec. 5.  “There is a need for monetary policy loosening and recent
capital outflow requires reverse sterilization. These made a
reserve requirement cut a preferred policy option, in my view,
despite repeated denial of policy loosening by policy makers
before this cut.”  “I expect more cuts in coming months, probably once a
month in the first half of 2012.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
