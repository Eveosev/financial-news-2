Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , the trading arm
of  Samsung Group , agreed to buy Parallel Petroleum Corp. from
Apollo Global Management LLC.  Samsung C&T will purchase a 90 percent stake of Parallel
Petroleum and Korea National Oil Corp. will buy the rest,
according to a regulatory filing made in  Seoul  today.  The companies may pay about $780 million for Parallel
Petroleum, said three people with knowledge of the matter who
declined to be identified. The regulatory filing did not
disclose the price.  At $780 million, the deal would mark the biggest overseas
energy takeover by a South Korean company this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. State-owned KNOC bought a 95 percent
stake in Altius Holdings Inc. for $515 million in March, and has
said it needs to buy more energy assets to meet oil production
targets set by the government.  Rising prices of raw materials are spurring South Korean
companies to boost investments in commodities ranging from oil
and gas to copper, as theyâ€™re competing for supplies with China
and  India . Samsung C&T aims to boost revenue from its natural
resources, energy and environment business to 46 percent of
overall sales by 2015 from 31 percent in 2010, according to an
investor relations presentation on its website.  Samsung C&T said in September it won a 658.8 billion won
($578 million) order to build a power plant in the United Arab
Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
