Israel  inflation-linked bonds headed
for the biggest monthly gain in more than a year on investor
speculation consumer prices will rise and after the Bank of
Israel lowered borrowing costs.  The yield on the consumer price-linked bond due June 2013
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.63
percent at 2:29 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The rate has tumbled 33 basis
points this month, the most since October 2010. The two-year
breakeven rate, the yield difference between inflation-linked
bond and fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, rose
three basis points to 205, implying an average annual inflation
rate of 2.05 percent.  The central bank cut  interest rates  for the second time in
three months to 2.75 percent on Nov. 28 to cushion the economy
from the impact of a European crisis. Natural-gas flow from
 Egypt  to Israel halted after an explosion on the Sinai pipeline
network that delivers the fuel. The price of electricity in
Israel may increase by 20 percent to 30 percent in 2012, DS
Securities & Investments Ltd. Alex Zabezhinsky said.  “Inflation expectations are rising on bets the central
bank will continue to lower interest rates in coming months
which is expected to weaken the shekel and make imports more
expensive,” Tel Aviv-based Zabezhinsky said by phone. “The gas
explosion this week adds to expectations that prices will rise
as it is becoming clearer that Israel can’t count on supply from
Egypt and will have to switch to costlier alternatives.”  The shekel, headed for its worst year since 2002, declined
less than 0.1 percent to 3.7907 a dollar. The currency has lost
4.5 percent this month and 7.1 percent in 2011.  Two-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, dropped two basis points
2.63 percent. Two out of 13 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg
forecast that the  Bank of Israel  will lower interest rates to
2.5 percent at its next meeting on Dec. 26. The remainder expect
the central bank to keep rates on hold.  The yield on the 5.5 percent bonds due January 2022 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
