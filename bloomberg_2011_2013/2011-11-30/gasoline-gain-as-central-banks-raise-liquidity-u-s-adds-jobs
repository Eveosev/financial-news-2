Gasoline rose after central banks
led by the  Federal Reserve  cut emergency dollar funding costs to
European banks to ease the region’s debt crisis and as the U.S.
added jobs.  Prices gained as the central banks’ move boosted equities
and the dollar fell, increasing the investment appeal of
commodities. U.S. companies added 206,000 workers in November,
reducing concern that unemployment will remain elevated, curbing
fuel use. The Energy Department reported that gasoline demand
climbed last week.  “The bigger impact was the coordinated action of the
central banks to reduce the dollar lending rates, sending stocks
higher and  oil prices  with it,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Underpinning that is an
increase in the amount of jobs that were created.”  Gasoline for December delivery gained 3.67 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.5758 a gallon at 11:47 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The more-actively traded January contract
advanced 3.85 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.5783.  December gasoline and heating oil contracts will expire at
the end of floor trading today.  Gasoline demand, or  deliveries  to wholesalers, rose 2.1
percent in the week ended Nov. 25 to 8.77 million barrels a day,
the most since the week ended Oct. 7, today’s report showed.
 Gasoline production  fell 3 percent to 9.19 million barrels a
day. Inventories increased 213,000 barrels.  “It was Thanksgiving week and people were driving,” said
 Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield, Massachusetts. “Production cutting back is
bullish.”  Central Banks  The central banks of the U.S., the euro region,  Canada , the
U.K.,  Japan  and Switzerland agreed to cut the cost of providing
dollar funding via swap arrangements, the Federal Reserve said
in a statement.  “It was extremely bold,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president
of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Futures rose a third consecutive day after the banks’ move,
which is aimed at easing financial market strains and boosting
the central banks’ capacity to support the global financial
system, the statement said.  The euro gained 1.1 percent against the dollar at 11:49
a.m. in New York while the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 3.6
percent.  “The market likes the news because it’s a glimmer of good
news in a torrential downpour of bad news. But it’s done for a
reason and the reason they did it is not good,” said Ray
Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Jobs Increase  The 206,000 increase in jobs was the biggest this year and
followed a revised 130,000 gain in October, ADP Employer
Services said today.  Planned firings  dropped 13 percent to
42,474 from November 2010, according to figures released today
by Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.  The jobs reports are “constructive, optimistic kind of
news and that helped the rally,” Carbone said.  Heating oil fluctuated, reducing an earlier gain, after the
department reported that distillate stockpiles  surged  5.53
million barrels last week to 138.5 million, the biggest gain
since January 2009.  Demand  plunged 20 percent to 3.24 million
barrels a day, the lowest since Aug. 2009.  Refiners increased heating oil and diesel fuel  production 
1.2 percent to a record 4.83 million barrels a day. Exports
remained at a record high 948,000 barrels a day, based on
preliminary weekly reports.  The market “thinks this is bearish, but we had a great
Thanksgiving shopping season and export demand is really
strong,” Cohan said.  December-delivery heating oil gained 0.44 cent to $3.0255 a
gallon, after touching $3.0536 before the inventory report’s
10:30 a.m. release in  Washington . The January contract rose 0.66
cent to $3.0402.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.295 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
