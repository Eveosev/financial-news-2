South Korea ’s large companies,
consuming 30 percent of the nation’s electricity, made
“voluntary” pledges to cut power use by 5 percent a year to
help conserve energy.  Representatives from 12 industry associations, including
steel and petrochemicals, met with Knowledge Economy Minister
Hong Suk Woo today in Seoul to declare their commitment to save
energy, the  ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.
Kepco, as state-controlled  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  is
known, imposed rolling blackouts Sept. 15 for the first time
since 2001 as a surge in demand that day coincided with reduced
supplies because of seasonal plant maintenance.  South Korea’s peak winter power demand may rise 5.3 percent
to 78,530 megawatts from a year earlier, while supplies may
increase 2.4 percent to 79,060 megawatts, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
