A cold front in  China  is forecast to
hit regions south of the Yellow River in the next two days,
causing temperatures to fall as much as 12 degrees centigrade in
some areas, according to the China Meteorological
Administration.  The cold front has already caused heavy rains and snow in
central and eastern China, including the provinces of Shanxi and
Shandong, according to the agency. Portions of highways in the
northern province of Hebei were closed or limited due to
freezing or foggy conditions, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
