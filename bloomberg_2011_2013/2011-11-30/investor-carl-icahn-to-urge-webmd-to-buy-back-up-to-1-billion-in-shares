Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  said
he plans to urge medical-information provider  WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) 
to buy back as much as $1 billion in shares through a Dutch
tender offer.  Icahn proposed a high end for the auction of $36 a share, a
12 percent premium to the closing price on Nov. 28, before
speculation circulated that WebMD may be sold, Icahn said today
in a regulatory filing. A Dutch auction enables investors to
specify a price at which they’re willing to sell.  WebMD, based in New York, surged the most in five weeks
yesterday after TheStreet.com said the company was considering a
sale to private equity firms. Icahn, who raised his stake in
WebMD to 9.9 percent last week, said today he hadn’t heard of
any such plans and didn’t support a deal with a private-equity
acquirer.  Icahn proposes WebMD use cash on hand to buy back shares.
The company had $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents as of Sept.
30, according to a Nov. 2 statement. Icahn and Kate Hahn, a
spokeswoman for WebMD, didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment.  WebMD rose 2.8 percent to $36.22 at the close of trading in
 New York . The shares have fallen 29 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
