Norway and  Indonesia ’s $1 billion
deal to halt the destruction of peatland and forests for two
years in Aceh, a province of the Southeast Asian country, has
been broken, according to the Ecosystems Climate Alliance.  Aceh’s governor Irwandi Yusuf has agreed to let a palm oil
company called PT Kallista Alam convert protected peat swamp
forest into plantations, the alliance said today in an e-mail.  “We often see this sort of contravention of law from the
usual suspects such as disreputable logging corporations and oil
palm interests, but this time the highest authority in the
province appears to be breaking the moratorium,” Peg Putt, a
senior consultant at  Global Witness , a member group of the
alliance, said in the e-mail.  Officials that grant such permissions are breaking an
agreement with Norway that came into effect in January to
protect forests. According to the deal agreed in May 2010,
Indonesia would suspend new concessions to companies seeking to
convert forest and peatland into plantations for two years.  Climate talks are under way in Durban,  South Africa  to
carve out a treaty to extend or replace the 1997  Kyoto Protocol .
That’s the linchpin of efforts to limit fossil-fuel emissions
blamed for damaging the atmosphere. Forest destruction is
responsible for about 17 percent of global emissions and the
talks may negotiate a deal to protect them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
