The ruble jumped the most in a month
against the dollar after  China  cut lenders’ reserve requirements
and the  Federal Reserve  and other central banks made a
coordinated bid to protect global growth.  The Russian currency advanced 1.8 percent to 30.735 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest daily gain
since Oct. 27. The ruble was 0.9 percent stronger at 41.40 per
euro, leaving it up 1.3 percent against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Emerging-nation assets rallied after China cut the amount
of cash that banks must set aside as reserves for the first time
since 2008 to safeguard growth. Markets extended gains after the
Fed, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Swiss
National Bank and the European Central Bank also agreed to
reduce the  interest rate  on dollar liquidity swap lines by 50
basis points.  “The reserve cut in China has raised global sentiment, and
the ruble is stronger on that,”  Gaelle Blanchard , an economist
at Societe Generale SA in  London , said by e-mail. “China easing
quickly means growth recovering faster, and more demand for
commodities.”  Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.1687 per dollar
in three months’ time. Russia’s dollar Eurobonds due 2020
climbed, pushing the yield down nine basis points to 4.493
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
