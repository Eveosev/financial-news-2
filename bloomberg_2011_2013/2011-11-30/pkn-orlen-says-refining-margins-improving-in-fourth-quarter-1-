PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest fuel
refiner, said refining margins are better in the fourth quarter
than in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Slawomir Jedrzejczyk told reporters in Warsaw today.  According to Jedrzejczyk, Orlen’s refining margin increased
in the quarter to date to $3.8 per barrel of oil from $2.7 in
the previous quarter, while the company’s petrochemical margin
declined to 630 euros per ton from 663 euros in the third
quarter.  “In general, situation remains difficult but has improved
from the third quarter,” he said.  In the retail segment sales volumes are very good but
margins remain weak, Jedrzejczyk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
