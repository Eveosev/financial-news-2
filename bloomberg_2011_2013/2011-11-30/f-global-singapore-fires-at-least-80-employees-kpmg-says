MF Global Holdings Ltd.’s Singapore
unit fired at least 80 employees, according to its provisional
liquidator  KPMG .  “With regret, one of these measures to contain costs
involves reducing the employee headcount at MF Global
Singapore,” Bob Yap, head of transactions and restructuring at
KPMG in Singapore, said in an e-mailed statement today. “We
have therefore ceased the employment of over 80 individuals.”  A “small group” of workers are still employed to help
KPMG wind down the business, including helping to reconcile
customers’ positions, Yap said.  MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after a
wrong-way $6.3 billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some
of  Europe ’s most indebted nations. The firm listed debt of $39.7
billion and assets of $41 billion and said it had about $26
million in cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
