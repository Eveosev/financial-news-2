Companies added more workers than
anticipated in November, easing concern the job market is
stagnating in the third year of the U.S. recovery, according to
a private report based on payrolls.  The 206,000 increase was the biggest this year and followed
a revised 130,000 gain the prior month, Roseland, New Jersey-
based ADP Employer Services said today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an advance of
130,000.  A pickup in hiring will make it easier to sustain the
recent gain in  consumer spending , which accounts for about 70
percent of the economy. Overall payrolls rose by 122,000, still
not enough to cut the  jobless rate  from 9 percent, economists in
a Bloomberg survey projected ahead of a Labor Department report
due in two days.  “Things are getting better for the economy,” said  Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact & Opinion Economics in  New York ,
who projected a gain of 160,000. “It means the news we have on
Christmas shopping and on an increase in  consumer confidence  may
have some validity.”  Last month’s initial ADP figures showed a 110,000 gain,
while the Labor Department’s data two days later showed an
increase of 104,000 in private payrolls for October.  Stock-index futures extended gains after the Federal
Reserve and five central banks lowered  interest rates  on dollar
swaps and  China  cut banks’ reserve requirements. The contract on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next month climbed 3
percent to 1,232.5 at 9:03 a.m. in New York.  The projections for November ranged from 95,000 to 200,000,
based on the estimates of 44 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Construction Employment  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies, had an increase of 28,000 workers,
today’s figures showed. Employment in construction rose by
16,000, the most since November 2006, while factories added
7,000 jobs.  Service providers took on 178,000 workers.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 12,000
jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, took on
84,000 workers and small companies increased payrolls by
110,000, ADP said.  Another report today showed employers announced fewer job
cuts this month, according to figures from Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Job-cut announcements dropped
13 percent in November from the same month in 2010.  Yellen on Economy  Economic growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies
“has been proceeding too slowly to provide jobs for millions of
unemployed people,”  Federal Reserve  Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen 
said in a speech at a San Francisco Fed conference yesterday.
She called for “urgent” international action to combat a
“dearth” of global demand.  Yellen said the central bank has leeway to spur the U.S.
recovery and reduce unemployment by buying more assets or
clarifying its plan to sustain record-low borrowing costs.  Fed officials have differed this month over whether
additional stimulus may be needed to reduce unemployment more
quickly. Policy makers next meet Dec. 13 in Washington.  Macy’s Inc. (M) , betting consumer spending will be sustained
during the November-December  holiday shopping season , was among
companies that added staff. The second-biggest U.S. department-
store chain said it was stepping up hiring of mostly part-time
employees by 4 percent for the period.  Retailer Hiring  Earnings growth is allowing some businesses to hire.
 Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) , a retailer of high-end home goods, raised
its annual profit forecast and will “continue to look for a few
key jobs” in online sales, Chief Executive Officer Laura Alber
said in a Nov. 17 conference call with analysts.  Companies remaining cautious include  DirecTV (DTV) , the largest
U.S. satellite-TV provider, which this month said it will cut
back on spending in 2012 to prepare for any slowdown in the
economy.  The Labor Department’s report, to be released on Dec. 2,
may show private payrolls rose by 146,000 in November, according
to the Bloomberg survey median. Overall hiring, which includes
government jobs, may have climbed after rising 80,000.  The ADP report is based on data from about 337,000
businesses with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
