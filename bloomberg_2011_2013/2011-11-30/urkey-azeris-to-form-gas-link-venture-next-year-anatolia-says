State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or
 Socar , and Istanbul-based Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS plan
to form a venture to build a  gas pipeline  across  Turkey  by the
middle of next year, the state-owned Anatolia News Agency  said ,
citing an Azeri energy official.  The Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline, which may cost $6 billion
to $7 billion and have a capacity of 21 billion cubic meters a
year, is planned to be completed by 2017 when the second phase
of the  BP Plc -operated Shah Deniz project starts producing
natural gas, Anatolia said, citing an interview Socar Vice
President Vaqif Aliyev.  The project seems more “doable” than the European Union-
backed Nabucco pipeline project, which has some “unresolved
issues,” although it won’t undermine  Nabucco (NABUCCO) , Anatolia said,
citing the Socar vice president. Turkish and foreign companies
may participate in the construction, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
