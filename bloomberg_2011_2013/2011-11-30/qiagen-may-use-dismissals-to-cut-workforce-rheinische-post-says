Qiagen NV , a German biotechnology
company, doesnâ€™t exclude forced job cuts to eliminate as many as
380 positions,  Rheinische Post  reported, citing a company
spokesman.  The company may fire as many as 150 employees, of whom more
than 100 at company headquarters, after earlier saying it would
offer severance packages and benefits for voluntary departures,
the newspaper added, without saying where it obtained the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
