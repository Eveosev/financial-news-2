The Canadian dollar extended its
advance as central banks including the Bank of Canada and the
 Federal Reserve  agreed to reduce the interest rate on dollar
liquidity swap lines.  “The global central banks think that there is something to
be done to improve liquidity, and this is what they’re doing to
improve dollar funding costs, and that’s negative for the dollar
because it’s easier to sell the dollar against everything,”
said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak
& Co. in New York, referring to the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
