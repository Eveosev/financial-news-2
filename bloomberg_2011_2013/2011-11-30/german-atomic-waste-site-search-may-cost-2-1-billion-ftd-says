Germany â€™s search for a permanent
nuclear waste storage site may take 18 years and cost about 1.6
billion euros ($2.1 billion), the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing a government document.  Examining each potential site will cost about 400 million
euros, the FTD said, citing a reply from the  Environment
Ministry  to a request from the  Green Party . The government may
initially scrutinize as many as four sites, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
