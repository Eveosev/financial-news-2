(Corrects country where company owns hotels in third
paragraph.)  Naiade Resorts Ltd. (NRL)  will retire more
than 1 billion rupees ($34 million) of debt over the next two
years as it seeks to strengthen its financial position, Chief
Executive Officer  Paul Jones  said.  The Mauritian resorts and leisure group will also change
its brand name to LUX* Island Resorts from tomorrow as part of a
restructuring, Jones said in an interview yesterday in Belle
Mare, on the east coast of the Indian ocean island nation.  Naiade’s debt stands at 4.8 billion rupees, according to
data obtained from the group, including 500 million rupees of
convertible bonds. The owner and manager of hotels in Mauritius,
Reunion Island and Maldives, posted an attributable loss of
120.4 million rupees in the three months through September
against a 188.9-million rupee loss a year earlier.  “By June 2012 and 2013 the debt should go down by 600
million rupees and 500 million rupees respectively, and will be
financed by cash that will be generated from operations,” Jones
said. “We are ahead of the business plan presented last
December. We are confident our results for the quarter ending
31st December 2011 will improve on last year.”  Tourism is one of the largest sources of foreign currency
for Mauritius. The industry’s income for the nine months through
September rose 7 percent to 30.15 billion rupees, according to
Bank of Mauritius data.  Naiade was unchanged at 26.40 rupees at the close in  Port
Louis , the capital, yesterday and has gained 3.5 percent this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
