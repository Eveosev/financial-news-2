Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today’s coordinated central bank action wasn’t
aimed at supporting any specific financial institution.  “I know that discussions were taking place, not with
respect to any specific financial institution,” Flaherty said
in a Bloomberg Television interview in  New York  to be aired
later today.  Stocks surged and the euro strengthened after the  Federal
Reserve  and five other central banks cut the cost of emergency
dollar funding for European banks as part of a globally
coordinated central-bank response to the continent’s sovereign-
debt crisis.  “I think that the coordination is very important,”
Flaherty said. “This is one of the discussions we’ve had
repeatedly at the G-20 the last couple of years, the need to
coordinate actions like that.”  Earlier today, Flaherty said he expects more coordinated
actions could take place.  Flaherty also said European policy makers need to decide on
the mandate the  European Central Bank  will have in helping
countries overcome their sovereign debt problems.  “The ECB needs more work,” Flaherty said. “The euro-zone
countries need to decide whether they’re going to have the
resources” needed to resolve the crisis.  The full interview will air on Bloomberg Television’s
Street Smart at 3:00 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
