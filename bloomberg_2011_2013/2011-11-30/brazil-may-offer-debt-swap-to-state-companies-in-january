Brazil  may offer a debt exchange to
state companies and public entities in January, giving them a
chance to swap their floating-rate bonds for other securities to
meet new requirements, Treasury Undersecretary  Paulo Valle  said.  Valle said in an interview that the exchange could be done
in a single transaction and that the government is looking to
ensure it doesn’t affect bond prices in the secondary market. He
said that the government is considering other options and will
discuss them with state-run  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  before making a
decision.  This exchange “will not have an impact on debt costs or
the price of securities,” Valle said in a telephone interview
from Brasilia.  Valle said earlier today that the government is forcing
public entities and state companies to shift 57.6 billion reais
($32 billion) of floating-rate bonds into fixed-rate and
inflation-linked debt. The move is part of an effort to reduce
the government’s vulnerability to swings in the  benchmark
overnight rate , which the central bank lowered 0.5 percentage
point today to 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
