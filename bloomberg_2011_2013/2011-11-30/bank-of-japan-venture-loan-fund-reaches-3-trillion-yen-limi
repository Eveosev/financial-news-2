The  Bank of Japan  said it will
disburse 162.9 billion yen in ($2.1 billion) loans to banks in a
program to support growth industries, bringing total allocation
to the maximum 3 trillion yen.  Funds will be lent to 85 financial institutions including
seven large banks, the central bank said in a statement on its
website today.  Officials also plan to disburse 17.5 billion yen under a
separate program unveiled in June that allows lenders to ask for
loans by using inventories and receivables as collateral. The
ultimate size of that facility, which will continue through 2016
and is designed to support industries and improve the countryâ€™s
potential growth, is envisioned at 500 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
