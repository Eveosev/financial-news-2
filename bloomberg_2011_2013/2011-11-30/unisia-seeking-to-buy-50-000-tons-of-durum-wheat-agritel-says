Tunisia is seeking to buy 50,000
metric tons of durum wheat, French farm adviser Agritel wrote on
its website today, without saying where it got the information.  The North African country has the world’s highest per-
capita food consumption of wheat at 216.9 kilograms (478
pounds), more than three times the global average of 67.8
kilograms, according to data from the  United Nations ’  Food and
Agriculture Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
