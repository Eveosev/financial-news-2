Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  and Welspun Group are
among 22 bidders for solar projects in  India â€™s Karnataka state
as India seeks to build 20,000 megawatts of capacity by 2022.  Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd. will open the
bidding on Dec. 2, Managing Director N.S. Prasanna Kumar said by
phone today. Other companies applying include Sunborne Energy
LLC, Kiran Energy Solar Power Pvt. and Jindal Aluminium Ltd.  The auction will  award  licenses to build 30 megawatts of
solar thermal capacity and 50 megawatts of solar photovoltaic
capacity with a maximum project size of 10 megawatts. The
winners get preferential power rates and an assured buyer.  The development agency delayed the application deadline
from Nov. 25 to prevent a clash with an auction of 350 megawatts
of solar capacity by central government, Prasanna Kumar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
