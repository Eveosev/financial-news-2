Following is the text of U.S. online help wanted
advertising from the Conference Board.  Online Labor Demand Dips 76,200 in November, The Conference Board Reports  Labor demand drops 76,200 in November for the sixth consecutive monthly loss
Average monthly gain for 2011 is 15,800 Nationally, there are 10 million more
unemployed than advertised vacancies Download the National Historical Table.  Online advertised vacancies were down 76,200 in November to 3,857,200,
according to The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine Data Series released today. The
November drop follows a dip of 14,000 in October and 44,000 in September. The
Supply/Demand rate stands at 3.53, indicating there were 3.5 unemployed for every
online advertised vacancy in October, the latest monthly data available for
unemployment.  “The November decline in labor demand, following on the heels of the drops for
the previous five months, is not good news for the labor market,” said June Shelp,
Vice President at The Conference Board. The average monthly gain for 2011 is now
just 15,800, as the decline of 589,000 in recent months has largely offset the gain
of 763,000 in early 2011. The lackluster labor market is impacting a wide range of
occupations including the occupations we think of as professional jobs in companies
(Management, Business and Finance, and Computers and Math). All have lost ground
over the last six months, and the November online labor demand for each was modestly
below the number of advertised vacancies in January of this year. (See occupational
detail section.)  REGIONAL AND STATE HIGHLIGHTS  In November:  All 4 regions experience losses  Pennsylvania , among the 20 largest States, is
flat while other States show an overall downward trend In November, the Midwest
declined 32,600, reflecting losses in 5 out of 6 of its largest States. Illinois was
the only one of the larger states posting a minimal gain (+400) in November. This
was the first monthly gain for Illinois since May 2011.  Ohio experienced the
largest November decline, 10,300. Since June, Ohio has lost over 22,300.  Missouri
fell 6,500, more than 3 times its October decline.  Minnesota  followed with a decline
of 6,000.  Michigan experienced a decline of 4,900. Wisconsin fell 2,100, its sixth
consecutive monthly decline. Among the less populous States in the region, Indiana
and Iowa fell 1,300 and 200 respectively, while North Dakota and  South Dakota  both
dipped 500.  The Northeast was down by 21,800 in November, reflecting losses in all 4 of its
large States.  New York experienced the largest loss, 7,100.  Since March 2011, New
York has experienced a loss of 53,000 advertised vacancies.  Next was  New Jersey 
with a loss of 5,600 while Pennsylvania dropped 3,300.  Labor demand in
 Massachusetts  fell 3,100.  Over the last six months, advertised vacancies in
Massachusetts have declined nearly 23,000.  Among the smaller States in the region,
Connecticut, Vermont, and  Rhode Island  lost 3,100, 900, and 700 respectively while
New Hampshire gained 200.  The South dipped 20,800, led by a decline of 4,300 in  North Carolina . Since May
2011, North Carolina has declined by over 14,500 advertised job vacancies. Other
large states in the South, however, posted gains.  Virginia experienced the largest
gain, 6,800, its first gain since May.  Maryland rose 1,800. Texas and Florida
gained 1,100 and 1,000 respectively while Georgia rose 900 to 103,700.  The gains in
the larger States were offset by the losses in the smaller States in the South.
Louisiana fell by 2,900 to a total of 41,700. Tennessee was down 2,700 while both
 South Carolina  and Oklahoma fell by 2,100, Alabama dropped 1,600, and Arkansas lost
1,300.  Labor demand in the West was down slightly by 7,200 in November and was led by
 Washington  State, which lost 5,600.  California , the region’s largest State, remained
steady at 425,500 advertised vacancies. Colorado gained 1,400.   Arizona  gained 1,200.
Among the small States in the West,  Nevada  declined by 1,600,  Oregon  lost 1,100,
 Utah  fell 1,000,  Idaho  lost 700, and  New Mexico  dropped 500.  The Supply/Demand rate for the U.S. in October (the latest month for which
unemployment numbers are available) stood at 3.53, indicating that there are close
to 4 unemployed workers for every online advertised vacancy. Nationally, there are
10 million more unemployed workers than advertised vacancies. The number of
advertised vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed only in  North Dakota , where
the Supply/Demand rate was 0.88. States with the next lowest rates included Nebraska
(1.40), South Dakota (1.41), Vermont (1.59), Alaska (1.76), Minnesota (1.94), and
New Hampshire (1.99). The State with the highest Supply/Demand rate is Mississippi
(7.87), where there are close to 8 unemployed workers for every online advertised
vacancy. The States with the next highest Supply/Demand rates are Kentucky (5.16),
California (4.99), Alabama (4.92), and Illinois (4.85).  It should be noted that the Supply/Demand rate only provides a measure of
relative tightness of the individual State labor markets and does not suggest that
the occupations of the unemployed directly align with the occupations of the
advertised vacancies (see Occupational Highlights section).  OCCUPATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS  In November:  Demand for Healthcare Practitioners and Technical workers shows an increase Ads
for Office and Administrative Support and Sales and Related workers decline sharply  Changes for the Month of November  In November, fifteen of the twenty-two Standard Occupational Classifications
(SOC codes) that are reported separately declined while six posted some gains and
one, Legal, was unchanged. For most of the occupational categories the November
change, whether up or down, was modest.  Healthcare Practitioners and Technical occupations posted the largest increase,
23,300, to 529,900. Largely responsible for the rise were increased advertised
vacancies for Physical and Occupational Therapists, Speech-Language Pathologists,
and Physician Assistants. The number of advertised vacancies in this occupational
category continues to outnumber job-seekers by 2.6 to one (0.38 S/D based on October
data, the latest unemployment data available).  Among the top 10 occupation groups with the largest numbers of online
advertised vacancies, demand for Office and Administrative Support occupations
dropped 36,600 to 432,200, which offset the October rise of 30,100. Largely
responsible for the drop was lower demand for Customer Service Representatives. The
number of unemployed in these occupations remains above the number of advertised
vacancies with almost 4 (3.55) unemployed for every advertised vacancy.  Labor demand for Sales and Related workers dropped 33,900 to 476,800 and was
led by a decrease in demand for Sales Representatives and Insurance Sales Agents.
The number of unemployed in this occupational category continues to outnumber the
number of advertised vacancies by about 3 to 1 (S/D of 2.76).  Business and Financial Operations positions decreased by 13,700 to 218,900
advertised vacancies in November. Management analysts and tax preparers were among
the advertised vacancies that showed declines. In this field there are almost 2
(1.76) unemployed workers for every advertised vacancy.  Longer View of Labor Demand for Selected Occupations  “Looking at the 22 broad occupational categories over the eleven months of 2011,
relatively few occupations have held their ground and posted gains,” said Shelp.
Construction and Extraction has had a lackluster but relatively steady increase
throughout 2011; it has risen on average just over 1,800 per month to 75,900
advertised vacancies in November. Demand for Production workers has been even more
modest with the November figure of 118,000 just 1,000 above the 117,000 being
demanded in January.  The occupations we think of as professional jobs in companies (Management,
Business and Finance, and Computers and Math) have all lost ground over the last six
months, and the November online labor demand for each was modestly below the number
of advertised vacancies in January of this year. The drop in advertised vacancies
has been much sharper for Legal jobs, and at 21,000 in November the number of
advertised vacancies was almost 25 percent below the January level. Labor demand for
Community and Social Service occupations, which includes jobs like mental health and
substance abuse and child and family social workers, has also contracted sharply
this year and in November at 47,400 was also 25 percent below the monthly demand in
January.  “The level of labor demand alone, however, does not tell the whole story,” said
Shelp. “The difficulty of finding a job is a factor of not only the number of
openings but also the number of people competing for the advertised position.” The
broad occupational groups that can be termed “favorable” typically are occupations
where the supply/demand rate is below one and there are more advertised vacancies
than unemployed people seeking positions. Even though there are fewer advertised
vacancies for Computer and Math occupations in November than there were at the
beginning of the year, there were only 174,000 unemployed people seeking 515,000
open positions.  Other occupational groups in which the supply of unemployed workers
is less than the demand for help included Healthcare Practitioners and Technical
workers (315,000 more openings than unemployed, based on October data) and Life,
Physical and Social Sciences, where there were 13,000 more openings than unemployed
workers seeking positions in this field.  Occupations where finding a position is more challenging and where there are
more unemployed than advertised vacancies include Construction (18.4 unemployed for
every advertised opening); Food Preparation and Serving (8.7); and Production Work
and Personal Care, both with about 8 unemployed for every available opening.  METRO AREA HIGHLIGHTS  Washington, D.C., Oklahoma City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and  Boston  have the
lowest Supply/Demand rates In November, 35 of the 52 metropolitan areas for which
data are reported separately posted over-the-year increases in the number of online
advertised vacancies. Among the three metro areas with the largest numbers of
advertised vacancies, the  New York  metro area was down 10,400, or 4.1 percent, from
its November 2010 level and the Washington, DC metro area was down 1,600, or 1.1
percent, from last year.  The Los Angeles metro area was down a mere 400, or 0.3
percent, from last year’s level.  The number of unemployed exceeded the number of advertised vacancies in all of
the 52 metro areas for which information is reported separately. Washington, DC
continues to have the most favorable Supply/Demand rate (1.31) with about one
advertised vacancy for every unemployed worker.  Oklahoma City, Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Boston, and Salt Lake City were metropolitan locations with the next lowest
Supply/Demand rates. On the other hand, metro areas in which the respective number
of unemployed is substantially above the number of online advertised vacancies
include Riverside, CA -- where there are nearly nine unemployed workers for every
advertised vacancy (8.87) -- Miami (5.44), Sacramento (5.02),  Los Angeles  (4.70),
Las Vegas (4.40), and Memphis (4.23).  Supply/Demand rate data are for September
2011, the latest month for which unemployment data for local areas are available.  PROGRAM NOTES  The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine Data Series measures the number of new,
first-time online jobs and jobs reposted from the previous month on more than 1,200
major Internet job sites and smaller job sites that serve niche markets and smaller
geographic areas.  Like The Conference Board’s long-running Help Wanted Advertising Index of print
ads (which was published for over 55 years and discontinued in November 2008 but
continues to be available for research), the new online series is not a direct
measure of job vacancies. The level of ads in print and online can change for
reasons not related to overall job demand.  With the December 1, 2008 release, HWOL began providing seasonally adjusted
data for the U.S., the nine Census regions and the 50 States. Seasonally adjusted
data for occupations were provided beginning with the December 2009 release. This
data series, for which the earliest data are for October 2005, continues to publish
not seasonally adjusted data for 52 large metropolitan areas.  People using this data are urged to review the information on the database and
methodology available on The Conference Board website and contact us with questions
and comments. Background information and technical notes and discussion of revisions
to the series are available at:  http://www.conference -
