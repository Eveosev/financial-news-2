Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s German unit expects
to reach an accord with two other phone operators on sharing
network infrastructure by the end of the year to reduce the cost
of carrying growing data volumes, its head, Rene Schuster said.  Telefonica is in talks with a “magenta” and a “red” network
operator in Germany to share the costs of fiber networks that
transport signals from wireless towers over large distances,
Schuster said at a press event late yesterday, without naming
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and Vodafone Group Plc., who use those
colors respectively in their corporate branding.  Sharing costs would make it easier to satisfy demand for
increased bandwidth as more people use smartphones and faster
long-term evolution technology is rolled out in Germany.  Telefonica,  Europe ’s biggest phone company by market value,
plans to make the faster LTE technology available in the
country’s biggest cities Berlin, Hamburg and Munich by the
second quarter, Schuster said, adding that ten additional cities
are set to follow by the end of September.  Deutsche Telekom,  Vodafone (VOD)  and Telefonica are starting to
reach cities in Germany with LTE after fulfilling regulatory
requirements to cover rural communities which don’t have
broadband wireless coverage. Madrid-based Telefonica spent 1.38
billion euros ($1.83 billion) on wireless frequencies in Germany
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
