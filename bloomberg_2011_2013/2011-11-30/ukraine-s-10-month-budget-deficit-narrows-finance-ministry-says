Ukraine’s 10-month state budget
deficit declined to 12.353 billion hryvnia ($1.54 billion) after
tax revenue rose and the government cut spending, according to
the  Finance Ministry .  The gap is 4.6 times less than the shortfall in the first
10 months of 2010, the Kiev, Ukraine-based ministry said today
in a  statement  on its website. Tax revenue rose more than 65
percent to 209.67 billion hryvnia from January through October,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
