Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said the euro area’s debt crisis requires global support
through the  International Monetary Fund  because of its worldwide
impact.  “It’s not only the euro zone which will be affected when
this crisis escalates,” De Jager said in an interview today in
Brussels after a meeting of euro-area finance ministers. “It’s
very important that the IMF globally will increase its resources
either by raising its capital or by bilateral loans so that it
can lend more money to euro-zone countries in need.”  De Jager said increased IMF aid to  Europe  is needed in
concert with the euro area’s rescue fund in order to tap
sufficient resources to stem the debt crisis. A bigger role for
the IMF should accompany European plans to expand the European
Financial Stability Facility’s firepower, he said.  “If we open the IMF effort, that will be sufficient
together with the leverage options in the EFSF,” De Jager said.  De Jager also said euro-area rescue efforts will be
“sufficient” for  Greece , provided that country meets all of
the conditions laid out by European leaders in October. The euro
region yesterday approved the sixth payout in Greece’s initial
bailout package, while also moving closer to a second package as
outlined last month.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said his country
intends to make good on its pledges.  “We respect absolutely the different parameters and we go
ahead in order to implement and execute the decision” of
European leaders, Venizelos said in a separate interview in
Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
