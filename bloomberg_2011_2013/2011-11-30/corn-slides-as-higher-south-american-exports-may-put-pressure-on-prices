Corn fell in  Chicago , extending a
monthly decline, as Morgan Stanley forecast pressure on prices
next year from higher South American exports of the grain.  U.S. corn shipments, the world’s largest, may slump 21
percent in the 2011-12 season to 1.45 billion bushels, the least
since 1985-86, according to Morgan Stanley. That’s smaller than
a Nov. 9 forecast of 1.6 billion bushels by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture.  “Corn prices will likely come under pressure in the second
half of the year as rebounding production in South America, and
ultimately the U.S., increases supply,” analysts led by  Hussein Allidina  wrote in the report e-mailed today, referring to 2012.  March-delivery corn dropped 1 percent to $5.995 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:58 p.m. Paris time. Prices are
down 7.3 percent this month.  Lower prices may encourage  China , the world’s second-
largest corn user, to boost imports to about 5 million to 7
million metric tons in 2011-12, Paul Deane, an agricultural
economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said by
phone from Melbourne today. That’s more than the 3 million tons
forecast by the USDA.  Wheat for March delivery declined 0.6 percent to $6.125 a
bushel. The grain has dropped 2.5 percent this month. Milling
wheat for delivery in the same month traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 1 percent to 176.75 euros ($235.53) a ton.  “Cheaper alternatives from the  Black Sea , the EU and
Argentina are likely to continue to edge out U.S. exports,”
Morgan Stanley said.  Soybeans for delivery in January slipped 0.1 percent to
$11.2425 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed is down 7.6 percent
this month.  “Weak global crushing demand and adequate Brazilian
supplies have decimated demand for U.S. 11/12 exports,” the
Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
