Thailand â€™s baht pared gains after
the central bank reduced borrowing costs for the first time in
two years.  The baht advanced 0.1 percent to 31.24 per dollar as of
2:23 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency had gained as much as 0.3 percent earlier.  The Bank of Thailand cut the one-day bond-repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
