Soco International Plc (SIA) , a U.K.
explorer in Africa and Southeast Asia, will review its drilling
program to focus resources on larger prospects.  Soco directors are due to meet next week to examine seven
new projects close to existing operations in Congo, the
 Democratic Republic  of Congo and Vietnam, according to Chief
Financial Officer Roger Cagle. One drilling project may win
approval to start next year, he said, while Soco may expand into
three new countries.  “We are very keen on refreshing our exploration pipeline”
and “bringing some projects forward,” Cagle said in an
interview yesterday in  London . “We’d like to bring larger
projects.”  Soco previously planned to drill eight exploration wells
next year in  Vietnam , the Angolan enclave of Cabinda and the
DRC. With partners, it plans to invest about $1 billion to
increase production at Vietnam’s Te Giac Trang oil field. It
expects to accumulate $1 billion in cash in 2015, with capital
expenditure limited to about $100 million a year excluding
future exploration success.  “Right now we have some near-term exploration drilling but
it’s not as high impact as we would like it to be,” Cagle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
