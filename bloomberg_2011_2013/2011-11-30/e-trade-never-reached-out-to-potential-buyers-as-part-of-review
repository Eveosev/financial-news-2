E*Trade Financial Corp. , which faced
pressure from its biggest shareholder to explore a sale, never
contacted potential buyers as part of its strategic review,
Chief Financial Officer Matthew Audette said.  E*Trade saw “no reason to proceed down the path” of
starting a sales process, he said today during an event hosted
by KBW Inc. Audette cited economic uncertainty and the interest-
rate and credit environment in explaining why the company didn’t
reach out to potential suitors.  The stock fell 4.1 percent on Nov. 11, the most in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after E*Trade said its board
rejected putting the company on sale. Citadel LLC, the hedge
fund that is New York-based E*Trade’s biggest owner, called for
a strategic review this year to address “catastrophic losses.”  Audette said the company considered three options,
remaining independent, selling its bank and selling the entire
company, before picking the first.  To contact the reporter on this story:
