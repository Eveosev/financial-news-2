Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , owner of the
namesake theme parks and ESPN sports network, increased its
annual dividend by 50 percent, the most in at least 20 years,
following record sales and profit.  The new 60-cent dividend, up from 40 cents, will be paid on
Jan. 18 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 16, the Burbank,
California-based company said yesterday in a statement.  Disney, also owner of the ABC TV network, is returning cash
to investors through stock repurchases as well. The company
bought back $5 billion of shares in the year ended Oct. 1,
according to a Nov. 10 statement. Disney last increased its
dividend one year ago, boosting the payment to the current 40
cents from 35 cents. Bloomberg historical data going back to
1990 don’t show an increase this large.  “The hike showed an unexpectedly higher order of
magnitude, more so for a somewhat conservatively managed
Disney,”  Tuna Amobi , a  Standard & Poor’s  analyst, said in an e-
mail. The “move also seems consistent with large media’s
refocus on increased return of capital to shareholders,” said
the analyst, who recommends the stock.  The Steven P. Jobs Trust, Disney’s largest shareholder,
will reap $82.8 million, an increase of $27.6 million based on
the 138 million shares held by the estate of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s late
co-founder.  Disney rose 5.4 percent to $35.85 yesterday in  New York , a
day when the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 4.2 percent
and every company in the 30-stock index gained. Disney has
declined 4.4 percent this year.  2011 Results  “The Walt Disney Company had a great creative, strategic
and financial year,” Robert A. Iger, president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement. “We are pleased to be
able to raise our shareholder dividend by 50 percent while
continuing to invest for future growth.”  The company on Nov. 10 reported a 21 percent increase in
fiscal 2011 profit to $4.81 billion, or $2.52 a share, on
revenue that gained 7.4 percent to $40.9 billion.  Disney was expected to raise its dividend by 5 cents to 45
cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An increase to
65 cents is forecast for next year, according to the data.  At the new dividend rate, Disney has an indicated yield of
1.67 percent, compared with 2.12 percent for the S&P 500 stock
index, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
