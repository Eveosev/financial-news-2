Ireland’s economic growth rate will
more than halve next year as exports slow amid a deepening euro-
region debt crisis, the  Economic & Social Research Institute 
said.  Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the
economy, will rise 2.2 percent this year and 0.9 percent in
2012, the Dublin-based institute said today. The ESRI in
September forecast growth of 1.8 percent this year and 2.3
percent in 2012.  “There has been a significant deterioration in the outlook
for the world economy in recent months stemming from the
uncertainty about the euro zone debt crisis,” the ESRI said.  Export growth will slow to 4.7 percent in 2012 from 6
percent this year, the ESRI said. Prime Minister  Enda Kenny ’s
government is relying on overseas sales to counter falling
consumer spending, as taxes rises and house prices plunge.  Household disposable income, which has fallen about 10
percent between 2008 and 2010, could drop by about 7 percent in
the years through 2015, the ESRI said. That’s about 7,000 euros
($9,333) per household.  House prices  will decline about 10 percent this year and
about 7 percent next year, according to the ESRI. Gross national
product, which excludes profits repatriated overseas, will
shrink by 0.3 percent next year after expanding 1.2 percent this
year, the ESRI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
