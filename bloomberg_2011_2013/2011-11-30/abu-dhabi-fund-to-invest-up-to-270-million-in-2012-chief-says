Abu Dhabi  Fund for Development,
which has offered 13 billion dirhams ($3.5 billion) since 1971
in loans and grants to developing countries, will invest 700
million dirhams to 1 billion dirhams in 2012, the director
general said.  “We want to go to  Latin America  next year, where we don’t
have any presence, and invest in infrastructure, power,
transportation,” Mohammed Saif al-Suwaidi said in an interview
in Abu Dhabi today. “Also because of the Arab Spring, a lot of
our money will stay in the region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
