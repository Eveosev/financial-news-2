The  German economy ,  Europe ’s
biggest, may slide into a “technical” recession at the end of
the year as domestic and foreign orders drop, the DIW economic
institute said.  The economy will shrink 0.2 percent this quarter, led by a
slump in industrial production, and may contract again in the
first three months of 2012, the Berlin-based institute said
today in an e-mailed statement.  “The euro crisis is affecting the German economy more and
more,” DIW economist Ferdinand Fichtner said in the statement.
A decline in gross domestic product in the first quarter “can’t
be excluded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
