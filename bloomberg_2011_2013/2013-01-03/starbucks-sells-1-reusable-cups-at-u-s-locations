Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop operator, began selling reusable plastic cups for $1
at its U.S. and Canadian stores today.  The white plastic cup has the Starbucks logo on it and
holds a tall or grande size drink, Haley Drage, a Starbucks
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The Seattle-based brewer already
offers a 10-cent discount to its customers who bring in a
reusable mug.  Starbucks served 1.9 percent of drinks in customers’
 personal tumblers  in its global company-owned stores in 2011,
according to its latest global responsibility  report.  It wants
to serve 5 percent of beverages in reusable cups by 2015, the
report shows.  Starbucks rose 0.7 percent to $55.37 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  gained 17 percent last year.  The coffee company has more than 18,000 cafes worldwide,
including about 11,100 in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
