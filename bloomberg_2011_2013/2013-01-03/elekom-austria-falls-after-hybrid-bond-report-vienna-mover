Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , partly owned by
billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil SAB de CV, fell today
after a report said the company was considering an 800 million
euro ($1.05 billion) hybrid bond.  Shares fell as much 0.098 cents, or 1.67 percent, to 5.77
euros each and traded at 5.80 euros at 9:50 a.m. in Vienna. It
was the biggest intra-period drop since Dec. 3 and gave Telekom
Austria a 2.6 billion euro market value.  The company needs to raise funds to acquire and extend
licenses for radio-frequency spectrum in Austria later this
year, state-asset agency chief Rudolf Kemler told News magazine
in an interview published today. The state-asset agency, or
OeIAG, is  Telekom Austria ’s biggest shareholder, owning 28
percent of the stock.  Telekom Austria spokesman Peter Schiefer declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
