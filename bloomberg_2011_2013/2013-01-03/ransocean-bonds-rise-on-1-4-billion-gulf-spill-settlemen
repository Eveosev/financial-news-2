Bonds of Transocean Ltd. climbed
after the offshore driller settled federal claims related to the
2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and spill in the  Gulf of
Mexico .  Transoceanâ€™s $750 million of 3.8 percent securities
maturing in October 2022 rose 0.9 cent to 104 cents on the
dollar to yield 3.3 percent as of 12:27 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company, based in Vernier,  Switzerland , will pay more
than $1.4 billion, including a $400 million criminal penalty,
according to a court filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
