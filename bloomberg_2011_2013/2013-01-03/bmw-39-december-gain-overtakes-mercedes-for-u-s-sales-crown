Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
U.S. sales surged 39 percent in December, powered by the 5
Series car line, helping it top  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz in
luxury-auto deliveries for the second consecutive year.  Sales for BMW increased to 37,399 vehicles last month,
boosted by a 72 percent gain for its midsize 5 Series. Mercedes
reported a 9.5 percent increase from a year earlier to 28,145,
helped by sales of the E-Class sedan, which rose 32 percent to
6,984.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7201) ’s Lexus rose 21 percent to 30,607.  December’s sales vaulted BMW past Mercedes, which held a
1,849-vehicle lead through November. BMW finished 2012 with
281,460 vehicles sold, topping Mercedes-Benz by 7,326. The two
German automakers were vying to be the top luxury-auto brand in
the U.S. after outselling  Lexus  last year. Lexus was the top-
selling luxury brand in the U.S. for 11 years until natural
disasters in Asia curtailed vehicle production in 2011.  “We like to be No. 1 and we are No. 1 in the world,”
Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of BMW of North
America, said in an interview. “Being No. 1 means success.”  BMW’s U.S. sales rose 14 percent for 2012, the Munich-based
automaker said today. BMW also benefited from a 46 percent jump
in X3 sport-utility vehicle sales in December to 5,162.
Deliveries of the SUV rose 27 percent for the year to 35,173.  Stuttgart, Germany-based Mercedes’s 2012 U.S. sales rose 12
percent to 274,134, the automaker said. In 2011, BMW topped
Mercedes in the U.S. by 2,715 vehicles. Lexus’s U.S. sales
totaled 244,166 vehicles in 2012, a 23 percent gain from a year
earlier and its highest volume since 2008.  The sales results don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and
Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t luxury vehicles.  Mercedes ‘Constraints’   Mercedes “significantly” exceeded its U.S. sales target,
Steve Cannon, head of Mercedes-Benz’s U.S. operations, said in
an interview. Sales were limited by the availability of M-Class
and GL-Class sport-utility vehicles, he said.  “You’ve got to sell within the constraints of your product
line,” he said. “We could have sold thousands more in the U.S.
We didn’t get that allocation.”  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac rose 12 percent to 18,248
vehicles in December, helped by the new XTS sedan, the Detroit-
based automaker said in a statement. For the year, sales fell
1.7 percent to 149,782.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 7,384 Lincolns in December, a 12
percent decrease from a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker. Ford is starting a
new ad campaign to try to revive the luxury brand. The campaign
will include an ad during the 2013 Super Bowl football game to
be broadcast by CBS. For the year, Lincoln sales fell 4.1
percent to 82,150.  Sales of Tokyo-based  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura brand rose 22
percent to 16,034 last month, the company said in a statement.
Deliveries for the year rose 27 percent to 156,216.  ‘Conquest Mode’  U.S. sales of Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen (VOW) ’s Audi
brand rose 17 percent last month to 14,841, the company said in
a statement. For the year, sales rose 19 percent to 139,310.  Audi is winning customers from BMW, Mercedes and Lexus,
Scott Keogh, president of Audi’s U.S. operations, said in an
interview.  “The good news is, we’re taking more buyers from them then
they are from us,” Keogh said. “We’re still in conquest
mode.”  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 12,627 vehicles last
month, a 15 percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama,
Japan-based company said in a statement. Deliveries for 2012
rose 22 percent to 119,877 vehicles.  Porsche, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part of
Volkswagen, sold 2,952 vehicles in the U.S. last month, a 61
percent gain, the company said in a statement. For the year,
sales surged 21 percent to 35,043.  Land Rover deliveries rose 9.1 percent to 5,174, while
