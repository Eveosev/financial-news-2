Canadian  stocks  fell from a nine-
month high as commodities slid after American jobless claims
topped forecasts and concern grew that a budget compromise won’t
cut the U.S. deficit fast enough.  Reitmans Canada Ltd. (RET/A)  dropped 4.6 percent after the clothing
retailer reported falling sales during December.  Silvercorp
Metals Inc. (SVM)  declined 2.5 percent as the price of the metal fell
for the first time in three days. Goldcorp Inc., the world’s
second-largest gold producer, slipped 1.1 percent as the price
of the metal fell from a two-week high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 23.24
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,517.53 at 10:08 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge has risen 1.6 percent this week.  More Americans than forecast filed  claims  for unemployment
insurance payments last week as the closing of some state
agencies during the holidays prompted the government to estimate
figures. Applications for jobless benefits increased 10,000 to
372,000 in the week ended Dec. 29, the Labor Department reported
today in  Washington . Economists forecast 360,000 claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
