Indian (SENSEX)  stocks rose for a third day,
with the benchmark index holding at a two-year high. Software
exporters climbed as an expansion in U.S.  manufacturing  boosted
investor confidence in the world’s largest economy.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent
to 19,764.78 at the close in Mumbai. The 30-stock gauge ended at
its highest level since Jan. 6, 2011 yesterday. A measure of
software makers on the MSCI India Index jumped to a one-month
high after  manufacturing in the U.S.  grew more-than-expected in
December.  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (DRRD) , which earns about 40
percent of its revenue from  North America , jumped 2.4 percent.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
rose to 50.7 in December from 49.5 a month earlier, the group
said yesterday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a
reading of 50.5, according to the median of 71 forecasts. The
U.S. took in 11 percent of India’s exports in the six months to
September 2011, data from India’s trade ministry show.  “A recovery in the U.S. is boosting sentiment for software
exporters but investors would watch the upcoming quarterly
results and management commentary before taking further calls,”
Sadanand Shetty, a senior  fund manager  at Taurus Asset
Management Co. in Mumbai, said by phone. “Foreign investors
continue to be very bullish on India as can be seen from the
momentum in flows.”  Foreign funds bought a net $24.5 billion of local stocks in
2012, the highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.
Offshore funds were net buyers of equities on all but one day
last month. They bought $149 million of shares on Jan. 1, data
from the market regulator show.  Two-Year High  The Sensex climbed 26 percent last year, fueled by fund
flows and government measures to open the economy and boost
economic growth. The rally has driven the Sensex’s  valuation  to
15.6 times  estimated earnings , the highest level since March,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index
trades at a multiple of 12.4. Volumes on the Sensex were 14
percent lower than the 30-day average today.  Indian stocks rose yesterday after U.S. lawmakers approved
a bill undoing tax increases and spending cuts threatening the
recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  “The fact that the fiscal cliff has been avoided for the
time being is a big relief,” Ratnesh Kumar, managing director
at Standard Chartered Securities India, told Bloomberg TV India
today. “Developed markets will still be on a slow-growth path
through 2013 as well as beyond. Within that context, what is
important for emerging markets including India is to pick up the
growth momentum.”  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  overhauled policies starting
mid-September, raising diesel prices and allowing more foreign
investment in the retail and airlines to lift  growth  from
September quarter’s 5.3 percent, which matched a three-year low.  Exporters Gain  The MSCI India Information Technology Index jumped 1.2
percent to 659.44, its highest close since Dec. 5.  Tata
Consultancy Services (TCS) , India’s top software exporter, jumped 1.2
percent to 1,278.30 rupees.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second largest,
rose 1.2 percent to 2,337.90 rupees. The two companies  got  more
than half of their revenue from North America in the year ended
March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Dr. Reddy’s rallied 2.4 percent to 1,881 rupees, its
highest close since Dec. 11. Energy stocks also advanced with
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, adding 1.5 percent to 860.75 rupees and state-owned
explorer  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  gaining 1.9 percent to 279.80
rupees.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the largest Indian mobile-phone
operator, climbed 2.2 percent to 328 rupees.  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 0.3 percent to 6,009.5. Its January futures traded
at 6,037.55. The BSE Mid-Cap Index climbed 0.8 percent. India
VIX, which measures the cost of protection against losses in the
Nifty, slid 1.8 percent to 13.47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
