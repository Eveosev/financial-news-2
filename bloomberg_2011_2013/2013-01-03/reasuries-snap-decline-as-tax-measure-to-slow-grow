Treasuries fell for a third day,
pushing the 10-year note yield to a more than seven-month high,
after Federal Reserve policy makers said they may end their $85
billion monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013.  U.S. government debt fell earlier as a private report
showing companies added more jobs in December boosted
speculation tomorrow’s monthly employment report may top
forecasts. The yield on the benchmark security rose the most
since October yesterday as lawmakers approved a budget averting
income-tax increases for more than 99 percent of households,
breaking an impasse about how to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff. Congress must next tackle the U.S. debt ceiling, which
reached its $16.4 trillion limit on Dec. 31.  “The comments about discontinuing bond purchases by some
members is what really pushed the levels over the edge,” said
 Sean Simko , who oversees $8 billion at  SEI Investments Co. (SEIC)  in
Oaks,  Pennsylvania .  Ten-year note yields rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.91 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield reached the
highest since May 10. The price of the 1.625 percent security
fell 21/32 or $6.56 cents per $1,000 face value to 97 13/32.  The 30-year bond yield rose nine basis points to 3.13
percent, the highest since May 4.  ‘Evenly Divided’  The minutes from the FOMC Dec. 11-12 meeting show a divide
among participants on how long the purchases should last. Those
who provided estimates were “approximately evenly divided”
between participants who said it would be appropriate to end the
purchases around mid-2013 and those who said they should
continue beyond that date.  After its December meeting, the FOMC announced Treasury
purchases of $45 billion a month in addition to $40 billion a
month of mortgage-debt purchases begun in September, bringing
the total pace of bond buying to $85 billion a month. The FOMC
hadn’t set a limit on the program’s size or duration and said
last month the purchases will continue “if the outlook for the
labor market does not improve substantially.”  The Fed bought $5.1 billion of securities due from January
2017 to September 2017 today under its strategy of quantitative
easing, or QE, according to the Fed Bank of New York.  If the drop in Treasury prices was “just because of the
FOMC minutes and the news that the Fed may end its program in
mid-2013, we think this was an over-reaction,” said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays Plc,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “We thought
the market was already priced for QE3, not QE-infinity.”  Jobs Reports  Fed asset purchases of between $750 billion and $1 trillion
had already been priced in, roughly matching a late-2013 end to
mortgage and Treasury buying, Pond said.  Companies added 215,000 workers in last month after a
revised 148,000 gain in November, data from the Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed today. The median
forecast of 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
advance of 140,000. Estimates ranged from gains of 70,000 to
210,000.  The economy gained 152,000 jobs in December, versus 146,000
in November, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The
jobless rate held at 7.7 percent, the least since 2008,
according to a separate survey.  The ADP hiring report “is being viewed as more of a
precursor or harbinger of tomorrow’s payrolls report, and that’s
why the market is selling off,” said Kevin Flanagan, a
Purchase, New York-based fixed-income strategist for Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney.  Budget Deal  Applications for jobless benefits increased 10,000 to
372,000 in the week ended Dec. 29, the Labor Department reported
in  Washington . Economists forecast 360,000 claims, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Claims in nine states
and territories were estimated last week, a Labor Department
spokesman said as the data was released.  “Everybody seems to be of a mindset that we’ve skirted the
worst of the pernicious effects of the fiscal cliff, with the
result that the economy is unlikely to go into recession this
year,” said William O’Donnell, head U.S. government-bond
strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut  at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit, a primary dealer.  Lawmakers who struck an 11th-hour budget agreement on Jan.
1 must next tackle the U.S. debt ceiling, which reached its
$16.4 trillion limit the day before. While the budget measure
avoids the fiscal cliff of taxes and spending cuts that
threatened to push the economy into a recession, it ends a 2
percentage-point payroll tax cut and raises taxes on individuals
earning $400,000 a year and households making $450,000.  Austerity Cap  “The austerity is capping yields by keeping economic
growth down,” said Marc Fovinci, the head of fixed income in
 Portland ,  Oregon , at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management Inc.,
which has $3.2 billion in assets. “Taxes are going up.”  The revenue plan approved by Congress this week led
Ferguson Wellman to cut its forecast for the pace of U.S.
expansion in 2013 by half to 1.5 percent, Fovinci said. Ten-year
yields may rise to 2.25 percent in a year, he said.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion of three-year notes, $21
billion of 10-year securities and $13 billion of 30-year bonds
over three days starting Jan. 8, the Treasury Department
announced. The amounts are unchanged from the last time the
government sold this combination of securities in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
