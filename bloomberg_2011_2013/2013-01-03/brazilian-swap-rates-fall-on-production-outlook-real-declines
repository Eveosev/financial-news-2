Brazil ’s swap rates fell before a
report tomorrow forecast to show a drop in industrial
production, spurring speculation that policy makers will keep
borrowing costs at record lows to support the economy.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point to 7.70 percent at
10:18 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.1 percent to
2.0478 per dollar after rallying yesterday the most in a week.  “The industrial production indicator tomorrow may impact
swap rates,” Darwin Dib, the chief economist at CM Capital
Markets Asset Management, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Industrial production  in  Latin America ’s largest economy
shrank 0.9 percent in November after a 0.9 percent increase in
the prior month, according to the median forecast of 34
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before tomorrow’s report from
the national statistics agency.  Swap rates also fell on concern the U.S. budget deal won’t
reduce the deficit fast enough. Most major currencies including
the real fell against the dollar on demand for a refuge.  “The U.S. avoided the fiscal cliff, but there’s a
perception that the trajectory of the debt is unsustainable,”
Dib said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
