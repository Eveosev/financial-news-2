ConocoPhillips and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  were
sued by California Attorney General  Kamala Harris , who accused
the oil producer and the refiner it spun off last year of
environmental violations at more than 560 gasoline stations.  Harris and seven county district attorneys filed a
complaint today in state court in Oakland seeking an order
forcing the companies to comply with California’s laws for
underground gasoline  storage tanks  as well as unspecified civil
penalties for violating the state’s health and safety code.  “The state’s hazardous waste laws help protect our
residents from contaminated groundwater,” Harris said in a
statement. “This lawsuit safeguards public health by ensuring
proper maintenance of the tanks that store fuel beneath many
California communities.”  The complaint accuses the Houston-based companies of
improperly monitoring, inspecting and maintaining the
underground storage tanks. The companies also improperly handled
hazardous waste and materials associated with the storage tanks,
the attorney general said.  The assets and liabilities of the retail locations are no
longer part of  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and are owned by Phillips 66,
Daren Beaudo, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, said in an e-mail.  Janet Grothe, a Phillips 66 spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
that the company doesn’t comment on legal matters.  The case is The People v. Phillips 66, RG13661894, Superior
Court of California, Alameda County (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
