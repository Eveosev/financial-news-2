New Jersey Devils owner Jeff Vanderbeek bought out his partners and refinanced the National
Hockey League team’s debt with  CIT Group Inc. (CIT)  as lead arranger,
the team said in a statement.  “Today’s announcement is good news for Devils fans,”
Vanderbeek, a former member of the executive committee at Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., said in the statement. “Our future is
now secure and we can be confident of continued on-ice
success.”  Vanderbeek was negotiating with his lenders, who were owed
about $77 million in overdue debt, and partners Michael
Gilfillan, who owned 47 percent of the team, and Peter Simon,
who owned 6 percent, according to the  New York  Times.  The newspaper said the team carried about $178 million in
debt. It didn’t say how much of the refinancing was used to buy
out Gilfillan and Simon.  Vanderbeek bought the team in 2004 for $125 million. Forbes
magazine estimated in November that the Devils were worth $205
million, ranked No. 19 in the league, on $122 million in
revenue.  The Devils have gone to the Stanley Cup Final five times in
the past 17 years, including last season, with three
championships in that span. The NHL has locked out its players
and hasn’t played this season as contract talks continue.  Vanderbeek ran Lehman’s capital markets division from 2000
to 2002, then became head of global risk management, private
equity and strategy when the company was the fourth-biggest
securities firm by capital. He left in 2004 when he took control
of the Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
