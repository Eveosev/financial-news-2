Almost two years after the Basque
terror group known as ETA ended its attacks, Batasuna, the
political group that shared its goals for the regionâ€™s
independence from Spain and  France , announced it is dissolving,
Agence France-Presse reported.  Two spokespeople made the announcement during a news
conference today in Bayonne in southwest France, AFP said.  Members of Batasuna, outlawed in Spain though not in
France, will pursue political action, the spokespeople said
without giving further details, according to AFP.  Spain, the country in continental  Europe  most affected by
domestic and international terrorism, has suffered from violence
linked to Basque nationalism for more than a generation. The
government is still in talks with ETA to work out how it will
disarm and address the future of those members who are in jail
or on the run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
