The U.K. agricultural industry should
work to build more direct relationships with consumers, protect
farmland biodiversity and improve public access to green areas,
according to a study commissioned by the Oxford Farming
Conference.  Public opinion toward farming has improved in recent years,
while many consumers are uninformed about where their  food  comes
from, according to the study released today by e-mail from the
nonprofit research group. Farming was considered “important for
the U.K. economy as a whole” by 85 percent of respondents in a
YouGov-Cambridge survey in 2012, while 72 percent said they know
little or nothing about the sector, according to the report.  The total value of farming to U.K. society cannot be
determined because it includes many diverse economic,
environmental and social factors, according to the study,
conducted by researcher Vision 37 and professors from the
University of Exeter and the University of Worcester.  To contact the reporter on this story:
