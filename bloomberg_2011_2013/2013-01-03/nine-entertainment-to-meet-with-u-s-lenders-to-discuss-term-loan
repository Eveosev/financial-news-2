Nine Entertainment Co., the
Australian broadcaster owned by CVC Capital Partners Ltd., will
meet with U.S. lenders on Jan. 10 at 10:30 a.m. in New York to
discuss a A$700 million ($733 million) covenant-lite term loan
it’s seeking to refinance debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Nomura
Holdings Inc. are arranging the financing, which also includes a
A$100 million revolving line of credit that will be undrawn at
closing and be used for general corporate purposes, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private.  Scott Briggs, director of corporate and regulatory affairs
for Sydney-based Nine Entertainment, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  Covenant-lite debt doesn’t carry typical lender protection
such as financial-maintenance requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
