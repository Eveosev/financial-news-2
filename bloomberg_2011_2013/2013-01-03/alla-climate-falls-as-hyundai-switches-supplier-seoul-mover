Halla Climate Control Corp. (018880)  fell the
most in almost five months in Seoul trading after  Hyundai Motor
Co. (005380)  chose Japan’s  Denso Corp. (6902)  to supply air-control equipment.  Halla Climate, a maker of car air-control systems and
components,  slumped  11.4 percent to 21,400 won at the close in
Seoul, its biggest drop since Aug. 7. South Korea’s benchmark
Kospi index declined 0.6 percent.  Hyundai Motor will use Denso’s air-control parts for U.S.-
made Sonata sedans, the auto company, South Korea’s biggest
carmaker, said in an e-mailed response to a Bloomberg News query
today. The Seoul-based company and affiliates  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
and  Hyundai Mobis (012330)  Co. together  account for  70 percent of Halla’s
revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Hyundai is probably trying to lower its dependency on
Halla, which has long been Hyundai’s key air-control parts
supplier,” Kim Yoon Ki, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities
Co. in  Seoul , said by phone. “It’s the right strategy for
Hyundai, as it’s rare and dangerous for an automaker to be that
dependent on one supplier.”  Kim has a buy rating for Halla and Hyundai Motor.  The switch is part of the company’s regular supplier
diversification to ensure a stable delivery of parts, Hyundai
Motor said in its e-mail.  The Korea Economic Daily reported the supplier switch
earlier today.  Denso last traded 0.8 percent higher to close at 2,973 yen
in  Tokyo  on Dec. 28. Japanese markets resume trading tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
