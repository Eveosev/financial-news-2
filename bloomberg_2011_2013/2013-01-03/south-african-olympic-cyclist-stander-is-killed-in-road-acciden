South Africa’s leading mountain biker
Burry Stander died in a road accident while on a training ride
near his home.   The 25-year-old, who finished fifth in the men’s cross-
country race at the London Olympics and also competed at the
Beijing Games, was killed in a collision with a taxi in Shelly
Beach, a town on South Africa’s east coast, the South African
Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee said yesterday.  “This is indeed terrible news to start 2013 with,” SASCOC
president Gideon Sam said in a  statement . “Burry was the
epitome of an Olympic athlete: talented, ultra-competive but at
the same time extremely humble and a true gentleman.”  Two years ago, Carla Swart, another leading South African
cyclist, was killed when she was hit by a truck while training
in Free State province. Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins,
fellow British rider Mark Cavendish and British Cycling head
coach Shane Sutton were involved in collisions with vehicles in
the U.K. last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
