Biohit Oyj (BIOBV) , a Finnish maker of tools
to diagnose and prevent gastrointestinal diseases, rose the most
in almost three months in Helsinki trading on speculation of
increasing sales for its drug to prevent stomach cancer.  The shares advanced for a sixth day, jumping as much as 15
percent, the most since Oct. 8, to 5.10 euros in intraday
trading. Biohit added 11 percent at 2:51 p.m. in the Finnish
capital, to 4.96 euros, giving the company a market value of
67.5 million euros ($88 million). More than 134,000 shares
traded, or  four times  the three-month average.  Biohit signed Canadian distributor Xediton Pharmaceuticals
Inc. for its Acetium product, the company said on Dec. 28. Since
then, the stock has gained 34 percent. ProGalenika is the drugâ€™s
dispenser in  Mexico , Argentina, Brazil,  Colombia  and  Venezuela ,
according to a Dec. 7 statement.  Acetium is used to bind carcinogenic acetaldehyde, which
occurs naturally and is used in food. Biohit won a U.S. patent
for the product in October, valid until 2026, and a European
patent was granted in July. Acetium is the only product proven
to reduce exposure to acetaldehyde, Biohit said on July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
