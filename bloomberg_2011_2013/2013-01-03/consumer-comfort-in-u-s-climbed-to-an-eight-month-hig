Consumer sentiment last week reached
an eight-month high, reflecting broad-based gains that indicated
even wealthy Americans were less concerned about tax increases
and fiscal policy challenges heading into 2013.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 31.8 in
the period ended Dec. 30, its highest since April, from minus
32.1 a week earlier. For the year, the index climbed 12.9
points, the biggest annual improvement since 1998. Americans
earning $100,000 or more reported their most optimistic reading
in more than two years.  “The rebuilding of wealth and modest income gains
permitted consumer sentiment to overcome slow growth and a
politically divisive environment in late 2012,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York .
Rising home values and low  interest rates  in particular are
buoying wealthier households, helping to overcome the threat of
higher taxes in 2013, he said.  The index finished the year at its best level since mid-
April, less than half a point from the 2012 high it reached
twice that month. It has held above its traditional trouble
zone, the minus 40s, for 15 straight weeks, a positive run last
recorded in early 2008.  For the year, the index averaged minus 38.1, the most since
2007. It remains below its long-term average of minus 15.8.  Stocks fell, pulling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down
from close to a five-year high. The  S&P 500  eased 0.2 percent to
1,459.38 at 9:35 a.m. in New York.  Another report today from the ADP Research Institute showed
companies added 215,000 workers in December, the most since
February, after a 148,000 gain a month earlier that was larger
than initially estimated.  Jobless Claims  The Labor Department reported initial  jobless claims  last
week climbed by 10,000 to 372,000. The closing of some state
employment agencies during the holidays prompted the government
to estimate some figures.  The comfort survey, conducted in the last week of the year
when President  Barack Obama  and Congress remained at odds over
taxes and  government spending , showed a more positive outlook
among Democrats than other voters.  The comfort index was minus 19.8 among registered
Democrats, compared with minus 35.8 for Republicans and minus
33.9 for Independents. Democrats have had a rosier outlook than
Republicans for a record 41 straight weeks.  The index coincides with improvements in other areas of the
economy, including housing. Residential real estate, which
triggered the economic downturn that ended in June 2009, is
rebounding, with  resales  at their strongest pace in more than
two years and building permits at a four-year high.  Income Groups  Among Americans with annual incomes of $100,000 or more,
the Bloomberg index rose to 11.8 from 6.6 a week earlier,
capping nine weeks in positive territory. For those making
$50,000 or more, the gauge climbed to minus 4.1, the highest
reading since January 2008.  That contrasts with the mood of the lowest wage earners.
The gauge for those earning less than $15,000 a year was minus
72.5, its worst since early September.  Two of the three components of the Bloomberg consumer
comfort index improved last week. The measure of Americans’
views of the state of the economy climbed to minus 57.1, the
second-highest level since March 2008, from minus 58.5 the prior
week. The personal  finances  gauge rose to 0.8, the first
positive reading since July, from minus 0.5.  The buying climate index decreased to minus 39 from minus
37.5 in the previous period.  Retail Sales  Retailers lured reluctant shoppers with late-December
specials after  Hurricane Sandy , the presidential election and
the school shooting in Newtown,  Connecticut , tempered earlier
holiday spending.  Macy’s Inc. (M)  and Gap Inc. reported December same-store sales
that topped analysts’ estimates after shoppers rushed to take
advantage of last-minute discounts.  Sales at Macy’s, the second-biggest U.S. department-store
company, rose 4.1 percent, exceeding the average projection of
3.7 percent from analysts surveyed by researcher Retail Metrics
Inc. Gap, the largest U.S. specialty-apparel retailer, posted a
5 percent gain, topping the 3.6 percent estimate.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer
Research Associates in New York, conducts telephone surveys with
a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older. Each week, 250
respondents are asked for their views on the economy, personal
finances and buying climate. The percentage of negative
responses is subtracted from the share of positive views and
divided by three. The most recent reading is based on the
average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
