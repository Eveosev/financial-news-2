Latvia’s budget deficit may have
narrowed to between 1 percent and 1.3 percent of gross domestic
product last year according to European Union methodology,
Finance Minister Andris Vilks told the  Baltic News Service .  That would compare with a target for a 1.9 percent
shortfall and would outperform this year’s plan for a 1.4
percent gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
