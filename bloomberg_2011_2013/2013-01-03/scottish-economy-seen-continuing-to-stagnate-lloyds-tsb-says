The Scottish economy is set to
continue stagnating in the first half with 49% of companies
expecting revenue to be static in the period, according to a
report from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)   About 28 percent of the companies surveyed forecast sales
will fall while 23 percent predict an increase, the Lloyds TSB
 Scotland  Business Monitor showed. The negative net balance of 5
percentage points compares with a negative balance of 14 percent
a year ago, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  “A return to more vigorous growth in the Scottish economy
awaits a further increase in confidence in both consumers and
businesses,” Donald MacRae, chief economist for Lloyds TSB
Scotland, said in the statement. “However, there are no
definite signs of a relapse into deep recession.”  The U.K. economy expanded 0.9 percent in the third-quarter,
ending a so-called double-dip recession. Third quarter data for
the Scottish economy, due to be published this month, is
unlikely to show the same increase, MacRae told the Glasgow-
based Herald newspaper in November.  The net balance of companies expecting a rise in export
activity over the next three months was 16 percent, compared
with a negative balance of 15 percent a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
