Palm oil  declined on concern that an
advance to the highest level in two months yesterday may further
reduce demand, which usually decreases during winter.  The contract for March delivery lost as much as 1.4 percent
to 2,467 ringgit ($813) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, before trading at 2,483 ringgit at 12:20 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures gained 2.6 percent yesterday to close at 2,501
ringgit, the highest settlement price for the most-active
contract since Nov. 1.  Exports fell 5.7 percent to 1.57 million tons in December
from 1.66 million tons a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said
Dec. 31. Shipments dropped 7.9 percent to 1.52 million tons in
the same period, estimated Societe Generale de Surveillance.
Exports are generally lower during the winter months as the
tropical oil clouds in cooler temperatures.  The winter is “the main reason that exports are not able
to pick up,” Vijay Mehta, a director at Commodity Links Pte,
said by phone from  Singapore . “There should be a revival in
demand from February onwards.”  Gains will be curbed on concerns about stockpiles in
Malaysia, said Mehta. Futures lost 23 percent last year as
 inventories  gained for five straight months, reaching a record
2.56 million tons in November, according to the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board. Malaysia is the largest producer after  Indonesia .  Soybeans for March delivery dropped as much as 0.5 percent
to $13.85 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest
price for the most-active contract since Nov. 20.  Soybean oil 
for delivery in March was little changed at 51.06 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
