Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, has created a new executive position to
oversee new store formats in international markets.  Lev Khasis, who joined the company in 2011 after working in
Russian retail, was named president and chief executive officer
of new formats for Wal-Mart International,  Kevin Gardner , a Wal-
Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Wal-Mart has been experimenting with different types of
stores, including bodega-style locations that have proved
popular with shoppers in Mexico. The company has used the
Mexican Bodega Aurrera stores as the inspiration for small-
format locations in the U.S. and Latin America.  “Lev has a track record of developing innovative formats,
and he will now focus on developing new concepts that can be
deployed across our markets to provide future growth,” Gardner
said.  Wal-Mart fell 0.6 percent to $68.80 at the close in New
York yesterday. The shares have gained 14 percent over the past
12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
