Formosa Plastics Group ’s biggest
units reported improved quarterly earnings as demand for
petrochemicals increased.  Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301) , a polyvinyl chloride maker, posted
a pretax profit of NT$2.85 billion ($98 million) in the three
months ended Dec. 31, the parent company said in a statement
today. That compared with NT$942 million a year earlier and the
NT$5.52 billion average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Manufacturing in  China ,  Taiwan ’s biggest overseas market,
expanded for a third straight month, based on the Purchasing
Managers’ Index, adding to evidence of a recovery in the global
economy. The island’s industrial output rose at the fastest pace
in nine months in November, with production of chemical
materials gaining 7.3 percent from a year earlier.  “There are signs that demand is coming back,” said Filoli
Tsai, a Taipei-based analyst at IBTS Investment Consulting Co.,
who rates Formosa Plastics neutral. “There’s been some
restocking for commodities.”  Chemical producer  Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326)  turned to
a pretax profit of NT$3.4 billion in the fourth quarter from a
loss of NT$2.21 billion a year earlier. The average of nine
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a pretax profit
of NT$3.6 billion.  Plastics processor  Nan Ya (1303)  Plastics Corp. reported a pretax
profit of NT$136 million, compared with a loss of NT$1.57
billion a year earlier. Seven analysts had expected an average
profit of NT$2.85 billion.  Oil refiner  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  posted a pretax
profit of NT$1.98 billion. The average of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a profit of NT$6.18
billion. The company reported a loss of NT$4.39 billion a year
earlier.  Formosa Petrochemical’s fourth-quarter earnings were eroded
by the reduced value of stockpiles after crude oil prices
dropped, Lin Keh-yen, a spokesman for the company, said in a
press conference in Taipei today.  To contact the reporter on the story:
