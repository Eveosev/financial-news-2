The U.K.’s pork exports climbed about
13 percent in October, compared with a year earlier, in part as
Chinese demand increased, according to the Agriculture &
Horticulture Development Board.  The U.K. shipped 14,900 metric tons of fresh and frozen
pork in October, up from 13,100 tons at the same time a year
earlier, AHDB’s pig unit BPEX said in a  report  on its website.
Exports in the first 10 months of 2012 totaled 127,100 tons,
compared with 121,100 tons a year earlier. Shipments of offal
jumped 81 percent during October to 6,400 tons.  U.K. pork exports to European Union countries rose 13
percent, and shipments to  China , the world’s biggest pork
consumer, topped 2,000 tons for the first time, AHDB said. China
 agreed  to begin importing British pork in May, with most
purchases expected to consist of offal, or organs and other
animal parts, according to the Department for Environment, Food
& Rural Affairs.  The U.K. imported 31,100 tons of fresh and frozen pork in
October, up 3 percent from a year earlier, AHDB said. Purchases
of bacon climbed 3 percent to 23,700 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
