Residual-fuel inventories in
 Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
3.3 percent to the lowest in three months, according to a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped 646,000 barrels to 18.8
million barrels in the seven days to yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. The
residual-fuel supply declined for a fourth week to the lowest
level since the week ended Oct. 3.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene fell 317,000 barrels, or 3 percent, to 10.2
million barrels, the ministry’s data showed.  Light-distillate supplies including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate rose 938,000 barrels, or 10 percent, to 10.3 million
barrels, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
