Brazilian soybean and corn shipments
from Paranagua, the country’s biggest grain and oilseeds port,
will rise as much as 14 percent this year as growers harvest
record crops, the hub’s head of operations said.  The shipments will climb from 44 million metric tons last
year, said Luiz Henrique Dividino, superintendent of the port,
in a telephone interview. The jump will follow an 8 percent
increase last year, he said.  Brazil , set to surpass the U.S. as the world’s biggest
soybean grower and exporter this year, is forecast to harvest a
record 82.6 million tons of the oilseed this year, the
government said in a Dec. 6 report. Corn output will drop to
71.9 million tons from a record 73 million in the past harvest.  “We are prepared for the challenge of shipping this record
soybean crop and the big corn harvest that is expected too,”
Dividino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
