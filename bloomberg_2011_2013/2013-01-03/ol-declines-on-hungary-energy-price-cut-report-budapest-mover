Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest refiner,
fell after Magyar Hirlap reported that the government plans to
impose further price cuts on energy suppliers.  The shares dropped as much as 1.4 percent and traded 0.6
percent lower at 17,800 forint by 12:28 p.m. in Budapest. The
benchmark BUX stock index, in which Mol has the biggest
 weighting  at 33 percent, slid less than 0.1 percent.  The Cabinet, which is forcing suppliers to cut household
prices by 10 percent from this month, plans two further rounds
of reductions for heating, natural gas and electricity starting
in March or April, Magyar Hirlap said. The government wants to
cut profit margins for gas and electricity distributors to allow
utility prices to fall, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said in an
interview with state-run MR1 radio on Nov. 30.  A 10 percent cut in Mol’s gas prices may hit operating
profit by as much as 5 percent, Jozsef Miro, a Budapest-based
analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report.  The Development Ministry declined to comment in an e-mailed
response to questions from  Bloomberg News  on the Magyar Hirlap
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
