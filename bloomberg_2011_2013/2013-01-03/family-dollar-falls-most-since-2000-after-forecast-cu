Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) , the
second-largest U.S. dollar store chain, tumbled the most in more
than 12 years after cutting its fiscal 2013 earnings forecast,
saying consumers are reluctant to spend on more-profitable
discretionary items.  Family Dollar sank 13 percent to $55.63 at 9:57 a.m. in New
York, after falling 14 percent for the biggest intraday drop
since December 2000. The Matthews, North Carolina-based
company’s shares had advanced for five straight years, including
a gain of 10 percent in 2012.  Accelerating price cuts and expanding sales of lower-margin
necessities will continue to weigh on profit, the company said
in a statement. Consumers may trim discretionary spending even
more after the expiration of a 2 percent payroll tax cut, Peter Keith, a New York-based Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst, wrote in a
note.  “This expiration is a more meaningful impact on lower
income spending capacity” than the income tax increases for
upper income households, Keith wrote. He rates Family Dollar
underweight, the equivalent of a sell recommendation.  Family Dollar said it expects full-year profit of $3.95 a
share to $4.25 a share, compared to a projection of $4.10 to
$4.40 in October. The average analyst estimate was for $4.25,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The retailer projected
fiscal second-quarter earnings of $1.18 to $1.28, trailing
analysts’ expectations of $1.39.  ‘Challenging’ Season  Profit in the fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 24 was 69
cents a share, missing analysts’ estimates of 75 cents. Revenue
rose 13 percent to $2.42 billion, beating analysts’ forecast of
$2.38 billion.  The holiday-selling season “proved to be more challenging
than we expected as customers faced increasing financial
uncertainty,” Chief Executive Officer Howard Levine said today
in a statement. He said customers are focusing “even more on
basic needs.”  Dollar General Corp. (DG) , the largest dollar store chain, said
last month it expects consumers to spend more cautiously this
year, spurring it to match rivals’ price cuts on popular items
such as coffee and cereal.  A 2 percentage point payroll tax cut ended Dec. 31,
shrinking paychecks for U.S. workers. The move is expected to
pull more than $100 billion out of the economy in 2013 and is
the primary reason why 77.1 percent of U.S. households will face
higher taxes this year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy
Center in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
