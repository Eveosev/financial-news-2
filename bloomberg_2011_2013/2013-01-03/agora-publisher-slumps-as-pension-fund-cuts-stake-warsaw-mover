Agora SA (AGO) ,  Poland ’s largest publicly
traded publisher, headed for a two-week low after the country’s
biggest pension fund reduced its stake.  The  shares  dropped 2.9 percent to 10.2 zloty at 2:59 p.m.
in Warsaw trading after the company said ING Groep NV’s Polish
fund cut its holding to 9.6 percent from 10 percent. Today’s
volume on the stock was 81 percent of the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors closely watch moves by big investors, fearing
more shares might be sold on the market,” Dominik Niszcz, a
Warsaw-based analyst at Raiffeisen Centrobank AG said by e-mail
today. “I’d wait for a rebound in the advertising market and
probably some better news-flow from Agora’s cinema business
before buying the shares.”  Agora bought Helios SA, the nation’s third-largest cinema
chain, for 26.2 million euros ($34 million) in 2011 to help make
up for the decline in sales of its flagship newspaper,  Gazeta
Wyborcza . The title, Poland’s largest non-tabloid newspaper, has
seen readership and revenue fall since 2008 as advertisers shift
their focus to the Internet. The company increased the copy
price of Gazeta Wyborcza as much as 15 percent this year, it
said on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
