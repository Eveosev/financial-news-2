Most Germans view real estate as the
safest way to save money for retirement and don’t want stocks to
be part of their pension, a Union Investment survey showed.  The poll of 500 financial decision makers showed 85 percent
consider real estate ownership as the most reliable investment,
while 37 percent view so-called Riester saving plans as secure,
the  fund manager  said in a  summary  of the findings today.
Seventy percent of the people surveyed regard state pensions as
unsafe.  Germans are skeptical of buying equities, with 58 percent
of respondents saying that stocks and funds shouldn’t be part of
“good” planning for old age. About two-thirds of 20- to 29-
year-olds hold that opinion, Union Investment said.  Forsa, a polling company, conducted the quarterly survey of
people between 20 and 59 with at least one investment from Nov.
5 to Nov. 14, according to the fund manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
