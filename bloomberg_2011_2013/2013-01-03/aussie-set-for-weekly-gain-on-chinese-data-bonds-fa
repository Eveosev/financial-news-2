Australia ’s dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart, trimming a weekly gain, after service-industry
indexes in the South Pacific nation and  China  declined.  Australian bonds dropped, pushing benchmark 10-year yields
to the highest in more than four months after gains in Asian
stocks curbed demand for haven assets. The so-called Aussie and
New Zealand’s dollar were supported against the yen amid
speculation the  Japan ’s central bank will boost stimulus to
weaken its currency.  “The Aussie is looking a bit overvalued,” said Masashi Murata, a currency strategist in  Tokyo  at Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co. “The risk scenario for the Aussie is for the
recovery in the Chinese economy to halt and Australia’s domestic
demand to deteriorate.”  The Australian dollar fell to $1.0441 as of 4:25 p.m. in
Sydney, down 0.2 percent from yesterday and poised for a 0.7
percent gain this week. It climbed 0.4 percent to 91.66  yen  from
yesterday, when it touched 91.76, the highest since September
2008.  New Zealand ’s dollar, known as the kiwi, dropped 0.4
percent to 82.47 U.S. cents from yesterday, paring its gain
since Dec. 28 to 0.6 percent. It rose 0.2 percent to 72.39 yen.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government bond rose as
much as 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 3.45
percent, the highest since Aug. 21. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
of stocks rose 0.3 percent.  Services Industry  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today a
purchasing managers’ index of Chinese non-manufacturing
industries fell to 51.7 in December from 52.1 in the previous
month. Fifty is the dividing line between an expansion and
contraction.  An  index  published today by the Australian Industry Group
and  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  showed services shrank for an
11th-straight month in the South Pacific nation, with a reading
of 43.2 in December. November’s reading was 47.1.  The Australian dollar has fallen 1.1 percent in the past 12
months according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
indexes, a set of gauges that track 10 developed market
currencies. New Zealand’s currency has gained 3.3 percent in the
same period, the best performer after the Norwegian krone.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 44 percent chance the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will lower
its benchmark rate to 2.75 percent in February, lower than the
59 percent probability indicated at the end of 2012.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will next meet on Jan. 21-22 after
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his policy board added 10
trillion yen ($114 billion) to its 66 trillion-yen asset
purchase program last month. Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura
is scheduled to speak today in  San Diego .  Benchmark interest rates are 3 percent in Australia and 2.5
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency-market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
