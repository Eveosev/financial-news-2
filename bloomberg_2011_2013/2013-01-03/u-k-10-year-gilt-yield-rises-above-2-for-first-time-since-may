U.K.  government bonds  fell, with 10-
year yields climbing above 2 percent for the first time since
May, signaling the government of Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will have to pay more to finance its  budget deficit .  Gilts extended losses from yesterday when  benchmark yields 
jumped the most since September as U.S. lawmakers reached a deal
to avert tax increases and spending cuts, reducing demand for
safer assets. U.K. borrowing costs increased today as the nation
sold 3.75 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) of five-year notes. The
pound weakened from a 16-month high against the dollar as U.K.
reports showed British  house prices  fell last month and
construction output contracted.  “It’s the milestone bit that’s being crossed today,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London. “Yields can go a lot higher but they can’t go that much
lower, in that we’re coming from a very low starting point.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.06 percent at 4:34 p.m.  London  time after
reaching 2.07 percent, the highest level since May 2. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 dropped 0.64, or 6.40 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 97.28.  Benchmark yields, which jumped 16 basis points yesterday,
will increase to 2.40 percent by year-end, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The yield
fell to a record 1.407 percent on July 23.  Debt Sale  The U.K. sold five-year notes today at an average yield of
0.958 percent, compared with 0.787 percent at the previous
auction of the securities on Nov. 20. Investors submitted bids
for 2.11 times the amount sold, versus 1.59 times in November.  Five-year yields climbed five basis points to 1.01 percent
in the secondary market after rising to 1.02 percent, the
highest since May 10.  The breach of 2 percent in 10-year yields may have been
triggered by automatic orders to sell the securities, said
 Orlando Green , a strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London.  “Clearly it’s a big number if it’s gone through that,
there may be little bit of some forced selling,” he said.  Gilts have underperformed their German counterparts since
 Standard & Poor’s  lowered the outlook on Britain’s top credit
rating to negative on Dec. 13, citing weak economic growth and a
worsening debt profile.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of bunds widened five basis points today to 59 basis
points, from 49 basis points on Dec. 12.  Yields have moved in the opposite direction than suggested
by a rating change 47 percent of the time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg in June on 314 upgrades, downgrades and
outlook changes going back to 1974.  Pound Declines  The pound dropped the most in almost two weeks against the
dollar as  Nationwide Building Society  said the average cost of a
home in Britain slipped 0.1 percent in December.  A U.K. construction index fell to 48.7 last month from 49.3
in November,  Markit Economics  said in a separate report. A
reading below 50 signals contraction.  The U.K. currency weakened 0.6 percent to $1.6155 after
appreciating to $1.6381 yesterday, the strongest since Aug. 30,
2011. Sterling was little changed at 81.15 pence per euro.  The pound has appreciated 1.5 percent in the past 12
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro declined
1.5 percent and the dollar weakened 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
