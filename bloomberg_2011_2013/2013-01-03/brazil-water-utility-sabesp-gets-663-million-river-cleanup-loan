Sabesp, Latin America’s largest
publicly traded water utility, will be loaned 1.35 billion reais
($663 million) by the national  development bank  to help clean up
the Tiete River that originates in  Sao Paulo .  The Tiete, Sao Paulo state’s main river, has become heavily
polluted from industry and population growth in South America’s
biggest city. It flows inland rather than to the sea, growing
larger, and is utilized by Brazilian farmers and agricultural
interests.  The loan announcement to  Cia. de Saneamento Basico  do
Estado de Sao Paulo came from BNDES, Brazil’s development bank,
which is based in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil is the host of next
year’s  World Cup  and the 2016 Olympic summer games.  The funding includes expanding sewage treatment capacity in
more than 20 cities in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area in the
third stage of the Tiete cleanup that’s expected to be completed
in 2016 as part of a R$2.9 billion project.  According to the statement, the loan will cover Sabesp’s
portion of a contract with the  Inter-American Development Bank 
for the third stage. Sabesp had no immediate comment when
contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
