The Hong Kong government’s new rules
that require real estate agents to list properties by apartment
size not including shared space will help raise transparency for
the industry, according to property broker AG Wilkinson.  Starting on Jan. 1, real estate agents are required to show
potential buyers net areas of the properties they market, after
complaints from consumer groups that past rules allowing them to
use only gross floor areas, which include shared areas such as
lobbies, have misled buyers, according to documents on the
 Estate Agents Authority  Web site. The city’s government has in
the past year introduced measures including tightening mortgage
lending and imposing extra taxes to curb  home prices , which are
now the world’s highest.  “This will unify industry standard and raise
transparency,” said Ringo Lam, a director of valuation at Hong
Kong-based AG Wilkinson. “In the past there were agents who
deliberately used this loophole to mislead buyers. Hopefully
this can help rectify that.”  The difference between gross and net areas can be more than
30 percent at some residential projects in the city, according
to Lam.  Hong Kong’s  home prices  have doubled in the past four years
on near record low mortgage rates, an influx of buyers from
other parts of  China  and a lack of new housing supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
