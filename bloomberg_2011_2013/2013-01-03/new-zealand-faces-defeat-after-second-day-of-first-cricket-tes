Dean Brownlie scored an unbeaten 69
as  New Zealand  battled to avoid a heavy defeat on the second day
of the first cricket Test against  South Africa .  The visitors reached 169-4 at stumps in Cape Town and trail
by 133 runs. New Zealand collapsed to 45 all out in its first
innings, with top-ranked South Africa declaring on 347-8 in
reply.  Alviro Petersen scored 106 for the hosts, who resumed on
252-3 today. AB de Villiers got 67 runs, Hashim Amla 66 and
Jacques Kallis 60.  New Zealand lost Martin Guptill in the first over before
captain Brendon McCullum, with 51 runs, and Brownlie recovered
some stability. The pair put on 89 for the third wicket.  Kane Williamson made 15 runs and Daniel Flynn 14, while BJ
Watling is 10 not out.  Vernon Philander took 5-7 yesterday as New Zealand slumped
to its third-lowest Test total.  The teams are playing a two-match series, New Zealandâ€™s
first under McCullum, who succeeded  Ross Taylor  as captain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
