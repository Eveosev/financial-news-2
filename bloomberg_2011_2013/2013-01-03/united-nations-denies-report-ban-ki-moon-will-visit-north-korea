The  United Nations  denied a report by
a South Korean newspaper that its Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon
may visit North Korea in March.  “This report is totally baseless,” the spokesperson for
the secretary-general said in an e-mailed statement. “I wish to
make it absolutely clear that there are no plans for or
discussions about such a visit by the Secretary-General as
reported.”  South Korea ’s Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported earlier today
Ban may visit Pyongyang in March to discuss the participation of
the two Koreas in the 2015 Gwangju Summer Universiade, a
sporting event for university athletes, as a unified team,
citing an interview with Gwangju City Mayor Kang Un Tae.  Ban said last month that he is willing to visit  North Korea 
when “the time comes, when appropriate conditions” are
created. The UN Security Council unanimously condemned North
Korea’s Dec. 12 long-range rocket launch, calling it a “clear
violation” of UN prohibitions.  North Korea requested emergency supplies from the UN last
summer, including food and fuel, as it suffered from torrential
rains and flooding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
