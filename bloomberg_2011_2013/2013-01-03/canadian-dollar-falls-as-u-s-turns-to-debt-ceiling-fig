The Canadian dollar fell the most in
almost two weeks against its U.S. counterpart after the U.S.
central bank revealed it may end monetary stimulus as early as
this year, allowing the currency to appreciate.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, strengthened
against the euro and most of its other major peers before
government reports tomorrow from Canada and the U.S. on December
employment. The Federal Reserve will probably end its $85
billion monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013, with members
divided between a mid- or end-of-year finish, the record of the
Federal Open Market Committee’s Dec. 11-12 gathering show.  “Markets thought quantitative easing would last much
longer than that and as a result less stimulus tends to mean a
stronger U.S. dollar,” said  Eric Lascelles , chief economist at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Global Asset Management unit, said by
phone from Toronto. “The Canadian dollar ends up weaker just
because the U.S. dollar is stronger on less stimulus
expectations.”  The loonie fell 0.3 percent to 98.78 cents per U.S. dollar
at 5:04 p.m. in Toronto, its largest drop since Dec. 21.
Yesterday, it rose to the highest level since Dec. 18. It added
0.8 percent to C$1.2891 per euro. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0124.  Oil, Stocks  Futures on crude oil, the country’s biggest export, fell
0.3 percent to $92.85 per barrel. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index was down 0.2 percent.  Implied volatility for three-month options on the U.S.
dollar versus the loonie was 5.5 percent, the least since Dec.
21 and below the one-year average of 7.7 percent. Implied
volatility signals the expected pace of currency swings and is
quoted and used by traders to set option prices.  Canada ’s benchmark 10-year bonds declined, with yields
rising six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.95
percent. The 2.75 percent security maturing in June 2022 fell 50
cents to C$107.08.  The Bank of Canada said it will sell C$3.4 billion ($3.4
billion of five-year notes on Jan. 9. The 1.25 percent
securities will mature in March 2018.  Canada’s unemployment rate is expected to have increased in
December to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent the previous month,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists. Jobs growth
may have slowed to 5,000 from 59,300 the previous month, a
separate survey shows.  Jobs Data  Hiring is expected to have picked up in the U.S. in Dec.
with 153,000 jobs added, compared with 146,000 the previous
month, according to the median estimate of a survey of 76
economists by Bloomberg. The jobless rate is forecast to be
unchanged at 7.7 percent.  Canada’s dollar strengthened earlier as data from Roseland,
New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed U.S. companies
added 215,000 workers in December, compared with the 140,000 job
gain predicted in a Bloomberg survey.  “The Canadian dollar has really taken its cue off the ADP
employment change, and it’s probably going to start
strengthening off expectations for positive nonfarm payrolls
tomorrow,” Eimear Daly, a currency market analyst at Monex
Europe Ltd., said by phone from  London .  The U.S. Congress will face a debate about raising the
country’s $16.4 trillion debt ceiling next month and must
confront $110 billion in automatic spending cuts in March that
were put off in this week’s budget deal. Republican politicians
have promised to use the debate on raising the nation’s
borrowing limit to win concessions on spending cuts.  Big Move  “We had such a big move in the Canadian dollar yesterday,
and all risk assets yesterday, that it’s really hard to see that
move extended right now,” said David Watt, chief economist at
the Canadian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, by phone from Toronto.
“Especially with the one-day move after the fiscal cliff and
there’s still a number of issues looming in the next couple of
months, so I think the enthusiasm for risk assets is dissipated
after yesterday.”  The Canadian dollar has gained 1.3 percent in the past week
versus nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The greenback has added 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
