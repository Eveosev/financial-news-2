Gold futures fell in electronic
trading as the dollar extended a rally after Federal Reserve
policy makers said they probably will end their $85 billion
monthly U.S. bond purchases sometime in 2013.  The greenback rose to a three-week high against a basket of
major currencies after minutes from the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s Dec. 11-12 meeting showed members divided between a
mid- or end-of-year end to the debt purchases. Earlier, gold
settled down 0.8%, the biggest drop since Dec. 20, on renewed
U.S. deficit concerns after a budget accord yesterday spurred a
commodity rally.  “After the initial euphoria, people realized that the
announcements made yesterday were just a Band-Aid solution, and
the problems remain,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Many
investors are moving to cash.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell $23.30, or 1.4

called quantitative easing to boost the economy and cut the
jobless rate.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 1.8 percent to
