Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, issued $2 billion of bonds in its first sale of
fixed-rate debt maturing in at least 30 years since 1999.  The 4.75 percent securities due January 2043 were priced to
yield 180 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the sale
will be used to refinance debt and to fund its  pension plan . The
notes may be rated Baa3, the lowest level of investment grade,
by Moody’s Investors Service.  The offering from Ford, which was lifted last year to high
grade at Moody’s and  Fitch Ratings , comes as auto sales surge
and with borrowing costs touching record lows. Ford’s U.S.
light-vehicle sales rose 1.6 percent in December, the company
said today, exceeding the 1.2 percent increase forecast by
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ford’s $1.8 billion of 7.45 percent bonds due July 2031
traded at 128.5 cents on the dollar to yield 5.06 percent
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The automaker issued $4.95 billion of 4.25 percent, 30-year
convertible securities in December 2006, Bloomberg data show.  Ford was  raised  to investment grade by Moody’s in May and
by Fitch in April. Standard & Poor’s rates the company’s debt
BB+, or the highest level of speculative grade, with a positive
outlook, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Borrowing costs for high-grade American companies have
declined to 2.8 percent from last year’s high of 3.93 percent,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
index data.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and
Morgan Stanley managed the Dearborn, Michigan-based company’s
sale, Bloomberg data show.  General Motors Co. (GM)  is the top-selling
automaker in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
