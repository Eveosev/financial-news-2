Metallurgical coal may rebound from
the lowest prices since 2009 as China rebuilds steel supplies,
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment-banking unit said in a report today.  The increased consumption comes after companies from
Appalachia to Australia tempered output in an effort to help
stem declines and as a loading berth at  Westshore Terminals
Investment Corp. (WTE) ’s operation in  Vancouver  may be shut until the
end of the first quarter after a Dec. 7 accident.  Barclays said the destocking of steel has been more
pronounced than usual and that China’s inventories haven’t
fallen in either of the past two weeks for the first time since
February. The country typically begins to restock in late
December, weeks before the Chinese New Year, the London-based
bank said.  “This bodes well for a recovery in global seaborne met-
coal prices in the coming months,” David Gagliano, an analyst
at Barclays in New York, said in the note. Barclays said first-
quarter benchmark settlements of $165 a metric ton may mark the
low for 2013.  Prices are down 50 percent from the record $330 a metric
ton set in the second quarter of 2011 after floods in
Queensland,  Australia , ravaged production, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
