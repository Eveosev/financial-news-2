CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is said to
be planning to raise about 780 million euros ($1 billion) from
high-yield bonds to finance its buyout of Cerved Group SpA, an
Italian business credit information provider.  The senior and subordinated notes will be offered to
investors in the second half of January, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be named
because the deal is private. The proposed drawn debt represents
about 5.5 times Cervedâ€™s earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, the person said.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings
Plc provided committed financing to support the 1.13 billion-
euro buyout, CVC said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Alessandro Lozzia, a spokesman for CVC in  Italy , declined
to comment on details of the debt financing.  The financing package also includes a 75 million-euro
revolving credit facility, the person said. Under a revolver,
money repaid can be borrowed again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
