     Jan. 3 (Bloomberg) --- Vanguard Group Inc., the biggest
U.S. mutual-fund firm, said Sandip A. Bhagat, head of the Equity
Investment Group, left the firm to pursue other opportunities.  Bhagat’s team oversaw $926 billion in equity  index funds 
and quantitative strategies, spokesman  John Woerth  said in a
telephone interview. Unlike actively managed funds, which
require day-to-day decisions on buying and selling securities,
index funds track benchmarks such as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and quantitative strategies follow pre-set mathematical
models.  “This is not a big deal for Vanguard,” Daniel Wiener,
editor of the New York-based newsletter Independent Adviser for
Vanguard Investors, said today in a telephone interview.  Bhagat’s departure was announced today in a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which also said
Mortimer J. Buckley has assumed the role of chief investment
officer. Buckley, known as Tim, joined Vanguard in 1991 as
assistant to founder  John Bogle  and replaces George Sauter, who
announced in June that he would would retire at the end of the
year.  Bhagat, who joined Vanguard four years ago, previously
worked at the investment units of Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
Inc. His replacement has not been announced, according to
Woerth.  Vanguard, based in  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania, manages $2
trillion in U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The
company attracted $141 billion in deposits last year, the most
in its 39-year history, Woerth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
