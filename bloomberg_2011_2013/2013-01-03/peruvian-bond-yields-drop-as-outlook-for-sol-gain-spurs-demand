Peru ’s bonds rose, pushing yields to
a record low, on speculation assets denominated in the sol will
gain from a further rally in the currency.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.88 percent at 2:36 p.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol climbed yesterday to its strongest level in 16
years as record foreign direct investment spurred inflows. The
central bank increased lenders’ reserve requirements for a fifth
time last year on Dec. 30 and bought $13.9 billion in the  spot
market  in 2012 to slow sol gains.  “Most of the short-term paper is already in the hands of
foreigners so increasingly they’re extending duration to gain
exposure to the sol,” said Walther Benavides, a trader at Banco
Continental SA in Lima. “Peru is very solid structurally, with
good fiscal numbers, net foreign reserves, public spending under
control and high foreign investment.”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5490 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close of trading, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency rose yesterday to the strongest level
since October 1996,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  Foreign direct investment in Peru probably rose 35 percent
to $11.1 billion last year from 2011, the central bank said in a
Dec. 14 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
