British Airways (IAG)  said bookings at its
holiday division jumped 75 percent on Christmas Day versus a
year earlier, spurred by a wet winter and pent up demand after
Britons spent the summer at home for the London Olympics.  Sales were also 58 percent higher on Dec. 26, BA said, with
top destinations including Las Vegas and Orlando, Florida, the
Caribbean islands of Barbados and  St. Lucia , and the Persian
Gulf sheikdom of Dubai, as well as city breaks in New York,
Rome, Venice, Barcelona and Berlin. Bookings may reach an annual
peak next week as more people return to work, the carrier said.  Britain endured its second-highest rainfall on record in
2012, with April and June posting all-time highs and Dec. 8 the
wettest single day, the  Met Office  said today. People meanwhile
skipped overseas holidays to watch Queen Elizabeth II’s diamond
jubilee celebrations and the  Olympic Games  in July and August.  “The festive season has shown a trend in early booking,”
BA, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, said
in a statement. “After the U.K.’s summer of sport in 2012, and
one of the wettest years on record, British Airways Holidays is
expecting Jan. 7 to be the biggest booking day.”  U.K. rainfall last year averaged 1,330.7 millimeters (52.4
inches), 6.6 millimeters short of the record set in 2000 for
data stretching back to 1910, the Met Office said in a
statement. 2012 was the wettest year ever for  England  and the
third-wettest for  Wales , according to the government forecaster.  IAG traded 0.1 percent higher at 193.10 pence as of 12:38
p.m. in London after advancing 4.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
