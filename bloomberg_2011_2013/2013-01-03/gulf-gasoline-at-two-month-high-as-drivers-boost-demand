Gasoline strengthened to the highest
level in  two months  on the U.S. Gulf Coast as drivers returned
to work after the holiday, increasing demand for the motor fuel.  “People are returning from vacation and the holiday season
and are beginning to get out and do business again,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LP in Houston, said by
telephone. “Things are naturally a little stronger.”  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline gained 2.63 cents to 4.5
cents below futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:57
p.m., the smallest gap since Oct. 15.  Conventional gasoline  to
be blended with ethanol, or CBOB, gained 3.75 cents to a
discount of 12 cents a gallon.  Demand for gasoline in the U.S. was 8.61 million barrels a
day in the week ended Dec. 21, the lowest level for this time of
year in at least 10 years, Energy Department data showed. Demand
for  distillate products  including diesel fuel and heating oil
was 3.71 million barrels.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the Gulf gained 1.25 cents to 2
cents below heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
