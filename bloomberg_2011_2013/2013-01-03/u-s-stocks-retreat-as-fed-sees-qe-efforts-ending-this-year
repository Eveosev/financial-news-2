U.S. stocks retreated, erasing
earlier gains, after minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last
meeting showed policy makers said they will probably end their
$85 billion monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent to
1,460.39 at 2:07 p.m. in New York after earlier gaining as much
as 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
