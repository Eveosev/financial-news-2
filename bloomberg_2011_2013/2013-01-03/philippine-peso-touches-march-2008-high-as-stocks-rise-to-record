The Philippine peso touched its
strongest level in almost five years as better-than-estimated
U.S. manufacturing data spurred risk-taking, bolstering demand
for emerging-market stocks.  Government bonds  due 2037 fell.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Composite  Index (PCOMP)  climbed 1.5
percent to a record high today after the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rallied 2.4 percent yesterday. The Institute for Supply
Management’s U.S. factory index rose to 50.7 in December,
compared with 50.5 forecast in a Bloomberg survey, a report
showed yesterday.  Standard & Poor’s  raised the Philippines’
credit-rating outlook from stable to positive on Dec. 20.  “The peso should be stronger given the Dow’s
performance,” said Leong Sook Mei, the Singapore-based regional
head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd. “Among Asian currencies, we still like the peso. There’s
the possibility of a credit upgrade either in late 2013 or
2014.”  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 40.808 per dollar as of
10:56 a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency reached 40.785 earlier, the strongest level since March
2008, and rallied 6.8 percent in 2012. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, was unchanged at 4.3 percent.  S&P cited improved governance and public finances when it
boosted its outlook on the Southeast Asian nation. The company
assigned the Philippines its top junk rating in July.  Inflation may have quickened to 3 percent in December, from
2.8 percent in November, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists before data due tomorrow.  The yield on the 6.125 percent government bonds due October
2037 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.58 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services. The rate dropped three basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
