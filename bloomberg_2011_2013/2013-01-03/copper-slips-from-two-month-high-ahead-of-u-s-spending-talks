Copper dropped from the highest
level since October as U.S. lawmakers face a renewed battle
next month over government borrowing in the largest economy,
hurting the outlook for demand. Tin and nickel also declined.  The contract for delivery in three months fell as much as
0.3 percent to $8,181 a metric ton before trading at $8,187 on
the  London  Metal Exchange at 11:22 a.m. in  Seoul . The price
rallied to $8,255 yesterday, the highest since Oct. 18. Futures
for delivery in March were little changed at $3.7310 a pound on
the Comex in New York. Markets in  China  are closed for a holiday.  A budget bill passed by Congress on Jan. 1 that boosted
metals prices, solves an immediate dilemma, averting income-tax
increases for most Americans while taxing top-earners more, yet
leaves unanswered a question of taming the federal debt. The
legislation will delay automatic spending cuts for two months.  “The $8,200-level seems to be a bit burdensome,” Lelia
Kim, a metals trader at Seoul-based Tong Yang Securities Inc.,
said by phone today. “It was a risk-on mode yesterday after the
budget bill passed. While the fiscal cliff was temporarily
avoided, spending cuts have to be discussed in two months.”  Copper advanced 4.4 percent in 2012 on the LME, the third
gain in four years, helped by forecasts for supply to lag behind
demand. Inventories tracked by the exchange declined 14 percent
in 2012, the third straight contraction. The LMEX  Index (LMEX) , which
tracks the six primary metals on the bourse, yesterday jumped to
3,581.7, the highest since Sept. 14.  In London, lead, aluminum and zinc were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
