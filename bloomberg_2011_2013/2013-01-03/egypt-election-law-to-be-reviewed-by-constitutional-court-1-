Egypt ’s parliamentary elections law
will be submitted to the constitutional court for review within
15 days of the endorsement of the new constitution, the state-
run news agency cited Prime Minister Hisham Qandil as saying.  MENA earlier cited the premier as saying the law would be
finished within 15 days from now. There was no immediate
explanation for the timeframe change. The country’s election
commission announced Dec. 25 that the constitution had been
passed in a referendum.  The completion of upcoming parliamentary elections will
spell the end of the country’s transitional period, the Middle
East News agency cited Qandil as saying.  Expatriate Egyptians will be able starting Jan. 8 to
register to vote in the parliamentary election, MENA said in a
separate statement. No date has been set for the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
