U.S. stocks erased early losses as
retailers from TJX Cos. to Ross Stores Inc. led gains after
reporting better-than-estimated monthly sales and a private
report showed faster-than-forecast jobs growth.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,462.55 at 11:13 a.m. in New York after slumping as much as 0.3
percent in the first half hour of trading.  The S&P 500 surged 4.3 percent over the previous two
sessions in its biggest advance in 13 months, bringing it within
four points of a five-year high reached in September, amid
optimism over the budget deal that avoids most of the more-than
$600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
