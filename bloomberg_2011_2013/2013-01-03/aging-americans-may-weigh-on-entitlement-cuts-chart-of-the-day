Congress missed a chance to pick
“low hanging fruit” in  Social Security  and other entitlement
programs as part of a fiscal overhaul, according to Steven C. Wieting, Citigroup Inc.’s managing director of economic and
market analysis.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows demographic shifts may hamper
future efforts to rein in budget deficits through entitlement
changes, as Wieting wrote in a report yesterday.  Growth in the number of Americans ages 65 to 74 is due to
peak this year and slow for most of the next quarter-century,
according to estimates by the Census Bureau. Within a decade,
the 75-and-up age bracket will increase at a faster pace.  “A package of measures to alter the course of underlying
health-care demand and supply seems greatly needed” to address
the issue, Wieting wrote. The New York-based economist added
that any agreement “seems far more complex and difficult to
achieve politically” than averting a so-called fiscal cliff.  At the moment, the formula for calculating Social Security
cost-of-living adjustments and the age of eligibility for the
Medicare program are obvious targets for budget negotiators, the
report said.  Republicans in Congress may pursue changes in these
provisions and others in return for an increase in the U.S. debt
ceiling of $16.4 trillion. The limit has to be raised as early
as mid-February to prevent a default on Treasury debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
