Algeria ’s Salafis, who adhere to an
ultraconservative interpretation of Islam, requested Interior
Ministry approval to form a political party, a spokesman said.  Rejecting the application could have serious consequences,
said Abdelfattah Hamadache Zeraoui, a Salafi spokesman, in a
telephone interview.  “If the regime doesn’t accept peaceful Salafis, then only
Salafis that believe in violence will emerge,” Zeraoui said.
“We represent a large portion of the population and will
operate peacefully within the law.”  Zeraoui is a former activist with the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS), a political party banned in Algeria in 1992 after
the military intervened and canceled elections FIS was poised
to win. It led to the Algerian civil war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
