Manchester City striker  Mario Balotelli  and manager  Roberto Mancini  were caught in a dispute
during practice by photographers today.  Photos published by the  Daily Telegraph  and other U.K.
newspapers showed Mancini pointing to, grabbing and pushing his
fellow Italian, before the pair were separated at City’s
Carrington training ground.  City spokesman Simon Heggie said the club wouldn’t be
commenting on the incident. The Manchester Evening News reported
the confrontation started when Mancini reacted to a late tackle
by Balotelli on winger  Scott Sinclair .  Balotelli, 22, followed Mancini from Inter Milan in 2010.
Since then the forward has been involved in a series of
incidents both on and off the field including throwing a dart at
a teammate, brawling with teammate Micah Richards and collecting
four red cards.  He hasn’t played since being substituted in City’s 3-2 home
defeat to league leader  Manchester United  on Dec. 9. He remains
a popular figure among City fans after playing the pass that
allowed Sergio Aguero to score an injury time goal in the final
game of last season that delivered the Blues their first league
title since 1968.  To contact the reporter on this story:
