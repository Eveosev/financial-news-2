Thailand ’s baht traded near a 10-
month high after U.S. lawmakers resolved a budget deadlock and
signs of a global economic rebound brightened the outlook for
the Southeast Asian nation’s exports.  The currency jumped 0.8 percent yesterday, the most since
Sept. 14, after the U.S. House approved legislation undoing tax
increases for more than 99 percent of households in the world’s
largest economy. Foreign funds  bought  a net 738 million baht
($24.3 million) of Thai stocks on Jan. 2, after $2.5 billion of
net inflows in 2012. Reports this week showed a pickup in
American manufacturing and  China ’s service industries.  “We see earnings upgrades as the economic outlook gets
better, supporting inflows,” said Thammarat Kittisiripat, an
economist in Bangkok at  TMB Bank Pcl. (TMB)  “The appreciation trend
is there but short-term risk” still remains as U.S. budget
discussions continue, he said.  The baht rose to 30.35 per dollar in Bangkok versus 30.36
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It climbed
as high as 30.29 earlier. The exchange rate may average 30 in
2013, Kittisiripat said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, rose to 4.03 percent,
the highest level since Dec. 17, from 3.68 percent yesterday.  China’s service industries grew in December at the fastest
pace in four months, official data showed today. The  Institute
for Supply Management ’s U.S. manufacturing index rose to 50.7
from a three-year low of 49.5 in November, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said yesterday. Fifty is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction.  Bonds Decline  Government bonds  fell for a second day on speculation
faster inflation reduces the odds of an interest-rate cut when
the Bank of Thailand reviews policy on Jan. 9. The central bank
held its one-day repurchase rate at 2.75 percent at the last
meeting on Nov. 28. Consumer  prices  in  Southeast Asia ’s second-
largest economy climbed 3.63 percent in December from a year
earlier, compared with 2.74 percent in November, the commerce
ministry said yesterday.  The yield on the 3.875 percent government bonds due June
2019 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.3
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched a
one-month low of 3.23 percent on Dec. 28.  “The rate-cut cycle is probably over for Thailand,” said
Eugene Leow, an economist in  Singapore  at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. “The economy has a few things going for it in 2013 and
inflation could become a problem from the third quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
