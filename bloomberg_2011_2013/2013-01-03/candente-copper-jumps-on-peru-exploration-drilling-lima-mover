Candente Copper Corp. (DNT) , a Canadian
mining exploration company with operations in Peru, rose the
most in four years after starting a delayed drilling project.  Candente surged 38 percent to 58 cents at 11:56 a.m. in
 Lima , the biggest intraday gain since November 2008. The stock
has jumped 53 percent in two days.  Candente said in a statement that it began exploratory
drilling at its Canariaco deposit in the southern Andes after
reaching an accord with local community members whose protests
over land rights had delayed the $1.5 billion project for a
year. The company’s stock slumped over the past two years during
the protests and after President Ollanta Humala increased a
mining windfall tax in 2011.  “Investors were relieved to get information on the project
after the community problems last year,”  Jorge Rodriguez , an
analyst at Kallpa Securities SAB, said in a phone interview from
Lima. “We’re seeing more investor confidence in the project,
which has a large amount of  mineral resources .”  The company expects to make new discoveries at the deposit,
Chief Executive Officer Joanne Freeze said in a Dec. 4
interview. Candente, which received a water permit from the
government last month, plans to drill a total 13,500 meters to
boost the project’s reserves, currently estimated at 7.5 billion
pounds of copper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
