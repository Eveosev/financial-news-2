Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., the
mobile-phone maker bought by  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in May, put its
headquarters complex in suburban  Chicago  on the market after
agreeing to relocate downtown.  Binswanger, a Philadelphia-based commercial-property
brokerage, was hired to sell the four-building, 1.1 million-
square-foot (102,000-square-meter) property in Libertyville,
 Illinois , according to a statement today on the real estate
firm’s  website .  Binswanger is marketing the 84-acre (33-hectare) campus to
companies in a number of industries, including finance and
education, according to the statement. The four connected
buildings have office, lab and distribution space as well as a
day-care center, full-service cafeteria and a gym. The asking
price hasn’t been set, said Laurie Goldstein, vice president of
marketing for the brokerage.  Motorola Mobility agreed in July to relocate to  Vornado
Realty Trust (VNO) ’s Merchandise Mart in Chicago. It will be the
building’s largest tenant, occupying almost 600,000 square feet
on the top four floors and rooftop, according to a July
statement from Motorola Mobility and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.  The 4.2 million-square-foot Merchandise Mart, completed in
1930, is the world’s biggest commercial building, according to
its  website . Motorola Mobility plans to move to its new offices
by mid-2013, it said when the deal was announced.  A telephone message left with Jennifer Erickson of Motorola
Mobility wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
