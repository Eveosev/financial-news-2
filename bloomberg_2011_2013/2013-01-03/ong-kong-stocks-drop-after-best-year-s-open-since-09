Hong Kong  stocks  extended gains after
the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  had its best opening to a year since 2009. A
measure of services companies gained after non-manufacturing
industries in  China  expanded at the fastest pace in four months.  China Communications Services Corp. (552) , a Beijing-based
telecommunications support firm, gained 1.7 percent after
touching its highest level since June 2011. Casinos extended
yesterday’s gains as more than 800,000 people are expected to
enter Macau over the three-day New Year holiday. Utility stocks
fell the most, with the Hang Seng Utilities Index sliding 1.4
percent, led by China Resources Power Holdings Co., a mainland
power producer, which declined 3.3 percent.  The Hang Seng Index gained 0.4 percent to 23,398.60 at the
close in Hong Kong after sliding 0.3 percent. The gauge
yesterday closed at a 19-month high. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in the city,
which jumped yesterday by the most in almost a year, rose 0.8
percent to 11,987.23 after falling 0.4 percent.  “There was a lot of profit-taking activity in the morning
today because yesterday there was a very big rally from the
fiscal cliff resolution,” said Lewis Wan, Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer at Pride Investments Group Ltd., which
oversees about $250 million. “But overall, the sentiment is
still very good.”  Central-Bank Easing  The Hang Seng Index rose 23 percent last year. The gauge
advanced  12 percent  from the end of September through yesterday
as signs of accelerating growth in China lured funds made
available by global central-bank easing. The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority has injected HK$107.19 billion ($13.8 billion) into
the financial system to maintain the local currency’s peg to the
 U.S. dollar  since Oct. 21, the first time it had to do so since
2009.  China Resources Power Holdings Co. (836)  dropped 3.3 percent to
HK$19.78 and Huaneng Power International Inc. slid 2.6 percent
to HK$7.20 after the power producers closed at their highest
levels since 2008 yesterday.  Services Industries  China’s services industries expanded at the fastest pace in
four months, adding to manufacturing gains that may help sustain
an economic rebound this year. The non-manufacturing purchasing
managers’ index was at 56.1 in December after a 55.6 reading the
previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics & Purchasing said in Beijing today. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  An index of services companies in the broader  Hang Seng
Composite Index (HSCISV)  advanced 1 percent. China Communications rose
1.7 percent to HK$4.70. Maoye International Holdings Ltd., a
Shenzhen-based department-store operator, increased 8.4 percent
to HK$1.80. China Wireless Technologies Ltd. gained 1.3 percent
to HK$2.32.  Casino stocks rose. Macau’s boundary with mainland China is
“bursting at the seams,” according to Union Gaming analyst
Grant Govertsen. Macau authorities expect more than 800,000
crossings from Jan. 1-3 during the New Year holiday.  Casinos  Wynn Macau Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed casino unit of Wynn
Resorts Ltd., gained 1.2 percent to HK$21.80. SJM Holdings Ltd.,
founded by tycoon  Stanley Ho , rose 1.4 percent to HK$18.54.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.3 percent today
after the gauge jumped 2.6 percent yesterday. Global equities
surged after the  House of Representatives  passed a bill in
 Washington  undoing income-tax increases for more than 99 percent
of households. President  Barack Obama  has signed the bill into
law.  Shares on the Hang Seng Index traded at 11.4 times average
estimated earnings compared with 13.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 11.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index climbed 1 percent to 23,449.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slid 3.4 percent to 15.45, indicating
traders expect a swing of 4.4 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
