PPR SA, (PP)  owner of the Gucci brand,
said it’s in talks to sell the children’s and family division of
its Redcats unit in a deal valued at 119 million euros ($156
million) as it disposes of retail assets to focus on luxury and
sports brands.  Exclusive negotiations are being held with buyout firm
Alpha Private Equity Fund 6, the Paris-based company said today
in a statement. The deal amount refers to the enterprise value
of the business, or the sum of its equity and debt minus cash.  PPR is selling Redcats in pieces, having sought a buyer for
the unit since 2010. The company last month agreed to sell its
U.S.-based OneStopPlus large-size clothing business to two
private-equity firms for an enterprise value of $525 million.  Redcats’ children’s and family division comprises the
Cyrillus and Vertbaudet brands. The transaction will be
completed in “the coming months,” subject to consultation with
employee representative bodies and to approval of the
competition authorities, PPR said in today’s statement.  PPR  shares  rose 1.6 percent to 145 euros in Paris trading.
The sale was announced after markets closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
