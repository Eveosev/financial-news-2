The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development will help finance a project of a Mediterranean
Shipping Co. unit to develop container handling at Lithuania’s
Klaipeda port on the  Baltic Sea  and turn it into a regional hub.  Loans from the EBRD and  Skandinasviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA) 
will each finance half of the 65 million-euro ($85 million)
expansion of Klaipedos Smelte LKAB, a Klaipeda-based subsidiary
of Terminal Investment Ltd., which is part of the MSC group, the
EBRD in  London  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Klaipeda is the northernmost ice-free port on the eastern
coast of the Baltic Sea. By enabling Klaipedos Smelte to handle
large deep-sea container ships, instead of the smaller feeder
vessels it now relies on, the project will cut costs for
transporting cargo to and within the Baltic region, Russia,
Belarus and Ukraine, according to the EBRD.  “The EBRD is supporting the transformation of Klaipeda
into a major regional transshipment hub and helping to reduce
shipping-related  carbon emissions ,” it said in the statement.  The project could as much as quadruple cargo handling at
Klaipeda by attracting large ships from the Americas and other
distant parts of the world, SEB’s Lithuanian unit said on its
website about the bank’s own 32.5 million-euro loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
