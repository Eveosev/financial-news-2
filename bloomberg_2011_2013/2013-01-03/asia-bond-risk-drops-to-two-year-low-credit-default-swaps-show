Chinese property companies are
marketing U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, ending a three-week
pause in issuance from the region. Debt risk in Asia fell to the
least in almost 20 months.  Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007) , based in  China ’s southern
Guangdong province, is offering 10-year notes to yield about
7.75 percent, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. (1638) , headquartered in Shenzhen, plans to
sell seven-year bonds at 10.25 percent, a person with knowledge
of that deal said, also asking not to be identified because the
terms aren’t set.  Hopson Development Holdings Ltd. (754)  meanwhile
hired banks to help arrange fixed-income investor update
meetings from Jan. 7, a person familiar with the matter said.  The real-estate companies would be the first issuers in
Asia to sell debt in the U.S. currency since Zoomlion Heavy
Industry Science and Technology Co. issued $600 million of 10-
year securities Dec. 13, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds
from non-payment in  Asia  outside of  Japan  has fallen to the
lowest level since April 2011, prices from credit-default swap
traders show.  “Sentiment is good so they want to take the chance when
the window is still open to raise funds,” said Louisa Lam, a
Hong Kong-based credit analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc. “We’ve
already seen a long pipeline building late last year, so this
month will be quite positive.”  Companies in Asia pay an average 3.86 percent to sell
dollar bonds, the least in data going back to 1996, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes as of Dec. 31. That
compares with 2.57 percent for companies globally, also the
least in 16 years.  New Projects  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 2 basis points to 102.5 basis
points as of 2:14 p.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. It last traded around those levels in
early April 2011, according to data provider CMA.  Country Garden’s most recent sale of bonds was in February
2011, when it raised $900 million via 11.125 percent notes due
February 2018, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company
plans to use the  proceeds  from this sale of notes to redeem its
yuan-denominated convertible bonds which mature in February, and
for existing and new property projects, according to a statement
to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Kaisa last sold notes in September when it raised $250
million via 12.875 percent securities due 2017, the data show.
The company intends to use more than 90 percent of the  proceeds 
from the sale it’s currently marketing to refinance a $120
million  term loan  and 2 billion  yuan  ($321 million) of U.S.
dollar-settled bonds due 2014, it said in a Jan. 2 Hong Kong
stock exchange statement.  Australian Bonds  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 7 basis points
to 114 basis points as of 5:15 p.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The measure is on course for its lowest
close in more than 17 months, according to CMA, which is owned
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Markets in Japan are closed for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
