OCI Co. (010060) ,  South Korea ’s biggest maker
of polysilicon used in solar panels, rallied the most in eight
months in Seoul stock trading after prices of the material rose.  OCI climbed 6.9 percent to 179,000 won at the close on the
Korea Exchange, its steepest gain since May 2. The stock is the
 best performer  on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index today.  Prices of polysilicon climbed to $15.38 per kilo, its first
weekly increase in 11 months, from $15.35, SK Securities Co.
said in a report today, citing data from research firm PV
Insights. The price had been falling due to oversupply.  “While the increase is marginal, I think it’s worth noting
because this could be an indicator of the future price
direction,” Sohn Ji Woo, an SK Securities analyst, wrote in the
report. “The recent spot price decline was irrational.”  Other solar-related companies also advanced, with Hanwha
Chemical Corp. rising 5.5 percent and Nexolon Co. jumping by the
daily limit of 15 percent.  Falling product prices led  LG Chem Ltd. (051910)  to delay a
polysilicon investment plan, while Hankook Silicon Co. filed for
receivership with the Seoul Central District Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
