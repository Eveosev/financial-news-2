Republicans, we know, are angry. But there are different kinds of anger: It can be productive, clarifying and aimed  cleanly at a deserving target. Or it can be, well, none of those things. The first was on display yesterday from Governor  Chris Christie  of  New Jersey . The second was exhibited by  House Speaker John Boehner. Let's take Boehner's first:  According to Politico , last Friday Boehner let Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  have it.  Reid  had accused Boehner of "running a ‘dictatorship’ in the House and  caring more about holding onto his gavel than striking a deal" to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. When Boehner ran  into Reid steps from the Oval Office, he said "Go  f--- yourself."  Boehner later bragged about the incident to fellow Republicans. This wasn't righteous anger so much as pique. Boehner is really mad at himself for  being led  by the nose by his most conservative members, who operate under  the delusion they  represent the entire country rather than their tiny gerrymandered districts. It’s awful to be afraid of those you  should be leading. Anger -- any real feeling, actually -- is risky for a politician.  but Christie  abided by the unwritten rules of the road. He was angry on  behalf of others  about the shelving of  bills that would  bring some $60 billion in disaster  relief for  Hurricane Sandy ’s  victims, venting for people who’ve got no voice,  ordinary folks beaten down by  tragedy and homeless to boot. He  avoided  the general in favor of the specific: “I called the speaker  four times last night  after 11:20 [the time the vote on the fiscal cliff ended]  and he didn’t take my  calls.” He named names: “There is only one group to  blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims,"  he said . "The House majority and their  speaker,  John Boehner .” He was vivid. What was  happening was  “disgraceful” as lawmakers “failed their most basic trust”  to care for others in  need. Instead, “our people were played last night as a pawn” by a speaker more  interested in “palace intrigue.” He followed another important rule and  shouldered some blame. “Last night my party was responsible for this.” Then  he tapped into the universal way to  land a blow, the parental “shame  on you”: We respond to disaster, he said, not  as partisans but as  “Americans, or at least we did until last night.” Christie   doesn’t always get it right. When he said “ none of your business ” in 2011 to a voter question about where his children went to school, it  was Boehner-type pique. In contrast, when he told his fellow  New Jerseyans  to “ get the hell off the beach ” before  Hurricane Irene  in 2011, he could have  been rehearsing for yesterday. Christie sidestepped the  personal. He didn’t accuse his party of hating the  Acela corridor or of  punishing him because he hugged President  Barack Obama  the week before  Election Day, although he could have -- both are true. Will he always be so restrained? Stay tuned. ( Margaret Carlson  is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  her on Twitter.) Read more breaking commentary from Bloomberg View at  the Ticker .
