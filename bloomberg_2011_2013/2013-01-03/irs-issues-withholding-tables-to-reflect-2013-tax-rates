The  Internal Revenue Service  released
new withholding tables to reflect the 2013 tax rates that
President  Barack Obama  signed into law yesterday.  For most workers, that will mean little change, because
Congress reinstated the marginal tax rates that were in place
for all except 0.7 percent of taxpayers -- those with annual
taxable income exceeding $400,000 for individuals and $450,000
for married couples.  In a statement today, the IRS instructed employers to make
the change as soon as possible and no later than Feb. 15.  The biggest difference for many taxpayers will come from
the expiration of the 2 percentage point cut in the  payroll tax .
A worker making $50,000 a year who is paid twice a month will
have $41.67 more withheld than in 2012.  The IRS hasnâ€™t made an announcement about the opening of
the 2013 tax filing season. The late legislative action may
cause a delay from the scheduled January start, because Congress
retroactively reinstated a provision that shielded 28 million
households from the alternative minimum tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
