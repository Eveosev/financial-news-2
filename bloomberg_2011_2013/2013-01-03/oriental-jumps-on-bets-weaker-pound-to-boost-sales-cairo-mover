Oriental Weavers Co. (ORWE) , which exports
most of its products to the U.S., rose to the highest level in
more than three months on bets the Egyptian pound’s depreciation
will boost revenue.  Shares of  Egypt ’s largest publicly-traded machine-made
carpet manufacturer and exporter rallied 3.5 percent to 24.2
pounds at the close in Cairo, the highest level since Sept. 30.
The stock, which gained 4.1 percent this week, helped push the
benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  up 1.8 percent to 5,734.39.  The Egyptian pound weakened to a record this week after the
central bank started selling dollars at daily auctions, in which
the regulator caps the amount each bank can buy to conserve
tumbling foreign reserves. Oriental Weavers may post a  21
percent increase  in 2012 profit to 316 million pounds ($49
million) as revenue grows, according to the median estimate of
three analysts on Bloomberg.  The company “is a net exporter and one of the stocks that
always benefits from the pound’s depreciation,” said Mohamed Radwan, head of international sales at Pharos Holding in Cairo.
“You’re going to find some appetite on names that reflect the
currency’s devaluation.”  The pound weakened 0.5 percent today to 6.4207 per dollar.
 Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC)  and  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, (ORTE) 
which derive most of their revenue away from their home market,
advanced 2.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
