Turkish  yields  rose the most in more
than a year after inflation slowed by less than analysts
expected in December.  Yields on benchmark two-year notes rose 17 basis points, or
0.17 percentage point, to 6.33 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
Istanbul, the highest level since Nov. 16 and the biggest
increase since Dec. 30, 2011. The lira lost 0.2 percent against
the dollar to 1.7812.  Inflation slowed to 6.2 percent, the statistics office in
Ankara said on its website today. The median estimate of six
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for 6 percent. Prices rose
0.4 percent in the month.  Turkey ’s central bank is targeting 5
percent inflation this year after missing its goal for the past
two years.  “Today’s inflation data disappointed a bit and we need to
look at forthcoming prints where inflationary pressures could be
on the rise again,” Cengiz Erguen, a director of local markets
trading at Commerzbank AG, said in e-mailed comments from
 London .  The central bank in Ankara cut its benchmark interest rate
to a record-low 5.5 percent on Dec. 18 after economic growth
decelerated to 1.6 percent in the third quarter, the slowest
pace since a 2009 recession. Governor Erdem Basci said Dec. 25
that inflation will be “very close” to its target of 5 percent
in 2012 after ending 2011 with 10.5 percent inflation.  “I expect the inflation rate to remain range-bound in most
of 2013 with some upside risks present coming from credit
expansion and fiscal measures,”  Tevfik Aksoy , chief economist
for central and eastern  Europe , the Middle East and  Africa  at
Morgan Stanley in London, said in e-mailed comments, adding he
was keeping his 2013 forecast unchanged at 6.3 percent.  Breakeven  The one-year breakeven rate, a gauge of investor inflation
expectations that shows the yield gap between fixed-rate bonds
and those indexed to consumer prices, advanced for a second day
to 5.99 percent.  The lira appreciated 6 percent last year, the third-largest
gain in emerging Europe after the Polish zloty and the Hungarian
forint. Yields on two-year benchmark lira bonds fell 483 basis
points in 2012, the biggest annual drop since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
