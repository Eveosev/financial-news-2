The pound declined against the dollar
as a report showed  house prices  fell last month, signaling the
U.K.â€™s economic recovery will be slow.  Sterling strengthened for a second day versus the euro. The
average cost of a home in Britain slipped 0.1 percent in
December, Nationwide Building Society said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median prediction of 11 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for prices to remain unchanged. From a year
earlier, values were down 1 percent, the Swindon, England-based
customer-owned lender said.  The pound lost 0.2 percent to $1.6229 at 8:40 a.m. London
time, after reaching $1.6381 yesterday, the strongest level
since Aug. 30, 2011. Against the euro, the pound gained 0.1
percent to 81.07 pence.  U.K. gilts were little changed, with the 10-year yield at
1.99 percent. Yields jumped 16 basis points yesterday.  Sterling has gained 1.9 percent in the past 12 months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.3 percent
and the dollar fell 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
