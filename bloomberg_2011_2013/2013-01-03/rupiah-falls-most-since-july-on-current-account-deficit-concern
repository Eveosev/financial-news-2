Indonesia’s rupiah fell by the most
in almost three weeks as analysts forecast the current-account
deficit will be bigger than the central bank forecast.
 Government bonds  gained, pushing the 10-year yield to the lowest
level since February.  The shortfall will be  2.9 percent  of gross domestic product
in the fourth quarter, Credit Suisse Group AG economist  Robert Prior-Wandesforde  wrote in a note yesterday. Barclays Plc
forecast 2.5 percent, Singapore-based economist  Prakriti Sofat 
said today. Bank Indonesia predicted a 2.3 percent gap on Dec.
11. November’s  trade  deficit was $478 million, after a revised
$1.88 billion in October, data showed yesterday.  “I am pessimistic about the rupiah, its weakening will
continue,” said Billie Fuliangsahar, the Jakarta-based treasury
director at PT Rabobank International Indonesia. “The  trade gap 
will remain until the middle of this year and continue to weigh
on the current account and the rupiah.”  The rupiah weakened 0.3 percent to 9,675 per dollar as of
3:34 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest decline since Dec. 17, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The rupiah was the
worst-performing currency last year among  Asia ’s 10 most-active
excluding the Japanese yen, declining 5.9 percent.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at 5.7
percent today.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.14
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. That is the lowest level since Feb. 9, when the
benchmark 10-year yield reached a record-low 5.05 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
