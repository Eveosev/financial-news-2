Canadian heavy crudes weakened amid
concern that increasing supply will overwhelm pipeline capacity
out of the oil-producing regions of western  Canada .  Western Canada Select, a heavy blend mainly produced from
oil-sands bitumen, declined $3 a barrel to $36 below U.S. West
 Texas  Intermediate, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc. Cold Lake, a heavy conventional blend, fell $3.50 a barrel
to a $39.50 discount.  Several pipelines carrying Canadian crude to the U.S. are
full, including parts of the Canada’s largest export system,
Enbridge Inc.’s 2.5 million barrel-a-day mainline.  Enbridge’s Lines 6A and 62 are overbooked by 10 percent
this month, and demand on Line 5 is 12 percent above capacity,
according to a company statement. Lines 6A and 62 can carry up
to 739,000 barrels a day, and Line 5 can ship as much as 491,200
barrels a day, according to the Enbridge website.  Suncor Energy Inc. said today oil sands production in
 Alberta  surged 23 percent in December from the previous month to
385,000 barrels a day.  A new heavy oil project,  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ’s 110,000-
barrel-a-day Kearl mine in Alberta, is expected to begin
production early this year, meaning more supply will have to
travel through limited pipeline space.  Canada exported 2.3 million barrels of oil a day during the
third quarter of 2012, up 4.5 percent from the same period a
year earlier, according to the  National Energy Board .  BP Whiting  BP Plc (BP)  also delayed until at least June the conversion of
its largest crude unit at the Whiting, Indiana,  refinery  to
heavy oil production, a person familiar with the matter told
Bloomberg News Dec. 14. The 225,000 barrel-a-day unit makes up
about 6 percent of Midwest refining capacity, its conversion is
expected to increase demand for heavy Canadian crude.  Syncrude, a synthetic light oil derived from bitumen,
weakened by $1 to a $1 premium to WTI, according to Net Energy
data, as an upgrader that produces the grade neared the end of
maintenance.  Work at  Nexen Inc. (NXY) ’s Long Lake upgrader in Alberta is
“wrapping up,” company spokeswoman Patti Lewis said in an e-
mail today. Long Lake produced about 34,000 barrels a day at the
end of October, according to the company’s third-quarter
earnings release.  WTI on the  spot market  in Midland, Texas, the
pricing point for Permian Basin crude, strengthened $3.50 to a
discount of $10.50 a barrel to the U.S. benchmark at 4:05 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  West Texas Sour crude in Midland, a light, high-sulfur
oil, narrowed its discount by $2.50 to $13.50 a barrel.  Along the  Gulf Coast , Light Louisiana Sweet was steady at
$18.75 a barrel over WTI in Cushing, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet
gained 5 cents to an $18.80 premium. Mars Blend slipped 10 cents
to a $13.80 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
