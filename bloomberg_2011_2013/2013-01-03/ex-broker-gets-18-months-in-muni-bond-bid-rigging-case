Adrian Scott-Jones, a former broker
for Tradition NA, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his
role in a municipal bond bid-rigging case.  Scott-Jones, of Morriston,  Florida , pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and wire fraud in 2010, agreeing to cooperate with a
U.S. investigation of auction-fixing in the market for
investments bought by states and local governments. He was
sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. in
Manhattan, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.  Scott-Jones pleaded guilty to conspiring with former
executives of  General Electric Co. (GE)  from as early as 1999 to
2006, the Justice Department said in the statement. He gave co-
conspirators information about competitors’ bids, an illegal
practice known as a “last look,” the government said.  “From soliciting intentionally losing bids for investment
agreements to paying out kickbacks to manipulate the competitive
bidding process, the conspirators went to great lengths to
defraud municipalities across the country,” Scott D. Hammond, a
U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, said in the statement.  Scott-Jones was also fined $12,500.  The investigation has resulted in convictions and guilty
pleas against 19 individuals and one company, the Justice
Department said. One person is awaiting trial.  The case is U.S. v. Scott-Jones, 1:10-cr-00794, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
