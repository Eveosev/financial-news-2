The Kansas City Chiefs are on the
verge of hiring Andy Reid as coach,  ESPN reports , citing
unidentified people in the National Football League familiar
with the situation.  Reid, 54, was fired by the Philadelphia Eagles on Dec. 31,
ending a 14-year run with the franchise that was the longest of
any active coach in the NFL. Reid went 130-93-1 in Philadelphia,
including a 4-12 record this season, while winning seven
division titles and making nine playoff appearances.  Kansas City fired Romeo Crennel after going 2-14 this
season, tied for the NFL’s worst record. The Chiefs have the No.
1 pick in April’s draft.  Reid interviewed with the Chiefs for nine hours yesterday
and agreed on most major contractual issues, ESPN said. Ted
Crews, a spokesman for the Chiefs, didn’t immediately reply to
an e-mail seeking comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
