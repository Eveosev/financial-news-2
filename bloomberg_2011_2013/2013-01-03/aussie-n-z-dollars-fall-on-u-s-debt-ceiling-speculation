The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell against their U.S. peer as concern U.S. lawmakers
will struggle to agree on raising the nation’s debt ceiling
overshadowed a bill passed to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  The so-called Aussie snapped a three-day increase against
the greenback as officials in the world’s biggest economy turned
their attention to a debate over raising the $16.4 trillion  debt
limit . The New Zealand currency declined as minutes of the
 Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed policy makers said they’ll
probably end their $85 billion monthly bond purchases sometime
in 2013.  “The modest pressure on risk assets like equities and
commodities is reflected in the FX space, with the risky majors
underperforming against the safe haven yen and dollar,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,
wrote yesterday in a note to clients. “The commodity
currencies, however, have held up well.”  Australia’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0466
yesterday in New York after earlier falling to its lowest level
since Dec. 21. It declined 0.5 percent to 91.33 yen.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, sank 0.7
percent to 82.81 U.S. cents. The kiwi decreased 0.9 percent to
72.24 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials declined
0.4 percent and crude-oil futures slipped 0.3 percent to $92.86
per barrel in New York. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.2 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 3.6 percent over the
past year, the second-biggest increase among the 10 developed-
nation currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, while the Aussie has lost 1 percent. The  U.S.
dollar  has fallen 2 percent and the yen has dropped 15 percent
to lead decliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
