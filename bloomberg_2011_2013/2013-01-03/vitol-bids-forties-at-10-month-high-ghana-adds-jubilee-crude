Vitol Group failed to buy a cargo of
North Sea Forties crude even as the company bid at the highest
differential in almost 10 months.  Ghana will ship one more cargo of Jubilee crude in January,
bringing total exports for this month to four, a revised loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  North Sea  Vitol failed to find a seller for a Forties lot loading
from Jan. 21 to Jan. 26 at $1.35 a barrel more than Dated Brent,
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That’s the highest unsuccessful bid since
March 7, when the same company sought to buy at $1.45 more than
the benchmark.  The Geneva-based trader bought a cargo yesterday at a
premium of 95 cents to Dated Brent.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose to 98 cents more than Dated Brent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 57 cent premium
in the previous session and is the most since March 15.  Brent for February settlement traded at $112.34 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $112.39 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $111.07, a discount of $1.27 to February.  Loading programs for  North Sea  Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk
crudes will probably be released tomorrow, followed by Forties
on Jan. 7, according to two people with knowledge of the
schedules who asked not to be identified because the information
is confidential.  Brent futures and options average daily volume climbed 16.5
percent in 2012 to 620,373 lots, ICE said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude,
according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus 95 cents, 12 cents narrower than yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe,
the  discount  decreased to $1.31 from $1.42 in the previous
session, the data showed.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $2.44 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ghana will ship the additional cargo from Jan. 4 to Jan. 5,
increasing daily exports to 122,581 barrels a day this month,
the revised schedule showed. That’s up from 91,935 barrels a day
in December or three cargoes.  Equatorial Guinea  is set to increase exports of Ceiba blend
in February to three cargoes while the Republic of Congo will
keep Djeno grade sales unchanged at five lots, two loading
programs obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Equatorial Guinea plans to ship three consignments of 1
million barrels each of Ceiba next month, one more than in
January. The five Djeno shipments are of 920,000 barrels each,
the same as this month, according to the schedules.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. is seeking between
650,000 barrels to 1 million barrels of low-sulfur crude,
according to a document sent to potential buyers.  The company is seeking a cargo for loading March 1 to March
15, for discharge at New Mangalore port on  India ’s west coast,
the document showed. Offers close at 9:30 a.m. India time on
Jan. 9 and must be valid until 8 p.m. on Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
