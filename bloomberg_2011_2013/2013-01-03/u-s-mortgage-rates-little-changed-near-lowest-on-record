U.S. mortgage rates were little
changed, keeping borrowing costs close to the record lows that
have helped spur demand for homes.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.34
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.35 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate slipped to 2.64 percent from 2.65 percent.  Low  interest rates  have bolstered the housing market by
making real estate more affordable. Contracts to buy previously
owned U.S. homes rose in November to the highest level since
April 2010, the National Association of Realtors said last week.  “Interest rates are likely to stay low throughout 2013,”
 Brad Hunter , chief economist at Metrostudy, a real estate
research company, said yesterday in a telephone interview from
 Palm Beach Gardens , Florida. “That will continue to offer
people a chance to buy a home and lock in a low rate, and I
think that continues to be a stimulus for the housing market.”  Purchases of  new homes  rose 4.4 percent in November from
the previous month to a 377,000 pace, the most since April 2010,
the Commerce Department reported last week.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
