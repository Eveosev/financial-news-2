Arabica coffee climbed in New York to
the highest level in more than three weeks as investors bought
the futures on speculation prices may have bottomed. Sugar
retreated.  The beans traded on ICE futures U.S. gained 3.9 percent
yesterday after a vote in the  House of Representatives  broke a
year-long impasse over how to avert $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts that threatened to send the economy
back into recession. Speculators are now closing out bets on
lower prices after arabica fell the most in 12 years and was the
worst performing commodity in the Standard & Poor’s index of 24
raw materials last year, according to Citigroup Inc.  “Coffee, 2012’s biggest loser, started out 2013 with a
noticeable pop as the strength from the fiscal cliff was seen
lifting values and generating plenty of short covering,”
Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup in  Chicago ,
wrote in a report e-mailed yesterday. Another day of gains today
“would confirm ideas of bottoming,” he said.  Arabica coffee for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$1.508 a pound by 5:39 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The

coffee for March delivery advanced 1 percent to $1,962 a metric

short, or betting on falling prices, by 30,918 contracts in the
6-day period ended Dec. 24, data from the Washington-based U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Bets on falling arabica coffee prices reached a record
35,174 contracts in the week ended Nov. 16.  Off Guard  “Sooner or later the folly that is the current record
short spec fund positions will be reversed, exposing the
underbelly of a coffee market that remains in a long-term
structural deficit,”  Shawn Hackett , the president of Hackett
Financial Advisors Inc. in  Boynton Beach ,  Florida , said in a
report e-mailed yesterday. “When coffee makes the turn back up,
it will be explosive in nature and catch everyone off guard.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to 19.61
cents a pound in New York. White sugar for March delivery slid
