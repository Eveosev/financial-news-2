Asia’s naphtha crack spread rose for
the first time in four days, signaling increased profit for
refiners. Vitol Group sold gasoline and fuel oil in  Singapore ,
the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $1.19 to $95.84 a metric ton at 5:21 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread
is a measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and
gasoline feedstock.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification naphtha for first-half March delivery to Itochu
Corp. at $962 a ton, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders who monitored the Platts window. The Swiss trader sold
naphtha in Singapore for a fourth day.  PetroChina Co. bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline, the survey showed. Total SA sold one shipment for Jan.
18 to Jan. 22 loading at $120.60 a barrel and Gunvor Group Ltd.
sold for Jan. 23 to Jan. 27 at $120.80 a barrel.  Vitol sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON grade, loading Jan. 20
to Jan. 24, to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $125.60 a barrel,
according to the survey.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 5
cents to $19.35 a barrel at 2:16 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference,
also known as the  crack spread , narrowed for the third time in
four days.  Jet fuel  was unchanged after declining to a discount of 15
cents a barrel to gasoil, PVM said. A negative  regrade  shows it
is unprofitable to make aviation fuel over diesel.  Fuel Oil  BP Plc sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of 180-centistoke high-
sulfur fuel oil to Hin Leong Trading Pte at a discount of $3.75
a ton to benchmark quotes, according to the survey. The
shipments are for Jan. 18 to Jan. 22 loading.  Vitol sold 40,000 tons of 380-centistoke grade to a unit of
SK Innovation Co. at parity to average January prices, the
survey showed. The cargo is for Jan. 20 to Jan. 24 loading.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 4 cents to
$7.71 a barrel at 2:16 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This crack spread narrowed for a second day, indicating reduced
losses for refiners producing residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged for a third day at $8.75 a ton, PVM data
showed. This  viscosity spread  has been at the narrowest since
Nov. 8, 2011, meaning bunker, or marine fuel, decreased less
than supplies used in power stations.  Refinery News  Asian ethylene producers will shut fewer crackers for
maintenance in the first half of 2013 to gain from a forecast
decline in Middle East exports of the plastics feedstock. About
1.935 million tons a year of ethylene capacity is scheduled to
close over the first six months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. restarted a crude distillation unit
at its Kochi refinery late last month after completing planned
maintenance work, said two company officials who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The 4.5
million ton-a-year unit at the southern Indian plant was closed
for about a month.  Tenders  CPC Corp. offered to sell as much as 680,000 barrels of
gasoil and 150,000 barrels of kerosene for January and February
loading from Kaohsiung, according to a statement on its website.  Bharat Petroleum offered to sell a total of 82,000 tons of
paraffinic naphtha for January loading from Haldia and February
loading from Mumbai, said two traders who asked not to be named
because the information is confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
