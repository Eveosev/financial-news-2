German  government bonds  stayed little
changed after a report showed unemployment in the nation
increased less than economists forecast in December.  The 10-year bund yield was at 1.44 percent as of 9:20 a.m.
London time.  The number of people out of work rose a seasonally adjusted
3,000 to 2.942 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency
said today. Economists predicted an increase of 10,000, the
median of 19 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The
adjusted jobless rate held steady at 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
