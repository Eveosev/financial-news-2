Roll Call delivers the  following report  on the next campaign: The Capitol Hill newspaper quotes an anonymous party strategist: This is no doubt an appealing notion to campaign strategists looking for a quick fix to campaign setbacks. But the "character-type" problems that brought down high-profile Republican candidates last year were not the product of Democratic opposition research. They were the product of views that were abhorrent to a large number of voters. Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin was brought down by his own  repugnant remarks  on rape. Ditto for Senate candidate  Richard Mourdock  in  Indiana . Florida Representative Allen West proved more of a  demagogue  than a slim majority of his district's voters were willing to tolerate.  The "47 percent" video that troubled  Mitt Romney 's campaign wasn't produced by Democratic researchers (though much of the research on Bain & Co. was). Negative research is standard operating procedure in campaigns. But it had little or nothing to do with the defeats of these and other candidates. Perhaps when and if Senator Heitkamp runs for re-election, a crack opposition researcher will bring her campaign to its knees with some scandalous nugget. But don't count on it. It's far more likely that her electoral success or failure will stem from her public votes, statements and acts.  That's probably the realm where Republicans should be focusing their energies, as well.
