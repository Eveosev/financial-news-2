The dollar strengthened the most in
seven weeks against the yen on speculation improving U.S.
employment data will encourage policy makers to bring an early
end to asset purchases.  The U.S. currency strengthened through $1.30 per euro for
the first time in three weeks after Federal Reserve minutes
showed policy makers may end their $85 billion monthly bond
purchases this year, halting a program that tends to debase the
greenback. The yen dropped beyond 88 per dollar for the first
time since July 2010 amid speculation the Bank of  Japan  will
boost  money supply  to end deflation.  Australia ’s dollar fell for
a second day after a gauge of the nation’s services declined.  “If payrolls are strong there is an increased potential
that the Fed could finish its bond-buying plan earlier,” said
Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “That is in tune with the markets
interpretation of the minutes released yesterday. The dollar is
getting a bit of a boost from that.”  The dollar jumped 1.2 percent to 88.30 yen at 7:06 a.m. in
 New York  after rising as much as 1.3 percent, the biggest
increase since Nov. 15. It reached 88.33 yen, the strongest
since July 15, 2010. The U.S. currency gained 0.3 percent to
$1.3007 per euro after appreciating to $1.2998, the most since
Dec. 12. The yen fell 0.9 percent to 114.82 per euro.  U.S. payrolls rose by 153,000 in December after increasing
by 146,000 the previous month, according to the median forecast
of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Labor
Department report at 8:30 a.m. New York time. The  unemployment
rate  held at 7.7 percent, a separate survey showed.  Fed Minutes  A few members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
“ongoing asset purchases would likely be warranted until about
the end of 2013,” minutes of the Dec. 11-12 meeting released
yesterday showed. “Several others thought that it would
probably be appropriate to slow or to stop purchases well before
the end of 2013.”  “The Fed’s minutes are more hawkish than I thought they’d
be,” said Yasuhiro Kaizaki, vice president of global markets in
New York at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. “Expectations are
rising for better U.S. job numbers, which are supportive for the
dollar.”  Treasuries fell for a fourth day today, with the benchmark
 10-year yield  climbing to the highest since May, as signs the
world’s biggest economy is gaining momentum damped demand for
the safest assets.  The dollar has gained 0.6 percent over the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The yen slid 7.4 percent and the
euro lost 0.1 percent.  Weekly Decline  The yen headed for an eighth week of losses against the
dollar, tumbling 2.7 percent since Dec. 28. Even so, it is still
about 15 percent above its 10-year average of 101.22 per dollar.  Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on
Jan. 1 the most urgent issue for his country was to break out of
currency appreciation and deflation. “Bold” monetary policy is
one of the three prongs of his economic measures, he said.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will hold its first policy meeting this
year on Jan. 21-22 after expanding its asset-purchase program by
10 trillion yen at its previous gathering on Dec. 20.  “We’ve probably done the most of this move in the dollar-
yen,” Richard Yetsenga, head of global markets research at
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Sydney, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “There are some changes
domestically in Japan but I think it’s still an open question
about whether they will be significant enough to really change
the trajectory of Japanese monetary policy.”  Aussie Declines  The so-called Aussie weakened after service-industry
indexes for Australia and  China  both worsened in December.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  and the Australian Industry
Group said their gauge for the nation’s  services  decreased to
43.2 in December from 47.1 the previous month. A purchasing
managers’ index of Chinese non-manufacturing industries compiled
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to 51.7 from
52.1. Readings below 50 signal contraction. China is Australia’s
largest trading partner.  “The Aussie is looking a bit overvalued,” said Masashi Murata, a currency strategist in  Tokyo  at Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co. “The risk scenario for the Aussie is for the
recovery in the Chinese economy to halt, and Australia’s
domestic demand to deteriorate.”  The Australian dollar dropped 0.5 percent to $1.0412 after
sliding 0.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
