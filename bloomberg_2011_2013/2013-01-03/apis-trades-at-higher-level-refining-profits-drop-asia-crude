Malaysia’s flagship Tapis crude for
February loading sold at higher premiums than January supplies.  Petroliam Nasional Bhd., known as Petronas, sold 300,000
barrels of Tapis loading in mid-February at a premium of $5.60
to $5.70 a barrel to Brent, said two people who participate in
the market who asked not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media.  The state-owned Malaysian oil company last month sold a
January cargo at a premium of $4.90 to $5 a barrel, two people
said Nov. 30.  The company also sold 300,000 barrels of Labuan for late-
February at about $7.50 a barrel above Brent, as well as 400,000
barrels each of Bunga Orkid and Bunga Kekwa, for the same month,
at premiums of about $5.20 and $5.35 a barrel, respectively,
according to three people who participate in the market.  Asia-Pacific benchmark  refining margins , or the profit from
processing Dubai crude into fuels such as diesel and gasoline
priced in the regional oil-trading hub of Singapore, averaged
$3.36 a barrel during the last five days, down for a third day
to the lowest in almost three weeks, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 30-day average was $2.80.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL) ,  India ’s second-biggest state
refiner, restarted a crude distillation unit at its Kochi plant
late last month after completing planned maintenance work,
according to two company officials.  The 4.5 million metric-ton-a-year unit at the southern
Indian plant was closed for about a month, said the officials,
asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The  refinery ’s other crude unit operated normally
during the work, they said.  Minas OSP  Indonesia  set the official selling price of its Minas crude
for December at $109.01 a barrel, according to a document from
the country’s Directorate General of Oil and Gas, at the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, obtained by Bloomberg
News.  That sets the Southeast Asian nation’s flagship grade 84
cents, or 0.7 percent, higher than November’s level. Cinta crude
for December increased to $107.92 a barrel, while Duri climbed
to $105.03.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, issued a
tender to buy crude for loading in March, according to a
document obtained by Bloomberg News. Offers are due Jan. 8.  Mideast Crude  The February Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European crude’s premium to Middle East oil, advanced 37
cents to $5.52 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 8, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. The
March EFS added 85 cents to $5.18.  Abu Dhabi’s Murban and Upper Zakum were unchanged at
discounts of 50 cents and 5 cents a barrel, respectively, to
their official selling prices, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Qatar Land remained at 60 cents below its OSP while
Qatar Marine was at a 13 cent premium.  Oman futures for March delivery settled 12 cents higher at
$107.62 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.  No Dubai partial cargoes were traded today, according to a
survey of people who monitor the Platts pricing window.  To contact the reporter on this story:
