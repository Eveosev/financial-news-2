Soybeans fell to a six-week low in
Chicago and corn declined for a second day as prospects improved
for crops in  South America .  Brazil’s soybean harvest may reach a record 83 million
metric tons in the year from Feb. 1, allowing the country’s
exports to rise, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign
Agricultural Service  said yesterday. Soybean and corn areas from
the states of  Rio Grande  do Sul to Mato Grosso do Sul will have
scattered showers and milder temperatures in the next 10 days,
and planting conditions in Argentina will be favorable until at
least tomorrow, Telvent DTN said today.  “Improved growing conditions in South America are putting
particular pressure on prices,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said today in an e-mailed report.
“The dry weather in Argentina is forecast to continue until
mid-January and is creating perfect conditions for the remaining
planting. Heavy rainfall and flooding had previously fueled
fears of another poor harvest.”  Soybeans for delivery in March dropped 1 percent to $13.785
a bushel at 7:06 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The oilseed
touched $13.725, the lowest price for a most-active contract
since Nov. 16. Corn for delivery in March slid 0.7 percent to
$6.8625 a bushel.  Farmers in Argentina have sown 80 percent of the estimated
soybean area and 75 percent of the corn area, the Buenos Aires
Cereals Exchange said Dec. 27. The country is the world’s third-
largest soybean exporter, after  Brazil  and the U.S.  Wheat for delivery in March fell 0.1 percent to $7.5425 a
bushel, erasing an increase of as much as 0.8 percent. The grain
reached $7.4975, the lowest level for a most-active contract
since June 29. In Paris, milling wheat for delivery in March
rose 0.1 percent to 246.50 euros ($322.89) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
