Warmer than normal weather in the
eastern U.S. through mid-January probably will cut demand for
natural gas and heating oil.  The high temperature in  New York City  may reach 58 degrees
Fahrenheit (14 Celsius) on Jan. 12, according to MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Philadelphia may have a high
of 59 and Washington may reach 63 on the same day.  The period from November to March is when the most fuel is
used for heating in the U.S.; the higher temperatures have sent
natural gas prices lower for the third day in  New
York . Prices dropped to $3.05 in electronic trading on Jan. 1,
the least since Sept. 28, before rebounding.  “You are going to have really suppressed heating demand in
the big cities,” said Travis Hartman, MDA’s energy weather
manager and meteorologist. “What we have seen in December and
now in January doesn’t spell too much good for the heating
season of 2012-2013.”  Average temperatures should be eight to 14 degrees above
normal across the entire eastern part of the country from Jan. 8
to Jan. 12,  MDA said . Temperatures will remain 5 to 7 degrees
above normal from Jan. 13 to Jan. 17, MDA said.  Frigid air will dominate the western U.S. and  Canada  from
Jan. 13 to Jan. 17 and remain there, pinned by larger weather
patterns, MDA forecast.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Jan. 9 is
about 33 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 29 in Boston; 24 in
Chicago; 32 in St. Louis; 53 in Houston; 19 in Calgary,  Alberta ;
42 in  Seattle ; and 55 in  Burbank , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
