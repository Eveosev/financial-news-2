Kazakhstan has been unable to sell
its shares in  AO Nurbank (NRBN) , the country’s 14th-biggest lender by
assets, through the stock exchange in Almaty.  The government planned to sell 25,625 preferred shares from
Aug. 20 to Dec. 30 and raise 289.6 million tenge ($1.9 million),
according to a Kazakhstan Stock Exchange  statement  published on
its website today.  “No orders have been submitted for purchasing” of the
state’s stake, and the government cut the price to 11,300 tenge
a share from 15,500 tenge, the bourse said.  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s oldest daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva, and her son Nurali Aliyev ceded a controlling
interest in Nurbank, as Sofya Sarsenova, a professor at the
Kazakh sports and tourism academy, got the majority in May 2010.
Almaty-based Nurbank’s assets shrank 22 percent and cash it sets
aside against bad loans almost quadrupled since the sale through
November, according to the latest data available on the central
bank’s financial oversight committee website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
