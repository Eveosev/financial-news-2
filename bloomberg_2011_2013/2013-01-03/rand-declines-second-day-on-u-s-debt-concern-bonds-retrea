The rand declined for a second day as
concern U.S. lawmakers won’t agree to raise the debt ceiling for
the world’s biggest economy sapped demand for riskier, emerging-
market assets.  South Africa’s currency weakened 1.1 percent to 8.5767 per
dollar as of 3:38 p.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark 10.5
percent bonds due December 2026 rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.31 percent.  Bonds gained for the first time in six days yesterday after
a U.S. budget deal that averted automatic tax increases and
spending cuts. The dollar advanced against most of its 16 major
counterparts today as officials turned their attention to a
debate over raising the $16.4 trillion debt limit. An increase
will be needed as early as mid-February, according to the U.S.
Congressional Budget Office.  “The fiscal challenges still exist; they have not been
resolved,”  George Glynos , a Johannesburg-based analyst at ETM
Analytics, and colleagues wrote in e-mailed comments. “Risk
assets will start to once again price in the uncertainty.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index dropped for the first time
in three days as the prices of metals including copper and
nickel declined. Metals and other commodities account for 45
percent of South Africa’s exports, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
