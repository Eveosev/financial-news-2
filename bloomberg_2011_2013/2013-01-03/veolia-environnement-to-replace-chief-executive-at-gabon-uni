Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , Europe’s
biggest water company by market value, said Francois Ombanda,
chief executive officer of its Societe d’Energie et d’Eau du
Gabon unit, is being replaced.  The Gabonese national will be replaced on Feb. 1 by Deputy
Director General Christian Lefaix of  France , the water utility
said in a statement handed to reporters today in Gabon’s
capital, Libreville.  The decision was taken by the board on Dec. 21 in Paris,

joined the company known as SEEG, Gabon’s water and electricity
monopoly, in 1978, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
