cliff,” Jane Coffey, who manages $19 billion as head of U.K.
equities at Royal  London  Asset Management Ltd., said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “We still have to get through
March. We have to look at the spending cuts they are going to
put in this package.”  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  rallied 2 percent yesterday after U.S.
lawmakers passed a budget bill that avoided most scheduled tax
increases. The so-called fiscal cliff of sweeping spending cuts
and revenue raising had threatened to push the world’s largest
economy into a recession.  Budget Deal  The U.S. House of Representatives approved the legislation
on Jan. 1, delaying automatic spending reductions by two months.

trillion debt ceiling to force President  Barack Obama  to accept
cuts to entitlement programs.  Moody’s Investors Service said the budget agreement won’t
reduce the deficit enough to avoid a sovereign-rating downgrade.  The ratio of government debt to gross domestic product will
probably peak at about 80 percent in 2014 and stay at that level
for the rest of the decade, New York-based Moody’s said
yesterday. The ratings company has assigned its top Aaa ranking

this year,” Royal London’s Coffey said in an interview with
 Mark Barton . “Valuations aren’t stretched.”  The Stoxx 600 is trading at 11.9 times estimated earnings,
