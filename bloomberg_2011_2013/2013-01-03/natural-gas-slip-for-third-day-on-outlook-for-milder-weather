Natural gas futures declined to a
three-month low in New York on forecasts of milder weather that
would cut demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped 1.1 percent after MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted above-normal temperatures in
the eastern half of the U.S. from Jan. 8 through Jan. 12. The
low in  Chicago  on Jan. 10 may be 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2
Celsius), 10 higher than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania .  “The forecasts are starting to warm up quite a bit,” said
Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “We aren’t really seeing the type of cold weather
you’d expect for this time of year.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 3.5 cents to $3.198
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Sept. 26. The
futures are up 6.8 percent from a year ago. Trading volume was
214,363 at 2:39 p.m., down 27 percent from the 100-day average.  Gas slid to $3.05 in yesterday’s session, the lowest
intraday price since Sept. 28, before rebounding. The futures
have tumbled 19 percent since rising to a one-year intraday high
of $3.933 on Nov. 23.  February $3.60 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.7 cent lower at 1.8 cents on
volume of 919 contracts as of 2:42 p.m. Calls accounted for 56
percent of options volume.  Last year will probably overtake 1998 to become the warmest
year on record in the U.S., the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  said in a monthly climate report.  Record Year  The first 11 months were the warmest start to any year in
the contiguous states since the nation began keeping records in
1895, NOAA’s  Climatic Data Center  said Dec. 6.  U.S.  gas inventories  dropped by 130 billion cubic feet in
the seven days ended Dec. 28, according to the median of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
decline for the period is 111 billion, Energy Department data
show. Last year, supplies fell by 77 billion during that week.
The department’s weekly storage report is scheduled to be
released tomorrow.  Stockpiles totaled 3.652 trillion cubic feet in the week
ended Dec. 21, a record for that time of the year, the
department said last week. Supplies were 12.8 percent above the
five-year average for the seven-day period, up from 4.6 percent
at the end of November. The  surplus  had risen to 61 percent at
the end of March.  Record Stockpiles  Inventory levels reached an all-time high of 3.929 trillion
cubic feet during the week ended Nov. 2.  Natural gas may gain more than 20 percent to average $3.70
per million Btu this year, Ric Deverell, head of commodities
research at Credit Suisse in  London , said in a note to clients
today.  “We still hold the view that prices generally improve
through 2013 as the U.S. storage surplus shrinks further and
production begins to fall,” Deverell said.  U.S. gas output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59
billion a day, the department said Dec. 11 in its monthly  Short-
Term Energy Outlook .  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $3.68 per million Btu this year, according to the
report from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first nine months of last year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
