California  carbon emission allowances
for December advanced 6.6 percent to the highest in more than
three months.  The futures rose $1 to $16.10 a metric ton yesterday, the
highest settlement since Sept. 10, according to data e-mailed by
 CME Group Inc.   The stateâ€™s cap-and-trade market started on Jan. 1.
California, which adopted an emissions-trading program after
efforts to pass a national plan failed, has hailed its effort as
a model for the rest of the world, even as carbon prices in the
U.S. Northeast and  Europe  declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
