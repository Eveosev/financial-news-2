Dolphin Capital Investors Ltd. (DCI) , a
developer of holiday and golfing resorts in southeast  Europe ,
the Caribbean and central America, rose the most in 11 weeks
after Panmure Gordon said the shares may double in 2013.  The  shares  gained 4.7 percent to 27.6 pence at 11 a.m., the
biggest intraday gain since Oct. 16 and the highest price since
Nov. 15. The stock has risen 49 percent over the past six
months. It was the second-best performer in the AIM 100 Index.  “The shares continue to trade on an anomalous 71 percent
discount to net asset value” even after the company reported
“significant developments” across its portfolio,  Mark Hughes ,
an analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co. said in a note to clients
today. “Dolphin Capital is our key small cap pick for 2013.”
Hughes has a  buy rating  on the stock.  Dolphin raised 50 million euros ($65.8 million) in a share
sale in October. One of the company’s Porto Heli projects in the
Greek Peloponnese opened to guests last month, the company said,
while the first golf course at its Venus Rock resort in Cyprus
is due to open in September.  Dolphin is in a much stronger financial position than many
other real estate companies that trade at less than the value of
their assets with its debts representing 16 percent of the value
of its properties and other assets, Hughes said.  “This level of discount represents a significant
anomaly,” he said. “We expect the discount to narrow
significantly over the coming months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
