Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  obtained
$270 million of protection with bonds designed to guard
Switzerland’s biggest insurer from losses linked to earthquakes
in  North America .  The firm bought protection from Lakeside Re III Ltd., a
Bermuda-based special purpose reinsurance company that issued
the so-called catastrophe bonds due in three years in an
oversubscribed offering, Zurich said today in a statement on its
 website . The securities pay investors 800 basis points more than
the rate on quarterly Treasury bills, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The bonds replace $225 million of debt that matures on Jan.
8 and paid a spread of 775 basis points, or 7.75 percentage
points, according to Munich Re, which helped structure the
transaction. The new bonds, which are also linked to damage from
tsunamis and volcanic eruptions sparked by earthquakes, cover
losses in areas from Canada’s British Columbia province to
Arkansas,  Standard & Poor’s  said in a Dec. 28 report that rated
the securities B+(sf).  “Investors continue to appreciate the diversifying effect
from cat bonds that are virtually uncorrelated with trends on
the capital markets,” Thomas Blunck of  Munich Re  said today in
a statement.  Cat bonds have  returned  more than 10 percent in three out
of the past four years, including a 10.5 percent gain in 2012,
according to the Swiss Re Cat Bond Total Return Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
