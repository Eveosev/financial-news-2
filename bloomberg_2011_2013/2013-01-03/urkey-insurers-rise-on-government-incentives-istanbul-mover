Turkish  insurance companies  advanced
for a second day in Istanbul as government incentives to
encourage savings through private pension plans came into effect
with the start of 2013.  Anadolu Hayat Emeklilik AS (ANHYT)  led gains, surging 12 percent to
4.85 liras at the close, its biggest advance since November 2008
and the highest level since Aug. 3.  Yapi Kredi Sigorta AS (YKSGR) , which
is being split into life and non-life units for sale by parent
Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, climbed 2.1 percent to 16.80 liras.  “Anadolu Hayat and Yapi Kredi Sigorta are companies that
will benefit most from the incentives,” Isik Okte, a strategist
at Istanbul-based Halk Yatirim Menkul Degerler, said in e-mailed
comments today. “Anadolu Hayat will see more short-term
interest from foreign funds that believe in the private pensions
story in Turkey.”  The government will match 25 percent of private pension
contributions up to the minimum wage level to encourage more
participation, according to the regulations. The effort could
add 500,000 new participants to the system this year, Mehmet
Bostan, chairman of the Pension Monitoring Center, said at a
news conference in Istanbul yesterday.  Turkey ’s pensions system
has 3.1 million participants with 20.1 billion liras ($11.3
million) of funds, according to the center’s website.  Haircuts  While analysts predict as much as 30 percent annual asset
growth in private pensions, benefits to pension companies may be
pared by limits to fees and commissions included in the new
legislation, according to Kutlug Doganay, an analyst at
Istanbul-based Is Yatirim.  The government cut the maximum fee pension fund managers
can charge to 2 percent from 8 percent. Fund operation fees were
reduced to as low as 1.09 percent from 3.65 percent. The changes
were effective as of Jan. 1.  “With the recent haircuts in fee rates, pensions fund
managers will suffer declines in revenues,” Doganay said in a
phone interview on Dec. 28. The average period to start
profiting from contributions will rise to between seven and
eight years, compared with about five before the cuts, he said.  The seven-member Istanbul Stock Exchange Insurance Index
rose 4.1 percent to 142,100.28, the highest level since May
2011, at the close in Istanbul today. The benchmark Istanbul
Stock Exchange  National 100 index  rose 0.5 percent to 80,033.33,
breaching 80,000 points for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
