SunPower Corp., the solar-panel maker
that announced a $2.5 billion deal with  Warren Buffett ’s utility
yesterday, rose the most in more than seven years after Lazard
Capital Markets LLC upgraded it.  SunPower climbed 48 percent to $9:07 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain for the San Jose, California-based
company since Nov. 17, 2005. The  BI Solar Index (BISOLAR)  of 17 companies
climbed 14 percent, its largest gain since March 26, 2009.  Large-scale utility solar plants, similar to the projects
that Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. agreed to buy,
and cost reductions will help boost SunPower’s earnings through
2014, Lazard’s Sanjay Shrestha and Aditya Satghare wrote in a
note to clients today. They raised the shares to buy from
neutral.  “As investors gain confidence in meaningful upside to
current street estimates, the shares should continue to move
higher,” according to the note.  Lazard set a price target of $11 a share, almost double the
$5.68 average target price of ten  analysts’ estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
