Cattle futures rose the most in two
weeks on speculation that U.S. animal supplies are shrinking as
demand for beef climbs. Hog prices also increased.  Steers  averaged $1.27 a pound in the first two days of this
week, up 1.9 percent from a week earlier, U.S. data show.
Meatpackers are buying animals for the first full week of the
new year for slaughter, supporting prices, Troy Vetterkind, the
owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC in Chicago, said in a
report. Yesterday, 127,000 cattle were processed, up 5 percent
from a week earlier.  “There’s still quite a bit of optimism in this cattle
industry that our numbers are still tight, and our demand is
going to increase for the next two or three weeks,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures in Oklahoma City,
said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for February delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
$1.3335 a pound at 10:01 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would mark the biggest gain for
the most-active contract since Dec. 19.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.4 percent
to $1.54545 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement climbed 0.7 percent to
86.8 cents a pound. In 2012, the price increased 1.7 percent,
the fifth straight gain and the longest rally since at least
1987, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 commodity  debuted in February 1966.  To contact the reporter on this story:
