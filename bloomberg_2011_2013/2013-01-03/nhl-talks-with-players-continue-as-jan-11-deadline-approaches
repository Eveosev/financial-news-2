The  National Hockey League  and its
players’ union will continue federally mediated negotiations
today, drawing a day closer to a league-stated Jan. 11 deadline
to reach a deal or lose the season.  The two sides met last night and the National Hockey League
Players’ Association, facing a midnight deadline to disclaim
interest in the union, opted to continue negotiating in an
effort to save a 48-game season, news organizations including
ESPN reported. Players voted unanimously in December to give the
board the authority to file the disclaimer, which would have
allowed them to individually sue the league under antitrust
claims.  Instead, the federal-mediated talks will continue today,
ESPN said, two days after NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said
that a deal must be reached by Jan. 11 in order to give teams a
one-week training camp before opening the season on Jan. 19.  “We’ve said we need to drop the puck by Jan. 19 if we’re
going to play a 48-game season,” Bettman said on Jan. 1,
according to the  Associated Press . “We don’t think it makes
sense to play a season any shorter than that.”  The league has canceled 625 games, or 51 percent of the
season, through Jan. 14. In 1994-95, an NHL lockout ended Jan.
11 and a 48-game schedule began on Jan. 20. A lockout wiped out
the 2004-05 season, the only time an entire schedule was lost to
a labor dispute in a major North American sports league.  Prior to this week’s meetings in New York the groups hadn’t
held face-to-face talks since Dec. 13, when federal mediators
were present.  The sides are arguing over how to split revenue and other
issues, including salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency. League revenue grew to $3.3 billion
last season, up 50 percent from $2.2 billion in 2003-04.  Under the previous agreement, players received 57 percent,
or $1.9 billion, of the income. The remaining $1.4 billion, or
43 percent, was shared among the league’s 30 team owners. The
league this time has offered a 50-50 split.  To contact the reporter on this story:
