Crude options volatility fell as
futures were little changed, trading in a range of less than $4
a barrel the past five days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 23.11 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:16 p.m., down from 24.41 percent
yesterday.  “This is mostly due to the fact we’re range trading here
at the higher price,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  February-delivery crude oil fell 20 cents to $92.92 a
barrel on the Nymex after settling yesterday at the highest
level since Sept. 18. Since Dec. 27, crude has traded in an
intraday range from $90 to $93.87.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
February $95 calls, which fell 26 cents to 71 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,831 contracts at 3:32 p.m. in New York. February $90
puts were the second-most active, with 1,761 lots exchanged as
they declined 3 cents to 69 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
the 156,639 contracts traded.  March $75 puts were the most active options with 11,195
contracts changing hands. They declined 7 cents to 14 cents a
barrel. February $72 puts fell 1 cent to 1 cent on 10,146 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
36,924 contracts. Next were March $70 puts at 27,808 and
February $110 calls at 27,114.  To contact the reporter on this story:
