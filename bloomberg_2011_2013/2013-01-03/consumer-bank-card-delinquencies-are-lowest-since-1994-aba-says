U.S. bank-card delinquencies fell to
the lowest level in 18 years as consumers strengthened their
personal finances amid uncertainty over the nation’s economy,
the  American Bankers Association  said in a quarterly report.  Bank-card accounts at least 30 days overdue dropped to 2.75
percent of all accounts in the third quarter from 2.93 percent
in the second quarter, the ABA said today in its Consumer Credit
Delinquency Bulletin. The rate, the lowest since 1994, was below
the 15-year average of 3.89 percent, the ABA said in a
statement.  ABA Chief Economist  James Chessen  said the improvement in
bank-card delinquencies reflects consumers’ efforts to better
manage their finances. He said it was a bright spot in a report
that failed to show improvement across eight installment-loan
categories tracked by the Washington-based industry group.  “The lack of broad-based improvement remains a cause for
concern,” Chessen said in the statement. “Some categories have
reached historical lows leaving little room for improvement. In
addition, slow job growth, continued uncertainty and falling
 consumer confidence  could signal rising delinquencies in the
year ahead.”  Delinquencies in two home-related loan categories rose in
the third quarter, Chessen said.  “While there are strong signs that the housing market has
turned a corner, it will take several quarters before
delinquency numbers begin to reflect those trends,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
