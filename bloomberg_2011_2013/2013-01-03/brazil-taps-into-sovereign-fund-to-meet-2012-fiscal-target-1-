Brazil  tapped into its sovereign
wealth fund and state companies’ profits in an effort to meet
its 2012 fiscal target.  The Treasury will withdraw 8.85 billion reais ($4.3
billion) from its sovereign wealth fund and 4.7 billion reais in
dividends from state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal,
according to a Dec. 31 decision published in today’s official
gazette.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration last year cut
taxes and stepped up public works spending as it struggled to
revive an economy that the central bank estimates expanded by 1
percent. Tax breaks reduced federal revenue by 45 billion reais
last year, according to Finance Minister  Guido Mantega .  Latin America’s biggest economy targeted in 2012 a  budget
surplus  before interest payments, known as the  primary surplus ,
of 139.8 billion reais, about 3.1 percent of gross domestic
product. In the first 11 months of the year, the primary surplus
was 82.7 billion reais, or 69 percent of the goal.  As part of the efforts to meet the goal, the Treasury is
also authorized to discount 25.6 billion reais in infrastructure
spending from its target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
