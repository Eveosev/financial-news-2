Precise Biometrics AB (PREC)  rose to the
highest in more than two months after the Swedish fingerprint
log-in technology provider said a new order in the U.S. will
help first-quarter earnings.  Precise Biometrics jumped as much as 18 percent to 0.86
krona, the highest intraday price since Oct. 23, at 2:08 p.m. in
Stockholm. That pared the shares’ 12-month decline to 37
percent, valuing the Lund-based company at 227.5 million kronor
($35 million).  The contract from an unidentified U.S.-based financial-
information services provider that the company didn’t identify
is an “extremely significant” deal, confirming the strength of
Precise Biometric’s algorithms even for reading “difficult”
fingerprints, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Marschall said
today in a statement. The order will have a “positive impact”
this quarter, the company said.  “The financial-services markets have some of the world’s
toughest requirements on usability and security, which is why we
are extremely proud and pleased to present this new customer,”
Marschall said. “It means that hundreds of thousands of
employees in the financial sector soon will be using our
technology on a daily basis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
