Macau Legend Development Ltd ., the
casino operator backed by former Macau lawmaker David Chow, may
seek as much as $800 million in an initial public offering in
 Hong Kong , a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The share sale may start as early as in the second quarter,
said the person, asking not to be identified because the
information is private. Key assets of the company include the
Landmark Macau hotel, the  Pharaoh’s Palace  casino and the Macau
Fisherman’s Wharf complex.  CLSA Ltd. will help arrange the IPO, the person said. A
spokeswoman for Macau Legend declined to comment on the share
sale plan. The Apple Daily reported on the IPO yesterday, citing
unidentified people.  Casino revenue surged 20 percent last month to a record
28.2 billion patacas ($3.5 billion) in the former Portuguese
colony, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sands China
Ltd. (1928) , the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s
Las Vegas company, soared 67 percent in the past 12 months,
while  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  gained 52 percent.  Chow served as a legislator in Macau from 2005 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
