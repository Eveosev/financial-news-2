Joe Johnson  scored 33 points to lead
the Brooklyn Nets to a 110-93 victory over the Oklahoma City
Thunder.  Brooklyn has won three of its four National Basketball
Association games since P.J. Carlesimo took over as interim
coach when  Avery Johnson  was fired Dec. 27.  Brook Lopez had 25 points and  Deron Williams  added 19
points and 13 assists last night for the Nets at Chesapeake
Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.  The Nets improved to 17-15 and are second in the five-team
Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division, 4 1/2 games behind the
New York Knicks. Oklahoma City tops the five-team Western
Conference’s Northwest Division, seven games ahead of second-
place Denver with a 24-7 record.  Kevin Durant  had 27 points for the Thunder (24-7) and
Russell Westbrook contributed 26 points and 10 assists.  Durant was ejected for the first time in his six-season NBA
career with less than two minutes left in the game as the Nets
neared the end of a 23-8 run to seal the Thunder’s first home
loss in 13 games. Durant was removed for arguing with referee
Danny Crawford after a technical foul was issued against
Kendrick Perkins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
