New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, headed for its biggest decline in
more than three weeks on speculation the rally to near a six-
month high was overdone.  NWR slid 1.4 percent to 99.60 koruna by 12:30 p.m. in
Prague. A close at that level would mark the steepest one-day
retreat since Dec. 11.  Basic resources companies fell in  Europe  today after
leading gains yesterday on optimism about the global recovery
following a U.S. budget agreement. NWR’s 3.5 percent jump to the
highest since July 19 yesterday lifted the stock’s 14-day
relative strength  index  to 80, above the 70 level at which
technical analysis signals a decline.  “The drop in NWR shares is driven by technical factors
after recent increases,” Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at Cyrrus
AS brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in e-mailed comments
today. “The weather in Europe is unusually warm,
which is hurting the price of thermal coal.”  The RSI for NWR shares fell to 73 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
