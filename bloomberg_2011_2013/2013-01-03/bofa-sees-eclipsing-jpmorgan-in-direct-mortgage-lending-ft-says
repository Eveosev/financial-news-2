Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Chief Executive
Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said his firm should overtake  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  in direct-to-consumer mortgage lending in the next
six months, according to the Financial Times.  Moynihan, 53, also said he has directed bankers to be
“more aggressive” in lending to companies, according to the
FT, citing an interview with the CEO.  Total mortgage originations at Bank of America plunged 37
percent to $21.3 billion in the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. The
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company cut lending to pare
assets deemed risky by regulators after its 2008 purchase of
Countrywide Financial Corp. and shut a business that bought debt
marketed by third-party firms.  Bank of America originated $53.4 billion of retail
mortgages in the first nine months of 2012, ranking it third
behind San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co.’s $189 billion and
JPMorgan’s $81.5 billion, according to the newsletter.  Larry DiRita , a Bank of America spokesman, didn’t return
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the FT report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
