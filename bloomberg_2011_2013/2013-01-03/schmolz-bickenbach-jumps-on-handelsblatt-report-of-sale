Schmolz & Bickenbach AG (STLN)  rose the most
in more than two years after Handelsblatt reported the Swiss
maker of high-grade steel products may be sold in a transaction
valued at as much as 500 million euros ($658 million).  Schmolz & Bickenbach  advanced  as much as 29 percent to 3.70
Swiss francs, the biggest intraday gain since Nov. 3, 2010, and
was up 12 percent at 10:51 a.m. in Zurich on the first trading
day of the year. That gave the Emmenbruecke, Switzerland-based
company a market value of 376.8 million francs ($410 million).  A takeover could take place in two stages, with the
acquisition of 258 million euros of high-interest bonds followed
by a purchase of shares, Handelsblatt reported yesterday, citing
unidentified people from the financial industry. Schmolz has
attracted suitors including  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and
Triton Advisers Ltd., according to the German newspaper.  “The company needs to strengthen the balance sheet at some
point this year,” whether through a capital increase or a debt-
to-equity swap, Patrick Rafaisz, an analyst at Vontobel with a
hold recommendation on the stock, said in a research report
today. “Once more, minority shareholders are likely to
suffer.”  Phone lines at Schmolz interim Chief Executive Officer
Marcel Imhof’s office were engaged. A spokesman at CNC AG, which
represents Triton, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
