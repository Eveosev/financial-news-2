Bill Gross’s  Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX) ,
the world’s biggest mutual fund, attracted $18 billion in
investor deposits last year after beating most rivals.  The fund drew $889 million in December, its 12th straight
month of deposits, helping lift assets to $285 billion, Chicago-
based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  said today in an e-mail. Deposits of $2.8
billion in September were the highest in 2012.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return Fund
rebounded from its first ever year of withdrawals in 2011 as it
advanced 10.4 percent last year, beating 95 percent of rivals,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund lost $5
billion to redemptions in 2011, according to Morningstar, as
Gross trailed peers after eliminating U.S. Treasuries early in
the year and missing a rally when investors rushed to the safety
of government-backed debt.  Gross decreased his  holdings  of Treasuries in November
after increasing them in October. The allocation was 23 percent
as of Nov. 30 compared with 24 percent a month earlier,
according to the company’s website. In his monthly investment
outlook posted today, Gross said investors should be alert to
the longer term inflationary risks of stimulus programs such as
quantitative easing.  Pimco, based in Newport Beach, California, is a unit of
Munich-based insurer  Allianz SE (ALV)  and manages $1.9 trillion in
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
