Argentina ’s peso weakened in the
parallel market to a record 7 per dollar today as demand for the
U.S. currency from people traveling abroad increased over the
holidays, the newspaper Clarin reported on its website without
saying how it obtained the information.  The parallel peso was trading at 6.91 per dollar yesterday,
Clarin said. The official peso depreciated less than 0.1 percent
to 4.9262 per dollar at 1:19 p.m. Buenos Aires time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Argentines are increasingly turning to the illegal and
unregulated currency market after President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  restricted access to dollars to curb capital flight.  Demand for dollars in the parallel market, called the
“blue” market by locals, also increased after the system the
federal tax agency uses to approve foreign-exchange purchases
wasn’t working yesterday, Clarin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
