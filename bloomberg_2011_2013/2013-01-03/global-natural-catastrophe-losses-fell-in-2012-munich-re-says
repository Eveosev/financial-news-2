Munich Re, the world’s largest
reinsurer, said global losses from natural catastrophes were cut
in half in 2012, with  Hurricane Sandy  causing the highest costs.  Natural catastrophes caused $160 billion in losses and $65
billion in global insured losses down from $400 billion and $119
billion respectively in 2011, the Munich-based company said in a
statement on its website today. Sandy accounted for about $50
billion in overall losses, with estimates still “subject to
considerable uncertainty,” the reinsurer said.  Homeowners and businesses are seeking payouts on policies
to help cover losses from Hurricane Sandy, which lashed the
densely populated U.S. Northeast coast on Oct. 29, ravaging
beach front communities and leaving more than 8 million homes
and businesses without power for days. Munich Re said that the
drought that hit parts of the U.S. last year caused the second-
highest costs, with crop losses of about $20 billion.  “Greater loss-prevention efforts are needed,”  Torsten Jeworrek , a Munich Re board member, said in the statement. “It
would certainly be possible to protect conurbations like New
York better from the effects of storm surges. Such action would
make economic sense and insurers could also reflect the reduced
exposure in their pricing.”  Munich Re said that the losses related to Sandy are
extremely difficult to assess.’’ Without that impact, they
“would have been very low” in 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
