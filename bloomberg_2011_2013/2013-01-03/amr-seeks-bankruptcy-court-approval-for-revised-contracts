AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  sought bankruptcy court
approval for restructured contracts with its aircraft and jet
engines suppliers that the carrier said will help it switch to
more fuel-efficient planes as part of its reorganization.  AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, filed
redacted settlement agreements with  Boeing Co. (BA) , Airbus SAS,
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and Rolls-Royce Plc in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Manhattan.  “A fundamental element of the debtors’ business plan is
the investment in newer, more efficient narrow-body and wide-
body aircraft which will, among other things, provide a superior
in-flight experience to American’s customers, and generate
significant fuel and maintenance savings,” the company said
yesterday in its request for approval of the Boeing settlement.  The restructured agreements will in “no way adversely
impact” AMR’s pursuit of strategic alternatives, the company
said in the request.  AMR, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, is in merger talks with  US
Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , people familiar with the matter said last
month. AMR’s board will meet Jan. 9 to decide whether to go
ahead, with an announcement possible within days, said the
people.  The case is in re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
