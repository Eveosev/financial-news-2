Crude slipped from a three-month high
as more Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week and on concern that new budget
legislation won’t reduce the deficit fast enough.  Prices dropped as the Labor Department said jobless claims
rose 10,000 to 372,000. President  Barack Obama  signed the budget
measure into law yesterday to undo automatic tax increases and
spending cuts. Oil supplies fell to a two-month low, a Bloomberg
survey of analysts showed before a government report tomorrow.  “We saw crude coming off a little bit on the jobless
claims,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “The fiscal deal didn’t
solve all the problems. We still have big issues ahead.”  West  Texas  Intermediate for February delivery fell 20 cents
to settle at $92.92 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures climbed to $93.12 a barrel yesterday, the
highest settlement for a contract nearest to expiration since
Sept. 18.  Prices were little changed from the settlement after the
 American Petroleum Institute  reported inventories dropped 12
million barrels last week to 358.5 million. Oil futures fell 29
cents, or 0.3 percent, to $92.82 a barrel in electronic trading
at 4:49 p.m., up from $92.66 before the report was released.  Brent for February settlement slid 33 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $112.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The North Sea crude was $19.22 a barrel more
than WTI, down from yesterday’s $19.35. Trading volume in WTI
was 12 percent below the 100-day average at 4:33 p.m. in  New
York , while Brent was 3.5 percent higher.  Seaway Pipeline  Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed as  Enterprise Products
Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  planned to resume service on the
500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway pipeline linking the U.S.
pipeline hub at Cushing,  Oklahoma , with Freeport, Texas. Seaway
will be able to move 400,000 barrels a day when it returns next
week after work that more than doubled its capacity.  Supplies at Cushing, the delivery point for WTI futures,
rose 4.7 percent in the week ended Dec. 21 to a record 49.2
million barrels, according to the Energy Department.  Last week’s jobless claims exceeded the 360,000 forecast by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The prior week’s applications
were revised up to 362,000 from an initially reported 350,000.  Employment Data  The report comes one day before the Labor Department’s
monthly employment figures. Payrolls rose by 153,000 workers in
December after a 146,000 gain in November, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
 unemployment rate  probably held at 7.7 percent, the lowest level
since December 2008.  “The jobless claims number is poor,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “The euphoria from the budget agreement seems to
be wearing off.”  President Barack Obama signed the budget bill into law
yesterday to undo $600 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts, known collectively as the fiscal cliff, that took
effect on Jan. 1. The budget won’t cut spending enough to avoid
a sovereign-debt rating downgrade, Moody’s Investors Service
said yesterday.  Republicans, who control the  House of Representatives ,
immediately turned to their next battle -- a bid to use the need
to raise the nation’s $16.4 trillion  debt ceiling  to force Obama
to accept cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicare.  “The market is showing a little hesitation to move higher
because they left the job half done,” McGillian said.  Debt Ratio  The ratio of  U.S. government debt  to gross domestic product
will probably peak at about 80 percent in 2014 and may stay at
that level for the rest of the decade, New York-based Moody’s
said yesterday in a statement. The ratings company assigns the
U.S. its top Aaa ranking and has a negative outlook on the
grade.  “Spending cuts were still on the table and we still have
the debt ceiling,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-
based analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more than $20
billion in companies’ annual energy spending. “The only deal
they had was a smaller one on taxes and it set the stage for the
next fight.”  Oil also moved lower as a record of the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s Dec. 11-12 meeting showed policy makers said they
will probably end their $85 billion monthly bond purchases
sometime in 2013, with members are divided between a mid- or
end-of-year finish.  Oil Stockpiles  Oil stockpiles fell by 1 million barrels to 370.1 million
in the seven days ended Dec. 28, according to the median of 10
analyst estimates. That would be a third weekly decline and the
sixth drop in seven weeks.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report two days later than usual this week because of the New
Year’s holiday.  WTI slid in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened a glut at
Cushing, Oklahoma, America’s biggest storage hub and the
delivery point for the New York contract. That left it at an
average $17.48 a barrel below Brent last year, compared with a
premium of about 95 cents in the 10 years through 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
