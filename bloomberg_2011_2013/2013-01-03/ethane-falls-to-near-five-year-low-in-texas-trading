Ethane, a component of natural gas
used to make ethylene, fell 5.3 percent in  Texas  to the lowest
price in almost five years, benefiting  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and
other plastics producers.  Ethane at Mont Belvieu, the main supply hub for Gulf Coast
chemical makers, dropped to 22.25 cents a gallon at 10:06 a.m.
in New York, according to Liquidity Partners  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the lowest price since at least Jan. 28, 2008.  Ethylene is used to make polyethylene plastic, an
ingredient in packaging, and hundreds of other chemicals. Dow,
 LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB)  and  Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK)  are
among producers expanding U.S. ethylene production to take
advantage of low gas prices, which have fallen as new drilling
methods have increased output from shale formations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
