Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
fourth day, heading for a seven-month low, on speculation the
central bank will lower its benchmark  interest rate  next week.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 86.50 a dollar and traded at 86.45 by
11:10 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at this level would
be the weakest since May 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor
Njuguna Ndung’u, lowered the  benchmark  interest rate by 2
percentage points to 11 percent on Nov 7. Inflation slowed for
the 13th consecutive month in December, to 3.2 percent from 3.3
percent in November, slipping further below the government’s
target and boosting expectations the central bank will continue
to ease monetary policy. The policy makers will meet on Jan 10,
the bank said on its  website .  “The shilling is under pressure due to an anticipated rate
cut decision by Monetary Policy Committee and it’s anticipated
it could hit 87.00 before Jan. 10,” Nairobi-based NIC Bank
Ltd., said in a note to client. There is “corporate client
demand for greenbacks built up over the holiday period,” it
said.  The central bank has lowered its key  lending rate  by a
total of 7 percentage points since July, a move designed to
revive the economy after growth slowed to 3.4 percent in the
first quarter and 3.3 percent in the second. Expansion quickened
to 4.7 percent in the third quarter.  The central  bank rate  is seen at 10 percent this year,
according to the median of four economists’ forecasts surveyed
by Bloomberg in November.  “We don’t expect an aggressive reduction with the
possibility of a cut of 100 basis points to ensure the shilling
remains stable,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at NIC Bank, said
by phone.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.8 percent to 2,700 a
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling depreciated 0.3 percent to
1,594 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
