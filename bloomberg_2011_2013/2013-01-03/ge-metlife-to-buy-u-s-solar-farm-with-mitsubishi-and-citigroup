EDF Renewable Energy, a U.S. unit of
French utility  Electricite de France SA , completed financing for
its 143-megawatt Catalina solar project under construction in
California’s Mojave Desert.  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  MetLife Inc. (MET) ,  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  bought a majority stake
in the project and plan to buy the remainder when it enters
operation later this year, the San Diego-based EDF unit said
today in a statement that didn’t disclose terms.  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Gas & Electric will buy the power
produced by Catalina for 25 years to help meet a state
requirement for utilities to supply 33 percent of retail
electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  Showa Shell Sekiyu KK (5002) ’s Solar Frontier
unit are  supplying  thin-film photovoltaic panels for the
project, according to EDF Renewable Energy’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
