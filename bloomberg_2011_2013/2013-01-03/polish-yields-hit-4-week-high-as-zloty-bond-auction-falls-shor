Polish 10-year bond yields rose to
the highest level in almost four weeks and the zloty weakened
after the government failed to sell the maximum amount of bonds
at an auction today.  The yield on notes maturing in October 2023 increased 10
basis points to 3.92 percent, the highest since Dec. 7, as of
2:52 p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty declined 0.4 percent to 4.0864
per euro, the steepest drop among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The  Finance Ministry  raised a total of 3.66 billion zloty
($1.17 billion) from the sale of 10-year and 16-year bonds, less
than the maximum 5 billion zloty planned. Deputy Finance
Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk told reporters in parliament that
demand was hurt in part by a “correction” in German bunds and
U.S. Treasuries.  “The retreat on the core market probably spurred some
profit taking, especially after such a strong rally,” Arkadiusz Urbanski, fixed-income analyst at  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , said by phone
from Warsaw. “We have to wait and see how the next auction will
go before jumping to conclusions.”  The government started the year having already obtained 27
percent of its 2013 funding needs. The yield on 10-year notes
fell 2.15 percentage points last year, the biggest annual
decline in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
