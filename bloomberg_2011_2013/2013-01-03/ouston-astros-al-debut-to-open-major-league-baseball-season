The Houston Astros will make their
American League debut in the first game of the 2013 Major League
Baseball season on March 31 when they host the  Texas Rangers .  The game is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. local time at
Minute Maid Park in Houston and will be shown by Walt Disney
Co.’s ESPN, baseball announced today in an e-mailed release. The
season-opener falls on the Easter Sunday holiday.  Six games will be played the following day, including the
 Boston Red Sox  at the  New York Yankees  and the defending-
champion San Francisco Giants on the road against the  Los
Angeles Dodgers .  The Astros are joining the AL West division after 51 years
in the National League, setting up a local rivalry with the
Rangers, who play about 250 miles (402 kilometers) away in
Arlington. Houston is the first major-league team to change
leagues since 1998, when the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the NL
Central division from the AL Central.  The Astros’ move, announced in November 2011, puts 15 teams
in both the AL and NL, which necessitates interleague play on a
daily basis. Baseball previously had two periods of interleague
play each season. The realignment also places five teams in each
of baseball’s six divisions for the first time.  The Astros finished the 2012 season 55-107, their second
consecutive year with baseball’s worst record. The Rangers were
93-69 last season and lost in the first round of the playoffs to
the Baltimore Orioles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
