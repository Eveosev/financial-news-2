The  Wellcome Trust , the world’s
second-largest biomedical charity, said it started an investment
arm with 200 million pounds ($326 million) of initial capital to
back biotechnology startups.  The Syncona Partners LLP unit will support new businesses
in the medical-device, therapeutics, diagnostics and
information-technology industries, London-based Wellcome said
today in a statement. Long-term investments will amount to 1
million pounds to 20 million pounds each, it said.  “We expect to play our part in building successful
businesses based upon innovation within the life science and
health-care industry,” Syncona Chief Executive Officer Martin
Murphy said in the statement.  Murphy, previously a partner at venture capital firm MVM
Life Sciences Partners LLP, oversees a five-member team of
executives at Syncona. The firm’s seven-member board is led by
Nigel Keen, who is also chairman of  Laird Plc (LRD) ,  Bioquell Plc (BQE)  and
 Oxford Instruments Plc. (OXIG)   The Wellcome Trust’s assets, minus current liabilities,
totaled 15.2 billion pounds on Sept. 30, ranking it behind the
Seattle-based Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It was
established in 1936 under the will of Wisconsin-born Henry
Wellcome, co-founder of Burroughs Wellcome & Co., a forerunner
of drugmaker  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , and primarily makes grants to
researchers.  More Global  The Trust said in its annual report on Dec. 19 that its
14.5-billion pound net portfolio has progressively become more
global to gain exposure to Asia and other  emerging markets  and
“has hardly suffered from the underperformance of European
assets in the financial crisis.”  It reduced “home-country bias” by dropping the proportion
of its portfolio allocated to the U.K. to 6 percent, from 13
percent in 2009 and 33 percent in 2006, according to the report.
It also reduced European and U.K. assets to 13 percent from 22
percent in 2009 and 48 percent in 2006.  The charity said it made 1.6 billion pounds in the year
ended Sept. 30, a 12 percent nominal return, and made charitable
cash payments of 643 million pounds in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
