EDF Energies Nouvelles SA, the clean-
energy arm of Electricite de France SA, started its first wind
farm in  Poland .  The 48-megawatt facility in the northern Grudziadz region
comprises 24 turbines supplied by  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the
Paris-based company said today in a  statement  on its website.  Poland has a goal to get 15 percent of its energy from
clean sources by 2020, compared with about 2 percent now. The
target includes 6,000 megawatts of wind power, EDF said. At the
end of 2011 it had 1,616 megawatts of wind,  according to  the
European Wind Energy Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
