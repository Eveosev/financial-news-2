The owners of the New York Mets
obtained at least $700 million in loans to refinance debt,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The financing will be used to replace existing credit lines
and provide additional funds to the parents of the Major League
Baseball team, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information wasn’t public.  A spokeswoman for the Mets, Danielle Parillo, declined to
comment.  The financing comes after Standard & Poor’s cut the ratings
of the debt used to finance a stadium in Queens, New York, where
the team plays. S&P lowered the grade of Queens Ballpark Company
LLC by one level to BB on Dec. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
