Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  scheduled a special
Feb. 22 shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed ouster of
Kazuo Okada, once the casino company’s largest investor, from
the board of directors.  The executive committee of Wynn’s board believes Okada has
not been acting in the best interests of the company and its
shareholders, according to a  regulatory filing  today. The Las
Vegas-based resort and casino operator has been locked in legal
disputes with Okada since January 2012, according to the filing.  Wynn Resorts directors, with the exception of Okada, voted
last February to declare him “unsuitable” after a year-long
company probe concluded he gave cash and gifts totaling $110,000
to foreign gaming regulators, the filing said. The company
seized Okada’s 24.5 million shares at a 30 percent discount to
market value.  Okada has said he did nothing wrong and sued Wynn Resorts
in the U.S. and Japan.  The Nevada Gaming Control Board is investigating Wynn
Resorts’ claims as well as later reports that Okada’s  Universal
Entertainment Corp. (6425)  made $40 million in payments to a consultant
to Philippine casino regulators, the company said in the filing.
Universal called the reports a “misrecognition of the facts.”  Wynn rose 2.4 percent to $120.91 at 12:31 p.m. in  New York 
after gaining 5 percent yesterday. The shares  advanced  1.8
percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
