European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances pared losses as German power erased declines.  Permits for 2013 fell as much as 5.3 percent to the lowest
in almost a month. German power for delivery next year, the
European benchmark, weakened to a record before closing 0.1
percent higher.  EU carbon for 2013 dropped as low as 6.22 euros ($8.16) a
metric ton on  London â€™s ICE Futures Europe exchange, the least
since Dec. 5, and closed at 6.40 euros.  German next-year power fell as much as 0.3 percent to 45
euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest since the contract started
trading in January 2010, before advancing to close at 45.20
euros, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
