U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
pledged an extra 30 million pounds ($49 million) to fund startup
loans for young entrepreneurs, taking spending on the project to
110 million pounds in a bid to generate growth.  Startup loans provide young people between the ages of 18
and 30 with support including access to a business mentor and
low-interest capital typically of about 2,500 pounds “to help
get their business idea moving,” Cameron’s office in London
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “They are a great way to help this next generation of
entrepreneurs get the financial help -- and the confidence -- to
turn that spark of an idea, into a growing, thriving business,”
Cameron said. “It is by backing our entrepreneurs and
championing small business that we can drive forward and grow
the economy and equip this country for the highly competitive
era we are in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
