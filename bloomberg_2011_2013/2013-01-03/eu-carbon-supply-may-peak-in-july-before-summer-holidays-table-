European Union carbon supply may peak
in July, before nations cut back sales during August, according
to data from European Energy Exchange AG and ICE Futures  Europe .
Weekly supply may peak in the week ending Jan. 18.  Monthly sales in July will be 73.4 million metric tons,
increasing from 62.7 million tons this month, according to
analysis of data on the websites of the exchanges handling sales
on behalf of EU members and the U.K. respectively. The average
this year will be 60.7 million tons a month.  Supply of allowances sold at auctions will rise to 14.7
million tons next week and to 18.8 million tons the following
five working days, a record-high for the year, according to the
data. No allowances are to be sold this week.  The planned volumes may be reduced if the European Union
agrees a proposal to hold back 900 million tons of permits from
2013 through 2015. Discussions over the plan are scheduled to
resume this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
