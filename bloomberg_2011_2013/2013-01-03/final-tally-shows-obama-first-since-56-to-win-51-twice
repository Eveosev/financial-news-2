Barack Obama  is the first president
in more than five decades to win at least 51 percent of the
national popular vote twice, according to a revised vote count
in New York eight weeks after the Nov. 6 election.  State election officials submitted a final tally on Dec. 31
that added about 400,000 votes, most of them from provisional
ballots in the Democratic stronghold of New York City that were
counted late in part because of complications caused by
 Hurricane Sandy .  The president nationally won 65.9 million votes -- or 51.1
percent -- against Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , who took
60.9 million votes and 47.2 percent of the total cast, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Obama is the first president to achieve the 51 percent mark
in two elections since Republican  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who did
it in 1952 and 1956, and the first Democrat to do so since
 Franklin D. Roosevelt , who won four consecutive White House
races. Roosevelt received 53.4 percent of the vote -- his lowest
-- in his last race in 1944.  Obama, 51, benefited from political factors that included a
lack of serious opposition for his party’s nomination or from
well-known third-party challengers, and an absence of social
unrest, scandal or foreign-policy disasters during his first
term, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American
University in  Washington .  “Under the big picture, this was an entirely predictable
election outcome,” Lichtman said.  Electoral Votes  The president won the popular vote in 26 states and the
District of Columbia, totaling 332 electoral votes, or 62 more
than the 270 needed to win the presidency. Romney won 24 states
with 206 electoral votes. Obama won 365 electoral votes in 2008.  Congress certified the 2012 electoral votes in a joint
session today. Obama will take the oath of office on Jan. 20, a
Sunday, and give his inaugural speech at the Capitol on Jan. 21.  Turnout in this year’s presidential race was about 129.1
million, down from the record 131.3 million four years ago.  Obama’s national vote total fell by about 3.6 million votes
from his record 69.5 million in 2008, when he was elected the
nation’s first black president. In that race, he won 52.9
percent -- with a victory margin of more than 9.5 million votes
over Republican  John McCain  -- amid a financial crisis that took
hold at the end of Republican  George W. Bush ’s presidency.  Unemployment Rate  The nation’s  unemployment  rate, 7.8 percent when Obama
succeeded Bush in January 2009, rose to 10 percent that October
before falling to 7.7 percent last November. Obama is the second
president since World War II to win re-election with a jobless
rate above 6 percent. The other was Republican  Ronald Reagan  in
1984.  “He was able to campaign against the economy back in 2008
because it was Bush’s problem,”  Rhodes Cook , a political
analyst who publishes a newsletter, said in an interview. “It
got reversed. He got stuck with the economy this time.”  Romney, a former private-equity executive and governor of
 Massachusetts , failed to parlay voter anxiety about the economy
into a victory.  While Obama’s national vote percentage fell by about 2
points from four years ago, he improved on his 2008 performance
in six states, including New York, where his 63.3 percent was
the best by any presidential nominee since 1964, and  New Jersey ,
where his 58.3 percent was the best by a Democratic White House
hopeful since 1964.  Closest Races  In just four states -- Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and
Virginia -- was the winning candidate’s margin of victory less
than 5 percentage points, the smallest number of states below
that threshold since 1984, when three states were within 5
points amid Reagan’s 18-point victory in the popular vote over
Democrat  Walter Mondale .  In 2004, when Bush was re-elected with a popular vote
margin of less than 3 points over Democrat  John Kerry , 11 states
were decided by fewer than 5 points. In 1976, when Democrat
 Jimmy Carter  won the White House and edged President  Gerald Ford 
by 2 points, 20 states were within 5 points.  The Nov. 6 results underscore challenges for Republicans as
they seek an Electoral College majority in 2016 and beyond.  Eighteen states and the District of Columbia, with a total
of 242 electoral votes, have voted Democratic in six straight
presidential elections. They include the biggest electoral-vote
prize, California, where Obama won its 55 electoral votes with a
23-point win.  Twenty-two states with 180 electoral votes have voted
Republican in the past four elections.  “You have an electorate that’s very polarized and pretty
even, though it’s a situation now though where the Democrats
seem to have a little better handle on the map than the
Republicans do,” Cook said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
