Pakistan  suspended mobile phone
services in cities across all four provinces on a key date in
the religious calendar for the country’s Shiite Muslims, a
minority that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists.  Phone services in 39 cities will be suspended from 8 a.m.
to 11 p.m., the Dawn newspaper reported today, citing an
official at the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority who it
didn’t name.  Mobile phones  have been used in Pakistan to
detonate explosives.  Processions are planned in the four provincial capitals,
television channels reported, as Shiites commemorate Chehlum,
which marks 40 days since the death anniversary of Prophet
Muhammad’s grandson Hussein.  Twenty-three people died when terrorists twice struck the
event in 2010. A suicide bomber first rammed his motorbike into
a bus carrying pilgrims in Karachi, and a hospital treating
victims was later attacked.  A car bomb Dec. 30 struck a convoy of three buses bound for
Shiite holy sites in neighboring  Iran . The attack in the Mastung
district of Baluchistan province triggered a fire in one of the
vehicles killing at least 20 people, state-run Pakistan
Television reported.  Attacks on Shiites are common in Pakistan, where the
community accounts for about 15 percent of the country’s 200
million people. This year, militants linked to Pakistan’s
Taliban movement have targeted Shiites from the ethnic Hazara
community.  Pakistan has shut off cellular services at least three
times since Sept. 21 when the nation protested an anti-Islam
movie, demonstrations that left 11 people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
