Contract disputes in cotton, last
year’s second worst-performing commodity, surged to a record in
2012 while settlements quadrupled to almost 407 million pounds
($658 million), the International Cotton Association said.  A record 247 applications for technical arbitrations were
received last year, up from the previous high at 242 in 2011,
the Liverpool, England-based ICA said in a statement today. In
the past two years, arbitration requests have increased to five
times their normal annual average as market volatility spurred
more traders to default on contracts, the ICA said.  Cotton futures tumbled 18 percent last year on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , with only coffee performing worse among the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials. In June, the
most-active cotton contract slumped to 64.61 cents a pound, the
lowest since October 2009, and down 71 percent from a record
$2.197 a pound achieved in March 2011. World production may
outstrip demand for a fourth consecutive year in 2013-14,
according to Rabobank International estimates.  “As we move into the first quarter, the pace does not seem
to be slowing down” for arbitration filings, ICA President
Ahmed Elbosaty said in the statement. ICA is looking at ways to
reduce the time and costs taken for cases, he said.  Arbitration Awards  In 2012, 226 cases were settled with awards climbing to
406.77 million pounds, ICA Managing Director Kai Hughes said in
an e-mailed response to Bloomberg questions. In 2011, there were
99 awards with a total value of 89.47 million pounds.
Arbitration activity has increased in Bangladesh, Vietnam and
 China , he said.  Terry Townsend, executive director of the Washington-based
International Cotton Advisory Committee, estimated in August
that cotton traders may break $600 million in contracts during
2012, or 5 percent of the fiber traded globally.  Cotton futures for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
75.49 cents a pound at 9:59 a.m. on ICE Futures in New York.
Rabobank expects prices to average 70 cents a pound in the first
half of this year, according to its annual outlook report
published Nov. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
