Taiwan ’s dollar rose to the strongest
level in almost eight weeks as an expansion in U.S. factory
output added to optimism the global economic recovery is gaining
traction, boosting the outlook for the island’s exports.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
climbed to 50.7 in December from a three-year low of 49.5 in
November, the Tempe, Arizona-based group reported yesterday.
Data due on Jan. 7 may show Taiwan’s overseas shipments
increased 4.7 percent last month from a year earlier, up from
0.9 percent in November, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Sentiment over the economic outlook of the U.S. has
improved,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “But I think we still need a
few months to see whether Taiwan’s exports have bounced back.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.4 percent to NT$28.988 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 10:16 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.978 earlier, the strongest
level since Nov. 12.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell
eight basis points to 3.15 percent.  Stock Inflows  The monetary authority has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past nine
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
central bank’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said on Dec. 19.  The  U.S. Congress  passed a bill that averts automatic
spending cuts and tax increases that threatened to push the
world’s largest economy into recession, while China reported
today that its services industries expanded at the fastest pace
in four months.  Global funds bought $234 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold yesterday, adding to $4.9 billion of inflows in 2012.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
1.125 percent notes due September 2022 held at 1.158 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank
lending  rate was steady at 0.389 percent, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
