Accuray Inc. (ARAY) , maker of radiation
devices used to treat cancer, said it would fire about 13
percent of its work force after reporting second-quarter revenue
that missed analyst estimates and lowering its annual sales
projections. Shares fell 22 percent in extended trading.  Sales in the three months ended Dec. 31 were $72 million to
$75 million, from $106.4 million a year ago, the Sunnyvale,
California-based company said in a statement. The result fell
short of the $94 million  average  of five estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Accuray also lowered its revenue projection for the
fiscal year ending June 30 to $320 million to $330 million, from
$405 million to $425 million.  The revenue shortfall is due to “transitional issues”
with its sales force and manufacturing problems that delayed
product introductions, the company said in its statement. The
job cuts, most of them in the U.S., will result in a charge of
$3 million to $4 million in the fiscal third quarter, Accuray
said.  Shares fell  $1.48 to $5.30 at 5 p.m.  New York  time in
extended trading after earlier closing at $6.78.  Joshua Levine, Accuray’s chief executive officer, took over
in October, replacing Euan Thomson, who left the company after
more than a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
