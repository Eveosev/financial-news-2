The Australian dollar retreated from
near a two-week high as concern U.S. lawmakers will struggle to
agree on raising the nation’s debt ceiling overshadowed the bill
they passed to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  The Aussie slid versus most of its 16 major counterparts as
officials in the world’s biggest economy turned their attention
to a debate over raising the $16.4 trillion  debt limit . An
increase will be needed as early as mid-February, according to
the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. The  New Zealand dollar ,
also known as the kiwi, reversed a gain from yesterday as U.S.
stock futures fell.  “All along, it’s been clear that the fiscal deal was not
going to bring any real progress for long-term spending and  tax
reform ,” said  Todd Elmer , head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy for Asia excluding Japan at Citigroup Inc. in
Singapore. “There is some further upside for the Aussie and I
doubt this temporary dip that we’re seeing is going to last.”  The Australian dollar lost 0.1 percent to $1.0491 as of
5:32 p.m. in Sydney from $1.0504 at the close yesterday, when
the currency touched $1.0524, the strongest since Dec. 19.  The yield on 10-year Australian debt fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.36 percent after earlier
climbing to 3.44 percent, the highest since Aug. 21.  Futures for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. shares
fell 0.3 percent. The stocks gauge surged 2.5 percent yesterday,
the biggest advance in a year.  The  U.S. Treasury  will probably exhaust what it called
“extraordinary” measures by late February or early March to
keep funding the government after the nation hit its debt limit
on Dec. 31.  New Zealand’s currency was supported earlier after  Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG)  said whole-milk powder prices rose in the
latest auction after declining in the four previous sales. The
near-term contract for New Zealand product rose to $3,183 a
metric ton, the highest price since Nov. 20, according to the
Auckland-based company’s GlobalDairyTrade website.  New Zealand’s currency was at 83.34 U.S. cents, 0.1 percent
lower than the 83.41 close yesterday, when it advanced as high
as 83.97, the strongest since Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
