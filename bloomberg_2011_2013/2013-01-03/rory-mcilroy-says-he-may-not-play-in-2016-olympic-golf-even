Rory McIlroy, the No. 1 player in the
Official World Golf Ranking, says he may skip the sport’s return
to the Olympics instead of picking which country to represent.  McIlroy, a 23-year-old from  Northern Ireland , is eligible
to play for both Britain and Ireland at the 2016 Games in Rio de
Janeiro. He said he’s considering both, along with the option of
not playing so as not to upset people from the nation he doesn’t
chose.  “I just think being from where we’re from, we’re placed in
a very difficult situation,” McIlroy said in comments from a
British Broadcasting Corp. documentary posted on the network’s
 website . “Play for one side or the other, or not play at all
because I may upset too many people. Those are my options I’m
considering very carefully.”  McIlroy was named player of the year on the European and
U.S. PGA Tours after leading the money list on both and
capturing his second major title at the  PGA Championship  by a
record eight shots. He won three times on the U.S. Tour in 2012,
one European Tour event and was a member of the winning European
squad at the Ryder Cup.  Golf returns to the Olympic program in  Brazil . The sport
