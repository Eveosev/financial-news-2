South Korea ’s three-year bonds rose
for a fourth day on speculation the central bank will cut
 interest rates  as early as next week to slow gains in the won,
Asia’s best-performing currency last year.  Policymakers at the Bank of Korea meet Jan. 11 to review
borrowing costs. The central bank kept the benchmark  seven-day
repurchase rate  at 2.75 percent last month after cuts of 25
basis points each in July and October. The government lowered
its growth forecasts for 2012 and 2013 in December. The won
touched a 16-month high today, after erasing an earlier loss.  “Speculation that the BOK may cut interest rates is
rising,” said Park Hyung Min, fixed-income strategist at
Shinhan Investment Corp. in  Seoul . “A rate cut is likely to
help stem the won’s appreciation, while uncertainties
surrounding the economy remain.”  The yield on the 2.75 percent bonds due December 2015 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.77 percent in
Seoul, according to Korea Exchange prices. The won closed at
1,061.65 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,061.64 earlier, the highest since Sept. 2, 2011. The
currency appreciated 8.3 percent last year.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan told reporters yesterday that
he’s concerned about “herd behavior” in the currency market
and the government is “actively” reviewing possible measures
for the won. South Korea’s economy will “gradually” recover
this year,  Bank of Korea  Governor Kim Choong Soo said today.  The  finance ministry  said in a statement today the
government will spend 72 percent of this year’s budget in the
first half to respond to economic uncertainties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
