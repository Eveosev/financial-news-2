The French government should take
“appropriate” action against a magazine that’s publishing new
caricatures of the  Prophet Muhammad , according to the secretary
general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu said the publication, which is part of
a series on the life of Islam’s last prophet by French satirical
weekly Charlie Hebdo, “should abide by the provisions –-
particularly those in the European Union context –- on
incitement to hatred and violence,” according to a statement
dated yesterday. The Jeddah-based OIC is an inter-governmental
organization with 57  member states , according to its  website .  The first part of the series, “The Life of Muhammad: The
Beginnings of a Prophet,” was published yesterday. The
magazine’s description says “if the form appears blasphemous to
some, the content is perfectly halal,” or permissible. Visual
representations of the prophet are considered blasphemy by most
Muslims.  The OIC called on Muslims around the world to exercise
restraint. Charlie Hebdo’s offices were firebombed in November
2011 after the magazine published a special edition featuring
the Prophet Muhammad as a “guest editor,”  Agence France-Presse 
reported at the time, citing an unidentified police official.
Charlie Hebdo also published cartoons mocking the prophet in
September, fueling protests across the Muslim world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
