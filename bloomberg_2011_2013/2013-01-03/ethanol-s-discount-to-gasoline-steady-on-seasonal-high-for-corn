Ethanol’s discount to gasoline was
little changed on concern that producers will close plants as
the price of corn, used to make the biofuel, traded at the
highest seasonal level in half a century.  The grain-based additive was 60.07 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on February futures for both commodities. That
compares with 60.11 cents yesterday.  “They’re still losing a lot of money,” said Jerrod Kitt,
an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.197 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. January
futures, which expire tomorrow, were unchanged at $2.179 a
gallon. The front-month futures have fallen 2.7 percent in the
past year.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. Prices for the grain
are the highest level for this time of year in records going
back to 1961 after a drought scorched crops in the Midwest,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn for March delivery decreased 1.5 cents to $6.8925 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
30 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production
that can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol  production  averaged 834,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Dec. 21, down 13 percent from the record 963,000 in
the week ended Dec. 30, 2011, Energy Department data show.  Biofuel Supply  Stockpiles fell 2.5 percent to 20.3 million barrels from
the previous week, the first decline since Nov. 23, the agency
said in a Dec. 28 report.  The department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , two days later
than usual because of the New Year’s holiday.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  added 0.5 cent
to $2.275 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel increased 0.75
cent to $2.19, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 0.5 cent to $2.245 a
gallon. On the West Coast the additive was unchanged at $2.35.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 0.26 cent to $2.7977
a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
