Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s biggest
coffee-shop operator, will open its first store in Vietnam next
month as it expands into its 12th Asian nation.  The cafe is scheduled to open in  Ho Chi Minh City , the
Seattle-based brewer said in an e-mailed statement. Hong Kong
Maxim’s Group subsidiary Coffee Concept Ltd., which already has
stores in Hong Kong and Macau, will operate the location and is
the licensee for Vietnam, Starbucks said.  Starbucks, which got 5.4 percent of fiscal 2012  revenue 
from the 3,300 stores in China and Asia Pacific, has been
expanding in the region to help boost sales as U.S. store growth
has stagnated since 2009. Asia is the largest and most immediate
retail growth opportunity for Starbucks,  John Culver , president
of China and Asia Pacific, said at a conference in December.  Starbucks, which has more than 18,000 locations globally,
already purchases beans from Vietnam and will buy more coffee
from the nation in the long term, according to the statement.  In October the coffee chain opened its first store in
India, where it has a partnership with  Tata Global Beverages
Ltd. (TGBL)   Starbucks’ shares rose 2.6 percent to $55 at the close in
New York on Jan. 2. The stock gained 17 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
