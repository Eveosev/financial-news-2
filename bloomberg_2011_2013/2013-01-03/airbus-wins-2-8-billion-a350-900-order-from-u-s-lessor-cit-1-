Airbus SAS (EAD)  won an order for 10 A350
wide-body aircraft from U.S. lessor  CIT (CIT)  Group Inc. that’s worth
about $2.8 billion at list prices.  New York-based CIT agreed to buy the mid-sized -900 version
of the A350 for delivery starting in 2019, taking its total
backlog for the model to 15 planes, the companies said today.  Airbus now has 572 firm orders from 34 customers for the
A350, which is due to fly in mid-2013 and enter service next
year. The -900 variant can accommodate 314 passengers and is the
most popular version of the new wide-body, with 375 commitments.  CIT has ordered 253 aircraft from Toulouse, France-based
Airbus in total, comprising 187 A320-series single-aisle jets
and 51 A330 wide-bodies, plus the A350s. The company has more
than 110 long-haul planes already in its portfolio or on order.  With today’s deal, CIT becomes the biggest A350-900
customer among lessors. International Lease Finance Corp. has 14
of the type on order, Airbus data through November shows.  As of Sept. 30, CIT had outstanding orders for 157 planes,
88 of them from Airbus, it said in a statement today. The total
includes 10 787 Dreamliners, the rival wide-body model from
 Boeing Co. (BA) , according to the U.S. manufacturer’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
