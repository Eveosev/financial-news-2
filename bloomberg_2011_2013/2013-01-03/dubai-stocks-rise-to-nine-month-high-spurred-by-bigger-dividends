Dubai’s benchmark stock index climbed
to a nine-month high on expectations improved earnings will
stoke bigger dividends when companies start reporting later this
month.  Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) , which has stakes in more than 40
businesses and is set to report full-year results on Jan. 30,
surged 2.9 percent.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the
world’s tallest skyscraper, reached a two-year peak. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.9 percent to close at 1,681.75, the highest
level since April 5 and taking this week’s advance to 4.4
percent.  “Fresh capital is entering the market, chasing dividend
paying stocks,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based
Al Fajer Securities.  Shares in the  Persian Gulf  are luring investors as they pay
more in dividends than emerging-market peers. Dubai’s stock
index, the best performer in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council last year, with a gain of 20 percent, offers a  dividend
yield  of 3.76 percent, compared with 2.67 percent for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Dubai Investments last year surprised investors when it
paid a  cash dividend  even after posting a 75 percent drop in
2011 profit. The stock advanced to 90 fils, the highest close
since April 5.  Emaar posted a decline in full-year net income in 2011 and
paid a dividend of 10 fils per share, disappointing some
investors. Even so the company’s 12-month dividend yield of 2.6
percent is higher than the 2 percent for  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , a
Dubai-based builder. Emaar’s net income probably rose 15 percent
in 2012 to 2.07 billion dirhams ($564 million), according to the
 average estimate  of 11 analysts on Bloomberg.  Pleasing Government  “There is speculation Emaar’s dividend recommendation this
year will exceed the 10 fils paid last year,” Farhat said.
Higher dividends are “a sort of return on investment to please
shareholders, as the government owns big chunks of these
companies,” he said.  Dubai owns 31 percent of Emaar and 12 percent of Dubai
Investments, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Emaar’s shares gained 1.3 percent to 3.91 dirhams, the
highest close since October 2010. The stock rallied 46 percent
last year, recovering from two years of declines.  Economic growth in Dubai, the second-biggest of the U.A.E.
sheikhdoms after  Abu Dhabi , reached 4.1 percent in the first
half of last year, putting the emirate on track to reach the
government’s forecast of 5 percent for the year, according to
the Dubai Statistics Center. About 407  million shares  were
traded in Dubai today, compared with a 12-month daily average of
163 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
