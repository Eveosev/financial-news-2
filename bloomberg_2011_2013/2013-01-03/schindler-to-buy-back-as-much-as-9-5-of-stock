Schindler Holding AG (SCHP) , a Swiss maker
of escalators, plans to buy back as much as 9.5 percent of its
stock within three years.  Two trading lines on the SIX Swiss exchange will open today
and may stay open until the end of 2015 to purchase stock and
share certificates, the company said in a statement today.
Schindler will propose canceling the shares at its general
annual meeting.  The stock rose as much as 2.3 percent to 135 francs in
Zurich trading and was up 1.3 percent as of 9.26 a.m., valuing
the company at 15.7 billion francs ($17.1 billion). The stock
had gained 21 percent in 2012.  The amount of shares trading freely, currently at 29.9
percent, won’t drop below the 25 percent level required by the
exchange, the company said. The Schindler and Bonnard families
hold 69.8 percent of the  voting rights  and the company said it
doesn’t know if they will participate in the buyback program.  Schindler, which hired  UBS AG (UBSN)  to manage the buyback, will
end the program when 9.5 percent of the equity capital has been
purchased, the manufacturer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
