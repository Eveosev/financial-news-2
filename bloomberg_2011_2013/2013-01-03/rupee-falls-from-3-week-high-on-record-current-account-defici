India ’s rupee retreated from the
strongest level in almost three weeks on concern a record
current-account deficit will boost demand for dollars.  The shortfall widened to $22.3 billion in the quarter ended
Sept. 30, official data showed Dec. 31. The world’s largest
bullion buyer may raise taxes on gold imports to reduce the gap,
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in  New Delhi 
yesterday. The central bank will cut its benchmark repurchase
rate during 2013, according to 20 of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Ten forecast the rate will be lowered by 100 basis
points or more.  “The current-account deficit has been a cause of concern
for India,” said Sean Yokota, Singapore-based head of Asia
strategy at  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. (SEBA)  “The rupee is
likely to strengthen in the second half, when the central bank
begins aggressive easing and the trade deficit comes in a bit.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 54.4900 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
54.2650 yesterday, the strongest level since Dec. 13. The rupee
dropped 3.5 percent last year after plunging 16 percent in 2011.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, fell 45 basis points, or
0.45 percentage point, to 9.70 percent. The rate decreased 190
basis points in 2012.  Exports will pick up in the rest of the fiscal year through
March 2013, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime
Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said yesterday. The rupee
is expected to remain at current levels for the rest of the
period, Rangarajan predicted.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.52 per
dollar, compared with 55.33 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.37 versus 55.21. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
