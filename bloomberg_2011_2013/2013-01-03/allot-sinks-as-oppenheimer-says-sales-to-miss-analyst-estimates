Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT)  tumbled the
most in New York since 2007 as Oppenheimer & Co. said the
Israeli developer of products to track wireless traffic will
report fourth-quarter sales and profit below average estimates.  Shares of  Allot (ALLT) , based in Hod Hasharon, Israel, plunged 22
percent to $14.18 by 10:57 a.m. in New York, the biggest
intraday slide since April 2, 2007. Trading volume was more than
seven times the stock’s daily average over the past three
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Allot lost 10
percent in  Tel Aviv  to 61.01 shekels, or $16.26.  Allot’s business has “decelerated and we expect a 4Q of
2012 miss,”  Ittai Kidron , a New York-based analyst at
Oppenheimer, wrote in a note to clients. Allot may report that a
measurement of future revenue known as book-to-bill was below
one in the last three months of the year, indicating that
“order patterns have softened,” said Kidron, who lowered his
rating on the shares to perform from outperform.  Kidron said Allot’s sales in the fourth quarter will be
$28.6 million while net income will total $5 million. That
 compares  with sales of $31.09 million and net income of $5.5
million, according to the average of 11 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
