Google Inc. (GOOG)  Executive Chairman  Eric Schmidt  may travel to North Korea over opposition from the U.S. State Department, becoming the highest-profile businessman to visit the isolated nation since Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as leader just over a year ago.  Schmidt is planning a “private” visit to North Korea,  South Korea ’s foreign ministry spokesman Cho Tai Young told reporters yesterday, confirming a report by the  Associated Press , which said the 57-year-old executive would accompany former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. Cho said South Korea doesn’t have details of the delegation or timing of any travel.  “Frankly, we don’t think the timing of this is particularly helpful, but they are private citizens and they are making their own decisions,” State Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  told reporters yesterday in  Washington , when asked about reports of the trip.  Nuland said Schmidt and Richardson “are well aware of our views” that the timing for a visit is wrong in light of North Korea’s Dec. 12 launch of a long-range rocket that deployed a satellite into space. The  United Nations Security Council  condemned the launch as a violation of its prohibition on ballistic missile tests by North Korea.  Google, based in Mountain View,  California , doesn’t comment on personal trips by company executives, Google Korea spokeswoman Lois Kim said when contacted by telephone yesterday. Caitlin Wakefield, a spokeswoman for Richardson, didn’t immediately return messages requesting comment on the planned trip.  American Held  A visit by a top executive of Google, which has the corporate motto “Don’t Be Evil,” may be intended to help secure the release of a U.S. citizen being held in  North Korea , said Yoo Ho Yeol, a North Korean studies professor at Seoul’s Korea University. The visit would come after Kim abandoned his usual saber-rattling in a speech calling for better relations with the incoming South Korean government.  “U.S. businessmen have previously accompanied former U.S. presidents traveling to North Korea to secure the release of detained citizens,” Yoo said. “For Google’s long-term interests, Schmidt may visit for business reasons including market research, but most likely it is to financially sponsor channels of dialogue with the North, including Governor Richardson.”  Active Contacts  North Korea confirmed last month it had detained an American citizen after he entered the country in November to lead a tour. The man, identified as Pae Jun Ho, confessed to committing a crime against North Korea after entering Nov. 3, the official Korean Central News Agency reported at the time, without specifying the crime.  Nuland, who said she was limited in discussing the detained American because of privacy considerations, said “we are obviously quite active on this case” with contacts through Sweden’s embassy in Pyongyang.  The AP report said Schmidt and Richardson may travel to North Korea as early as this month. It cited two unidentified people familiar with the group’s plans.  Google’s stock rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday to close at $723.67 in  New York .  A potential visit by Richardson and Schmidt may resemble the case of two American journalists who were detained after crossing the border between  China  and North Korea in March 2009 and held for illegal entry, Yoo said. Euna Lee and Laura Ling were released five months later after former President  Bill Clinton  visited Pyongyang to press for a pardon.  In 2010, former President  Jimmy Carter  traveled to North Korea to win the release of imprisoned American Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who had been sentenced to eight years of hard labor for illegal entry into the North via China. Carter didn’t meet then- leader  Kim Jong Il .  Evil Axis  President  George W. Bush  named North Korea as part of an “axis of evil” alongside Iran and  Iraq  in 2002. North Korea, a military-first state with 1.7 million of its 24 million people in the armed services, has twice detonated an atomic bomb and last month launched the rocket that bolstered the nation’s ballistic capabilities.  Since then, Kim has adopted a more conciliatory tone. In a speech delivered on state television and radio on Jan. 1, he called for economic growth, including an emphasis on coal and metal production, as well as the reunification of North and South Korea, which remain technically at war after their 1950-1953 conflict ended without a peace treaty.  Schmidt, Clinton  Google founders  Larry Page  and  Sergey Brin  included the “Don’t Be Evil” credo in a letter attached to their initial public offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004.  Schmidt has been supportive of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s initiatives to integrate diplomacy with technology. He participated in a gathering of technology executives Clinton hosted at the State Department, visited Iraq on a trip promoted by the U.S. to launch an Iraqi government channel on Google’s YouTube and spoke at a State Department entrepreneurship summit in Bali,  Indonesia .  Google is unlikely to be trying to start a business in North Korea through the visit,  Victor Cha , who holds the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in an e-mailed statement. Still, a visit would be an “interesting development,” he said.  “The restricted control of information lies at the heart of the DPRK state, and yet it is about to host one of the West’s greatest facilitators of borderless information flows,” Cha said. “The new young leader Kim Jong Un clearly has a penchant for the modern accouterments of life.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Sangwon Yoon in Seoul at  syoon32@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Hirschberg at  phirschberg@bloomberg.net
