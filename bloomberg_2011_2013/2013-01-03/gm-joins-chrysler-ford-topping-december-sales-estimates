Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) 
led U.S. vehicle sales to their highest annual total in half a
decade as Japanese automakers restored production disrupted by
the tsunami in 2011.  Toyota’s U.S. deliveries climbed 27 percent to 2.08 million
units last year and Honda’s increased 24 percent to 1.42 million,
the companies said yesterday. At  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC, December sales exceeded analysts’
estimates as they rounded out a year of surprising growth that
helped propel the country’s economy.  While Japanese companies led the growth, virtually all
major automakers added shifts and jobs at U.S. factories
throughout 2012 to keep up with rising demand, helping boost the
nation’s economic growth. Total U.S. deliveries of cars and
light trucks climbed 13 percent to 14.5 million, the highest
since 2007, and analysts said they expect the market to exceed
15 million this year.  “If you want to hang your hat on something that’s really
improved in our industry, it’s the North American auto
business,”  George Magliano , senior principal economist for IHS
Automotive in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “It’s a
shining piece of U.S. manufacturing.”  GM, Ford and Chrysler all topped average estimates for
December in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.  Deliveries in December rose 10 percent for Chrysler, 4.9
percent for GM and 1.6 percent for Ford, according to company
statements. The U.S. automakers topped estimates for gains of
7.6 percent by Chrysler, 2.1 percent by GM and 1.2 percent by
Ford in Bloomberg’s survey.  2013 Forecasts  GM and Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, the two largest
automakers by U.S. sales, both issued 2013 forecasts yesterday
calling for the industry to exceed 15 million deliveries.
Analysts projected 15.1 million annual light-vehicle sales, the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “People are much more confident about jobs; banks and
other  credit institutions  are much more willing to lend,”
Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist for Detroit-based GM, said
yesterday on a conference call. “You’re seeing the customer
continue to come back into the marketplace.”  GM and Ford climbed to their highest closing prices since
July 2011. GM rose 2.4 percent to $29.82 in New York and Ford
advanced 2 percent to $13.46.  Industrywide car and light truck sales in the U.S. rose 9
percent in December, trailing the 9.8 percent average estimate
in Bloomberg’s survey of analysts. The industry capped a third-
straight annual gain of at least 10 percent, a streak last
achieved in 1973.  Powering U.S.  Increased production to meet growing demand within the
industry has been a bright spot for the U.S. Autos contributed
14 percent of the 2.2 percent average rate of growth for gross
domestic product in the recovery that began in the third quarter
of 2009 to the third quarter of 2012, according to the most
recent data available from the Commerce Department.  Chrysler, which was projected by analysts to lose market
share in 2012, increased annual sales more than any major
automaker other than Toyota and Honda during the year. The
 Auburn Hills , Michigan-based automaker’s Dodge Grand Caravan was
the year’s top-selling minivan, besting Honda’s Odyssey and
Toyota’s Sienna.  Toyota, Honda, and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  all trailed estimates
for December. Toyota’s December sales rose 9 percent, according
to its  website , trailing eight analysts’ average estimate for a
10 percent rise. The Toyota City, Japan-based automaker’s Camry
was the No. 1 car in the U.S. for the 11th year in a row.  Civic, CR-V  Honda sales climbed 26 percent, the company said in a
 statement , missing the 32 percent increase that was the average
of eight analysts’ estimates. The Tokyo-based company’s Civic
was the best-selling small car, passing Toyota’s Corolla, and
its CR-V reclaimed the top spot among sport-utility vehicles
from Ford’s Escape.  The Civic, which drew critical reviews from  Consumer
Reports  after its redesign in 2011, was modified and
reintroduced to the market in November.  “The new Civic that just came out is the best Civic
they’ve ever built, and in terms of new products 2013 lines up
very nicely for them,”  Jesse Toprak , an analyst for industry
data provider TrueCar.com in  Santa Monica , California, said
yesterday in a telephone interview.  Nissan deliveries slipped 1.6 percent, according to an e-
mailed statement, falling short of the average estimate for a
2.7 percent gain.  The annualized industry sales  rate , adjusted for seasonal
trends, was 15.4 million in December, matching the average of 15
analysts’ estimates in Bloomberg’s survey.  Annual Totals  For the full year, GM’s sales gained 3.7 percent to almost
2.6 million, the automaker said in a  statement  on its website.
Ford’s light-vehicle sales increased 4.7 percent to 2.24 million
and Chrysler’s climbed 21 percent to 1.65 million. At Nissan,
based in Yokohama,  Japan , sales rose 9.5 percent to a record
1.14 million vehicles.  Chrysler, which last year announced plans to add about
 4,150 jobs  across five plants, ended 2012 with 11.4 percent
market share, according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based
Autodata Corp. The automaker’s increase of 0.7 percentage point
from a year earlier trailed advances of 1.5 percentage points by
Toyota and 0.8 percentage point for Honda.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , led by a more than doubling of sales for its
 Passat (PSAT)  sedan, boosted deliveries by its Volkswagen and Audi
brands in December by 30 percent, according to company
statements. The average of four analysts’ estimates was for an
increase of 31 percent. The company exceeded its full-year
target for U.S. sales of 500,000 vehicles in November and
finished the year with 577,443.  GM’s Pickups  GM, the top-selling automaker in the U.S., boosted
incentives on its trucks last month after warning it may end the
year with more Chevrolet Silverados and GM Sierras than it
planned. At the end of December, GM had 221,649 full-size
pickups on hand, almost reaching its year-end target of 200,000
to 220,000. Deliveries of the Chevrolet Silverado rose 6.1
percent to 50,699 in December.  Sales of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, marketed by GM
as its top model for fuel-saving technology, surged 72 percent
last month to 2,633.  Ford said sales of the Escape sport-utility vehicle,
recalled four times since it was introduced in May, fell 21
percent to 20,131. Ford Chief Operating Officer  Mark Fields  said
last month that the recalls, which have included defects that
could cause engine fires, weren’t hurting sales of the Escape,
the automaker’s top selling SUV.  Ford Recalls  “In the first half of the month, Fusion sales were
adversely affected by the recall,” and the Escape was in the
“same situation,”  Ken Czubay , Ford’s U.S. sales chief, said
yesterday in a conference call. Fixes were made to the models’
engines by Christmas and the sales pace for both picked up after
the holiday, he said.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  said in a statement that its sales rose
17 percent last month to 59,435. Combined with deliveries for
affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , South Korea’s two largest automakers
increased sales 4.7 percent last month to 98,613. That was less
than the 13 percent estimate for the Seoul-based companies that
was the average of six estimates.  Annual combined sales for Hyundai and Kia rose 11 percent
to a record 1.26 million cars and light trucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
