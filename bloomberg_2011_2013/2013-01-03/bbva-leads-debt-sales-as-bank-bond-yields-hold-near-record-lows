Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
led banks opening bond issuance in Europe after the holiday
period as the global credit rally entered a record 14th month
and yields on financial debt held near record lows.  BBVA, Spain’s second-biggest lender, sold 1.5 billion euros
($2 billion) of five-year bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , the largest French bank, and  Societe
Generale SA (GLE)  also entered the market, helping push sales to about
6.3 billion euros, compared with last year’s daily average of
2.8 billion euros, data show.  The yield on European financial debt is 2.1 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Financial
 index , having dropped to a record 2 percent on Dec. 28.
Investors are snapping up bank offerings as yields on government
bonds fall, with  France  selling October 2022 securities today at
an all-time low of 2.07 percent.  “Banks are always keen to make a start on funding, and
with all the focus on liquidity in recent years, CEOs want to
provide reassuring updates for current year funding when they
announce full year results in a few weeks’ time,” said Roger Francis, a strategist at Mizuho International Plc in  London .  BBVA will report its full-year earnings on Feb. 1, followed
by BNP Paribas on Feb. 14.  The Spanish lender’s bonds were priced to yield 295 basis
points more than the benchmark swaps rate after initial
marketing at about 310 basis points, said people familiar with
the deal, who declined to be identified. The Bilbao-based bank
sold 1.5 billion euros of 4.375 percent bonds due 2015 in
September that were priced to yield 380 basis points above
swaps, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bond Returns  Bonds sold by companies from the U.S. to  Europe  and Asia
have returned 14.3 percent since the end of November 2011, the
last month in which the debt recorded a loss, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data. The longest previous
stretches of gains ending in 2003, 2005 and 2009 each lasted
eight months.  “We’re very pleased with the price tightening,” Erik Schotkamp, capital and funding management director at BBVA, said
by telephone from  Madrid . “This deal shows a group of investors
from continental Europe, who didn’t previously believe Spain
offered the right risk reward, are coming back.”  The deal received more than 5 billion euros of bids from
more than 400 investors, Schotkamp said.  BNP Deal  BNP Paribas sold 1 billion euros of bonds due March 2018
that were priced to yield 75 basis points more than swaps,
according to people familiar with the deal. Societe Generale
sold 2 billion euros of two-year floating-rates notes that were
priced to yield 48 basis points more than three-month Euribor.  The sales come as the cost of insuring against default on
senior financial debt fell two basis points to 125, the lowest
since April 2011, according to the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of contracts on 125
investment grade companies dropped four basis points to 103. The
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50 mostly junk rated
companies, slumped 17 basis points to 422, the lowest since July
2011.  The investment-grade debt market is set to shrink this year
as senior bank bond redemptions of 213 billion euros outpace
sales of 140 billion euros, according to Societe Generale. That
offsets net issuance by non-financial companies, which are
forecast to raise 160 billion euros in 2013 and redeem 134
billion euros.  RCI Tap  Also in the market today is carmaker Renault SA’s financing
unit, RCI Banque SA, which added 100 million euros to its 4.25
percent bonds due 2017. The tap was priced to yield 173 basis
points above the swap rate.  The European Investment Bank sold 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) of five-year bonds that were priced to yield 40 basis
points more than gilts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The German state of Lower Saxony sold 500 million euros of bonds
due 2020, people familiar with the transaction said.  The relative yield to government debt for European
corporate bonds is 142 basis points, approaching the lowest
since April 2010, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
Euro Corporate  index . Corporate treasurers took advantage of
record-low borrowing costs by issuing almost 294 billion euros
of non-financial securities in euros and pounds last year, the
most since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There’s only one word for it, and that’s incredible,”
 Suki Mann , a strategist at Societe Generale in London, wrote in
a note. “We’re off to a flyer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
