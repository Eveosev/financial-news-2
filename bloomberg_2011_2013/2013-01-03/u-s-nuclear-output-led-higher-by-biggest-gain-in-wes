U.S. nuclear-power generation rose
for a third day, led by the  biggest gain  since November in the
West, as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted output at the 1,297-megawatt
Grand Gulf 1 reactor in  Mississippi .  Production  nationwide  advanced 1.1 percent to 94,308
megawatts, or 93 percent of capacity, the highest level since
Sept. 9, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 2.2 percent less than a  year
ago  with six of 104 nuclear reactors offline.  Entergy’s Grand Gulf 1 plant operated at 91 percent of
capacity early today,  778 megawatts  higher than yesterday. The
unit is returning to service after shutting  Dec. 29  because a
turbine tripped offline, according to an event notification on
the commission’s website. The cause of the trip is still under
investigation, the report showed.  An e-mail to Mike Bowling, a company spokesman based in
Jackson, wasn’t immediately returned today. Grand Gulf 1 is
located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Vicksburg.  Output in the NRC’s Western region, which spans from
 Washington state to Louisiana  and also includes Grand Gulf 1,
gained 4.1 percent to 19,904 megawatts, the  biggest increase 
since Nov. 28.  Fermi 2  DTE Energy Co.’s (DTE)  Fermi 2 reactor led nuclear generation
higher in the  Midwest , known as the NRC’s Region 3. The area,
covering from  Minnesota  to  Ohio , increased  output  by 1 percent
to 20,540 megawatts, the highest level since Sept. 8, according
to commission data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 1,122-megawatt Fermi 2 unit operated at 68 percent of
capacity today in  Michigan , compared with 53 percent yesterday.
Crews manually shut the unit in early November when water
cooling systems for generators contained higher-than-normal
amount of hydrogen gas, said Guy Cerullo, a company spokesman.  The plant will will remain at 68 percent until one of the
plant’s two reactor feed pumps, which was damaged over the
summer, can be replaced, Cerullo, who is based in Newport,
Michigan, said in an e-mail. “That work will be done at a later
date, but I can’t give you the exact timing on that work.”  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
