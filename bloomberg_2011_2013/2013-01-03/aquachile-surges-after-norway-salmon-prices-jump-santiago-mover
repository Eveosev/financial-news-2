AquaChile SA (AQUACHIL) , Chile’s largest listed
salmon farmer, rose the most in almost four months after the
price of the fish in Norway jumped.  AquaChile advanced 6 percent to 365 pesos at the close in
Santiago, the biggest gain since Sept. 12 and its highest price
since July 3.  The price of Norwegian fresh salmon, a benchmark for the
industry, jumped 12 percent to 33.11 kroner per kilogram ($2.69
per pound) in the week to Dec. 30, according to data from
 Statistics Norway  published today. It was the biggest increase
since December 2010.  “Probably the rise is due to the price increase,” Ignacio Spencer, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage IM Trust SA,
said in an interview.  Other salmon farmers in Chile also rallied.  Multiexport
Foods SA (MULTIFOO) , the country’s third-largest exporter, advanced 5.1
percent, Invermar SA jumped 10 percent and  Australis Seafoods SA (AUSTRALI) 
surged 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
