Global energy policies must be stable
to contribute to sustainability as demand for energy rises, the
World Energy Council said.  The group interviewed 40 executives from the  energy
industry  for its World Energy Trilemma report about what they
would like from policy makers. The group defines sustainable
energy systems as those that have security of supply, social
equity and can mitigate the impact on the environment. The
executives said they wanted predictable policies, incentives for
long-term investments and a greater encouragement of research
and development.  “We’re taking too long to create the environment needed to
develop sustainable energy systems,” said Mark Robson, a
partner of  Oliver Wyman  and an author of the report.
“Businesses must be assured that the economics of their
investments won’t be destroyed by changes in  energy policy . This
policy risk is a key factor holding back energy investments.”  The World Energy Council also ranked countries according to
how sustainable their energy systems are. While Sweden,
Switzerland and  Canada  topped the list, no country was deemed to
have achieved sustainability.  Next year, the group plans to interview policy makers and
write a report about what they would like from industry
executives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
