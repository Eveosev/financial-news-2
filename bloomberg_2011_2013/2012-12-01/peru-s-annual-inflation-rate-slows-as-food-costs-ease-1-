Peru ’s annual inflation rate slowed
more than expected in November, returning to the central bank’s
target range for the first time since June 2011, as food costs
eased.  Inflation slowed to 2.66 percent from a 3.25 percent
increase in October, the national statistics agency said in an
e-mailed report today. The median estimate of seven analysts
 surveyed  by Bloomberg was 2.8 percent. Prices fell 0.14 percent
from the previous month.  Peru’s central bank has maintained its  benchmark lending
rate  at 4.25 percent since May 2011 on the expectation that
slower economic growth will bring down inflation. Policy makers
target inflation at 2 percent, plus or minus 1 percentage point.
The bank increased  reserve requirements  Oct. 30 for the third
time in three months to cool credit demand.  The  consumer price index  is based on an agency survey of
establishments in the Lima Metropolitan area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
