Hashim Amla’s unbeaten 99 helped
South Africa to a 292-run lead over Australia on day two of the
final cricket Test in Perth.  Amla and captain Graeme Smith shared a 178-run second-
wicket stand as the Proteas reached 230-2 at stumps. Smith
scored 84 before being caught by Nathan Lyon off Mitchell Starc.  Australia earlier was bowled out for 163 in response to
South Africa’s first-innings 255.  Dale Steyn  took 4-40, while
 Matthew Wade  top-scored for the host with 68.  The three-Test series has opened with two draws. South
Africa would retain the No. 1 spot in the International Cricket
Council’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat in the final contest,
while Australia can overtake the Proteas at the top with a win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
