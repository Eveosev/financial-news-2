Serbia approved a budget for next
year designed to trim the fiscal deficit more than assessments
by the nation’s independent Fiscal Council and the  International
Monetary Fund .  Lawmakers voted 138 to 69 in favor of the plan to cut the
 budget  gap almost in half to 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product, or 121.9 billion dinars ($1.4 billion). The three-
member Belgrade-based Fiscal Council, appointed by Parliament,
predicted the shortfall would be about 25 billion dinars higher,
or 4.3 percent. The 2012 deficit is estimated at 6.7 percent.  “This is only the beginning of our fight against the
economic crisis,” Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said before
the vote.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since July
27, has pledged to bring down the widest deficit since the 2000
ouster of former Serbian strongman  Slobodan Milosevic . Serbia
completed the first round of talks with the IMF, which will
probably return to Belgrade early next year for more
negotiations on a new loan when it sees the completed budget
package.  The government plans to spend about $12.5 billion and
collect revenue worth $11 billion next year, slash state aid to
unprofitable public companies and set aside 300 million euros
($390 million) in a reserve financial stability fund to bolster
the banking industry if needed, according to Dinkic’s plan.  Debt Servicing  The government will need 493.6 billion dinars next year to
service all its debt, 25 percent more than in 2012. It will rely
on dinar- and euro-denominated debt sales at home and dollar-
denominated Eurobonds abroad until an upgrade in  Serbia ’s BB-
credit rating at Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. It may
also add seven-year and 10-year dinar bonds to existing
maturities.  The growth forecasts of the new government, dominated by
Milosevic’s Socialists and former nationalists, may be hurt by
signs that  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest economy and Serbia’s top
trading partner, may be tipped into a recession because of the
sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area.  The  Fiscal Council  sees Serbian 2013 growth of 1.4 percent,
based on a modest recovery in farming output. It may reach 2
percent if the government sells its steelworks and a new owner
restarts production.  Inflation Target  Inflation will be 1.5 percentage points above the target
for 2013, or about 7 percent, the council said. The central bank
targets inflation at 4 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage
points through 2014. The government sees consumer-price growth
easing to 5.5 percent in 2013 from 13.8 percent at the end of
this year.  The government and the central bank target a stable
 exchange rate  for the dinar, based on a narrower fiscal gap,
stabilized food prices, a lower  risk premium , increased capital
inflows and improved global economic prospects.  Each percentage point of weakening in the dinar raises
public debt by 0.45 percentage point of GDP. Public debt is
expected to peak at 65.2 percent of GDP next year, falling to
58.4 percent in 2015, still above the legal cap of 45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
