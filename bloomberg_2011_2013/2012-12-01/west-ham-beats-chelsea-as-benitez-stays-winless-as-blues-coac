West Ham came from behind to beat
Chelsea 3-1 and keep  Rafael Benitez  winless as manager of the
Blues.  Second-half goals from Carlton Cole, Mohamed Diame and
Modibo Maiga lifted West Ham to the home win at Upton Park in
east London.  Juan Mata  scored in the 13th minute for Chelsea.  Chelsea has two draws and a loss since Benitez was named to
replace the fired Roberto Di Matteo for the rest of the season
on Nov. 21. The Blues are winless in their past seven league
games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
