Serbia said it has stepped up
inspections of this year’s corn crop following reports that two-
thirds of the harvest has been contaminated by aflatoxins.  The  Agriculture Ministry  “has stepped up activities to
determine the condition of this year’s corn crop” because
severe weather conditions, including drought, may have resulted
“in an increased contamination by aflatoxins,” the ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Specialists from the Belgrade arm of  SGS SA (SGSN) , Swiss
industrial inspection and testing company, said yesterday that
one-third of the corn is safe for human consumption and half is
safe for  animal feed . They tested almost 400 samples, or 10
percent of this year’s crop, for aflatoxins. The toxins are
produced by fungi and considered carcinogenic to humans and
animals.  The ministry referred to the report as “unchecked and
factually ungrounded,” according to the statement.  Serbia’s corn output shrank 45 percent this year to about
3.6 million metric tons, mainly due to poor weather conditions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
