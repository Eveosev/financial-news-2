AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  and  Toshiba Corp. (6502) 
agreed to pay $68 million to settle claims that they conspired
to fix prices for liquid crystal display panels used in
computers for $68 million, lawyers for panel purchasers and the
companies said.  AU Optronics settled for $38 million and Toshiba will pay
$30 million, the lawyers said in a filing in federal court in
San Francisco. The accord resolves claims by digital signage
makers, office networking companies and other direct purchasers
of panels and products containing panels that manufacturers
agreed to set prices, causing buyers to pay more than they
should have, according to court filings in the six-year-old
case.  At least seven Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean panel
makers settled buyers’ civil claims late last year.  Sharp Corp. (6753) 
and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  were among those who agreed to pay
$927 million in settlements reached in December.  The civil lawsuits followed a U.S. Justice Department
criminal investigation of LCD price fixing, which led to guilty
pleas by  LG Display (034220) ,  Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475)  and Sharp. The
companies agreed in 2008 and 2009 to pay $585 million in
criminal fines. Toshiba wasn’t indicted in the criminal probe.  The case is In Re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust
Litigation, 07-1827, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 California  (San Francisco)  To contact the reporter on this story:
