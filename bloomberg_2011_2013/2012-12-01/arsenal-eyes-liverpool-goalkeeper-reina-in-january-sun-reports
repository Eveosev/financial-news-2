Arsenal is ready to make a move for
Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina in January, the Sun reported.  Arsenal is willing to spend 10 million pounds ($16 million)
for the Spaniard, who makes over 100,000 pounds per week, the
Sun said. Liverpool rejected a 20 million-pound bid from the
Gunners in 2010, a move that angered Reina, the newspaper said.  Liverpool is prepared to listen to offers provided it can
secure a replacement, with manager  Brendan Rodgers  favoring
Birmingham’s Jack Butland, Stoke’s Asmir Begovic or Hannover’s
Ron-Robert Zieler, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
