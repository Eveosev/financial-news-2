England upset New Zealand 38-21 to
end the rugby world champion’s 20-game unbeaten run.  Brad Barritt,  Chris Ashton  and Manu Tuilagi scored second-
half tries at Twickenham Stadium, in west London, as England
ended a nine-game losing streak against the All Blacks. Owen
Farrell kicked four penalties and a drop goal, while Freddie
Burns booted a pair of penalties.  “This is absolutely a brilliant day,” England flanker  Tom
Wood  told Sky Sports. “We put our heart and souls into that.”  Julian Savea scored two tries and Kieran Read touched down
once for New Zealand. In addition to their unbeaten run ending,
the All Blacks also lost an autumn Test for the first time since
a defeat to England in November 2002.  Australia beat Wales 14-12 in the day’s other international
match. Kurtley Beale’s last-minute try gave Australia the win in
Cardiff. Beale also kicked three penalties for the other
Wallabies points, while Leigh Halfpenny booted four penalties
for Wales.  The autumn series of games in Europe will affect the
seedings for the 2015  Rugby World Cup  in two days. The
International Rugby Board rankings will be used to band the 12
automatic qualifiers in the 20-team tournament in England, with
the first four placed at the top of the five-team groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
