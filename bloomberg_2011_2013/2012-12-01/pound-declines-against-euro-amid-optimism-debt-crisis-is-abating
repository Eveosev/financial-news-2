The pound fell for a third week
versus the euro, touching the lowest level in more than a month,
as bets European policy makers are taking steps to stem the debt
crisis damped demand for the safety of U.K. assets.  Sterling was little changed against the dollar after a
report showed gross domestic product rose 1 percent in the third
quarter, matching an earlier estimate. The German parliament
yesterday approved the latest rescue package for Greece after
euro-region finance ministers’ Nov. 27 agreement to ease the
terms of the nation’s bailout. Gilts rose as Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  was unexpectedly appointed as the next head
of the  Bank of England .  Sterling’s decline against the euro is “a function of
improving short-term European sentiment over Greece,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in London. “Carney is well respected. I would suggest
the appointment is good for U.K assets in the longer term.”  The pound fell 0.3 percent from Nov. 23 to 81.18 pence per
euro at 4:54 p.m. London time yesterday after depreciating to
81.33 pence, the weakest level since Oct. 24. The U.K. currency
was little changed on the week at $1.6023, after touching
$1.6063, the most since Nov. 2.  Sterling has weakened 1.4 percent in the past six months,
the third-worst performer after the yen and the dollar among the
10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The yen fell 9.6 percent, the dollar dropped
5.1 percent and the euro rose 0.4 percent.  Sterling Negative  “The picture for sterling is going to turn more
negative,”  Ian Stannard , head of European currency strategy at
Morgan Stanley in London, said Nov. 29. “Sterling has been
relatively well supported by safe-haven flows from Europe but
these flows are slowing. That is going to expose sterling to its
underlying fundamentals, which I don’t think are positive.”  There may be further evidence the U.K. economy is stalling
next week, with a report economists say will show manufacturing
contracted for a seventh month in November. A gauge based on a
survey of  purchasing managers  was at 48 from 47.5 in October,
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  will say in London on Dec. 3, according to the median of
32 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  The benchmark  10-year gilt  yield fell seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 1.78 percent. The 1.75
percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.47, or 4.70 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 99.78.  Bank of England policy makers will maintain their asset-
purchase target at 375 billion pounds when they meet on Dec.
5-6, according to all 36 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Deputy Governor  Charles Bean  said on Nov. 28 officials should
keep open the option to expand stimulus.  Gilts returned 3.5 percent this year through Nov. 29,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.8 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
