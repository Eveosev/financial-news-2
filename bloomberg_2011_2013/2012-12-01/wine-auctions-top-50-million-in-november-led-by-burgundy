Global wine auctions exceeded $50
million in November driven by  demand  for top Burgundies as well
as classic Bordeaux producers, data from auction houses show.  Christie’s International rounded off the month in Hong Kong
with a three-part sale which fetched a total HK$108.39 million
($14 million), led by a case of Romanee-Conti 2005 Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti, which sold for HK$1.69 million, and 12 bottles of
the same producer’s 2007 which reached HK$968,000.  Earlier in the month Christie’s conducted the annual
Hospices de Beaune sale in Burgundy, which raised 5.92 million
euros ($7.54 million).  Following are auction results this year from the five
biggest houses: New York-based Acker Merrall & Condit Company
Inc., Christie’s, based in London,  Sotheby’s (BID) , with its
headquarters in New York,  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  of Chicago
and Zachys in White Plains, New York. Internet-only auctions
aren’t included.  Links on auction-house names are to results or catalogs on
their websites, while those on city names are to post-sale
statements where available.
