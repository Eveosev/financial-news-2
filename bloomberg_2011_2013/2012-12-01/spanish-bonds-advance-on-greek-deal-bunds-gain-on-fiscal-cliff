Spain’s bonds rose this week, with
yields falling the most in almost three months, as an agreement
by euro-area ministers to ease the terms of aid to  Greece 
boosted demand for the debt of so-called peripheral nations.  Italy’s government securities gained for a third week as
signs the region’s financial crisis is easing pushed down
borrowing costs at an auction. Greek bonds rose as the ministers
cleared the country to receive a 34.4 billion euros ($44.5
billion) of aid in December. German bunds rallied as speculation
U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach agreement on avoiding the
fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts boosted demand
for the region’s safest assets.  “It’s a case of two factors being in play,” said Richard McGuire, a senior rates strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “One being concern over the U.S. fiscal cliff ensuring
that there is a bit for safe havens, and the second is money
being put to work in Spain and  Italy  being triggered by a
decline in specific concerns related to  Europe .”  The Spanish 10-year yield fell 30 basis points, or 0.30
percentage point, this week to 5.32 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday, the biggest decline since the period ended Sept. 7.
The 5.85 percent note due in January 2022 gained 2.17, or 21.70
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 103.765.  Similar-maturity Italian yields dropped 25 basis points to
4.50 percent after declining to 4.47 percent on Nov. 29, the
lowest level since December 2010.  Greece Agreement  European officials meeting in Brussels announced on Nov. 27
they would cut the rates on Greek bailout loans, suspend
interest payments, give the nation more time to repay, and
engineer a bond buyback.  Greek bonds  due in February 2023 rose for a fourth week,
with the yield dropping 35 basis points to 16.13 percent. The
price increased to 35.27 percent of face value.  Italy sold 3 billion euros of its benchmark 10-year bonds
on Nov. 29 at a yield of 4.45 percent, the lowest since November
2010. The Rome-based Treasury also sold 3 billion euros of a
five-year note at 3.23 percent, the least since October 2010.  Bunds advanced  as U.S. Congressional Republicans dug in to
fight President  Barack Obama ’s plan to avert the fiscal cliff,
rejecting his tax-and-spending proposal.  The German 10-year yield declined five basis points this
week to 1.39 percent.  Austria ’s  10-year yield  dropped to a record 1.732 percent
this week and  Belgium ’s fell to 2.15 percent, the least since
Bloomberg began collecting data on the securities in 1993.  The European Central Bank meets to decide monetary policy
on Dec. 6. Spain is scheduled to auction bonds due in 2015, 2019
and 2022 on Dec. 5, and  Germany  will sell two-year notes.  France
