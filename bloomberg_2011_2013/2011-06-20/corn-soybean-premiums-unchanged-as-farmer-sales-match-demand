Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in June to terminals near  New Orleans  were unchanged
relative to Chicago futures as sales by farmers matched export
demand.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 60 cents to 62 cents a bushel above July futures, the
same as on June 17, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
The soybean basis was 75 cents to 80 cents a bushel above the
July contract.  “Commercial grain demand is steady and farmers are selling
just enough to keep export supplies adequate,” said Scott Stoller, a cash-grain merchandiser for Michlig Agricenter Inc.
in Manlius,  Illinois . “The cash markets are in a holding
pattern, waiting for clues about the summer weather” after
rains delayed planting and flooded large tracts of cropland,
Stoller said.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.25 cent to $7.005 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last week, the price
tumbled 11 percent, after reaching a record $7.9975 on June 10.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 2.75 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.3575 a bushel. The contract dropped 3.9 percent
last week, the most in six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
