The U.K. government is considering
delaying raising the retirement age for women, the Financial
Times reported, citing Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.  The government had planned to announce raising the
retirement age for women from 60 to 62 as an initial step toward
setting 66 as the retirement age; Duncan Smith said heâ€™d look at
ways of softening the blow, the newspaper said.
