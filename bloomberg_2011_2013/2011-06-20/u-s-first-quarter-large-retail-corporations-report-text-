corporations with assets of $50 million and over totaled $16.1
billion, down $6.2 (+/-0.1) billion from the after-tax profits
of $22.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter 2010, but up
$0.4 (+/-0.1) billion from the after-tax profits of $15.7
billion recorded in the first quarter of 2010.  Sales in the first quarter of 2011, at $554.6 billion, were

equity in the first quarter of 2011 was 14.3 percent, down 5.5
