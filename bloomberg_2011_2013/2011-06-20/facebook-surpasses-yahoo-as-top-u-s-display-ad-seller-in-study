Facebook Inc., the world’s most
popular social-networking service, is set to overtake search
engine  Yahoo! Inc. this year to seize the biggest share of the
U.S. online display advertising market, a study found.  Palo Alto , California-based Facebook will reap $2.19
billion in display ads sales this year, for a 17.7 percent share
of the U.S. market, topping Yahoo’s 13.1 percent, according to a
report today from Internet research firm  EMarketer Inc.   Facebook, with more than half a billion users, has lured
advertisers such as Coca-Cola Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Adidas AG. The social-network’s display ad revenue more than
doubled in each of the past two years, and will surge 81 percent
in 2011, EMarketer estimated.  “Facebook’s supreme popularity -- both in terms of numbers
of people and amount of time they spend there -- creates a
plethora of display ad impressions, mainly for its unique form
of banners,” said David Hallerman, an EMarketer analyst, in the
report. “That popularity is also boosting what advertisers will
pay for its display ads.”  Google Inc. (GOOG)  is projected to increase its display ad sales
by 34 percent this year, and capture 9.3 percent of the U.S.
market, the report projected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
