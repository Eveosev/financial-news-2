Natural gas futures dropped for a
sixth day in  New York  on forecasts of moderating temperatures
that would limit demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas declined after companies including MDA EarthSat Weather
in Rockville,  Maryland , predicted mostly normal temperatures
across the continental U.S. from June 25 through June 29.  “The dominating factor is always the weather, and if
temperatures are moderating, that’s going to provide some
downward pressure for the market,” said Brad Florer, a trader
at Kottke Associates LLC, an energy trading company in
Louisville,  Kentucky .  Natural gas for July delivery fell 0.8 cent to settle at
$4.317 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 14 percent from a
year ago.  Prices earlier rose as much as 1.2 percent on forecasts of
hotter-than-normal weather in the central U.S. from June 30
through July 4.  The high temperature in New York on June 28 may be 81
degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 1 below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
Houston may be 94 degrees, 2 above normal.  Hot weather forecast for this week along the East Coast
won’t be as severe as two weeks ago, and there probably won’t be
any heat waves for the region into July, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  “Hot weather in the short-term is still expected to be
much less impressive than the event two weeks ago in the Midwest
and East,” Rogers, who is based in Bethesda, Maryland, said in
a note to clients today. “Otherwise, the six-to-15-day period
is still lacking significant heat potential in the Midwest,
East, and South.”  Air Conditioning  Cooling demand in the north-central U.S. may be 7 percent
below normal from June 26 through June 30,  David Salmon , a
meteorologist at Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , said
in a note to clients today.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Gas inventories are below average levels for this time of
year. Stockpiles rose 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended
June 10 to 2.256 trillion, 3.3 percent below the five-year
average for the week and 10.9 percent below year-earlier levels,
according to the Energy Department.  Rig Report  The number of U.S. natural gas rigs dropped by nine to 870
last week, the lowest level since May 20, according to data
released June 17 by Baker Hughes Inc.  The combined oil and gas rig count rose by five to 1,860,
the highest level since November 2008, the Baker Hughes data
showed.  Oil rigs jumped by 15 to 984, the ninth consecutive time
the count has reached the highest level since at least 1987,
according to the Houston-based company.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
202,242 as of 2:38 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 316,000. Volume was 263,673 on June 17. Open interest was
991,893. The three-month average open interest is 951,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
