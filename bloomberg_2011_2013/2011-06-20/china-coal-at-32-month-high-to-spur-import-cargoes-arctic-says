Rising power-station coal prices in
 China  may bolster imports of the fuel from Australia, causing
shipping costs to strengthen, Arctic Securities ASA said.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) at Qinhuangdao port gained 0.6 percent to between
840 yuan ($130) and 855 yuan a metric ton over the past week,
data from China Coal Transport and Distribution Association
show. That’s the highest since October 2008.  The export price for the fuel in Newcastle, Australia, is
$12 a ton cheaper, Oslo-based Arctic analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said in an e-mailed report today. That may be
“conducive to imports” and have a “positive impact” on
demand for capesize ships that also transport  iron ore , he
wrote.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping
costs, has declined 20 percent this year to 1,423 points,
according to the Baltic Exchange Ltd. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
