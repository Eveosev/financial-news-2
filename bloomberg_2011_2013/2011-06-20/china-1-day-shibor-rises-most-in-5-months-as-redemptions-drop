China ’s one-day Shanghai interbank
offered rate, or Shibor, surged the most in five months on
speculation cash supplies will become tighter as redemptions of
central bank bills decline this week.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of interbank funding
availability, rose for a fourth day as an increase in bank
reserve ratios, announced last week, took effect. Some 88
billion yuan ($13.6 billion) of central bank bills and
 repurchase agreements  will mature this week, compared with 115
billion yuan the week before, said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-
income strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  “The cash squeeze worsened today because it’s the reserve
ratio payment day,” said Guo Caomin, a Shanghai-based bond
analyst at Industrial Bank Co. “Due to the small amount of
maturing bills we probably won’t see an obvious easing of the
liquidity shortage this week.”  The one-day Shibor jumped 297 basis points, or 2.97
percentage points, to 6.96 percent, according to a fixing rate
published at 11:30 a.m. in  Shanghai  by the National Interbank
Funding Center. That was the biggest increase since Jan. 20.  The seven-day repo, which measures interbank funding
availability, jumped 80 basis points to 7.51 percent as of 4:20
p.m. in Shanghai, the highest level since Jan. 31, according to
a weighted average rate compiled by the Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank will deposit 50 billion yuan with
commercial banks for nine months from tomorrow, according to a
statement on its website June 16.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined six
basis points to 3.77 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
dropped two basis points to 3.57 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Sandy Hendry, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
