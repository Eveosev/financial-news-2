Ambareesh Baliga, chief operating
officer at Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt., comments on the decline in
Indian stocks after Business Standard reported that the South
Asian nation will seek to tax  capital gains  on investments made
through Mauritius as negotiations on its taxation treaty with
the island nation resume after three years.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
dropped 1.7 percent to 17,565.40 at 10:35 a.m. in Mumbai.  “The likelihood that corporate entities invested in  India 
through the Mauritius route will be taxed in India is the big
news that is affecting the markets today.  ‘‘The corporate bodies that are invested in India through
Mauritius may now look for other  tax havens  such as Bermuda,
Cyprus.’’  India wants to impose a tax because the capital gains are
being made in India, the newspaper reported on June 19, citing
Prakash Chandra, chairman of the tax board. Mauritius doesn’t
impose capital gains tax, the newspaper cited Chandra as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
