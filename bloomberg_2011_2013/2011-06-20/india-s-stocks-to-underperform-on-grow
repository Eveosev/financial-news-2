Indian stocks will underperform in
coming months amid uncertainties over the magnitude of policy
tightening, the impact on demand, the direction of government
policies and the outlook for global growth, BNP Paribas said.  “Indian equities could remain listless with a downward
bias until the uncertainties dissipate,” analysts led by
Manishi Raychaudhuri wrote in a report dated today. The analysts
downgraded banks and auto shares to “neutral” and are
“overweight” on technology, telephone and utility stocks.  The analysts reduced the end-2011 estimate for the Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index to 20,500 from 23,600 to factor
in lower earnings estimates and valuation multiples, according
to the report. The Sensitive Index, or Sensex, closed at
17,870.53 on June 17.  The gauge has lost 13 percent this year, the biggest
decline among Asian benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg, on
concern rising borrowing costs will hurt corporate profits.
Sensex stocks are valued at 14.5 times estimated earnings,
compared with 10.7 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  India ’s central bank raised its key interest rate on June
16 for the 10th time since the start of 2010 to curb inflation.
The wholesale-price index accelerated to 9.06 percent in May
from 8.66 percent in April, the government reported on June 14.  While the  Reserve Bank  of India needs to continue with its
anti-inflationary stance, the extent of policy action needs to
"balance the adverse movements in inflation with recent global
developments" and their likely impact on domestic growth, the
central bank said after last week’s rate increase.  Rate increases will slow India’s economic expansion this
year and help ease inflation to 6 percent “with an upward
bias” by March 31, 2012, RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on
May 3.  India’s economy  may grow “around 8 percent” in the year
through March from 8.5 percent in the previous 12 months, he
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
