The  New York  Yankees beat the
Chicago Cubs 10-4 in the finale of an interleague series at
Wrigley Field that drew 126,283 fans, a three-game record for
Major League Baseballâ€™s second-oldest ballpark.  Nick Swisher hit a three-run home run for the Yankees in
the eighth inning last night to snap a 4-4 tie.  New York scored six runs over the final two innings for its
eighth win in 10 games since getting swept by the  Boston Red Sox 
in a three-game series at Yankee Stadium.  Yankees starting pitcher CC Sabathia allowed four runs over
seven innings for his ninth victory of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
