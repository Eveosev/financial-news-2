Greek 10-year government bonds led
declines by securities from  Europe ’s most indebted nations after
governments failed to agree on releasing a loan payment, fueling
speculation the country may default.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian debt
instead of benchmark German bunds widened after Moody’s
Investors Service said the Mediterranean nation’s credit ratings
may be cut. German bonds pared an earlier gain that pushed the
10-year yield to within one basis point of the lowest in more
than five months, as euro-area ministers put off deciding
whether to give Greece the full 12 billion euros ($17.1 billion)
promised for July.  “Decision-making regarding Greece is what’s driving the
market and giving it a bit of volatility and uncertainty,” said
Rasmus Rousing, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group
AG in Zurich.  Greek 10-year bond yields climbed 40 basis points to 17.34
percent at 4:57 p.m. in  London . Two-year yields, which surpassed
30 percent for the first time last week, fell 18 basis points to
28.61 percent. The 30-year yield rose for a 10th consecutive
day, the longest streak since January 2009.  Portuguese 10-year yields rose 24 basis points to 11.15
percent. Equivalent-maturity Italian yields climbed three basis
points to 4.85 percent after being as high as 4.88 percent. The
yield jumped to 4.94 percent at the end of last week, the most
since March 11.  The 10-year Treasury yield approached the lowest this year
and the euro declined by as much as 0.8 percent against the
dollar as investors sought the relative safety of U.S. assets.  Moody’s Warning  Italy’s Aa2 local and foreign-currency government bond
ratings were placed under review for a possible downgrade,
Moody’s said on June 17 in a statement released after European
markets closed. The country faces “long-term structural
impediments to growth,” while “fragile  market sentiment ” in
the region poses risks, Moody’s said.  The spread between 10-year Italian bonds and German bunds
widened to 190 basis points after reaching 204 basis points on
June 16, the most since Jan. 11.  Portugal ’s 10-year spread over
bunds climbed 26 basis points to a euro-era record 821 basis
points. Irish 10-year securities yielded 853 basis points more
than bunds, up from 843 basis points on June 17.  Spanish 10-year yields were one basis point higher at 5.58
percent, leaving the spread over German bunds three basis points
wider at 263 basis points.  Crisis Meeting  Greek and Portuguese securities have both lost 19 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German
bonds made a 0.4 percent return as investors sought the region’s
safest debt, the indexes show. They still underperformed
Treasuries, which handed investors 3.3 percent.  The bonds of the high-deficit nations snapped gains that
pushed the Greek 10-year yield down by more than 100 basis
points on June 17, after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  dropped
calls for a mandatory bond exchange that might lead credit-
rating companies to declare Greece in default.  Ministers at a euro-crisis meeting in Luxembourg
“forcefully reminded the Greek government” to fulfill its
commitments, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told
reporters early today. Decisions on the next payout and a three-
year follow-up package were put off until early July.  “There’s still a whole stack of event risks ahead,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “The biggest issue is the
volatility. It’s discouraging some investors from the market.”  Greek Bond Trading  Greek government bond trading on the electronic secondary
 securities market  known as HDAT dropped 50 percent in May from
the previous month, the central bank said.  Traded volume fell to 695 million euros from 1.4 billion
euros in the previous month, and 1.39 billion euros in the same
period a year earlier, the Bank of  Greece  said today in a
statement sent by e-mail.  The 10-year bund yield dropped one basis point to 2.95
percent, after dropping earlier to 2.907 percent. It declined to
2.905 percent on June 16, the least since Jan. 11. The 3.25
percent security due in July 2021 rose 0.075, or 75 euro cents
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.55  Yields on two-year notes were also one basis point lower,
at 1.51 percent. They dropped to 1.43 percent on June 16, the
lowest since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
