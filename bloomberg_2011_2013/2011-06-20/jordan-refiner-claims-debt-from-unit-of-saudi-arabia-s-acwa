Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co. (JOPT)  said
the Central Electricity Generating Co., in which ACWA Power
International of  Saudi Arabia  bought a 51 percent stake earlier
this month, owes it 337.4 million dinars ($476 million).  More than two-thirds of the total debt accumulated as of
June 15, or 205 million dinars, is already due, the refiner said
in a disclosure on the Amman Stock Exchange  website . Central
Electricity Generating has failed to meet its financial
obligations to the refiner “despite repeated calls,” it said.  ACWA Power International, which develops electricity and
water projects, announced the $144 million purchase of Jordan
Dubai Capital’s stake in Central Electricity Generating on June
2. The transaction was advised by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
and Allen & Overy LLP.  Central Electricity Generating, Jordan’s largest power
company, has  capacity  of about 1,700 megawatts using a mix of
fuels. It produces 51 to 60 percent of Jordan’s total power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
