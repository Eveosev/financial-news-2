A majority of Estonians oppose
giving financial support to European Union member states mired
in a sovereign debt crisis, according to a poll commissioned by
the  Aeripaeev  newspaper.  Some 58 percent of those surveyed opposed such help, with
42 percent backing the assistance, the Tallinn-based newspaper
reported, citing the poll. The survey of 500 adults was carried
out from June 14 to June 16, the newspaper reported. The
opposition mainly came from the more educated, higher-income
urban residents, the newspaper said.  Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said the poll results were
misleading as respondents were not presented with the potential
consequences of denying such help for the whole EU, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
