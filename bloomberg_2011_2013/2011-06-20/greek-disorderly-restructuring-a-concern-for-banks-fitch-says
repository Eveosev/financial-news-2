European banks are more at risk from
a “disorderly” market reaction to Greek debt restructuring
than any losses on their holdings of the country’s bonds,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  Greek government debt held by European banks isn’t large
enough to trigger an “insolvency event” at the lenders, James Longsdon, managing director at Fitch Ratings, said today in an
interview in Seoul. If a “disorderly” restructuring or rollover
of the nation’s debt is followed by a “very, very disorderly
reaction in the market,” that would be “much worse,” he said.  At a crisis meeting that ended early today, euro-area
governments failed to agree on releasing a loan payment to spare
 Greece  from default, instead pushing the country to pass laws to
cut the deficit and sell state assets. Greek Prime Minister
George Papandreou’s cabinet faces a confidence vote scheduled
for late tomorrow amid public opposition to austerity measures.  A contained restructuring of Greece’s debt would be
relatively well “absorbable” by major European banks, said
Longsdon, who covers financial institutions in  Europe , the
 Middle East  and Africa.  Moody’s Investors Service last week said it may downgrade
BNP Paribas SA, France’s biggest bank, and local rivals Societe
Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA because of their investments
in Greece.  At the end of 2010, Greek  government bonds  held by banks in
countries reporting to the  Bank for International Settlements 
totaled $54.2 billion, of which 96 percent was owned by European
lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
