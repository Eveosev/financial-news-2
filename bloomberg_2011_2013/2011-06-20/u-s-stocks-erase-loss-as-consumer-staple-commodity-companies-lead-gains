U.S. stocks erased losses as shares
of consumer-staples companies and commodity producers rose,
offsetting concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening after
leaders failed to agree on a Greek loan payment.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.1 percent at
1,270.1 at 9:47 a.m. in  New York  after sliding 0.3 percent in
early trading. September futures on the gauge slumped as much as
0.8 percent in pre-market trading. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 6.62 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,010.98.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
