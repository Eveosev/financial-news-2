The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
review a decision requiring a  PPL Corp. (PPL)  unit to pay more than
$50 million to Montana for the use of riverbeds under the
companyâ€™s hydroelectric facilities.  PPL Montana is appealing a Montana Supreme Court ruling
that said the state owns the riverbeds and is entitled to demand
rent payments. The company argues in its appeal that the
riverbeds are owned either by private parties or the federal
government.  A Montana state trial court ordered the company to pay $40
million in past rent, plus an unspecified amount for rent
starting in 2008. PPL Montana last year recorded a pre-tax
charge of $56 million to cover estimated payments through the
first quarter of 2010. The company said last month that its
total accrued loss as of March 31, 2011, was $78 million.  The justices agreed to hear the appeal against the advice
of the Obama administration, which urged rejection without a
hearing.  The dispute centers on dams on the upper  Missouri , Madison
and Clark Fork rivers. PPL is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  The case is PPL Montana v. Montana, 10-218.  To contact the reporter on this story:
