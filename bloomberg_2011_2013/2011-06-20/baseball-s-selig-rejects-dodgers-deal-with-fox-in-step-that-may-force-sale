Major League Baseball Commissioner
 Bud Selig  rejected the  Los Angeles Dodgers ’ proposed TV deal
with Fox Sports, a move that may force a sale of the team.  “This decision was reached after a full and careful
consideration of the terms of the proposed transaction and the
club’s current circumstances,” Selig said today in a statement.
“It is my conclusion that this proposed transaction with Fox
would not be in the best interests of the Los Angeles Dodgers
franchise, the game of baseball and the millions of loyal fans
of this historic club.”  A community property settlement hammered out last week
between Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and his ex-wife, Jamie,
hinged on league approval of the long-term TV contract with News
Corp.’s Fox television. That agreement included a $385 million
loan that would have alleviated a cash squeeze at the team.  “Critically, the transaction is structured to facilitate
the further diversion of Dodgers assets for the personal needs
of Mr. McCourt,” Selig said. “Given the magnitude of the
transaction, such a diversion of assets would have the effect of
mortgaging the future of the franchise to the long-term
detriment of the club and its fans.”  The couple have fought over ownership of the team and
agreed to have their dispute resolved through a one-day trial
for Aug. 4 to address  Frank McCourt ’s remaining claim he has
sole title to the team.  Representatives of Frank and Jamie McCourt declined to
comment, as did  Lou D’Ermilio , a spokesman for Fox Sports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
