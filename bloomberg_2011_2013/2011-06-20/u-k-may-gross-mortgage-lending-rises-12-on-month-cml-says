U.K. gross mortgage lending rose 12
percent in May from the previous month, when it was restrained
by Easter and the extra public holiday for the royal wedding.  Lending amounted to 11.3 billion pounds in May, up from
10.1 billion pounds in April, the  Council of Mortgage Lenders 
said in an e-mailed statement released in  London  today. From a
year earlier, lending was 1 percent higher.  “Gross mortgage lending in May recovered after low
activity levels in April,” CML Director General Michael Coogan
said in the statement. “Distorting effects from Easter and bank
holidays cloud the current picture, but the likelihood seems to
be for essentially flat levels of lending over the next couple
of months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
