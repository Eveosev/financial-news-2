Natural gas deliveries to U.S.  power
plants  were set to gain for a second day on forecasts of warmer
weather in the North and East.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation rose 3 percent to 18 million dekatherms (17.5 billion
cubic feet) from yesterdayâ€™s 17.5 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg as of noon in New York. Gas deliveries to
New York increased by 11 percent.  Cooling demand in New York, Detroit and Washington will be
more than 30 percent above normal levels until at least June 27,
according to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather
Derivatives. Power plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  The high temperature in New York today may be 83 degrees
Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), 3 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. Detroit may
reach 87 degrees tomorrow, 7 degrees above normal.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.5 percent to
22.2 million dekatherms after a 16 percent drop yesterday.  Prices at the Transco-Z6 hub, which delivers gas to the New
York City region, dropped 2 percent to $4.74 per million British
thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange  on June 17.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
