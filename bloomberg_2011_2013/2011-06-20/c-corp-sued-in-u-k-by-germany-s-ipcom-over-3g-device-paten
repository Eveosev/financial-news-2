HTC Corp. (2498) , the world’s largest maker
of mobile phones that use Google Inc.’s Android operating
system, was sued in Britain by  IPCom GmbH & Co.  over claims its
products violate a European patent.  The lawsuit, filed June 17 in the  High Court  in London,
came a day after the same patent was found by a U.K. judge to be
valid and infringed by  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest maker of
mobile phones by volume.  “We offered a fair and reasonable license” to HTC,
Bernhard Frohwitter, IPCom’s managing director, said in an e-
mail. The new case targets HTC’s 3G devices, he said.  IPCom, based in Pullach, Germany, seeks royalties from a
family of mobile-technology patents it acquired in 2007 from
 Robert Bosch GmbH , the world’s largest automotive supplier.
IPCom bought the patents after Bosch failed to license them to
Nokia in 2003.  Linda Mills, a spokeswoman for Taiwan-based HTC, declined
to comment when reached today by e-mail.  IPCom seeks a declaration of infringement against HTC and
an inquiry into how much profit was generated by the company’s
disputed products, according to court records in the case.  Since last week’s ruling, Nokia’s shares fell to a 13-year
low. IPCom claims the patent is vital to the Finnish company’s
handset sales -- a claim that Nokia rejected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
