General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
biggest maker of jet engines, predicted it will pick up more
than $10 billion worth of orders during this week’s  Paris Air
Show  as airlines flock to more fuel-efficient models.  Orders will be a mix of aircraft sizes, with the majority
in the narrow-body market, GE Aviation Chief Executive Officer
 David Joyce  said in an interview today at the show.  “I couldn’t be happier with our position now or coming out
of the show,” Joyce said.  Demand is rebounding for the second straight year as oil
prices rise. That’s driving a push for more efficient engines,
with GE offering a new variant for the Airbus SAS A320neo
single-aisle aircraft that promises as much as 15 percent in
efficiency gains over current A320 models.  GE, through its CFM International joint venture with
France’s  Safran SA (SAF) , is vying with  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s
Pratt & Whitney unit to equip the A320neo single-aisle jets.
GE expects CFM to build about 1,300 engines in total a
a year through 2013, the company said last week.  Boeing Co. (BA)  is doing the “right thing” taking its time to
study whether to upgrade its existing 737 models, the world’s
best-selling aircraft, or build a new plane, Joyce said.  “My hat’s off to them in this environment, with everyone
asking them what they’re going to do, taking the time,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
