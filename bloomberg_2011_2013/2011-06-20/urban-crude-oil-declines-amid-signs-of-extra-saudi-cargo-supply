Middle East crude oil for sale to
 Asia  fell amid signs that Saudi Arabia is offering additional
crude supplies to Asian refiners.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Murban  for August loading
slid 3 cents to a discount of 13 cents a barrel below its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gap since Aug. 2. Qatar Land slumped to 25
cents below its official level, also its biggest discount since
Aug. 2, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, was said to
have sold additional crude cargoes to refiners in Asia,
depressing prices for other Middle East crude. Declining
processing profits may also be curbing refiners’ demand. A plant
running  Saudi Arabia ’s Arab Light crude through units capable of
upgrading  fuel oil  into gasoline and diesel made $1.27 a barrel
on June 17, down from $3.91 a week before, according to data
from Bloomberg and EnSys Energy.  “The market thus seems in for more than ample supplies of
heavy-sour crude in the coming period, promising to have a
bearish impact on regional spot differentials,” JBC Energy
GmbH, a Vienna-based consultant, said in an e-mailed report.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell $1.18, or 1.1
percent, to $105.90 barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
oil for loading in August declined 1.1 percent to $105.53.
Murban decreased 1.1 percent to $110.37.  Oman futures for August delivery dropped $1.11 to $106.09 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:06 p.m. Singapore
time, with 934 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$106.37 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker versus the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed 41
cents to $6 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates,
a broker. The front-month contract has averaged $5.77 this year.
The exchange for swaps for September fell 34 cents to $5.62 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
