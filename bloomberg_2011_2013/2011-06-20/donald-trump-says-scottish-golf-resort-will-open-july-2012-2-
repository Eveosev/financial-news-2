Donald Trump  said his new golf
resort in northeast  Scotland  will open in July 2012 with
bookings being taken from next month.  “I would love to have  Sean Connery  cut the ribbon or hit
the first shot,” Trump told reporters in Aberdeen today. He
declined to give a date for the opening of the hotel and
apartment complex at the resort, adding that “the timing will
depend on the markets.”  Trump is on a three-day visit to Scotland and will finalize
details on the shape of the tees, fairways and greens. He also
plans to sort out the final specifications of the practice
facilities and agree the location of the clubhouse. Trump’s
company started building the course a year ago on the 1,400 acre
(567 hectare) Menie estate north of Aberdeen.  The 65-year-old Trump, whose mother is Scottish, first
identified the coastal site as a potential 750 million-pound
($1.2 billion) golf resort in 2005 and battled for five years
for consent to build two courses, a 450-bed five-star hotel, 500
homes and 950 short-term rental apartments.  The Scottish government intervened in 2007 after local
councilors rejected the proposal. Following a public inquiry,
the government approved it in principle in November 2008 after
planning inspectors attached 40 conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
