German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said a new bailout package for  Greece  must aim to
secure a “substantial” contribution by bondholders.  “We have to talk with the involved institutions” about a
substantial contribution to a second aid package, Schaeuble told
reporters before a meeting of European finance ministers in
Luxembourg today. “There’s a fine line. I’ve been saying that
for weeks. On the one hand it has to be voluntary, because it
would have consequences otherwise; on the other hand, it has
produce results.”  Schaeuble said European governments must discuss the Greek
situation “clearly” with creditors. “Then everyone will have
an interest in managing the situation well. That’s why I’m
confident that we’ll reach a good result this way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
