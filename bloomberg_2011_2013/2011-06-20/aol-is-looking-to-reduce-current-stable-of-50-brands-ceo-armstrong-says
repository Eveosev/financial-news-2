AOL Inc. (AOL)  is planning to further
reduce the number of online brands it operates as part of an
effort to streamline the operations of the struggling Internet
pioneer.  “You’re going to see us betting on big brands,” Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong  said in a speech at the Cannes
Lions media conference today. The best-known current properties
of New York-based AOL, which has about 50 online brands, include
the namesake label, news and commentary site The Huffington Post
and TechCrunch, which covers technology and the Internet.  Armstrong is trying to turn AOL around after it was spun
off from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009, undoing a $124 billion
merger. The company will focus on expanding Web content
offerings, particularly in local news, Armstrong said today.
Earlier this year AOL paid $315 million for  Huffington Post ,
which is expanding to countries including Canada and France
while increasing its roster of paid journalists and
contributors.  AOL, which pioneered mass-market Internet access in the
1990s, is shifting to an advertising-based business model as its
remaining dial-up access customers cease their service. Its
first-quarter profit fell 86 percent to $4.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
