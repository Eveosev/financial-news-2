Jonathan Egol, a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. managing director, bought an eight-room condominium with
views of  Manhattan ’s Central Park for $3.72 million.  The deal for the four-bedroom apartment at 40 East 94th
Street was completed on June 2, according to New York City
property  records , which show Egol and his wife, Zina, took out a
$1.1 million mortgage to buy the property.  Egol ran a desk at New York-based Goldman Sachs that
created, sold and traded complex investments such as the Abacus
collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, that allowed the
company and its clients to bet that mortgages would drop in
value. Goldman Sachs paid $550 million last year to settle a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit that accused the
firm of misleading investors in one of the Abacus CDOs. Egol
hasn’t been charged with any wrongdoing.  Egol didn’t return two phone messages and an e-mail seeking
comment on June 17.  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment today and said Egol couldn’t be reached.  The “sun-filled” condo in Manhattan’s Carnegie Hill
neighborhood “features magnificent panoramic open city views,”
according to  StreetEasy.com , a property-listings website. The
property was initially listed for sale by Brown Harris Stevens
for $4.25 million in October. The price was cut twice since
then, dropping to $3.65 million in February, according to
StreetEasy.  To contact the reporter: Ashwin Seshagiri in New York at
