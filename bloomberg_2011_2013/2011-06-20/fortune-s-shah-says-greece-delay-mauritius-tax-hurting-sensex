Niraj Shah, senior vice president at
Mumbai-based brokerage Fortune Equity Brokers  India  Ltd.
comments on the decline in Indian stocks.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index dropped as much
as 556.15 points, or 3.1 percent, to 17,314.38 and was trading
at 17,640.86 as of 11:30 a.m. in Mumbai.  India will seek to tax  capital gains  on investments made
through Mauritius as negotiations on its taxation treaty with
the island nation resume after three years, the Business
Standard newspaper reported yesterday, citing Prakash Chandra,
the chairman of the Indian tax board.  “The delay in a bailout package for  Greece  and the
possibility of India imposing a capital-gains tax on investment
routed through Mauritius have impacted the market today. A
default by Greece is more real now after the Europeans couldn’t
decide on the bailout. This may have a contagion effect on the
world’s financial system.  “The decision to tax investments from Mauritius will take
time, but there’s been a knee-jerk reaction in some company-
specific stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
