India’s  Ministry of Railways  will
start a 100 billion-rupee ($2.2 billion) domestic sale of tax-
free bonds by September to help upgrade and expand  Asia ’s oldest
train network.  The offering will be divided between a private placement
and a later tranche for retail investors, Rajendra Kashyap,
managing director of finance arm Indian Railway Finance Corp.,
said in a June 17 interview in  New Delhi . Plans for the money
include spending as much as 53 billion rupees on laying
additional rail lines, 21 billion rupees for widening tracks and
8.5 billion rupees for electrification, he said.  The agency intends to raise a total of 205 billion rupees
in the year ending March, including a record $750 million from
overseas, as the ministry improves facilities to lure traffic
from roads. About 1,300 kilometers of (808 miles) of new lines
are due to be laid this year to meet rising travel and freight
demand in the world’s second-fastest growing major economy.  Overseas, the finance unit’s plans include a $200 million
 term loan  and a $300 million bond sale, Kashyap said. The funds
will primarily be used to buy 18,000 cars for hauling iron,
steel, cement and other cargo, he said.  “We’ve tested the market and we got some very encouraging
offers,” he said. The finance unit, which employs 20 people,
raised $740 million outside India in the year ended March.  The agency sold a $200 million bond in March. The 5-year
4.406 percent note yields 3.765 percent, according to Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc prices on the Bloomberg.  Borrowing Overseas  Increased fundraising from overseas has helped pare
borrowing costs, Kashyap said. Last fiscal year, the agency
reduced its average borrowing cost to 7.6 percent from 7.7
percent a year earlier, he said. It raised a total 97.9 billion
rupees in the period.  India  is expanding railways to ease road traffic and
pollution. The government wants rail to account for 50 percent
of inland freight movements by 2020. Trains had a 35 percent
share in 2009, according to the  rail ministry .  Rail-freight traffic grew an average 7.2 percent in the six
years ended March 2009, trailing economic expansion at an annual
pace of 7.9 percent, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
