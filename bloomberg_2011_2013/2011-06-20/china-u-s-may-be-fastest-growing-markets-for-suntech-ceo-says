Suntech Power Holdings Co., the
world’s largest solar panel maker, expects  China  and the U.S. to
be its fastest-growing markets this year, Chief Executive
Officer Shi Zhengrong said.  Solar power will be the main renewable energy source in
China over the next 10 years, Shi said in an interview at a
forum in Seoul. He said the company is also investing in the
U.S. where it has created 2,000 jobs.  “More and more governments will initiate policy to support
solar,” Shi said, adding that he expects $60 billion to be
invested globally in solar energy to produce 18 gigawatts of
capacity by 2020.  The company generated 66 percent of its revenue in  Europe ,
15 percent in the U.S. and 5.3 percent in China in 2010,
according to Bloomberg data. Suntech cut manufacturing costs by
70 percent to 15 cents per kilowatt from 2001, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
