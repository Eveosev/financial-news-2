Natural gas futures gained for the
first time in six days on forecasts of above-normal temperatures
that may increase demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas futures climbed as much as 1.1 percent after
forecasters including MDA EarthSat Weather in Rockville,
 Maryland , predicted hotter-than-normal weather in the central
U.S. from June 30 through July 4.  “It’s hot in the South, especially in Texas and
Oklahoma,” said  Ed Kennedy , a trader at INTL Hencorp Futures LC
in Miami. “But we’re going to need a change in supply and
demand to break out of this trading range, and I don’t see it
yet.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 0.4 cent to $4.329 per
million British thermal units at 12:24 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 1.7 percent this
year.  Gas futures had dropped to $4.279, the lowest intraday
price since May 26.  The high temperature in New York on June 28 may be 81
degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 1 below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in
Houston may be 94 degrees, 2 above normal.  Cooling demand in the north-central U.S. may be 7 percent
below normal from June 26 through June 30,  David Salmon , a
meteorologist at Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri, said
in a note to clients today.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Gas Stockpiles  Gas inventories are below average levels for this time of
year. Stockpiles rose 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended
June 10 to 2.256 trillion, 3.3 percent below the five-year
average for the week and 10.9 percent below year-earlier levels,
according to the Energy Department.  The number of U.S. natural gas rigs dropped by nine to 870
last week, the lowest level since May 20, according to data
released June 17 by Baker Hughes Inc.  The combined oil and gas rig count rose by five to 1,860,
the highest level since November 2008, Baker Hughes said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
