Morgan Stanley foreign-exchange
strategists advised selling  Sweden ’s krona versus the Norwegian
krone, saying slower global growth may weaken demand for Swedish
assets while higher  oil prices  boost Norway’s currency.  “In the current environment we warn that the krona is
vulnerable given Sweden’s exposure to the global manufacturing
cycle,” strategists led by Hans Redekerin London wrote in a
research report today. “We expect the krone to outperform on a
relative basis, given that our commodities team still expects
oil prices to rise further this year, on the back of both strong
demand and tight supply.”  Investors should bet the krone will strengthen to 1.20
against the krona and end the trade if it falls to 1.151, the
strategists wrote.  The krone weakened 0.2 percent to 1.1583 against the krona
as of 11:06 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
