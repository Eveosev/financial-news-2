D.K. Aggarwal, who manages about
$100 million as chairman of SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd.,
comments on the drop in Indian equities. He spoke in a phone
interview from  New Delhi .  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index lost 1.7 percent
to 17,562.36 at 2:25 p.m. in  Mumbai , bound for the lowest close
in four months. The gauge slumped as much as 3.1 percent
earlier, the most in 22 months.  “A lot of investments by foreign investors and private
equity funds are routed through Mauritius-registered entities.
Any review of the tax factor on such investments is likely to be
seen as negative. This comes on top of other negatives. The
European crisis is still there. The  U.S. economy  is trapped in
low growth. Funds are not flowing to emerging markets because of
the inflation threat they face. The environment is not very
conducive to the equity markets. Unless investors see clarity
they are not going to return to Indian markets in a hurry.”  India  will seek to tax capital gains on investments made
through Mauritius as negotiations on its tax treaty with the
island nation resume after three years, the Business Standard
reported yesterday, citing Prakash Chandra, chairman of the tax
board. At presentm such tax authority resides with Mauritius,
which doesn’t impose capital gains tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
