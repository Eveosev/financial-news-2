Saudi Arabia  increased production of
crude oil by 1.9 percent in April, when domestic consumption
surged by 36 percent, recent official data showed.  The world’s largest crude exporter’s April output rose to
8.82 million barrels a day, according to figures posted on the
Joint Organization Data Initiative website on June 18. Domestic
demand rose to 1.99 million barrels a day and exports increased
3.4 percent to 6.76 million, according to JODI, which is
supervised by the Riyadh-based  International Energy Forum  and
shows historical data supplied directly by governments.  Saudi Arabia aims to fulfill Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi’s
pledge to raise production to help calm oil markets, after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members failed to
agree at their meeting this month over his proposal to increase
the group’s output by 1.5 million barrels a day.  “Any announcement of increase in production from Saudi
Arabia and other OPEC members will have a very limited impact on
global oil markets,” Anas Alhajji, chief economist at Irving,
Texas-based NGP Capital Management, said by e-mail today.
Exports from Saudi Arabia and OPEC are increasing only slightly
as domestic consumption rises, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
