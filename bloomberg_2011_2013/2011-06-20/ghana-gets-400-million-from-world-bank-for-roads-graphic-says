Ghana  will receive  $400 million  from
the  World Bank  to complete four road projects in Accra, the
capital, and Kumasi, the second-biggest city, the Daily Graphic
reported.  The Washington-based lender will also provide $100 million
for a sanitation and water supply project in the capital, the
Accra-based newspaper said, citing John Jinapor, spokesman for
Vice President John Mahama.  The agreements were the outcome of a meeting held between
the bank and Ghanaian officials led by Mahama in Washington
D.C., the Daily Graphic said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
