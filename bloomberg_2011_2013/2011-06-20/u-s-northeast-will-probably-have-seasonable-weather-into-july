Hot weather forecast for this week
along the East Coast won’t be as severe as two weeks ago, and
there probably won’t be any heat waves for the region into July,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  This week’s highest temperatures will be in central and
southern  California , where Sacramento may reach 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), Rogers said in a note to clients today.
From June 24 to July 4, however, East Coast weather should be
seasonal.  “Hot weather in the short-term is still expected to be
much less impressive than the event two weeks ago in the Midwest
and East,” said Rogers, who is based in Bethesda, Maryland.
“Otherwise, the 6-15-day period is still lacking significant
heat potential in the Midwest, East, and South.”  Natural-gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures.  Gas had its first weekly decline since mid-May last week on
forecasts of moderating temperatures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
