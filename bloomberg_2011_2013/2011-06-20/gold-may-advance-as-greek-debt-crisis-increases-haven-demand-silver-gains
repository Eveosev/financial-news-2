Gold may gain for a second day in
London as concern about Greece’s debt crisis spurs demand for
the metal as an alternative investment.  European governments failed to agree on releasing a loan
payment to spare Greece from default, ramping up pressure on
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  to first deliver budget cuts in
the face of domestic opposition. Gold is trading 2.6 percent
below a record set last month.  “We are still far from certain on the future of mounting
peripheral debt costs in the monetary union,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said today in
a report. “The political situation in  Athens  remains explosive.
We prefer the upside” for gold.  Immediate-delivery gold fell $2.15, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,537.30 an ounce by 11:19 a.m. in London. Gold for August
delivery was little changed at $1,537.90 an ounce on the Comex
in  New York .  Bullion was little changed at $1,537 an ounce in the
morning “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, from $1,537.50 at the afternoon fixing on June 17.  Papandreou kicked off a three-day debate yesterday on a
confidence motion in his government.  Greece  needs parliamentary
approval of a 78 billion-euro ($111 billion) package of budget
cuts to ensure the payment of a fifth loan under last year’s 110
billion-euro bailout.  Euro-area finance ministers today pushed Greece to pass
laws to cut the deficit and sell state assets, and left open
whether the country will get the full 12 billion euros promised
for next month.  ‘Bated’ Breath  “Uncertainty is keeping gold well supported at the
moment,”  Darren Heathcote , head of trading at Investec Bank
( Australia ) Ltd., said by phone. “The market’s waiting with
bated breath to see what comes out of the European discussions
on Greece.”  Gold is up 8.2 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades.
 Europe ’s debt crisis helped bullion reach a record $1,577.57 on
May 2. The metal climbed to an all-time high of 954.8418 British
pounds an ounce today.  Silver for immediate delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
$35.595 an ounce in London. Palladium slipped 0.9 percent to
$739 an ounce, after falling earlier today to $738.50, the
lowest price since May 25. Platinum was down 0.9 percent at
$1,741.15 an ounce. It earlier today fell to $1,737.20, the
lowest level since March 29.  Palladium held in exchange-traded products declined 0.24
metric ton to 65.75 tons on June 17, the lowest level since
December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters for this story:
