Softbank Corp. (9984)  Chairman Masayoshi Son said he expects to reach an agreement “soon” on its dispute
over Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s sale of the Alipay online-
payment unit.  Son didn’t elaborate on details of the talks with Alibaba
to reporters in Seoul, where he attended an energy forum today.
Softbank,  Japan ’s fastest-growing mobile-phone carrier, is the
second-biggest shareholder at Alibaba, which spun off its Alipay
business without the consent of Softbank and Yahoo! Inc., the
largest stakeholder.  Alibaba,  China ’s biggest electronic-commerce company, is
“optimistic” it will reach an agreement with Yahoo and Softbank
over the spinoff of Alipay, Jack Ma, chief executive officer at
the Chinese company, said on June 1. Shares of Softbank and
Yahoo have declined since last month’s disclosure that Alipay
was sold without the knowledge of the shareholders.  Yahoo rose 51 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $15.21 as of 1:22
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Shares of the
Sunnyvale, California-based company had fallen 21 percent from
May 10, when it disclosed the transfer of Alipay, through June
17.  Softbank shares declined 1.3 percent in Tokyo trading
today, and have declined 10 percent since May 10.  Alibaba’s Ma last week said Softbank and Yahoo were wrong
in delaying a decision over the reorganization of Alipay, which
he said was needed to expedite the application of an online
payment license in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
