China’s stocks fell to the lowest
level in almost nine months after Nomura Holdings Inc. forecast
the central bank will raise  interest rates  and Credit Suisse
Group AG said the country is heading for a “sluggish landing.”  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. and  Bank of
China Ltd. (3988)  paced declines for lenders after Credit Suisse cut
its rating on banking shares to “underweight.” PetroChina Co.
lost 1 percent as crude traded near a four-month low. Poly Real
Estate Group Co., China’s second-largest developer, rose to a
two-month high on speculation the government won’t intensify
housing curbs after prices cooled in some cities.  “The big picture is that there’s a capital crunch for the
market after all these government tightening measures,” said
 Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River Fund Management
Co. “It’s probably the worst time for stocks now.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, dropped 21.6 points, or 0.8 percent, to
2,621.25 at the 3 p.m. local time close, the lowest since Sept.
29. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.6 percent to 2,874.90.  The Shanghai Composite has slumped 14 percent from this
year’s high on April 18 on concern government measures to cool
inflation will slow economic growth. The central bank has raised
 reserve requirements  12 times and interest rates four times
since the start of last year. The  stock index  has lost 6.8
percent this year, extending the 14 percent retreat in 2010.  Rate Outlook  China is likely to raise rates within the next 10 days as
price pressures encourage the government to end the longest
pause since increases began in October, Nomura said.  The world’s second-biggest economy is maintaining momentum
and “inflation is still high,” Nomura economist Sun Chi said
in a phone interview from  Hong Kong  today. Sun reaffirmed a
forecast for an increase by the end of June.  Inflation is likely to grow 5.5 percent in June, which is
expected to be the fastest this year, the Shanghai Securities
News reported over the weekend, citing Zheng Xinli, deputy
director of the China Center for International Economic
Exchanges. Inflation for the whole year is estimated at 4.8
percent, Zheng said at a conference yesterday, according to the
newspaper.  The Shanghai Composite is valued at 12.2 times estimated
earnings for this year, compared with a five-year average of
18.9, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.  ICBC, the nation’s biggest listed lender, dropped 0.7
percent to 4.26 yuan.  Bank of China , the third largest, fell 1.3
percent to 3.05 yuan.  ‘Credit Overhang’  People’s Bank of China data show lenders face a larger-
than-expected “credit overhang,” Credit Suisse analysts led by
Vincent Chan wrote in a report. They cut their ratings on
banking shares to “underweight” from “overweight,” while
increasing utilities to “overweight” from “market weight.”  The analysts also lowered their 12-month forecast for Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index to 15,000 from 17,500,
and reduced the target for the Shanghai A-Share Stock Price
Index to 3,000 from 3,650. Their estimate for the MSCI China
Index was cut to 76 from 89, according to the report.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil company, retreated 1
percent to 10.66 yuan.  China Oilfield Services Ltd. (601808) , the
drilling unit of the nation’s largest offshore oil producer,
retreated 1.9 percent to 16.46 yuan. Oil for July delivery fell
as much as 1.7 percent to $91.42 a barrel in electronic trading
in  New York  today.  Copper Stocks  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
dropped 0.6 percent to 32.34 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous Metals
Group Co., the second largest, slid 3.1 percent to 21.35 yuan.  Copper in  London  dropped for the third time in four days on
concern  Greece ’s debt crisis may worsen after euro-area finance
ministers failed to reach an agreement on disbursement of aid to
the country. The metal for three-month delivery on the London
Metal Exchange fell as much as 1.3 percent to $8,980 a metric
ton.  Poly Real Estate gained 2.9 percent to 10.43 yuan, the
highest close since April 22.  China  Vanke Co., the nation’s
biggest listed property developer, rose 1.6 percent to 8.18
yuan. Gemdale Corp. added 1.3 percent to 6.15 yuan.  Existing home prices in May fell from the previous month in
23 of 70 cities measured, the National Bureau of Statistics said
June 18. That’s more than the 16 cities that posted declines in
April, it said. Existing home prices in Beijing fell 0.2 percent
from April while those in Shanghai increased 0.2 percent,
according to the bureau.  Citic Securities Co. said it has turned “positive” on
China stocks, citing government measures to finance construction
of affordable housing as well as water conservancy projects and
to support small companies. The brokerage had been “cautious”
about the nation’s stocks since April.  The measures will offset a slowdown in the economy as
growth in the third quarter is expected to hit a “low ebb,”
analysts led by Xi Feng at the brokerage wrote in a report
today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
