Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., one
of  China ’s biggest solar equipment makers, said it is prepared
for an industry-wide capacity glut and that its narrowing profit
margins are good for consumers.  Declining solar panel prices “isn’t a bad thing, it’s a
good thing,” Chief Executive Officer Miao Liansheng told
reporters in Baoding, China today. Chief Financial Officer Li
Zongwei, at the same event, said Yingli is “looking forward to
what will happen after the downturn because we are well prepared
for this downcycle.”  Miao said falling profit margins were a positive
development because sales will continue to rise and the downward
pressure on prices will help more people use solar power.  Yingli is adding capacity to its solar manufacturing plants
even as Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts photovoltaic cell
production capacity will be more than twice global demand this
year across the industry.  Yingli has a 36 billion-yuan ($5.6 billion) line of credit
from the state-owned China Development Bank Corp. About a fifth
of the money Yingli is borrowing for the production expansion is
from CDB, Li said in an interview today.  #<101388.23235.2.1.87.23378.96># To contact the reporter on this story:
