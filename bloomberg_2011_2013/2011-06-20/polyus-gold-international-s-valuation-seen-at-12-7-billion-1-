OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia ’s largest
producer of the metal, will have a market capitalization of
about $12.7 billion after its reverse takeover by U.K.-
registered unit  KazakhGold Group Ltd. (KZG) , the companies said.  Mikhail Prokhorov , billionaire chief executive officer of
Polyus Gold, will control 36.4 percent of the company after the
transaction, KazakhGold said in a presentation posted on its
website today.  The combination will create Polyus Gold International and
be the largest London-listed gold producer by market value,
KazakhGold said. Prokhorov plans to step down as CEO and enter
politics if he is elected leader of Right Cause, or Pravoye
Delo, at the party’s June 25 meeting, he said last week. The
question of his successor is “under discussion,” German Pikhoya, deputy CEO at Polyus, said as executives from the two
companies held a conference call.  Billionaire Suleyman Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva will own 37.9
percent of Polyus Gold International, 8.2 percent will be held
by Polyus’ unit Jenington, and the public float will account for
17.6 percent, KazakhGold said.  Under the terms of the takeover, announced June 17,
shareholders of the companies are expected to exchange their
stock by July 18, KazakhGold said in the  presentation .  Polyus Gold fell 3 percent to 1,887.3 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, valuing the company at $12.8 billion.
KazakhGold was valued at $431 million in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
