Exchange on June 17. Coal India was unchanged at 395.6 rupees
and  Sun Pharmaceutical  declined 0.2 percent to 476.75 rupees.  GTL Ltd. (GTS)  , which manages telecommunication

percent to 127.95 rupees, and group company  GTL Infrastructure

The drop was due to “speculative activity” by local investors,
founder and Chairman Manoj Tirodkar said today.  National Aluminium Co. (NACL IN) slid 3.4 percent to 84.2
rupees, the steepest decline in more than three months. The
company cut prices on all products, save one, by 5,000 rupees a
metric ton starting June 17, according to an e-mailed statement.  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)   dropped 4.4 percent to 110.25
rupees, the lowest close since May 26. The Anil Ambani Group
company’s 4,000-megawatt power project in Krishnapatnam in
Andhra Pradesh state faces roadblocks partly because of new
Indonesian laws requiring coal to be sold at market prices, the
 Press Trust of India  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Indonesian coal mines previously had the freedom to reach
bilateral agreements on coal prices with buyers, the report
said. Other issues affecting the project include soil quality
and land disputes, the report said.  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET)   tumbled 10.5 percent to 29.3

of its total holding in the airline, according to SpiceJet.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)   fell 3.6 percent to
1,069.3 rupees, the lowest level in almost three months. The
nation’s largest software services provider has been ordered to
pay 6.56 billion rupees in taxes for the assessment year 2007-
2008 after India’s income-tax office disallowed some of its
claims, the Financial Express reported June 18, citing
unidentified sources.  The tax office disallowed TCS’ claims on items including
state taxes paid overseas and software expenses claimed as
revenue expenditure, the newspaper reported.  Tata Consultancy declined to comment on the report.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)   sank 5.1 percent to 931 rupees
on concerns the company plans to sell debt to fund expansion
amid signs the global economy is slowing. The cost of protecting
Tata’s notes using credit-default swaps for five years fell by
the most since March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
