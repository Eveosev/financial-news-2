Footage from security cameras
indicates that the June 16 bombing at the Nigerian police
headquarters in the capital, Abuja, may not have been a suicide
attack,  ThisDay  said, citing an unidentified security official.  The car that exploded had followed the convoy of the
inspector-general of police into the compound, before it was
stopped by a policeman who directed it to a parking place, the
Lagos-based newspaper said.  The vehicle exploded while it was still moving, ThisDay
reported, citing the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
