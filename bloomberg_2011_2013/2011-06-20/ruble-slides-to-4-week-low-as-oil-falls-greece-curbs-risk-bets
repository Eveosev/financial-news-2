The ruble depreciated to the lowest
level in four weeks against the dollar before paring losses by
the close as concern  Greece ’s debt crisis will spread curbed
demand for oil and riskier emerging-market assets.  The ruble fell 0.3 percent to 28.1424 per dollar by the 5
p.m. close in Moscow, the lowest level since June 16. Ruble-
denominated Eurobonds due in 2018 dropped for a sixth day, their
longest streak of losses since they were sold, raising the yield
three basis points to 6.916 percent, the highest since May 30.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, fell as European
governments failed to agree on releasing a loan payout to spare
Greece from default and  Japan ’s exports dropped in May more than
forecast. Oil lost as much as 2 percent to $91.14 a barrel, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “For now, the central bank of  Russia  is comfortable with
the moderate pressure on the ruble as it makes their job of
preventing ruble appreciation and controlling inflation
easier,” Citigroup Inc.’s Elina Ribakova and Natalia Novikova
wrote in an e-mailed research note today.  The ruble was little changed against the euro at 40.1399.
The currency’s movements against the dollar and the euro left it
0.2 percent weaker at 33.5413 against the basket used by the
central bank to moderate swings that erode the competitiveness
of Russian producers. The basket is calculated by multiplying
the dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate
by 0.45, then adding them together.  Citigroup left its ruble forecast unchanged at 34-35
against the basket this year. Ruble downside will be “limited
by central bank interventions and deposit rate hikes,” Ribakova
and Novikova said.  Russian government dollar bonds due 2015 were little
changed, with the yield at 2.931 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
