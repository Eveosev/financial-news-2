Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar, paring the previous session’s gain, as concern
mounted over  Greece ’s ability to repay debt, increasing investor
aversion to riskier emerging-market assets.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy slumped as
much as 0.7 percent to 90.23 per dollar and traded 0.6 percent
down at 90.20 by 1:07 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, compared
with a close of 89.65 on June 17.  The euro weakened against the dollar and emerging-market
stocks declined for a fourth day after European governments
failed to agree on releasing a loan payment to spare Greece from
default on its debts.  Risk aversion in frontier markets “is having a big play”
in the shilling’s depreciation, Peter Mutuku, a trader at
Nairobi-based Bank of Africa, said in a phone interview today.  “With  risk aversion  foreign investors will want to exit
the country, weakening the currency.”  Greece needs parliamentary approval of a 78 billion-euro
($111 billion) package of budget cuts to ensure the payment of a
fifth loan under last year’s 110 billion-euro bailout. Euro-area
finance ministers pushed Greece to pass laws to cut the deficit
and sell state assets, and left open whether the country will
get the full 12 billion euros promised for next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
