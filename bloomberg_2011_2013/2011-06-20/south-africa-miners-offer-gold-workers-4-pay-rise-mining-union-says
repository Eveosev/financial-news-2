South African gold miners seeking 14
percent higher pay rejected a 4 percent “pittance” offered by
employers including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   The  National Union of Mineworkers  will meet the Chamber of
Mines, which negotiates on behalf of gold mining companies, on
July 5, it said in an e-mailed statement.  “The NUM totally reject the pittance with the contempt it
deserves,” it said.  Gold prices have surged 40 percent since the beginning of
last year, spurring unions to demand wage increases in excess of
South Africa’s inflation rate, which was 4.2 percent in April.
The United Association of South Africa is supporting the NUM pay
demand, while Solidarity, another union, is seeking a 12 percent
increase. The nation’s gold mines employ about 160,000 workers.  The Chamber of Mines of  South Africa  made offers on a broad
range of demands, including an opening wage increase offer of 4
percent, the Johannesburg-based chamber said in an e-mailed
statement.  It was important to be aware of the economic realities in
the industry, with production consistently declining and
companies facing high cost pressures, it said.  “It is critical that the parties strike a balance between
the different needs, and that they therefore need to think
creatively on these matters,” the chamber said.  South Africa’s other gold mining companies include Harmony
Gold Mining Co. Wage negotiations in the coal industry will go
ahead tomorrow, the NUM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
