A violin made in 1721 by Antonio Stradivari sold online for 9.8 million pounds ($15.9 million) to
help victims of Japan’s March 11 earthquake, more than four
times the previous auction record.  The “Lady Blunt” Stradivarius, named after the grand-
daughter of Lord Byron who once owned the instrument, was sold
today on behalf of the Nippon Foundation by auction house
 Tarisio , which specializes in musical instruments. The highest 
auction price for a violin was previously $3.6 million, paid by
U.S. violinist Anne Akiko Meyers for the 1697 “Molitor” 
Stradivarius at Tarisio in  New York  last year.  “Normally in auction you don’t get world record prices
because most people like to sell through private dealers, but
this one’s an exception,” said  Steven Smith , a director at 119-
year-old London violin dealer  J & A Beare Ltd. , before the sale
ended. “It is a great one. It’s fairly immaculate.”  There were two bidders and the winner wishes to remain
anonymous. The price includes fees, the auction house said in a
statement from its London office.  Lady Blunt was one of 19 Stradivarius instruments owned by
the  Nippon Music Foundation . The proceeds of the sale will be
given to the organization’s parent, the Nippon Foundation, for
its Northeastern  Japan  Earthquake and Tsunami Relief Fund.  Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami left almost 23,000
dead or missing and destroyed more than 200,000 homes, according
to a National Police Agency statement on June 20. The disaster
caused as much as 25 trillion yen ($312 billion) in damage, the
government estimated in March.  Today’s sale was the second time the Lady Blunt has set a
world record at auction. On the first occasion, at Sotheby’s in
1971, the instrument was bought by Singaporean shipping and real
estate tycoon Robin Loh for 84,000 pounds.  To contact the writers of this story:
