Nigeria , a favored supplier of oil
to U.S. refiners, plans to ship 12 cargoes of benchmark Qua Iboe
crude in August, one more than July, according to a loading
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Africaâ€™s largest oil producer will also export nine cargoes
of Bonny Light crude, including one of 300,000 barrels, the plan
showed. This compares with the original shipping plan for July
of six 950,000-barrel cargoes and one 650,000-barrel lot.  The July schedule is subject to change after Royal Dutch
Shell Plc declared force majeure on Bonny Light exports for June
and July due to fires on the Trans Niger pipeline. Shell
informed its customers June 13 that the loading program will be
revised. Force majeure is a legal clause allowing companies to
miss deliveries because of circumstances beyond their control.  Nigeria will also ship eight cargoes of Forcados crude, six
Bonga, five Erha, four Brass River, three EA, two Okwori, one
Okono and one Antan in August, according to the plan. Cargo
sizes range from 450,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Schedules of Abo, Agbami, Akpo, Amenam, Escravos, Oso,
Pennnington, and Yoho grades will be released in coming days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
