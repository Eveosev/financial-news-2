ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest broadcaster, sold the formats for drama series
“Danni Lowinski” to Belgium’s VTM channel and game show ‘You
Deserve It’ to Spain’s  Antena 3 de Television SA.   A Belgian version of “Danni Lowinski,” a show about a
hairdresser turned lawyer who sets up shop in a mall and gives
advice for 1 euro ($1.42) a minute, will be produced by Sultan
Sushi, a company owned by ProSiebenSat.1’s Red Arrow unit.
Starring Belgian actress Nathalie Meskens, the program will air
in 2012 on VTM, said ProSiebenSat.1 spokeswoman Stefanie Prinz.  European production houses like Endemol NV of the
Netherlands and  RTL Group SA’s (RTL)  FremantleMedia have a long
history of rolling out shows like “Big Brother” and “Idols”
across multiple markets. ProSiebenSat.1, based near Munich, only
recently intensified efforts, having combined its European
production and distribution activities last year.  “If you’re lucky and you do land a hit, you can roll it
out basically everywhere,” Jens Richter, head of  SevenOne
International , the international-distribution unit of
ProSiebenSat.1’s Red Arrow production arm, said in a telephone
interview.  “You Deserve It,” a game show where the contestant plays
to win for someone else who deserves it, has previously been
sold to  Walt Disney Co.’s (DIS)  ABC Television Network and to  Italy 
and the  Middle East . The show was created by Red Arrow and Dick
de Rijk, who was behind  “Deal or No Deal.”   Acquisitions  ProSiebenSat.1 has also made acquisitions in the U.S. and
the U.K. to step up efforts to bring drama and game shows to a
wider market. The company is in talks with a local U.S.
production company to develop a Dutch TV show for  Lifetime
Networks , Richter said.  “From a strategic perspective, there are two must-have
markets for a production group,” said Jan Frouman, the head of
Red Arrow.  Other than “You Deserve It,” the German company has also
sold 12 episodes of a hidden-camera show hosted by former  Golden
Girl  Betty White to  Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA)  NBC through  Santa Monica ,
California-based  Kinetic Content , in which it bought a majority
stake last year. In the show, based on ProSieben’s  “Benidorm
Bastards,”  senior citizens play pranks on unsuspecting younger
people.  CW Network  “Danni Lowinski” made it through the pilot stage in the
U.S., produced by CBS Television Studios and intended for the  CW
Television Network , which so far hasn’t picked it up. Richter
said it remains a possibility to try to sell the pilot to
another network.  ProSieben still trails its free-TV peer in  Germany , RTL, in
producing and selling content. RTL Chief Executive Officer
Gerhard Zeiler said at a conference in Cologne, Germany, today
that he wants to reduce the Luxembourg-based company’s reliance
on advertising revenue, and increase the share that productions
and other businesses such as e-commerce and games contribute to
about 50 percent of total sales from about 40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
