A Chinese county about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southeast of Beijing has instituted rules to limit
the price of new homes in the area.  The price of luxury homes in Hebei province’s Xianghe
county will be limited to 11,000 yuan ($1,700) per square meter
(10.8 square feet), the local government said in a  statement  on
its website June 9. Properties classified as non-luxury homes
will be limited to a maximum price of 7,500 yuan per square
meter and their average price won’t be allowed to exceed 6,500
yuan per square meter, according to the statement.  China’s State Council, the nation’s cabinet, ordered local
governments in January to set price control targets on newly
built homes based on regional economic growth and incomes.
Government data published on June 18 showed new  home prices  rose
last month from a year earlier in 67 out of 70 cities monitored.  --Emma Dong. Editors: John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
