Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as concern eased that Greece will default on its
debt after Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker assured investors a
solution will be found to the crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
largest camera maker that counts Europe as its biggest market,
advanced 0.5 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
Those of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, jumped
1.3 percent after Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. raised
its rating on the company to “outperform” from “neutral.”
ADRs of Australian oil producer  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  climbed 1.5
percent after crude prices increased.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,430 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,350 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,410
in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.8 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index was little changed in Wellington.  “ Greece  will be supported by European nations in the end,
and it will be able to avoid the worst,” said Kenichi Hirano,
general manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in
Tokyo.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In New York, the index advanced 0.5 percent to
1,278.36 yesterday.  ‘Italy Safe’  Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said he doesn’t believe Italy is in danger amid the euro area’s
debt crisis. Private investors will be present in any second
rescue package for Greece, Juncker told reporters in Luxembourg
yesterday, though he said he doesn’t know if they’ll be
“enthusiastic.”  The yen depreciated to 115.07 against the euro, a level not
seen since June 16, compared with 114.16 at the close of  stock
trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 6.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 1.7 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 3.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for July delivery increased 0.3 percent to settle
at $93.26 a barrel in New York yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
