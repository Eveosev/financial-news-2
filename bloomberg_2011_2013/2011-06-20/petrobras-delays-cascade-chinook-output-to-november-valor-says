Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-run oil company, delayed the start of output at its
Cascade and Chinook fields in the Gulf of Mexico until November,
 Valor Economico  reported, citing a company executive.  Petrobras will carry out additional tests at the project,
Fernando Jose Cunha, Petrobras’s international director for the
U.S., Africa, Europe and Asia, told the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company said in March that it
planned to start production at the fields by the end of the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
