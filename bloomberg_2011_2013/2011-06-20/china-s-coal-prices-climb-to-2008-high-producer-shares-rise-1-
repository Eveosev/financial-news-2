China ’s benchmark power-station coal
prices rose to the highest since October 2008 as summer
electricity demand increased in the world’s fastest-growing
major economy.  The price of coal with an energy value of 5,500
kilocalories per kilogram at Qinhuangdao port gained 0.6 percent
to 840 yuan ($130) to 855 yuan a metric ton as of today from a
week earlier, data from the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association showed.  Industrial growth and rising summer temperatures have
increased consumption of coal, which is used as fuel at more
than 70 percent of the nation’s power plants. Producers
including Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. advanced in Shanghai trading
after the benchmark price climbed for a second straight week.  China’s power demand usually peaks in July to September,
when high temperatures increase use of air-conditioners. The
country’s summer electricity shortage may exceed its most severe
in 2004, according to State Grid Corp. of China.  The benchmark Qinhuangdao coal price has gained more than
10 percent this year, according to Bloomberg calculations based
on data from the association. Prices climbed above 1,000 yuan a
ton in July 2008, a record, along with a commodity boom.  Stockpiles of the fuel at Qinhuangdao, which ships half of
China’s seaborne coal, rose 0.5 percent to 5.8 million tons from
a week earlier, according to the association’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
