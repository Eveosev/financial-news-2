The euro gained against the dollar
and yen as investors speculated Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will win a confidence vote in parliament today, a key
step toward getting more aid for the Mediterranean nation.  The greenback dropped against all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as stocks and commodities rose and the  Federal
Reserve  began a two-day policy meeting.  “The government in Greece is going to give the go-ahead --
they recognize that the market needs to believe that Greece is
going to get that $12 billion tranche,” said Jessica Hoversen,
an analyst in New York at the futures broker MF Global Holdings
Ltd.  The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4408 at 4:52 p.m. in New
York, from $1.4304 yesterday. The euro gained 0.7 percent
against the yen to 115.59, from 114.80, and was little changed
at 1.2111 per franc after reaching a record low versus the Swiss
currency at 1.1947 on June 16.  The U.S. currency traded little changed at 80.23 yen,
compared with 80.25 yesterday.  Europe ’s shared currency remained stronger even after the
 International Monetary Fund  said in a report that  Spain ’s
efforts to repair its economy are “incomplete” and that risks
are “considerable.” It reached its high of the day, $1.4423,
after touching its 50-day moving average of $1.4416.  U.S. Interest Rates  Sales of existing homes in the U.S. decreased in May to the
lowest level in six months, an annual pace of 4.81 million,
National Association of Realtors data showed today. The report
followed data from the New York and Philadelphia Fed Banks last
week showing manufacturing in those regions shrank this month.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will keep its benchmark
interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent tomorrow, where it’s been
since December 2008, a Bloomberg News survey forecast.  Futures show the likelihood that policy makers will
increase the target rate by March 2012 dropped to 21 percent,
from 30 percent a month ago.  “The slowdown we’ve seen has pushed out the expected Fed
tightening,” said Steven Englander, head of Group of 10
currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “We’ve had two
and a half months of data and the timing of expected Fed
tightening is pushed out by 10 months. The market may be
extrapolating the softness for a longer period than they have
any right to.”  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.5 percent to 74.593, from 75.029.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.3 percent, and the
MSCI World Index climbed 1.6 percent. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw materials  increased 0.6
percent. Crude oil rose as much as 1.6 percent to $94.74 a
barrel in New York before trading at $93.40.  Canada ’s dollar advanced the most in a week versus the
greenback. Raw materials including crude oil account for about
half of the nation’s export revenue. The currency gained 0.8
percent to 97.25 cents per  U.S. dollar  after earlier rising as
much as 0.9 percent.  The euro rose versus most major currencies as Greece’s
Papandreou seeks to secure multiparty support for his
government’s austerity measures, a condition for receiving aid
needed to avoid a default. He called last week for the
confidence vote, due at 5 p.m. today New York time, after
opposition parties rejected pleas for national consensus and his
handling of the crisis led to defections from his party.  Budget-Cut Package  Greece  needs parliamentary approval of a 78 billion-euro
($112 billion) package of budget cuts and asset sales to ensure
the payment of the full 12 billion euros due in July under last
year’s 110 billion-euro bailout from the European Union and IMF.  Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker assured investors
yesterday that a solution will be found to Greece’s debt crisis.  “Some of the fears of broader global, economic and
financial disruption as a result of a Greek default are priced
out a little bit, and market participants are tiptoeing back
into risk,” said  Stephen Gallo , head of market analysis at
Schneider Foreign Exchange in  London . “The play leading into
the confidence vote has been to buy euros; the yes vote is
priced in now.”  Implied volatility for one-week Euro-U.S. dollar options
has slumped 195 basis points to 13 percent over the past three
days. It closed at 14.98 percent on June 16, the highest level
since May 6. Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to
set option prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the
underlying currency. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The pound weakened 0.5 percent to 88.70 pence per euro and
rose 0.3 percent to $1.6246 after Bank of England Markets
Director  Paul Fisher  said further bond purchases to stimulate
the economy are possible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
