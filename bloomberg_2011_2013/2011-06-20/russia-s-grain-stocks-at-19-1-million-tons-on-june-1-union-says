Russia’s grain stockpiles were at
19.1 million metric tons as of June 1, about 20 percent lower
than a year earlier, the country’s Grain Union said, citing
state data.  Large commercial agricultural companies held 13 million
tons of grains, including 8.5 million tons of milling wheat,
about 2 million tons of feed wheat, 1.1 million tons of barley,
723,000 tons of rye and 425,000 tons of corn. Procurement and
milling companies held 6.1 million tons, the  union  said.  Some 3.8 million tons of grain were held in the Central
federal district, almost 4 million tons in the Southern federal
district, and 1.4 million tons in the North-Caucasus. Some 3.9
million tons were stored in the Volga area and about 4 million
tons were held in the Siberian federal district, the union said,
citing data from the Federal State Statistics Service.  In the North-Western federal district, 591,400 tons of
grains were reserved, while 1.3 million tons were held in the
Urals, and 54,900 tons were stored in the Far Eastern federal
district, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
