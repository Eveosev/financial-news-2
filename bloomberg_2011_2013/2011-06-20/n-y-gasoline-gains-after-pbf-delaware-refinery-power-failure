New York  gasoline strengthened after
PBF Energy Partners LP reported a June 17 power failure and
emissions at its Delaware City refinery in Delaware.  “The carbon monoxide boiler in the cat cracker lost
power” and resulted in emissions after the  power outage  during
a “heavy rain event,” the company said in a state regulatory
 filing .  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 0.25 cent to 13 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:37 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
1.84 cents to $3.0551 a gallon.  The refinery, with a capacity of 182,200 barrels a day, is
in the process of starting up after being shut in November 2009
by Valero Energy Corp., the owner at the time, because of lack
of demand.  PBF Energy, backed by private-equity firms Blackstone Group
LP and First Reserve Corp., bought the plant from Valero for
$220 million in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
