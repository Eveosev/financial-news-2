Rabintex (RABN)  Industries Ltd., an Israeli
maker of protective materials used by the military, soared the
most in more than three months after a unit won a tender from
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   The shares rallied 15 percent, the biggest increase since
March 13, to 0.323 shekel at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  The company’s Bartek unit will supply motorized-docking
stations worth an expected $7 million through March 2012,
according to a  statement  filed today with the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange. Bartek received a $3.2 million work order as part of
the tender, according to the statement.  Separately,  Rabintex said  it’s unable to make a 1.1
million-shekel ($318,000) payment to holders of its Series Aleph
bonds on time and is working to find a solution so the payment
can be made within 30 days of the June 30 due date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
