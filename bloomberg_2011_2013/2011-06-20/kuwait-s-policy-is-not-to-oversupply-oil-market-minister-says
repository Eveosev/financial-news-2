Kuwait ’s crude output capacity is
3.2 million barrels a day and the Gulf Arab country’s policy is
not to oversupply the market, Oil Minister Mohammad Al-Busairy
said in an interview on Al-Arabiya television channel.  The country is currently producing 2.55 million to 2.7
million barrels a day, which is “what Kuwait’s clients need,”
Busairy said. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will not allow for a shortage of crude supply on global markets
amid fears of a return to an economic slowdown after Japan’s
earthquake and  Europe ’s financial crisis, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
