India  plans to open the second round
of bidding for licenses to build solar power plants “shortly”
and may change rules that limited the size and amount of
projects awarded to companies.  “We want to raise the maximum to 20 or 25 megawatts,”
Ashwini Kumar, director at the Ministry of New and  Renewable
Energy , said today in an interview in  New Delhi . In India’s
first solar auction last December, the government limited the
size of each solar photovoltaic project awarded to 5 megawatts.  Companies that won licenses for photovoltaic projects in
the first round include Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest
refiner, and  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s largest maker of
sports-utility vehicles. Each company was only allowed to win no
more than one photovoltaic project.  The ministry is calling for feedback from the industry by
June 30 to possibly change those rules so that developers can be
awarded multiple projects, according to a website  statement .  India aims to install 1,000 megawatts of solar  power plants 
connected to the national grid by 2013. In December, it awarded
620 megawatts of that, including 150 megawatts of photovoltaic
and 470 megawatts of solar thermal projects.  Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly into an
electrical current, whereas solar thermal technology uses
sunlight to heat liquids that produce steam for generators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
