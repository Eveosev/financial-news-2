Sichuan Road & Bridge Co., a
construction company in western  China , gained the most in almost
a year in Shanghai trading after the company said orders
increased almost four times from a year earlier.  The company, based in the city of Chengdu, rose by the 10
percent daily limit to 8.98 yuan in Shanghai, the biggest one-
day gain since July 2010. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite
Index fell 0.8 percent.  Sichuan Road & Bridge said it has won 11 billion yuan ($1.7
billion)of contracts this year, including two worth 6.2 billion
yuan to build roads in the provinces of  Inner Mongolia  and
Xinjiang, according to a statement filed with Shanghai’s stock
exchange yesterday.  --Emma Dong. Editor: John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
