Companies in  Ivory Coast  lost an
estimated 938 billion CFA francs ($2 billion) during a 4 1/2
month post-election crisis that forced many to close their
doors, according to the Confederation of Businesses in  Ivory
Coast .  Many companies were ransacked or destroyed during the
violent impasse, Jean Kacou Diagou, the head of the group, told
reporters in Abidjan June 17. The crisis was sparked when ex-
leader  Laurent Gbagbo  refused to cede power after losing a
November president election to  Alassane Ouattara .  “We are negotiating with the government to obtain direct
financial compensation” and tax relief, said Diagou.  The Ivorian government, now led by Ouattara following his
May 21 inauguration, pledged to “help companies that have been
hit by the crisis,” said Industry Minister Moussa Dosso.  “We’re considering at the moment the best way to implement
the help,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
