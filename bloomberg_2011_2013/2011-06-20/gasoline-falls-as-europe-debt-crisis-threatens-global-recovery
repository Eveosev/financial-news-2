Gasoline fell as European finance
chiefs failed to agree on a bailout plan for  Greece , raising
concern that Europe’s economic recovery may sputter and global
fuel demand growth may slow.  Futures sank as much as 1.5 percent as finance chiefs said
further aid hinged on embattled Prime Minister George Papandreou
delivering budget cuts on the eve of a confidence vote. Gasoline
has dropped 7.3 percent this month and is down 16 percent from
its 2011 high of $3.4648 on April 29.  “The fear is that if Greece goes down it triggers another
global recession,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “There’s worry
about the  U.S. economy  and how it will perform in the upcoming
months.”  Gasoline for July delivery fell 2.58 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.9202 a gallon at 9:31 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $2.9009. Prices are down 6 percent this
quarter.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 0.4 cent to $3.646
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website. It’s the lowest
level since April 2.  Heating oil for July delivery dropped 2.72 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9561 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices have dropped
3.3 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
