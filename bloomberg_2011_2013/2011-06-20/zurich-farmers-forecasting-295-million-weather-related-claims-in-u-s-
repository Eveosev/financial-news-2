Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
 Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, estimates claims of about $295
million from the tornadoes and hail storms that hit the U.S. in
April and May.  Claims of $200 million at its Zurich North America business
and $95 million at its Farmers Re unit are net of reinsurance
and before tax, the Zurich-based insurer said in an e-mailed
statement. The losses will be recorded in first-half results to
be released on Aug. 11.  An above-average number of tornadoes and hail storms,
mainly in the Midwest and the Southeast regions of the U.S.,
boosted claims for insurers, including  Allstate Corp. (ALL) , which
reported losses tied to disasters of $2 billion in the first two
months of the quarter. Inc. AIR Worldwide, a modeling firm,
projected insured losses of about $7.7 billion to $12.5 billion
industrywide from two weeks of storms in April and May.  The “loss confirms Zurich’s solid reinsurance protection
and in our view is in line with market expectations,” said
Stefan Schuermann, a Zurich-based analyst with Vontobel Holding
AG who has a “buy” recommendation on the stock. The claims
will cut full-year pretax profit by about 5 percent, he said.  Zurich fell 0.8 percent to 213.6 Swiss francs at 9.59 a.m.
in local time, valuing the company at 31.4 billion francs ($37.1
billion).  The Farmers Exchanges, which are managed by a unit of
Zurich, estimate losses of $400 million from the events, the
insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
