At last week’s Citymeals-on-Wheels
“Taste of Home” fundraiser, patrons paid $500 to $1,700 to
mingle with chefs such as  Daniel Boulud  and  Tom Colicchio  and
eat lobster rolls.  The $782,000 that the party at New York’s Rockefeller
Center raised was an improvement over last year’s total of
$684,000. Still, before the collapse of  Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) , the nonprofit that serves thousands of meals to the
elderly annually could count on more than $1 million in ticket
sales and donations from the event.  “The collapse of Bear Stearns has had a big impact on
us,” said Marcia Stein, Citymeals’ executive director. “Some
of those donors have come back, but we lost a lot of people.”  In 2010, the climate for giving improved over 2009, but
nonprofits and charities had to work harder. Last year,
donations by individuals, corporations and foundations rose
slightly by 3.8 percent to $290.9 billion, according to a report
released today by the   Giving USA Foundation  and the  Center on
Philanthropy at Indiana University .  Giving USA also revised its estimates of total giving in
2009 downward to $280.3 billion from $303.8 billion, after
compiling Internal Revenue Service data that showed “larger
than usual decreases” in giving. The IRS “typically revises
its data” a year after it releases its estimates, said Patrick
Rooney, the center’s executive director.  “It’s still a very tough environment out there, and it’s a
very fragile economic recovery,” said Edith Falk, chairman of
Giving USA Foundation, in a phone interview. “What’s so
heartening is that even in periods of economic stress, people do
give and support the things they care about.”  Arts Giving  Giving to arts and culture institutions rebounded in 2010
with about a 5.7 percent increase to $13.28 billion, the study
said. In 2009, giving to the arts fell 2.4 percent from the
previous year to an estimated $12.3 billion.  “I was heartened to see the increase to the arts,” Falk
said. “It suggests that people are once again supporting
culture organizations in their community, which is a good
sign.”  Religious organizations, which had an increase of about 0.8
percent in 2010, received the largest share of giving with about
$100.63 billion or more than a third of all gifts. Giving to
education rose 5.2 percent to $41.7 billion; gifts to health
organizations rose 1.3 percent to $22.8 billion; and
contributions to environmental- and animal-related causes
declined 0.7 percent to about $6.7 billion.  Foundation grant-making declined 0.2 percent last year to
$41 billion from the previous year.  Taking a Hit  “Some foundations are real-estate-driven, but most of
their assets are in the stock market, and since the market has
taken a hit in the past two years, it’s no surprise that this
had a deleterious impact on grant making, Rooney said by phone.  Categories that saw gains were individual gifts, rising
about 2.7 percent last year to $211.8 billion; corporate giving,
up 10.6 percent to $15.3 billion over 2009; and charitable
bequests, increasing 18.8 percent to $22.8 billion.  To contact the writer on this story:
