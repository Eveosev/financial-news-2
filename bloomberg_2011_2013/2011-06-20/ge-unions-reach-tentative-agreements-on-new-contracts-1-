General Electric Co. (GE)  and the
national leaders of its two largest unions reached tentative 4-
year agreements on new labor contracts, the company said in a
statement today.  “We’re glad we were able to reach an agreement and provide
a contract that’s good for our employees and also helps keep the
company competitive,” said Susan Bishop, GE’s director of
corporate communications.  The agreement between GE and the IUE-CWA and the United
Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America includes wage
and pension boosts.  GE is the world’s biggest maker of  jet engines , power-
generation equipment, medical imaging machines and locomotives.
Its total employees dropped 5.6 percent worldwide last year to
287,000 as the company shed some overseas businesses at its GE
Capital division.  The agreements, which would cover more than 15,000
employees, are subject to review and ratification by June 30.
Additional details were not disclosed.  “We’ve agreed to an affordable health-care plan designed
specifically to meet the needs of our union employees,” Bishop
said.  The current contract expires at midnight today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
