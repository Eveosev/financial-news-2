Statoil ASA (STL)  expects production to
grow by about 3 percent a year during the next decade as
Norway’s largest  oil company  expands operations in the  Gulf of
Mexico , Brazil and  Angola .  Production will exceed 2.5 million barrels a day in 2020,
the Oslo-based company said today in a statement. By that date,
the state-controlled producer expects to get 44 percent of oil
and gas output from outside of Norway.  Statoil, which produces about 80 percent of Norway’s oil
and gas, is expanding abroad to maintain output and boost
reserves amid dwindling production from aging North Sea fields.
The company is poised to become the second-largest operator in
Brazil, which plans to double oil output in less than a decade,
and is seeking to add to its portfolio.  The company’s reserve replacement ratio will rise above 100
percent in the “next couple of years,” Chief Executive Officer
 Helge Lund  told reporters in  New York  today. The rate is
currently about 87 percent.  “We have taken deliberate and quite significant positions
in unconventional energy over the last three to four years not
because it’s easy, but because we believe that unconventional
oil and gas are a very important part of energy supply over the
next many decades,” said Lund.  Statoil will focus on developing shale gas in  North
America , particularly in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford deposits,
he said.  Growing Market  Statoil will “benefit from our strong gas position in a
growing gas market,” said Lund.  Oil and gas from sites along the Norwegian coast will
account for about 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in
2020, the company estimated. The international portfolio, which
will also include non-Norwegian Arctic sites and the  Caspian
region , is forecast to produce about 1.1 million barrels of oil
a day, Statoil said.  Statoil started output at the Peregrino field in  Brazil ’s
Campos Basin in April. Following discoveries on both side tracks
of the well, the company said it estimates recoverable volumes
in Peregrino South to be between 150 million and 300 million
barrels of oil equivalent.  The oil company will spend $16 billion on exploration,
drilling and production in 2012, on par with what it spent in
2011. Statoil expects to drill 20 to 25 high-impact wells in the
years 2011 to 2013.  Statoil was unchanged at 131.4 kroner as of the 5:50 p.m.
close in Oslo. The stock has fallen 5 percent this year, valuing
the company at 419 billion kroner ($75.6 billion).  The company in February forecast output will grow on
average 3 percent in each of the next two years, to about 2
million barrels of oil equivalent a day, below a former target
of 2.06 million to 2.16 million barrels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
