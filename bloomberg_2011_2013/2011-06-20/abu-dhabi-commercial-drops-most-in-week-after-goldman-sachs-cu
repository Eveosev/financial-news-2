Emirates’ third-largest bank by assets was lowered to “sell”
from “buy” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The shares dropped 3.3 percent, the most since June 12, to
3.18 dirhams as of 1:16 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. The lender’s 24-month
price estimate was cut to 3.04 dirhams from 3.44 dirhams at
Goldman.  Abu Dhabi Commercial on June 17 signed an agreement to sell
its 24.9 percent stake in Malaysian lender RHB Capital Bhd. to
Abu Dhabi’s state-owned Aabar Investments PJSC for about 5.9
billion ringgit ($1.9 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
