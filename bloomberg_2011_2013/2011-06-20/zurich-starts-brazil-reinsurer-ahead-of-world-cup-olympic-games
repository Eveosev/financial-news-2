Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  will
invest 100 million reais ($63 million) to start a reinsurance
unit in  Brazil  as the nation prepares to host the 2014 Soccer
 World Cup  and the 2016  Olympic Games .  The division will provide reinsurance for its local
business in Brazil written by the firm’s Zurich Minas Brasil
unit and will not provide reinsurance services to third parties,
according to spokeswoman Sylvia Gaeumann.  Brazil plans to invest in infrastructure to prepare the
nation to host the World Cup and the Olympics, the world’s
biggest sports events, Sports Minister Orlando Silva said on
June 15. Investment in airports, stadiums, ports and urban
transportation before the World Cup will total about 23 billion
reais, Silva said. Most of the funding will come from the
government.  “The Brazil reinsurance market is attractive as
substantial investments in infrastructure are expected in the
short term, not only because of economic and demographic growth,
but also due to large events that will take place in Brazil,
such as” the World Cup and the Olympics, Gaeumann said in an e-
mailed statement. The insurer expects Brazil to have annual
gross domestic product growth of as much as 5 percent in the
coming years.  The license for the reinsurance company allows for the
coverage of general insurance and life products, Gaeumann said.
Zurich Financial,  Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, doesn’t publish
its sales figures for Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
