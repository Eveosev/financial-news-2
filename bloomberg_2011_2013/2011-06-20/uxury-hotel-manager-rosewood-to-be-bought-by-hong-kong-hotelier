New World Hospitality, a unit of  New
World China Land Ltd. (917) , agreed to buy luxury hotelier  Rosewood
Hotels & Resorts  for $229.5 million from Rosewood Corp. and
 Maritz, Wolff & Co.   The deal is expected to be completed on July 29, Hong Kong-
based New World Hospitality said in a statement today. The
business, which manages properties such as  Manhattan ’s Carlyle
hotel, will operate as the company’s “premium luxury brand.”  Investors have been attracted to the lodging sector as
hotel values climb, helped by a rebound in U.S. business and
leisure travel. Revenue per available room, an industry measure
of occupancy and rate, rose 13 percent to $171.56 in the first
quarter of this year, the highest increase among seven hotel
segments, according to Hendersonville, Tennessee-based Smith
Travel Research Inc.  “This acquisition represents a strategic direction for our
company to establish a robust presence in the international
luxury hospitality arena and, particularly with our strong Asia
base, Rosewood will be positioned for substantially accelerated
global growth,” Sonia Cheng, chairman of New World Hospitality,
said in the statement today.  Rosewood , based in  Dallas , was founded in 1979 and manages
19 properties, including the Carlyle and Rosewood Mansion on
Turtle Creek in Dallas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
