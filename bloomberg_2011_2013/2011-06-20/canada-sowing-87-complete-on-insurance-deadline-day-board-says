Grain planting in  Canada  is about 87
percent complete, and “little additional” acreage likely will
be planted because today marks the crop-insurance deadline
across the prairies, the Canadian Wheat Board said today.  As much as 11.5 centimeters (4.5 inches) of rain last week
“dashed hopes of any additional seeding in the wettest areas of
southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba,” the board
said today in a statement on its  website . The precipitation was
“welcomed” in drier regions in the north, the board said.  Crop planting is usually finished by this time, the board
said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
