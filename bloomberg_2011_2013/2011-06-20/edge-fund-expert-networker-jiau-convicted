Winifred Jiau, a former consultant
with expert networking firm Primary Global Research LLC, was
convicted in the third trial to result from a U.S. government
crackdown on insider trading tied to  hedge funds .  Jiau, 43, who provided industry information to financial
clients, was charged with conspiracy and securities fraud in
Manhattan federal court for passing inside tips about  Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA)  and  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL)  to hedge fund managers.  She was one of several dozen people charged in overlapping
insider rings stemming from the probe of New York-based hedge
fund Galleon Group LLC. The cases implicated hedge funds, banks,
technology firms and consultants such as Jiau.  Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam was convicted May 11 of
directing the largest hedge fund insider trading ring and faces
almost 20 years in prison at his July 29 sentencing. Ex-Galleon
trader Zvi Goffer was convicted with two others June 13 on
related charges and faces a similar sentence Sept. 21.  The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
