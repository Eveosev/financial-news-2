Miranda Mineral Holdings Ltd. (MMH) , a
South African minerals explorer, headed for the lowest close in
11 months after saying it terminated talks about raising funds.  The shares fell for a second day, losing 6.7 percent to 42
cents by 9:28 a.m. in Johannesburg. A close at this level would
be the weakest since July 20.  Miranda resolved to end capital-raising plans that involved
Global PS Mining Ltd. subscribing for shares in the explorer, it
said on June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
