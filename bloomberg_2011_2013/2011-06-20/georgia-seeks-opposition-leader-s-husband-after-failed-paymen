A Georgian court ordered that Badri
Bitsadze, the husband of opposition leader Nino Burjanadze, be
detained after failing to make a 100,000-lari ($61,000) bail
payment.  Bitsadze has been charged with helping a group of anti-
government protesters last month attempt an armed uprising,
Khatuna Iosava, a spokeswoman for the Prosecutor General’s
Office, said by phone in the capital Tbilisi today. Bitsadze’s
whereabouts remain unknown, she said.  Burjanadze won’t comment on the case immediately, Lia
Chkareuli, her aide, said by phone, adding that the opposition
leader isn’t planning to post bail for her husband.  Two people died in  Georgia ’s capital and at least 19 were
injured as police sought to remove anti-government protesters
from the city center in preparation for the independence day
parade on May 26. Opposition groups have held five days of
rallies in the city calling for the resignation of President
Mikheil Saakashvili.  To contact the reporter on this story:
