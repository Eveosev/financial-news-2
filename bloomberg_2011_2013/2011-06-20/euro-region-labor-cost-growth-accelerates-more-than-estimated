Euro-area labor-cost growth
accelerated more than economists forecast in the first quarter,
as the strengthening economies of  Germany  and  France  offset
declining labor costs in Greece and Ireland.  Nominal labor costs, which include wages and salaries, rose
2.6 percent from a year earlier when adjusted for work days,
after increasing 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That’s the
biggest jump since the third quarter of 2009. Economists had
forecast a gain of 1.9 percent in the 17-member euro region, the
median of eight forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The euro-region economy is showing some signs of slowing
down after expanding at the fastest pace in almost a year in the
first quarter. With surging energy costs and a worsening debt
crisis clouding growth prospects, companies may become reluctant
to add workers.  Europe ’s jobless rate held at 9.9 percent in
April and economic confidence weakened last month.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, labor costs rose 2.9
percent in the first quarter from a year ago, while French costs
increased 3.8 percent, today’s report showed. In Greece and
Ireland, which have received external aid, costs dropped 6.8
percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.  In the 27-member EU, labor costs rose 2.7 percent from a
year earlier, after increasing 1.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, today’s report showed. Euro-region wages rose 2.3
percent in the first quarter, up from 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
