German pump maker  KSB AG (KSB)  is losing
about 20 million euros ($28 million) in revenue from  Germany ’s
decision to close down eight nuclear reactors following the
Fukushima disaster in  Japan ,  Financial Times Deutschland  said,
citing Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Schmitt.  The Frankenthal-based company may be “hurt” should  China 
revise its nuclear plans, as pumps for nuclear reactors are part
of KSB’s growth strategy, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
