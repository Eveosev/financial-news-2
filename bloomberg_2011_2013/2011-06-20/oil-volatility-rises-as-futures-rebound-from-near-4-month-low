Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures rebounded from a nearly four-month low amid
assurances that  Greece  will be spared from default, easing
global economic concerns.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 34 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New
York , up from 33.5 percent June 17 and the highest level since
May 23.  “We’re seeing very little volume today, said Ray Carbone,
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “There were no
big punts either way. Everybody in the word is waiting to see
what happens with Greece.”  Crude oil for July delivery rose 25 cents to settle at
$93.26 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
touching $91.14, the lowest level since Feb. 22.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $105 calls with 1,533 lots changing hands. They fell 4
cents to $1.27 a barrel at 3:26 p.m. in New York. August $90
puts, the next-most active option, dropped 22 cents to $1.93 a
barrel with 1,484 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  August $115 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 9,669 lots changing hands. They fell
2 cents to 10 cents a barrel. The next-most active option,
September $125 calls, lost 3 cents to 15 cents a barrel on 7,547
