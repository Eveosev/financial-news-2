Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana,
the parent company of  Colombia ’s largest bank, may offer shares
on  Spain ’s Latibex, the Madrid-based equity market for Latin
American companies, said Chief Executive Officer David Bojanini.  The company also plans to offer shares in Colombia in
“months or years,” Bojanini said, adding that the country’s
exchange has enough liquidity to absorb more share sales after a
$295 million offering this month by Grupo Nutresa SA, Colombia’s
biggest food producer.  The company’s shareholders approved plans to offer as many
as 131 million preferred shares in Colombia and to allow for
conversion of up to 10 percent of existing common shares into
preferred shares, according to a regulatory filing today.  Grupo Sura, as the company is known, is seeking
acquisitions in Central and  South America , Bojanini said in a
live webcast of a shareholder meeting in Medellin. Central
America “is an interesting market for us to take leadership
positions” as the region has a population and economic output
similar to Colombia’s, he said.  Bojanini didn’t say when the company would offer shares on
Latibex.  Grupo Sura shares traded in Bogota fell 2.3 percent to
38,000 pesos today.  -- Editor:  Brendan Walsh , Marie-France Han  To contact the reporter on this story:
