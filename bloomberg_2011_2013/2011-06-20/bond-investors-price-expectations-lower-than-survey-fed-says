Bond investors’ expectations for
inflation are probably lower than shown in the Survey of
Professional Forecasters compiled by the  Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia , according to researchers at the San Francisco Fed.  The economists reached their conclusion by studying the
breakeven rate, or difference in yields between Treasury bonds
and Treasury inflation-protected securities, according to a
paper released by the San Francisco district bank today.
Researchers Jens Christensen and James Gillan then relied on
inflation swaps to derive a range for the possible  liquidity
premium , or how much more investors are willing to pay for
protection against the risk that inflation exceeds its
anticipated path.  Inflation expectations help guide future policy for Fed
officials, who must decide when to withdraw record monetary
stimulus. They are scheduled to begin a two-day meeting in
 Washington  tomorrow.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters shows a median
projection for inflation, based on the personal consumption
expenditures price index, over the next 10 years of 2.3 percent
as of May.  “Our model-based estimates of expected inflation suggest
that the inflation expectations of bond investors are well below
the widely followed survey,” the authors wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
