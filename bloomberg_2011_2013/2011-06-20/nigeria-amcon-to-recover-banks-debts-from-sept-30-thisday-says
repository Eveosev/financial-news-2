The state-owned Asset Management
Corp. of  Nigeria  will start to recover bad debts it has bought
from banks after Sept. 30,  ThisDay  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Mustafa Chike-Obi.  The company bought about 9,000 non-performing loans from
lenders, representing between 30 percent and 40 percent of the
total asset in the banking industry, the Lagos-based newspaper
cited Chike-Obi as saying.  Amcon, as the company is known, will work with debtors to
determine how the loans can be repaid, without bankrupting the
companies, some of which have more than 10,000 employees, Chike-
Obi said, according to ThisDay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
