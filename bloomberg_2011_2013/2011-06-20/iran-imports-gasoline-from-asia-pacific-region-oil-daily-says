Iran  is importing about 200,000
metric tons a month of gasoline, mostly from the Asia-Pacific
region, amid U.S. sanctions, the  International Oil Daily
reported , citing unidentified shipping sources in the Persian
Gulf area.  The U.S. in May charged seven companies including Petroleos
de Venezuela SA for violating the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,
