High Point Solutions Inc.  has bought
the  naming rights  to  Rutgers University ’s football stadium, the
Star-Ledger reported, citing two unidentified people familiar
with the agreement.  The Sparta, New Jersey-based maker of computer routers and
servers is expected to pay between $1.5 million and $2 million
annually for the right to rename 52,000-seat Rutgers Stadium and
promote its brand at sports events at the New Brunswick, New
Jersey-based school, according to the  newspaper .  Rutgers will hold a press conference tomorrow to announce
the agreement. Tom Mendiburu, a co-founder of High Point, didn’t
immediately return a voicemail and e-mail seeking comment. An e-
mail to Jason Baum, Rutgers’ sports information director, and a
voicemail to assistant Doug Drabik weren’t immediately returned.  In March, High Point announced a five-year, $1 million
agreement to purchase the naming rights to  Quinnipiac
University ’s multipurpose sports arena, the newspaper said.  The company signed an agreement in 2009 to become an
information-technology partner in the Barclays Center in
Brooklyn,  New York , where the National Basketball Association’s
Nets will play after a scheduled move from  New Jersey  in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
