Colombia ’s economy could be growing
“too fast” and the  central bank  may have been right in
disregarding his call to pause by raising rates at its meeting
last week, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  Santos, speaking in a Caracol Radio interview today, said
last week’s retail sales report, which showed a 23.2 percent
year-on-year increase for April, may signal that the economy is
expanding too rapidly.  The president on May 31 had urged the central bank to keep
the benchmark rate unchanged to safeguard growth. Policy makers
on June 17 raised the rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent,
their fifth straight increase. Still, Colombia may be reaching
the end of its cycle of rate increases, he said.  “What I was saying is ‘be careful,’ let’s not exaggerate
because that could really have a negative impact on the economy
in the long term,” said Santos, who as finance minister from
2000 to 2002 was a member of the bank’s seven-member policy
making board. “That’s why it’s so important to have an
independent central bank.”  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry, who said first-
quarter growth could expand as much as 5.5 percent from the same
period a year earlier, on June 17 denied the economy is
overheating and said that “it’s warming.” The government will
publish its quarterly growth report on June 23.  Santos also said he expects the  U.S. Congress  to ratify a
free-trade agreement with the South American country in August.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 1,787.40 per  U.S. dollar  from
1,791.80 on June 17. That’s its biggest increase since June 14
on a closing basis.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bond due July 2024 was
little changed at 7.79 percent, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange, at 3:54 p.m. New York time. The security’s price rose
0.014 centavo to 117.712 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
