     June 20 (Bloomberg) --Former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  may be suffering from a cancer relapse, said his lawyer,
who requested that a German doctor be allowed to examine him.  “All symptoms indicate that the cancer has returned,”
Farid elDib said in a phone interview. “I am talking about
Hosni Mubarak the citizen, not the president. Save his life,”
he said. ElDib said he made a request to the public prosecutor
last week to allow the doctor who operated on Mubarak last year
to come and examine him at the Sharm el-Sheikh hospital where
he’s being treated. Mubarak underwent an operation in  Germany 
last year to remove his gall bladder.  Egypt’s public prosecutor ordered in May that Mubarak and
his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, be tried in a criminal court on
charges of killing demonstrators and abusing public office.
Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended in February when he ceded
interim power to  Egypt ’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces
after 18 days of mass protests.  “When he was in Germany, they discovered the cancer,”
elDib said. Mubarak is now “in a bad shape,” he said.  Mubarak has denied all charges against him, elDib said.  A medical committee that examined Mubarak concluded he
can’t be transferred to prison, saying his health is
“unstable,” the public prosecutor’s office said in a statement
last month.  The six-member committee asked that Mubarak remain under
the supervision of a medical team in Sharm el-Sheikh. It found
that Mubarak suffers from heart conditions, depression and
“muscle weakness” and needs to be helped out of bed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
