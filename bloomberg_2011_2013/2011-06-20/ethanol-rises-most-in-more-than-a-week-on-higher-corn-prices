Ethanol futures rose the most in
more than a week in  Chicago  as corn increased on signs of
increased export demand.  The biofuel climbed a second day, gaining with corn after
the Agriculture Department said inspections at export terminals
in the week ended June 16 swelled to 42.978 million bushels, up
21 percent from a week earlier and 76 percent from a year
earlier. Corn fell the first four days of last week.  “We’re just taking a cue from corn,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2.5 cent, or 0.9
percent, to $2.666 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 12 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago dipped 4.5
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.64 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive decreased 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.83,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.735 a gallon and in  New York  the fuel dipped 0.5 cent to
$2.755.  Corn futures for December delivery increased 0.5 cent to
$6.605 a bushel in Chicago after rising 7 cents on June 17. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
