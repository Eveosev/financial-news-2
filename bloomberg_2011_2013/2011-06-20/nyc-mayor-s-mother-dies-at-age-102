Charlotte Rubens Bloomberg,
102, the mother of New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg ,
died yesterday at her home in West Medford,  Massachusetts ,
the mayor’s office said.  The mayor’s mother, in whose name the family endowed a
children’s center scheduled to open in 2012 at the  Johns
Hopkins Hospital  in Baltimore, and dedicated a wing at the
 Hadassah Hospital  in Jerusalem in 2003, participated in the
mayor’s 2002 and 2006 swearing-in ceremonies.  She is also survived by the mayor’s sister, Marjorie Tiven, a New York City commissioner, as well as five
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. William H.
Bloomberg, whom she married in 1934, died in 1963.  “As the center of our family, our mother’s
unimpeachable integrity, fierce independence, and constant
love were gifts that profoundly shaped our lives and the
lives of so many who knew her,” the mayor said in an e-
mailed statement last night. “Our family recognizes how
truly blessed we have been to have her live such a long and
full life, and to be able to carry her spirit with us
forever.”  Charlotte Rubens was born in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey ,
in 1909. She earned a bachelor’s degree in accounting from
New York University in 1929, and moved to West Medford in
1945. She worked as an office manager in  Boston  for several
years, and in volunteer work, the mayor’s office said in a
news release.  Burial will be private. A memorial service will be
held at a later date, the mayor’s office said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
