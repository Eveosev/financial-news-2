Natural gas futures dropped for a
sixth day in  New York  on forecasts of moderating temperatures
that may limit demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas futures declined as much as 1.1 percent after
forecasters including MDA EarthSat Weather in Rockville,
Maryland, predicted mostly normal temperatures across the
continental U.S. from June 25 through June 29.  “The dominating factor is always the weather, and if
temperatures are moderating, that’s going to provide some
downward pressure for the market,” said Brad Florer, a trader
at Kottke Associates LLC, an energy trading company in
Louisville,  Kentucky .  Natural gas for July delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.2 percent,
to $4.315 per million British thermal units at 9:06 a.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 1.9
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
