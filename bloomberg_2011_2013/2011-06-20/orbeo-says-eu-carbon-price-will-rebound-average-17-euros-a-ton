European Union carbon prices will
rebound and average 17 euros ($24.22) a metric ton in the second
half of this year, said Orbeo.  The first supply of EU allowances for the phase than begins
in 2013 and ends in 2020 will put some downward pressure on
prices, analysts including Paris-based Emmanuel Fages at Orbeo,
the carbon venture of  Rhodia SA (RHA)  and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, said in
an e-mailed research note on June 17. There’s also a “flood”
of United Nations offsets, boosting supply, they said.  On the other hand, improving profit margins at power
stations and the closure of German nuclear plants will add to
demand, boosting prices, Orbeo said. “On balance, we expect the
continued massive oversupply to cap prices and as a result, we
are not revising our forecasts.”  Carbon permits for December dropped as much as 1.2 percent
to 15.47 euros ($21.96) a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London, the lowest level since March 4. They were at 15.56
euros as of 10:12 a.m. local time. Prices fell 6 percent last
week, the biggest fall since the week ended Dec. 25, 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
