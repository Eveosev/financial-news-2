A U.S. regulator said he would
propose rules to keep unauthorized charges off subscribers’
monthly telephone bills.  “We’re turning up the heat on companies that rip off
consumers with unauthorized fees,” Federal Communications
Commission Chairman  Julius Genachowski  said today in a speech in
Washington.  Genachowski said he would send fellow FCC members his
proposal for new rules tomorrow. The regulations will call for
more disclosure on phone bills, the agency said in a news
release.  The FCC  proposed  on June 16 a total of $11.7 million in
fines against four telephone companies it said had charged
thousands of consumers for services that they never wanted,
ordered or used.  “This agency will not tolerate the abuse of consumers by
this unscrupulous practice,” the agency said in a June 16
advisory. It said the practice, known as cramming, involves
charges of $1.99 to $19.99 on monthly telephone bills that may
continue undetected for years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
