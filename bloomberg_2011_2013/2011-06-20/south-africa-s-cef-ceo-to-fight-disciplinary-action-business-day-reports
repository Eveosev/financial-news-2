Mphuthumi Damane, the chief
executive officer of  South Africa ’s Central Energy Fund, has
applied to the  High Court  to stop disciplinary action against
him, Business Day said, citing Damane and CEF Chairwoman Busi
Mabuza.  The court action follows an independent probe last year
that found lapses in control at the CEF, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. The CEF is responsible for planning ways to meet
South Africa’s energy needs and also controls PetroSA, Business
Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
