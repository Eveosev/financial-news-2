Stanford University , the fourth-
richest U.S. college, lost its chief investment officer, Ken Frier, after less than one year on the job.  Frier no longer works at the endowment, Adam Gorlick, a
spokesman for the school, near Palo Alto,  California , said today
in an interview. He declined to say when Frier left.  Stanford named Frier as CIO  in August , filling a position
that was open for more than two years. Previously, he held the
same role at nearby Hewlett-Packard Co. Frier, a graduate of
Stanford Business School, reported to John Powers, chief
executive officer of Stanford Management Co., which oversees the
fund. Powers didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail request for
comment.  In September, Stanford said its investments rose 14.4
percent in the year ended June 30, on gains in credit
investments and stocks. That performance beat  Harvard University 
and Yale University, the two richest U.S. schools. The endowment
rose to $13.8 billion in the year ended Aug. 31.  Frier’s departure was reported June 17 by Pensions &
Investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
