Donald Trump  said he may run as an
independent in U.S. presidential elections next year.  “I am considering doing something as an independent,” the
65-year-old real-estate developer turned reality television star
told reporters in Aberdeen,  Scotland , today. He said he would
make a decision after the 12th series of his show “The
Apprentice” is completed. “There’s plenty of time,” he said.  Trump said last month he won’t run for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2012. He was in Scotland today at the
start of a three-day trip to promote his new golf resort, whose
course is scheduled to open in July next year.  Trump has considered a presidential bid several times in
the past, including in 1999 when he formed an exploratory
committee to consider running for the nomination to be a third-
party candidate with the Reform party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
