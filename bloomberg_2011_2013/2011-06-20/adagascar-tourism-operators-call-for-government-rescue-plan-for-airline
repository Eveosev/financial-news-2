Madagascar tourism operators urged
the government to rescue Air Madagascar, the national carrier,
as problems at the airline may affect the industry, a group of
hotels, travel agencies and the tourism office, said.  The airline is facing extra costs and has “obvious
cash-flow problems” related to leasing contracts since the
European Union banned its two Boeing planes from using European
airspace in April, the group said in a statement published in
the Antananarivo-based Midi newspaper today.  Tourist arrivals will probably increase by 30 percent this
year compared with 2010, the group said, without giving more
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
