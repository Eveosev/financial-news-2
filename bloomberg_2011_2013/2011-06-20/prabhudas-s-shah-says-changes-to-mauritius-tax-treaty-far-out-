Apurva Shah, head of institutional
research at Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Ltd.,
comments on the decline in Indian stocks after Business Standard
reported that the South Asian nation will seek to tax  capital
gains  on investments made through Mauritius.  The government has yet to start negotiations after
Mauritius expressed willingness to hold discussions three months
ago, Shishir Jha, a spokesman for the Indian tax board said in
 New Delhi  today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
dropped as much as 3.1 percent to 17,314.38 and was at 17,637.29
as of 11:44 a.m. in Mumbai.  “As far as the India-Mauritius  tax treaty  is concerned, it
is bit too early to start speculating about what the
renegotiated treaty will be, what changes may be there and how
they will affect Indian investments.  “The governments have only proposed to talk and this issue
has been around for at least 10 years now.  “All the Indian government has been asking is to modify
the rules so round-tripping of investments doesn’t happen. It is
being heard that any legitimate money won’t be affected. The
fear of so-called black money finding its way back into  India 
via the Mauritius route is the major concern of the Indian
government. If the scope is limited to that, I don’t think it is
very negative.  “This is something that is clearly still far out. In a
bearish environment you just need a bit of news to start an
extreme reaction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
