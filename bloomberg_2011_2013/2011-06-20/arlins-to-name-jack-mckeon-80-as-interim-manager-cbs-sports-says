Jack McKeon will be named interim
manager of the  Florida Marlins ,  CBSSports.com reported , becoming
the second-oldest manager in Major League Baseball history.  McKeon, 80, would replace Edwin Rodriguez, who resigned
yesterday with the Marlins in last place in the National League
East Division. Florida has lost 10 straight games and has a 1-18
record this month.  Connie Mack was the oldest manager in baseball history,
leading the Philadelphia Athletics in 1950 at age 87.  McKeon has a 1,011-940 record as a major league manager,
which includes three years with the Marlins. He took over the
team in 2003 after a 16-22 start and led the Marlins to a 75-49
record and a World Series title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
