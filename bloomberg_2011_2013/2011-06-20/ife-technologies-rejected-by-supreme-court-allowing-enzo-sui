The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
hear an appeal by  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE) , letting  Enzo Biochem
Inc. (ENZ)  press ahead with a patent infringement suit over a way to
detect genetic sequences and diagnose human diseases, including
cancer.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
ruling that revived two Enzo patents invalidated by a trial
court. Life Technologies and its Applera unit argued
unsuccessfully that the patents weren’t specific enough in their
description of the claimed invention.  Life Technologies, based in Carlsbad, California, has said
the two patents are expired, so the lawsuit won’t have any
effect on current products. New York-based Enzo and Yale
University are seeking royalties in their lawsuit.  The case is Applera v. Enzo Biochem, 10-426.  To contact the reporter on this story:
