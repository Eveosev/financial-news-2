Brazil is now more concerned about
economic expansion than about inflation, after consumer price
increases eased,  Folha de Sao Paulo  reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s economic team forecasts gross
domestic product will expand 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year,
down from 7.5 percent in 2010, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said. Rousseff would like the economy to expand at least 4
percent, Folha said.  The  Finance Ministry  didn’t immediately return Bloomberg’s
phone call asking for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
