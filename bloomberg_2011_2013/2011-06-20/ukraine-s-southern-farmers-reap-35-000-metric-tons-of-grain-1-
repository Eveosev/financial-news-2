Farmers in southern Ukraine reaped
35,000 metric tons of grain so far, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told reporters in Kiev.  Barley yields will be lower than expected because of dry
weather last month and this, he said. The minister declined to
forecast the size of the grain harvest.  Farmers are going to begin harvesting winter barley this
week, Kiev-based researcher UkrAgroConsult said in an e-mailed
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
