Thermal coal prices may gain in the
third quarter after wet weather in  Australia ’s Hunter Valley
crimped production amid signs demand is reviving in  Asia ,
Citigroup Inc. said.  Thermal coal prices for immediate delivery may rise back
above $130 a metric ton, Citigroup analysts led by Daniel Hynes
said in a report. Power-station coal prices at Australia’s
Newcastle port, an Asian benchmark, were $119.19 a metric ton,
according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index.  “Wet weather has hit the coal market again, with Hunter
Valley thermal coal mines struggling to overcome the latest
deluge of rain during this wet season,” Hynes said in the June
17 report. “This is all coming at a time when Asian buyers look
like picking up their buying activity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
