The U.S. Supreme Court turned away
an appeal from  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL)  in a patent
fight with Honeywell International Inc. over night-vision goggle
technology used in military airplanes.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
ruling that said Honeywell was entitled to damages from the U.S.
government -- and ultimately L-3 -- for the use of patented
technology in aircraft including  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) â€™s C-130J
Hercules.  New York-based L-3 is involved in the case because it
supplied the displays for the C-130J and ultimately will be
responsible for damages, according to the appeals court
decision.  The Obama administration urged the high court not to hear
the L-3 appeal.  The case is L-3 Communications v. Honeywell, 10-491.  To contact the reporter on this story:
