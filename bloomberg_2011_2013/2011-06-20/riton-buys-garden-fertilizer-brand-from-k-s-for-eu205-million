Triton Beteiligungsberatung GmbH
agreed to buy Compo from K+S AG in a deal valued at 205 million
euros ($293 million) to add the garden-fertilizer unit to its
investments.  The transaction will result in a cash inflow for K+S of
about 150 million euros, Kassel, Germany-based K+S said in a
statement today. The transaction will result in a book loss of
about 90 million euros, the company said.  The purchase follows Triton’s interest in Evonik Industries
AG’s carbon-black business, which Rhone Capital LLC went on to
buy for $1.3 billion earlier this year.  K+S a year ago hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to advise on
a possible sale of the division, which had sales of about 400
million euros in 2009 and employs about 1,100 people.  The transaction comes at a time when the future of K+S’s
remaining nitrogen fertilizer trading business is in question as
K+S’s former parent company  BASF SE (BAS)  is selling most of the
plants that supply it with the crop nutrient.  K+S in March completed the acquisition of Potash One Inc.
of  Vancouver  and will build a potash mine in Saskatchewan. Chief
Executive Officer Norbert Steiner is also considering the
expansion of salt operations in  Asia . The company became the
world’s largest salt producer after acquiring Morton
International Inc. from  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
