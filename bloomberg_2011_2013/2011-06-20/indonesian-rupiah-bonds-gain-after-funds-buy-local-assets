Indonesia’s rupiah declined, trading
near its weakest level in more than three weeks, as European
policy makers failed to agree on a rescue plan for  Greece .  The currency erased earlier gains after the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional stocks declined for a fourth day.
Finance chiefs in  Europe  said further aid will depend on Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  delivering budget cuts in the
face of local opposition. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar
Index, which tracks the region’s 10-most used currencies
excluding the yen, dropped by the most in four weeks.  “We can expect volatility in the market due to concerns
about the debt crisis in Europe,” said Lindawati Susanto, head
of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “That will
affect the rupiah as well.”  The rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 8,614 per dollar as of
4:26 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It fell to 8,620, on June 17, the weakest level since April 28.  Emerging-market bond funds recorded inflows for a 12th
straight week, with money shifting back toward managers with
local-currency mandates, according to data compiled by EPFR
Global. Offshore funds increased ownership of  Indonesia ’s
government debt by 5.5 percent to 237.12 trillion rupiah ($27.5
billion) this month through June 17, figures from the  debt
management office  show.  Ten-year benchmark bonds fell for a third day. The yield on
Indonesia’s 8.25 percent notes due July 2021 climbed one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.68 percent, according to
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
