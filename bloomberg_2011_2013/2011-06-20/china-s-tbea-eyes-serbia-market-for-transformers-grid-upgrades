TBEA Co., a Chinese maker of
electric transformers and cables, plans to start sales in  Serbia 
where energy investments may boost demand for its equipment.  “Energy investments, whether in renewable or other
sources, will mean demand for transformers, especially large
transformers” that are TBEA’s top products, Chen Jing, a TBEA
project manager, said in an interview in Belgrade today.  Serbia is working to increase its total installed capacity,
modernize the grid to reduce transmission losses and renew its
coal-fired plants which are at least 30 years old.  TBEA’s presence in Serbia depends on arrangements with the
authorities and with Elektroprivreda Srbije, Serbia’s state-run
power monopoly, Jing said. She declined to estimate the size of
future sales in Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
