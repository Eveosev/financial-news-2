St. Louis Cardinals All-Star first
baseman  Albert Pujols  is expected to miss four to six weeks of
action after fracturing his left forearm, the team said.  Tests showed that Pujols, who was injured yesterday against
the  Kansas City Royals , has a non-displaced fracture of his left
radius and the arm will be placed in a splint, the Major League
Baseball team said today in a news release. Despite soreness in
his shoulder, no structural damage was found in that area.  Pujols, 31, collided with the Royals’ Wilson Betemit at
first base while trying to field a throw. He immediately reacted
with pain, running a few steps before falling to the ground in
foul territory.  A nine-time All-Star, Pujols was voted the National
League’s Most Valuable Player in 2005, 2008 and 2009. Last
season he finished second in voting to the  Cincinnati Reds ’ Joey Votto.  Pujols hit his 17th home run of the season earlier in
yesterday’s game, which St. Louis won 5-4 on a homer by Skip Schumaker.  A career .329 hitter, Pujols is batting .279 with 45 runs
batted in this season, the last before he enters free agency.
St. Louis is 40-33, tied with the  Milwaukee Brewers  atop the NL
Central Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
