The Canadian government introduced
legislation today aimed at ending a work stoppage at Canada
Post.  Labor Minister Lisa Raitt said lawmakers will start debate
on the law Tuesday, and the Conservative government could use
its parliamentary majority to force an end to debate, ensuring
the bill will be approved before the legislature leaves for its
summer break.  “It’s still important for the parties to try to find their
own process, because they can bring this to an end quickly,”
Raitt said.  The Canadian Union of Postal Workers and Canada Post have
been unable to reach a contract for about 48,000 letter carriers
in urban areas. The union began a series of rotating strikes
June 2, and the company locked out the workers on June 14.  The legislation sets out annual pay raises of between 1.5
percent and 2 percent until the end of 2014. Raitt said it sets
out a process of “final selection binding arbitration” where a
federal arbitrator picks between offers submitted by the two
sides on non-salary issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
