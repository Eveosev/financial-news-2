Ukraine’s wheat exports jumped to
27,000 metric tons in the first 15 days of June, compared with
3,000 tons a month earlier, according to researcher ProAgro.  The country also shipped 58,400 tons of corn from June 1
through June 15, Kiev-based ProAgro said in an e-mailed
statement, citing data from ports.  Ukraine now has 452,500 tons of grain at ports ready to be
shipped, the researcher said.  The government canceled quotas on wheat and barley
shipments early this month, after lifting limits on corn
deliveries a month earlier. The quotas were imposed last year
after drought reduced the grain crop by 6 million tons. Outbound
shipments are to be taxed from next month through December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
