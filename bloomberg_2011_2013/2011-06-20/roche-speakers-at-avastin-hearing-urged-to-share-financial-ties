Roche Holding AG (ROG)  should be required
to disclose any financial ties to its presenters speaking next
week at a hearing to consider a U.S. proposal to withdraw
approval of the drug Avastin in  breast cancer , regulators said.  The Food and Drug Administration  asked  the presiding
officer of the June 28-29 hearing to require disclosures for
speakers with ties to Basel, Switzerland-based Roche’s Genentech
division or any companies that make products that compete with
Avastin. This is necessary to correct an “imbalance” of
transparency since FDA speakers and members of the advisory
committee reviewing Avastin disclose their ties, the FDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
