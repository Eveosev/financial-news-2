China ’s government and economy
remain stable after unrest including clashes between crowds and
police in Inner Mongolia and  Guangdong province , Moody’s
Investors Service said today.  “We do not see negative credit implications from the
recent unrest because it has remained localized,” Moody’s said
in an e-mailed statement today. “What we do see are clouds
gathering on the economic horizon at a time when social unrest
is apparently rising.”  Premier Wen Jiabao’s government has raised  interest rates 
and banks’ reserve requirements to reduce inflation and may
increase the threshold for paying income tax to help narrow the
gap between rich and poor. Besides those efforts to ease social
tensions, China has introduced policies to bolster the economies
of provinces including Xinjiang and  Inner Mongolia  after ethnic
unrest.  The odds of a “pernicious scenario” playing out appear
low, Moody’s said today. At the same time, China’s leaders will
have to maintain economic stability and ensure continued
improvement of the rule of law and government accountability,
the ratings company said.  Protests erupted in May in Inner Mongolia after an ethnic
Mongolian herdsman was hit and killed by a coal truck. In
Guangdong province, a dispute between a street vendor and
authorities this month led to protests during which crowds
overturned cars and threw bottles at police.
