Zouk Capital, a U.K. investor, may
announce today that it’s closing a fund dedicated to providing
growth capital for companies specializing in environmentally
friendly products, the Financial Times reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  Zouk’s latest so-called cleantech fund will be closed after
raising 230 million euros ($328 million) after exceeding the
original target of 200 million euros, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
