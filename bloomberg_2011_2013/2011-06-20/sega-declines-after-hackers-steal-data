Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. (6460) , publisher
of the “ Sonic ” video-game series, dropped the most in almost
three months in Tokyo trading after the company said hackers
stole data on almost 1.3 million customers at its European unit.  The stock fell as much as 5.4 percent to 1,475 yen, the
biggest drop since March 23, before the decline pared to 1.5
percent at the midday trading break. Personal data, excluding
credit card information, on 1.3 million customers at a European
unit were accessed, Sega Sammy said in a  statement  yesterday.  Sega Sammy joins  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and
Citigroup Inc. among companies that have been hit by hackers in
the past three months amid a wave of cyber attacks. The
intrusion at Sony, which resulted in the theft of data from more
than 100 million accounts, has made investors sensitive to cyber
security news, according to Masayuki Ohtani, an analyst at
Securities Japan Inc. in  Tokyo .  “The Sega Sammy incident revives memories of what happened
at Sony,” Ohtani said. "Still, the stock reaction to this
probably won’t last beyond today."  To contact the reporter on this story:
