India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
yields to their lowest level in six weeks, on speculation the
10th interest-rate increase since the beginning of last year
will damp growth and slow inflation.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised the repurchase rate by 25
basis points to 7.5 percent on June 16. Oil fell 1.5 percent
today after declining more than 6 percent last week. India
imports almost 80 percent of its crude.  “Investors are betting slowing growth will bring down
inflation and boost bond returns,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar,
Mumbai-based treasurer at FirstRand Ltd. “The softening of
crude prices will also help in taming inflation.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 dropped
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 8.19 percent at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That’s the lowest level since May 6.  The wholesale-price index rose 9.06 percent in May from a
year earlier, compared with 8.66 percent in April, official data
showed on June 14. Gross domestic product rose 7.8 percent in
the three months ended March 31 from a year earlier, the slowest
pace in five quarters, government data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell two basis points to 7.91 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
