West Africa has seen a “tremendous
increase” of drug use, according to the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime, with more than a third of the cocaine that
passed through the region being consumed locally.  Local use of drugs, especially cocaine and heroin, which
are moved from  Latin America  to  Europe , has become “a huge issue
for public heath” in West Africa, said Alexandre Schmidt, the
UNODC’s regional representative, in Dakar today.  The traffickers are using new methods to evade capture,
including small submarines, making estimates of exactly how many
drugs are passing through the region hard to gauge, Schmidt
said.  In 2009, 35 metric tons of cocaine may have moved through
the region, according to the UNODC’s figures, which are based on
seizures, compared with 47 tons estimated for 2008. As much as
13 tons were consumed locally in 2009, the latest year that
figures are available, Schmidt told reporters.  Africa “in terms of hard drugs has never been a continent
for consumption,” he said, adding that the region lacks drug-
treatment centers. The UN agency said as much as 400 kilograms
(880 pounds) of heroin have been consumed in West Africa in 2011
so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
