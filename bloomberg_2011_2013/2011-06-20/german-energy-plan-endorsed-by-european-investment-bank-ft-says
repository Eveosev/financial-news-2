Germany ’s plan to close its 17
nuclear plants and replace them with renewable-energy and gas-
fired power stations by 2022 is “achievable,” European
Investment Bank Deputy President Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen said,
the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  The EIB calculates the cost of the process to be 90 billion
euros over 10 years, and that 15 percent of that amount will
come from the bank, the FT said, citing Kollatz-Ahnen. He said
that if the EIB “as just one player” is to provide 15 percent
of the financing, this is “a clear sign of how achievable” the
goal is, the FT reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
