Peru’s sol bonds rose to the highest
in three months, pushing yields down, as traders bet the central
bank will leave its benchmark rate unchanged next month after
trimming its growth forecast for this year.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.42 percent at 12:41 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price
climbed 0.11 centimo to 109.76 centimos per sol, the highest
since March 21.  A slowdown in private investment and  government spending 
led the central bank to lower its 2011 growth forecast on June
17 to 6.5 percent from 7 percent. Private investment is slowing
as President-elect Ollanta Humala has said he plans to introduce
a mining windfall tax that companies say could make the
country’s mines less competitive.  “There’s a reduced risk of inflationary pressures stemming
from domestic demand,” said  Hugo Perea , head of research at
 BBVA Banco Continental , the nation’s second-largest bank. “The
economic context is more consistent with current monetary
policy, which is more or less neutral.”  The central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25
percent June 9, the first pause in six months, after consumer
prices fell last month. Inflation was “very low” in the first
two weeks of June, central bank president Julio Velarde said
June 17. Central bank policy makers will meet again July 7 to
discuss whether to adjust the rate.  The sol was little changed at 2.7600 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7610 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
