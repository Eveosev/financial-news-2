OAO Novatek may acquire the natural-
gas assets that OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s diamond mining monopoly,
sold to VTB Capital in 2009, the Siberian explorer’s press
service said.  The assets interest Novatek, Russia’s second-largest gas
producer, because they’re close to existing fields, said a press
official, who declined to be identified citing company policy,
confirming an earlier report in the Kommersant newspaper. He
declined to provide more information.  Novatek may pay almost $1 billion for the assets, the
Moscow-based newspaper said today, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
