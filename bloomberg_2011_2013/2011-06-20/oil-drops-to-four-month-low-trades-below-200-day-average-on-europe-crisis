Oil fell to the lowest in four
months in  New York , bringing its loss from this year’s peak to
20 percent, on speculation a weakening global economy and
 Greece ’s debt crisis will lead to reduced fuel demand.  Futures slid as much as 2 percent, erasing this year’s
gains, as European governments failed to agree on releasing a
loan payout to spare Greece from default and  Japan ’s exports
dropped in May more than forecast. Crude traded for a second day
below its 200-day moving average, a major technical-support
level. Today’s low marked a 20 percent decline from its 2011
settlement high in April, the sign of a  bear market .  “The fear is that a Greek tragedy will lead to another
2008-style recession that will drive prices lower,” said
Thorbjoern Bak Jensen, an analyst at Global Risk Management in
Middelfart,  Denmark . “But I think that the European Union will
consider Greece too big to fail.”  Crude for July delivery fell as much as $1.87 to $91.14 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . That’s the lowest intraday price since Feb. 22 and
below $91.38, the final settlement price of 2010. The contract
was at $91.93 at 1:07 p.m. London time.  Futures reached a 2011 settlement high of $113.93 on April
29. A 20 percent decline is typically considered to be an
indicator of a bear market. The July contract expires tomorrow.
August futures are down $1.11, or 1.2 percent, at $92.29.  Bollinger Band  Brent oil for August delivery on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange fell as much as $1.79, or 1.6 percent,
to $111.42 a barrel. The price is up 18 percent this year.  Oil in New York is trading below its 200-day moving
average, currently at $92.30 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prices are also below the lower Bollinger
Band at $92.99, a technical indicator that may signal the market
has fallen too far.  Euro-area finance ministers pushed Greece to pass laws to
cut its deficit and sell state assets. They left open whether
the country will get the full 12 billion euros ($17.1 billion)
promised for July as part of a bailout package agreed on last
year, according to Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , after chairing a crisis meeting in his country.
Decisions on the next payout and a three-year follow-up package
were put off until early next month.  Growth Forecast  “The major influence continues to be the European
situation,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “If you look at
what happened to the oil price during the financial crisis you
can see that these events have a big impact. There is this tone
of a global slowing in the economy.”  Japan’s exports decreased 10.3 percent from a year earlier
after April’s 12.4 percent drop, the  Finance Ministry  said
today. The median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for an 8.4 percent decline.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for U.S.
growth in 2011, warning of setbacks to the economic recovery
with potential contagion from Europe’s debt crisis.  The U.S. will expand 2.5 percent this year, down from the
2.8 percent projected in April, the Washington-based fund said
June 17. It sees the world economy expanding 4.3 percent this
year, compared with 4.4 percent in April.  Hedge funds  and other speculators boosted wagers on crude
rising in the seven days ended June 14, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. Net-long bets climbed by 3,398 futures and
options combined, or 1.8 percent, to 194,372. That was the first
increase in three weeks.  Crude may decrease this week on signals economic growth in
the U.S. and  China  will slow, curbing fuel use in the world’s
biggest oil-consuming countries, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Eighteen of 38 analysts and traders, or 47 percent,
forecast prices will decline through June 24.  Thirteen respondents, or 34 percent, predicted oil will
increase and seven estimated there will be little change. Last
week, 54 percent of respondents said futures would drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
