Outfit7 , the maker of popular
“Talking Tom” and “Talking Ben” mobile-phone games, hired
the William Morris Endeavor talent agency to generate deals for
the characters in Hollywood.  Outfit7, based in  Palo Alto ,  California , and the two
characters will be represented on a standard commission basis by
Ari Emanuel, co-chief executive officer of Beverly Hills-based
William Morris, the companies said today in a statement.  Outfit7 and other makers of popular games played on  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone are trying to extend their characters and brands
into books, toys, television shows and movies. Closely held
Outfit7 is led by Andrej Nabergof, chief executive officer, and
Samo Login, chairman and chief creative officer.  “Talking Tom” was introduced on Apple devices last July.
It features a gray tabby that drinks milk and purrs when users
scratch an iPhone screen. Ten other talking characters have
followed, including “Ben,” a gruff dog that likes to blow
things up in his chemistry lab. More than 135 million of the
applications have been downloaded, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
