The German Bundesbank said  Europe ’s
largest economy lost momentum in the second quarter after a
strong start to the year.  “After the splendid start to the year, growth is likely to
be considerably weaker in the second quarter,” the Frankfurt-
based Bundesbank said in its monthly report today. Still, “this
should not be interpreted as an economic slowdown,” it said.
Rather, it reflects “the strong catch-up effect” that pushed
first-quarter growth to a faster-than-expected 1.5 percent.  The Bundesbank also reiterated its forecasts for German
growth first published on June 10. Gross domestic product will
expand 3.1 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2012.  Germany ’s
economy grew 3.6 percent last year, the fastest since
reunification two decades ago, as booming exports fueled
domestic hiring and spending.  “The prospects of the German economy experiencing a
lengthy period of expansion are rising” as the recovery “has
evolved into a broad-based upturn,” the Bundesbank said. While
exports remain the “pillar” of German growth, “in clear
contrast with the upturn of the last decade, the domestic
economy has a much larger role to play this time,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
