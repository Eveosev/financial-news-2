Morgan Stanley (MS)  is seeking to raise a
$688 million loan fund to be managed by GSO Capital Partners LP,
the credit investment arm of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , according to
people with knowledge of the deal.  The collateralized loan obligation, Central Park CLO,
includes a $428 million piece rated AAA by  Standard & Poor’s ,
said one of the people, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private. It may price by June 30, the person said.  CLOs, a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return, are increasing even as prices on the
underlying debt tumble to the lowest since January on concern
that the  U.S. economy  is slowing and  Greece ’s fiscal crisis
roils credit markets.  “The CLO machine is revving its engines,” Barclays
Capital analysts led by Bradley Rogoff wrote in a June 17
report.  More than $4 billion of CLOs backed by widely syndicated
loans have already been issued this year, surpassing the $3.4
billion raised in the U.S. in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. GSO priced a $400 million CLO with Bank of America
Corp. in December, according to Bloomberg data.  Heather Lucania, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Blackstone, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  GSO had fee-earning assets under management of $25.8
billion, as of March 31, according to its  website .  The Central Park CLO also includes a $91 million piece
rated AA; a $38 million slice graded A; a $36 million portion
rated BBB; and a $33 million segment rated BB, the person said.
There is also $7 million of Class F debt and $54.95 million of
subordinated notes, the person said.  The S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index declined 0.35
cent for the week to 94.25 cents on the dollar, the lowest level
since Jan. 7. The index, which tracks the 100 largest dollar-
denominated first-lien leveraged loans, has declined from 96.48
cents on Feb. 14, which was the highest since November 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
