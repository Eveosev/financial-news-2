Former New York Jets quarterback
 Chad Pennington  has joined  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Sports and will team
with veteran broadcaster Sam Rosen to call National Football
League games this season, according to the network.  Pennington , 34, the NFL’s only two-time Comeback Player of
the Year, was selected by the Jets with the 18th pick in the
2000 draft. He signed a free-agent contract with the  Miami
Dolphins  in 2008, and had one of the best seasons in his 11-year
career, passing for 3,653 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven
interceptions.  Pennington was sidelined with shoulder injuries in recent
years. After a promising start in Miami, he started a total of
four games the past two years, and recently tore a knee ligament
while playing pick-up basketball, according to a report in the
 Charleston Daily Mail  in Charleston,  West Virginia .  The paper said Pennington hasn’t officially retired from
the league and will wait a year to see if his body recovers and
he can return to football again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
