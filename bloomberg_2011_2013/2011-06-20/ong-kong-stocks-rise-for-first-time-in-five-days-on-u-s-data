Hong Kong stocks fell, sending the
benchmark index to its lowest close in nine months, as local
developers declined and after European governments failed to
agree on a loan payout to avert Greece from default.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the world’s biggest developer
by market value, slid 2 percent after its former chairman said
property prices may fall, and after Financial Secretary John
Tsang said the city may try further policies to cool the housing
market.  Cheung Kong  (Holdings) Ltd., Hong Kong’s No. 2 developer
by market value, declined 3.8 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) ,
which gets most of its revenue from  Europe , slid 3.5 percent.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.4 percent to 21,599.51, its
lowest close since Sept. 10. The gauge last week entered a so-
called correction from its April high, tumbling more than 10
percent, on mounting concern Greece will default on its debt and
slow global economic growth.  “The momentum remains weak and the overall sentiment
remains quite cautious,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating
officer at KGI Asia Ltd. Regarding Europe’s debt crisis, “it’s
still too early to say all the uncertainty has been removed.”  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’
H shares fell 0.3 percent to 12,009.33.  A measure of developers slid 2.2 percent, the biggest
decline among the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) ’s four industry groups. Sun
Hung Kai retreated 2 percent to HK$108.90, its lowest close
since September. Former chairman  Walter Kwok  said he wouldn’t be
surprised if property prices in the city fell by between 10
percent and 15 percent, and that it has already reached its peak.  Price Curbs  Cheung Kong sank 3.8 percent to HK$108.90, while Sino Land
Co., a Hong Kong developer controlled by billionaire Robert Ng,
dropped 3.3 percent to HK$11.70.  Hong Kong’s government may take more measures to curb
property-price gains in the city as “risks” are rising,
Financial Secretary John Tsang said in his blog yesterday.
Separately, the city’s Chief Executive Donald Tsang said on June
17 home prices are “quite frightening.”  In Europe, the region is on course to break up as member
nations’ willingness to continue bailouts for the region’s
indebted countries fades, the Centre for Economics and Business
research said in a research note today.  Esprit lost 3.5 percent to HK$24.75.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) ,
Europe’s No. 1 bank by market value, slid 0.7 percent to
HK$75.50.  Greece Debt  Euro-area finance ministers put off a decision on whether
Greece will get the full 12 billion euros ($17.1 billion)
promised for July as they pushed for budget cuts by Prime
Minister  George Papandreou , whose government faces a confidence
motion this week.  The Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent this year through June
17 on concern Greece’s debt, Japan’s nuclear crisis and China’s
monetary-policy tightening will hamper the global economic
recovery. Shares in the gauge traded at 11.7 times forecast
earnings on average at the previous close, the lowest level
since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose,  PCCW Ltd. (8) , Hong Kong’s biggest
phone carrier by market value, advanced 1.9 percent to HK$3.29
after Chairman  Richard Li  bought 2.9 million shares at an
average price of HK$3.004 each on June 13, according to a
disclosure statement from the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , China’s No. 1 maker of personal
computers by market value, gained 0.7 percent to HK$4.20 after
Chief Executive Officer  Yang Yuanqing  bought shares valued at
HK$3.3 billion ($423 million), according to an e-mailed
statement.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.1 percent to 21,622.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, dropped 4.3 percent to 22.50, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 6.5 percent in the Hang Seng Index in
the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
