Taiwan’s  government bonds  rose for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in three months, after
European governments failed to agree on releasing a loan to help
 Greece  avoid defaulting on its debt.  The island’s 10-year yields dropped to the lowest in seven
days and the Taiex index of shares slumped after euro-area
finance ministers failed to decide whether Greece will get the
full 12 billion euros ($17.1 billion) promised for July as part
of last year’s 110 billion-euro lifeline.  “The situation in  Europe  damped risk appetite,” said Eric
Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. “That led
to inflows into government bonds.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most-traded security, declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.47 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. local
close, according to Gretai Securities Market. It fell 8 basis
points in the past five days.  Taiwan ’s dollar was unchanged at NT$29.000 against its U.S.
counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.005 on June 17, the lowest level in
three weeks.  The government reported two minutes before the end of
 currency trading  that export orders rose 11.53 percent from a
year earlier in May, after a 10.14 percent increase in the
previous month. Economists in a Bloomberg survey estimated a
9.45 percent expansion.  The overnight money-market rate dropped for the first time
in six days. The rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 0.33 percent, according to a weighted average compiled
by Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
