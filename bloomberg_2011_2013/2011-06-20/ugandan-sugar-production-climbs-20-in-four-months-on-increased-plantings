Uganda ’s three biggest sugar
producers boosted output by 20 percent in the first four months
of this year as plantings increased, the Uganda Sugar Cane
Technologists Association said.  Output from January through April climbed to 123,935.1
metric tons from 102,894 tons a year earlier, Wilberforce
Mubiru, the Kampala-based agency’s secretariat manager, said in
an e-mailed response to questions on June 17. The increase may
mean the three companies’ production target of 345,570 tons this
year is “achievable,” Mubiru said.  Kakira Sugar Works, the largest grower, Kinyara Sugar Works
Ltd. and Sugar Corp. of Uganda Ltd. produced 292,052 tons of the
sweetener last year. Contributions by two small producers may
push total national output to 350,500 tons from 297,016 tons
last year, the agency said.  Kakira, owned by Madhvani Group, which says it is the
biggest private investor in Ugandan industries, may boost output
by 9.3 percent to 165,190 tons, the agency said on April 5. The
company’s production plant is expected to work more efficiently
after repairs on damaged sections and cane supply from
independent farmers are projected to increase, the company said
in January  Kinyara, the second-biggest producer, may increase output
by 40 percent to 126,380 tons, the association said. Kinyara is
51 percent-owned by Rai Group, a Kenya-based agro-forest
company.  Output at Sugar Corp., jointly owned by the Ugandan state
and Mumbai-based Mehta Group, may climb 7.5 percent to 54,000
tons, the association said.  The three producers plan to invest a combined $197 million
in boosting their capacity as well as generating electricity
from cane fiber and producing ethanol, the association said on
April 5.  Uganda consumed 346,000 tons and imported 13,000 tons of
sugar last year of which 67,590 tons were re-exported, according
to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
