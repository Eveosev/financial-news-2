Japanese stocks rose from a three-
month low as power companies climbed on signs the government may
allow atomic reactors to be restarted following the worst
nuclear accident in 25 years.  Chubu Electric Power Co., ordered last month to shut
operations at its Hamaoka nuclear plant to address safety
concerns, surged 7.9 percent.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  jumped 2.1
percent after the automaker said it will return to profit this
year and Citigroup Inc. raised its rating to “hold,” citing a
recovery in production after  Japan ’s March earthquake.
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , the country’s largest commodities trader,
dropped 0.8 percent after  oil prices  fell on a decision by
European officials to delay money to help  Greece  avoid default.  The Topix index advanced 0.2 percent to 806.83 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, with almost twice as many stocks advancing as
falling, after Trade Minister  Banri Kaieda  said on June 18 that
Japan’s nuclear plants have passed safety checks and reactors
shut for maintenance should be restarted on schedule.  “Restarting the nuclear power plants is good for the
utilities and, in the end, good for the economy because it means
we can avoid power shortages,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general
manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Still, words don’t settle anything by themselves, so you can’t
take it for granted that this will resolve the issue.”  Greek Bailout  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average was little changed at 9,354.32.
The gauge fell on June 17 to its lowest since March 18 amid
concern European officials would fail to agree on a bailout for
debt-saddled Greece.  Power companies had the biggest gain today among the 33
Topix industry groups, with Chubu Electric advancing 7.9 percent
to 1,440 yen and Kansai Electric Power Co., Japan’s second-
largest utility by sales, rising 7.7 percent to 1,420 yen.  The Topix Electric Power and Gas sub-index has lost 42
percent since March 10, the day before a magnitude-9 earthquake
and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeast coast, triggering
partial meltdowns at  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear plant, causing power shortages and forcing the
nation to rethink its reliance on atomic power.  Mazda advanced 2.1 percent to 199 yen. The automaker
forecast it will post 1 billion yen ($12.5 million) in net
income for the year ending March 31, compared with a loss of 60
billion yen a year earlier. Mazda also said it plans to build a
factory in  Mexico  with the capacity to produce 140,000 cars a
year.  Mazda, Olympus Gain  Citigroup analyst Noriyuki Matsushima raised his rating on
the carmaker to “hold” from “sell,” saying Mazda’s supply
chain has recovered from the earthquake more quickly than
expected.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , an optical-equipment maker, increased 4.3
percent to 2,787 yen and was the biggest single support for the
Nikkei. The company said net income will probably jump to 18
billion yen in the year ending March 31 from 7.38 billion yen a
year earlier.  Euro-area finance ministers today pushed Greece to pass
laws to cut its deficit and sell state assets. They left open
whether the country will get the full 12 billion euros ($17.1
billion) promised for July as part of a bailout package agreed
last year, according to Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude
Juncker , after chairing a crisis meeting in his country.
Decisions on the next payout and a three-year follow-up package
were put off until early next month.  Among stocks that fell, commodity-related companies
declined after oil and copper prices dropped. Mitsubishi lost
0.8 percent to 1,915 yen. Mitsui & Co., Japan’s second-largest
trading company, slid 0.8 percent to 1,277 yen.  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,
Japan’s biggest energy exploration company, retreated 1.6
percent to 555,000 yen.  Crude oil for July delivery fell as much as 1.7 percent to
$91.42 a barrel in electronic trading in  New York  today. Copper
futures dropped as much as 1.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
