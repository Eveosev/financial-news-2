Corn and wheat fell on speculation
rainfall in parts of  Europe  will help later-planted crops and
demand for U.S. supplies will decline on a stronger dollar.  Rain in  France  and the U.K. will boost prospects for plants
that were planted later than normal and spring crops now in the
ground. The  U.S. dollar  gained 0.4 percent today against a
basket of six currencies, making U.S. supplies less attractive.
The market will follow macroeconomic factors until the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s acreage and grain stockpiles report
on June 30, said Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank in
London.  “Rain for later crops in France and Northern Europe” are
depressing prices, FitzPatrick said today. “The markets will
follow macros until next week’s USDA report.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $6.57 a bushel by 10:35 a.m.  London  time on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. The price dropped 7.4 percent last week,
partly as farmers in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter of
the grain, finished planting.  Wheat for September-delivery fell 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.025 a bushel in Chicago. Milling wheat for
November delivery dropped 2.5 euros, or 1.2 percent, to 210.50
euros ($299.48) a metric ton.  Soybeans for November-delivery gained 0.75 cent to $13.34 a
bushel after falling 3.5 percent last week. The price has
declined 4.9 percent this year, partly on speculation Chinese
demand will fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
