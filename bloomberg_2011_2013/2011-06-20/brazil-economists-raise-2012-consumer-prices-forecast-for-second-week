Economists covering the  Brazil 
raised their 2012 inflation forecast for a second week, as they
expect wage increases to reignite inflation next year.  Consumer prices will rise 5.18 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in a June 17  central bank survey  of about
100 economists published today. That’s up from a 5.13 percent
median estimate in the previous week’s survey. The economists
cut their prediction for 2011 inflation, as measured by the IPCA
index, to 6.18 percent from 6.19 percent, the survey found.  “Even with an improvement in the short term, inflation is
going to get worse,” said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank in  Sao Paulo . “The job market is
showing no signs of cooling.”  Brazil’s central bank increased borrowing costs for a
fourth consecutive meeting this month, raising its benchmark
lending rate a quarter-point to 12.25 percent. In the minutes to
the meeting, published June 16, policy makers said the inflation
outlook is “more favorable” than it was in April, while
warning of a “very important risk” caused by a tight labor
market.  Brazilian workers are demanding bigger wage increases as
the nation’s unemployment rate fell in April to 6.4 percent, the
lowest level on record for the month.  Upper Limit  The bank has signaled it is prepared to raise rates further
this year to cool inflation that exceeded the upper limit of the
government’s target range in April and May.  Analysts expect the interest rate to end the year at 12.50
percent, before falling to 12.25 percent by the end of 2012, the
same prediction as in last week’s survey.  Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in the year through May,
the fastest pace in six years. The central bank aims to slow
inflation back to the midpoint of its target in 2012. The
government targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Economists held their forecast for 2011 economic growth at
3.96 percent and their 2012 growth forecast at 4.10 percent,
from 4.1 percent.  Economic activity, a proxy for gross domestic product, rose
0.44 percent in April from the previous month, according to the
central bank’s seasonally adjusted index, down from 0.51 percent
in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
