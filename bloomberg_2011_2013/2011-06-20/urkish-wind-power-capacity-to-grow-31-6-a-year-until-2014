Turkey ’s wind power capacity will
grow at an annual average rate of 31.6 percent until 2014,
outpacing the growth of overall renewable energy capacity in the
country, according to researcher Research and Markets.  Wind power generation will become a highly competitive
industry, thus creating business opportunities for manufacturing
and material innovations, the Dublin-based researcher said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Turkey’s energy regulator may give licenses for 2,277
megawatts of new wind power plants, subject to environment
assessment reports, Hasan Koktas, head of the Ankara-based
agency, said June 15.  The regulator rejected applications for 15,360 megawatts of
wind power licenses and is studying 23,300 megawatts more for
preliminary licensing, he said. The agency has given wind
licenses for 5,000 megawatts so far, including 1,406 megawatts
in operation, he said.  Turkey had 50,475 megawatts of total power capacity in May,
according to the government’s power transmission company Teias.
The government aims for 20,000 megawatts of wind power capacity
by 2020, about one quarter of the total capacity then, Koktas
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
