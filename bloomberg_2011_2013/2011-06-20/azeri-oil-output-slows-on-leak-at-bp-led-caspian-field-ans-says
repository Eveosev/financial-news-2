Azeri oil output has fallen this
year because a 2008 gas leak kept a BP Plc-led venture from
drilling at a Caspian Sea field, ANS television said, citing the
head of the State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan .  The venture hasn’t been able to drill new wells at the
Central Azeri field, leading to a drop in national oil
production in the first five months of the year, Rovnaq
Abdullayev, president of Socar, as the state oil producer is
known, said yesterday in an interview broadcast on the privately
owned ANS television channel. Azerbaijan aims to keep annual
output stable at 50 million tons, he said, according to ANS.  Tamam Bayatly, a BP Azerbaijan spokeswoman, said she
couldn’t immediately comment when called and sent an e-mailed
request by Bloomberg.  Oil output fell an annual 5.2 percent in January through
May to 20 million metric tons, according to the State Statistics
Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
