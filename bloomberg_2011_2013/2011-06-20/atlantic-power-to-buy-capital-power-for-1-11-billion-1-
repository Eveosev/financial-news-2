Atlantic Power Corp. (AT)  agreed to buy
 Capital Power Income LP (CPA-U)  for C$1.09 billion ($1.11 billion) in
cash or shares, more than doubling its electric output capacity.  Capital Power’s unitholders will receive either C$19.40 in
cash or 1.30 shares of Atlantic Power, which would be C$19.44
based on the June 17 closing price, the companies said today in
a joint statement. The offer represents a 4.1 percent premium to
the June 17 closing price.  Capital Power, based in  Edmonton ,  Alberta , began a review
of its strategic alternatives in October, including a potential
sale. The deal, which was unanimously approved by both boards,
is expected to be completed by the end of the year, according to
the statement.  “This is a transformative transaction for Atlantic
Power,” said Barry Welch, chief executive officer of the
Boston-based company. The purchase will add 1,245 net megawatts
to Atlantic Power’s holdings, from 871 megawatts today.  Atlantic Power is an independent producer of electricity
with interests in 13 power-generation projects across 10 states,
a biomass project under construction in  Georgia  and an electric
transmission line in  California , according to its website.  Capital Power, which was formed in 1997, saw its net income
fall by nearly half to C$30.5 million in 2010 compared with
C$57.6 million a year earlier, according to the company’s annual
report.  TD Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley were financial
advisers to Atlantic Power. CIBC Worldmarkets Inc. and Greenhill
& Co. Inc. were financial advisers to Capital Power. Goodmans
LLP was Atlantic Power’s legal adviser, Frasier Milner Casgrain
LLP and K&L Gates LLP served as legal advisers to the manager of
Capital Power. Norton Rose OR LLP and Richard Shaw PC advised
Capital Power.  Units of Capital Power rose 69 cents, or 3.7 percent to
C$19.32 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 9:40 a.m. Atlantic
Power increased 11 cents to C$15.07.  (Atlantic Power will hold a conference call for investors
