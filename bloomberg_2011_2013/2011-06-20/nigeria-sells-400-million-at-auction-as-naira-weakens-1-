Nigeria  sold $400 million at a
foreign-exchange auction today, less than the $478.8 million
requested by lenders, as it tries to keep the naira in a range
to control inflation.  Dollars were sold for between 153.47 naira and 153.09 naira
each, the  Central Bank of Nigeria  said on its website today. The
marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing exchange
rate, was 153.38 naira, compared with 153.18 naira at the Abuja-
based bank’s previous auction on June 15.  The naira has weakened in four out of six auctions this
month as the central bank failed to meet the demand of dealers.  “The depreciation at the official auction was due to
excess demand not met by the regulator,” Tayo Omidiji, Head of
Research at Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview
from Lagos.  The West  Africa  nation’s currency closed stronger at the
 interbank market , gaining 5 kobo, or 0.03 percent, to 156.60
naira to a dollar.  The central bank needs “to continuously meet dollar demand
to discourage speculation and the naira will appreciate,” said
Wale Abe, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Markets
Dealers Association in Lagos.  Nigeria’s central bank has been defending the currency of
Africa’s top oil producer, keeping it within 3 percent above or
below 150 per dollar, in a bid to curb inflation.  The marginal rate at today’s foreign-exchange auction
represents 2.25 percent devaluation from the target 150 naira
rate.  -- Editor: Fergal O’Brien  To contact the reporter on this story:
