Tokyo  Electric Power Co., owner of
the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant, has dropped its membership
of a nonprofit group founded by the person leading the
investigation into the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl.  The utility known as Tepco notified the  Association for the
Study of Failure  in April it won’t renew its membership for the
year ending March 2012 because of financial constraints, Kenji
Iino, executive director of the research group, said by
telephone from Tokyo today.  The association was founded in 2002 by engineering
professor Yotaro Hatamura, who was appointed on May 24 to head
the independent investigation into the accident at Tepco’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. The utility posted a record
loss following three reactor meltdowns at the station after an
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 knocked out power and backup
generators, crippling its cooling systems.  “We are looking into various restructuring measures,”
Tepco spokesman Takeo Iwamoto said by telephone today. “We plan
to drop memberships of outside groups.”  Corporate members of the association pay annual membership
fees of at least 100,000 yen ($1,248) each, Iino said, declining
to give details of how much Tepco paid since it became a member
in 2003.  The group studies accidents using a method that focuses on
design flaws, human error and how designers fail to see future
changes in use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
