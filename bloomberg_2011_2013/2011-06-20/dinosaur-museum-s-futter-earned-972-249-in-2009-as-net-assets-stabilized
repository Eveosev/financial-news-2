For the past 18 years of the 65
million since dinosaurs roamed the earth, Ellen V. Futter has
run the  American Museum of Natural History , earning as much as
$1.1 million annually for her efforts.  In 2009, according to the museum’s most recent Federal
income  tax return , Futter, 61, was paid $972,249 in pay and
benefits, or 20 cents for each visitor to the house that Teddy Roosevelt and Margaret Mead built.  Futter’s pay was 5 percent higher than Thomas P. Campbell’s, the director of the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, even
though the Natural History museum’s budget is just over half the
Met’s. Futter took over in 1993, whereas Campbell, a tapestry
curator, was elevated in 2009.  The tax return said a record 5 million people visited the
museum in 2009-2010. Its Richard Gilder Graduate School, the
only museum-based grad school in the country conferring a Ph.D.,
was fully accredited. A six-and-a-half-minute  YouTube video  that
the museum created about the universe went viral, attracting
more than 8 million views, according to YouTube.  Today, exhibitions include “The World’s Largest
Dinosaurs.”  The museum said in the return that it sets executive pay
with the help of an outside lawyer and a compensation consultant
who look at pay at comparable institutions.  A year earlier, Futter took a 5 percent salary cut as the
value of the museum’s investments plunged with financial
markets. In 2008-2009, net assets fell $146 million, or 18
percent. They rebounded in the year ending in June 2010, up 0.5
percent.  In 2009, Futter’s compensation was up $5,000, or 0.5
percent. She also earned $245,000 in cash and stock as a
director of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and $149,290 as a  Consolidated
Edison Inc. (ED)  director.  Michael Novacek, the museum’s senior vice president and
provost of science, earned $531,606; Barbara Gunn, who headed
operations and government relations, was paid $491,190. In early
2010, Gunn took over  Seedco , a New York-based nonprofit that
offers job training and other services.  -- Editors: Jeremy Gerard, Lili Rosboch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
