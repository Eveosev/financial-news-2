Azerbaijan  may turn to a liquefied
natural gas project if proposed rates via the planned Nabucco
pipeline and competing links to Europe are too expensive, ANS
television reported.  “If the tariffs are too high, we can choose AGRI,” Rovnaq
Abdullayev, president of the State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, said
in comments broadcast on the privately owned channel late
yesterday. He was referring to the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Romania
project to ship Azeri gas as LNG to world markets.  Azerbaijan wants to ensure low transportation rates for gas
from its offshore Shah Deniz field, which is operated by  BP Plc (BP/) ,
as pipeline projects vie for supplies. The projects include the
OMV AG-led Nabucco link, Statoil ASA, EGL and E.ON AG’s Trans
Adriatic Pipeline and the Interconnector Italy-Turkey-Greece led
by Edison SpA, Depa SA and Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or
Botas. Russia’s OAO Gazprom has also said it is willing to buy
all of Azeribaijan’s gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
