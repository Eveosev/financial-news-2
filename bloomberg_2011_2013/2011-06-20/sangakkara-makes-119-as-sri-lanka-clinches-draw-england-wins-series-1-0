Sri Lanka ’s stand-in captain Kumar Sangakkara struck a defiant century to deny England victory in
the third and final cricket Test.  Sangakkara scored 119 as his team reached 334-5 at
Southampton, England, before the rain-hit match was drawn.
England won the series 1-0 after victory in the first Test at
Cardiff. The second match at Lord’s in  London  was drawn.  England’s  Chris Tremlett  was named both man of the match
and player of the series. He took 6-48 as Sri Lanka was
dismissed for 184 in its first innings at the Rose Bowl and had
15 wickets in the three matches.  “I wasn’t expecting the pitch to have as much bounce as it
did,” Tremlett said at the post-match awards ceremony. “It’s
good to have a bit of bounce in the pitch and to take advantage
of that.”  Sangakkara, who retired as team captain in May, had to be
convinced to resume the role after  Tillakaratne Dilshan  broke
his thumb in the last game. He was caught off the bowling of
 James Anderson  today. Several match sessions were lost to the
weather, and the game was ended when play couldn’t be resumed
because of rain after tea.  The only other wicket to fall today was that of night-
watchman Rangana Herath, dismissed for 36 after Sri Lanka
resumed on 112-3. Thilan Samaraweera finished on 87 and Prasanna
Jayawardene made 6, with Sri Lanka having built a lead of 141 by
the time play ended.  Ian Bell’s unbeaten 119 had given England a chance of
victory as he helped the team to 377-8 declared, a first-innings
lead of 193.  Third-ranked England begins a four-Test series against No.
