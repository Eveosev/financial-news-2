Malaysia’s ringgit declined,
following its biggest gain this year on June 17, as the failure
of European governments to agree on a financial aid package for
 Greece  heightened  risk aversion .  Euro-area finance ministers pushed Greece to pass laws to
trim its deficit and sell state assets, while leaving open
whether the country will get the full 12 billion euros ($17.1
billion) promised for July as part of last year’s 110 billion-
euro lifeline. Decisions on the payout and a three-year follow-
up package were put off until early next month. .  “At the moment, the uncertainty in Greece is putting
pressure on most Asian currencies,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a
foreign-exchange trader at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala
Lumpur. “The ringgit rose pretty sharply Friday, tracking the
euro.”  The ringgit weakened 0.4 percent to 3.0435 per dollar as of
4:58 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency strengthened 0.7 percent on June 17.  Malaysian inflation accelerated to 3.3 percent in May from
3.2 percent in April, which was the fastest in two years,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before data due June 22.  Bank Negara  raised its overnight policy rate to 3 percent
from 2.75 percent on May 5. Borrowing costs may rise to 3.25
percent by the end of this year, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The bank next
meets to review rates on July 7.  Government bonds  fell, with the yield on the 4.262 percent
note due September 2016 rising one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.52 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
