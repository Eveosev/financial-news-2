Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s competitors
made no attempt to take over routes the carrier ceded in return
for European Union antitrust approval to buy part of Brussels
Airlines NV, EU regulators said.  The German carrier agreed in 2009 to a new slot-allocation
system that would allow new entrants to operate flights on four
routes including Brussels to Frankfurt and Brussels to Zurich.
Lufthansa,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, bought stakes in
smaller competitors to expand networks and cut costs.  “No prospective new entrants have so far applied to
receive the slots made available,” EU Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  said in a written response to an EU lawmaker’s
question last week.  The European Commission “does not perceive the need to
take additional measures,” Almunia said. Travel agents or
others concerned by Lufthansa’s control of routes into Brussels
could file a complaint with EU or national regulators “if there
are serious concerns about a breach of competition law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
