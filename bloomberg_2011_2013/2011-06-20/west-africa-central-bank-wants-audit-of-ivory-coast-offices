The  Central Bank of West African
States  has asked  Ivory Coast  to conduct audits of its offices in
the West African nation that were seized by ex- President
 Laurent Gbagbo  in January during a post-election crisis.  “The member countries want us to evaluate the damages and
losses incurred during the conflict,” said Justice Minister
Jeannot Ahoussou by phone from Abidjan, the commercial capital,
yesterday. “According to the bank’s own evaluation, the losses
amount to 300 billion CFA francs” ($648 million), she said.  Gbagbo seized four of the offices of the Dakar-based
central bank following the lender’s decision to remove his
access to the country’s accounts and later close the sites.
Gbagbo refused to cede power after losing to a November
presidential election to  Alassane Ouattara . Gbagbo was captured
in Abidjan on April 11 and Ouattara inaugurated on May 21.  Three other bank offices in the north of the country have
been closed since a 2002 army revolt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
