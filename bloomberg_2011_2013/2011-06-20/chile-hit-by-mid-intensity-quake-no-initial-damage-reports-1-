Northern  Chile , home to the world’s
biggest copper mines, was hit by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake
today. There were no initial reports of damage or injury.  The temblor struck at a depth of 111 kilometers (69.2
miles), 87 kilometers northeast of the city of Calama, according
to the  U.S. Geological Survey  website.  Chile’s government had no reports of emergencies from what
it characterized as a “mid-intensity” earthquake, according to
a statement posted on the government emergency website.  State-owned copper company Codelco said operations were
normal at its Chuquicamata, Radomiro Tomic and Gabriela Mistral
mines based on preliminary reports. Anglo American Plc and
Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi mine was also running normally, the
operating company said by e-mail today.  Chile, which in February last year was hit by an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake, is the world’s largest producer of copper.
The mines are in the northern and central regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
