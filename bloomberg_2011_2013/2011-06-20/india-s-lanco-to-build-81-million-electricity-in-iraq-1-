Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)  of India signed
an $81.3 million contract to build a gas-fired, 250-megawatt
power station in western Iraq, said Masaab Serri, an Electricity
Ministry spokesman.  The company is scheduled to build the plant within 16
months in Al-Qaim in western Iraq, using natural gas from the
nearby Akkas field, he said today by telephone from Baghdad.  Iraq faces electricity shortages eight years after the
U.S.-led invasion that ousted President  Saddam Hussein  as its
generation and distribution network suffered conflict, sanctions
and sabotage. Frequent outages hamper economic reconstruction
and protests over unreliable power supplies have made the issue
a major concern of the government.  The country sought bids this year to build more than 60
generation plants to add more than 14,000 megawatts to the
national grid.  Iraq  currently produces 7,000 megawatts and
imports 1,000 megawatts while domestic demand totals about
14,000 megawatts, Iraqi Electricity Minister Raad Shallal said
in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
