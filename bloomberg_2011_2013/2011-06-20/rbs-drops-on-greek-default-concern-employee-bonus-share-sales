Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, fell after the firm
sold shares to fund employee bonuses and as concern about a
possible Greek default roiled markets.  RBS slid 4.4 percent to 38.51 pence at the close in  London ,
the biggest decliner in the 48-member Bloomberg 500 Banks Index.  The bank placed about 354.6 million RBS shares, according
to the terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg News. The shares
were awarded to employees as part of their deferred 2009
bonuses. On average, about 79.3 million RBS shares are traded
daily.  “RBS would have been down 2 percent on the general Greek
market malaise, but these staff stock options have sent them
down further” said  Simon Maughan , head of sales and
distribution at MF Global in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
