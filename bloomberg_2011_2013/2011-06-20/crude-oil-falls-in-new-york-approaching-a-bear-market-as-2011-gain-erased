Crude oil rose in  New York  as
Luxembourg’s prime minister,  Jean-Claude Juncker , assured
investors a solution will be found to  Greece ’s debt crisis.  Futures climbed 0.3 percent after Juncker said Greek Prime
Minister George Papandreou had assured him the government would
do everything to ensure financial aid. He also said Italy was
not in danger from the euro area’s debt crisis. Prices slid 2
percent before Juncker’s comments on concern Greece’s debt
crisis would weaken the global economy and curb fuel demand.  “The market is getting some reassurance,” said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and research with Blue
Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. “Crude oil is near the bottom.
$90 is a fair value and I don’t think there is a lot of concern
to see it plunge under $90.”  Crude oil for July delivery rose 25 cents to settle at
$93.26 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract touched $91.14, the lowest intraday level since Feb. 22
and below $91.38, the final settlement of 2010. Futures have
increased 2.1 percent so far this year.  Futures have dropped 18 percent from the 2011 settlement
high of $113.93 on April 29. A 20 percent decline is typically
considered to be an indicator of a  bear market . The July
contract expires tomorrow. August futures advanced 23 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $93.63.  Brent crude oil for August delivery fell $1.52, or 1.3
percent, to $111.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Pressure on Greece  Euro-area finance ministers pushed Greece to cut its
deficit and sell state assets. They left open whether the
country will get the full 12 billion euros ($17.1 billion)
promised for July as part of a bailout agreed on last year,
Juncker said after chairing a crisis meeting in his country.  “Market participants will be paying attention to every
comment from a European finance minister or any major protest in
 Athens ,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “These comments
and events will send prices moving in either direction.”  The euro was little changed at $1.4311 as of 2:39 p.m. in
New York after dropping to $1.4191. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 0.6 percent to 1,278.79 and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 0.6 percent to 12,080.80.  “There’s great tension in the market,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The
S&P is higher today, which is a distraction from the largely
negative fundamentals.”  Japan  Exports  Japan’s exports decreased 10.3 percent in May from a year
earlier after April’s 12.4 percent drop, the  Finance Ministry 
said today. The median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for an 8.4 percent decline.  Crude also rose as the Centre for Global Energy Studies
said  Saudi Arabia  and the three other Persian Gulf states in
OPEC who pledged on June 8 to increase supplies will be
“cautious” in raising output to avoid weakening prices.  CGES, a non-profit think tank founded by former Saudi
Arabian Oil Minister Sheikh Ahmad Zaki Yamani, forecasts that
all of the organization’s members will provide an average of
29.6 million barrels a day during the third quarter, less than
the 30.9 million that OPEC projects is needed.  Kuwait’s crude output capacity is 3.2 million barrels a day
and the country’s policy is not to oversupply the market,
Mohammad Al-Busairy, the country’s oil minister, said in an
interview on Al-Arabiya television.  The country is currently producing 2.55 million to 2.7
million barrels a day, which is “what  Kuwait ’s clients need,”
Busairy said.  Adequate Supplies  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the  United Arab Emirates  and Qatar
agreed to keep consumers adequately supplied this year after
talks with other members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries collapsed on June 8 without an accord.  Oil fell earlier in the day on speculation a weakening
global economy will reduce energy demand.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for U.S.
growth in 2011, warning of setbacks to the economy and potential
contagion from the debt crisis.  The U.S. will expand 2.5 percent this year, less than the
2.8 percent projected in April, the Washington-based IMF said
June 17. It sees the global economy expanding 4.3 percent this
year, down from 4.4 percent in April.  Hedge funds  and other speculators boosted wagers on crude
rising in the seven days ended June 14, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report on June 17. Net-long bets climbed by 3,398
futures and options combined, or 1.8 percent, to 194,372. That
was the first increase in three weeks.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 480,121
contracts as of 3:23 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 690,630
contracts on June 17, 4 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
