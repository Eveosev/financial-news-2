Greece ’s central-government budget
deficit widened in the first five months of the year as the
country’s recession hit tax revenue.  The shortfall, which excludes outlays by state-owned
institutions and companies, increased to 10.3 billion euros
($14.7 billion) from 9.1 billion euros a year earlier, final
data released today by the Athens-based Finance Ministry showed.  Greece has failed to reduce its budget deficit, which in
2009 was the biggest in the history of the euro region, as much
as required under the terms of a 110 billion-euro bailout from
the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  last year.
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  needs to secure parliamentary
approval for a new package of budget cuts and asset sales to
ensure the payment of the bailout’s fifth tranche.  Net revenue decreased 7.1 percent to 18.4 billion euros in
the first five months, falling short of the 20.5 billion-euro
target included in the 2011 budget plan. Ordinary spending
increased 6.4 percent from a year earlier to 27.6 billion euros.
The target for spending was 26.6 billion euros.  The ministry blamed the drop on the recession, the absence
of road-tax fees collected in January last year and an increase
in rebates to people who paid too much tax in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
