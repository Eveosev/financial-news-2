The U.S. will seek a “strong
statement” criticizing bans on exports and will defend biofuels
while encouraging ethanol from new sources at a G-20 summit of
farm ministers, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  Trade needs to be encouraged to “create a market that
everyone can rely on,” Vilsack told reporters today at a
briefing in  Washington  ahead of the Group of 20 nations meeting
of agricultural ministers later this week in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
