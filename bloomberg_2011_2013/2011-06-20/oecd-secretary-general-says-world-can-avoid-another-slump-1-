Angel Gurria , secretary-general of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said
the world can avoid a so-called double-dip slump.  Growth is “a little softer’” because of factors including
higher commodity prices and Europe’s debt crisis, Gurria said at
an energy forum in  Seoul  today.  Asian stocks fell for a fourth day today after European
governments failed to agree on a loan payment to avert a Greek
default.  Gurria also said that governments should focus on using
nuclear power safely rather than turning away from the
technology after Japan’s disaster at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
