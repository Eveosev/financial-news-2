Chile ’s northern electricity grid,
which supplies the world’s biggest copper mines, has returned
“practically” to normal after an outage affected two-thirds of
the system yesterday, the grid operator said.  Authorities are investigating the cause of the outage,
which may have originated in transmission lines at state-owned
copper company Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine, the operator, known
as CDEC-SING, said in a  statement  on its website last night.  Supply returned to normal at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata
Plc’s Collahuasi venture after the world’s third-biggest copper
mine switched to backup supply yesterday, the mine’s operating
company said by e-mail today without elaborating.  Codelco’s Radomiro Tomic and Chuquicamata mines were
operating normally, Daniel Diaz, a union official, said by phone
yesterday. Activity at Barrick Gold Corp.’s copper Zaldivar mine
was also normal, said Scott Brubacher, Barrick’s corporate
communications director yesterday.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s  Escondida , the world’s biggest copper
mine, shut June 18 because of heavy rain and high winds, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. BHP spokeswoman Carolina
Lucaroni didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail request for
comment on  Escondida ’s operations today, and didn’t answer her
mobile telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
