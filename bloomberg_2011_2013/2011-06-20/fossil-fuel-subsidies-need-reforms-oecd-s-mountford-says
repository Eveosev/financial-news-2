Fossil fuel subsidies should be
“reformed” because they contribute to climate change and benefit
middle- and high-income people, an Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development official said.  Governments in emerging countries provided $312 billion in
subsidies for fuels such as oil and natural gas in 2009,
disrupting the growth of renewable-energy industries, Helen
Mountford, the Paris-based organization’s deputy director of the
environment directorate, said today at an energy forum in  Seoul .  Ending subsidies entirely would cut greenhouse-gas
emissions 10 percent by 2050 and “could make a significant
contribution to addressing climate change” while helping
“improve economic efficiency,” Mountford said. She called on
lenders to provide more funding for renewable-energy projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
