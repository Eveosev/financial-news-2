The European Union’s regulatory arm
will include a in a new  energy efficiency  law an option to
withhold carbon permits in its emissions trading system to
prevent a decline in prices, an EU official said.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulator, has agreed
on the law to improve energy efficiency to help fight  climate
change  and is set to present it on June 22, said the official,
who asked not to be identified, citing EU policy.  The law will include a provision enabling the commission to
set aside some carbon permits in the next phase of the EU
emissions trading system from 2013 should the new efficiencies
curb demand for pollution rights. Creating such as set-aside
will be conditional on approval by national governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
