The zloty dropped to the weakest
level in two months against the euro after European governments
failed to agree on releasing a loan payment to spare  Greece  from
default.  The zloty lost 0.6 percent to 3.9940 per euro, the weakest
intraday level since April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
