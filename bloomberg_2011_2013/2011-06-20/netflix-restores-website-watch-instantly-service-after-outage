Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the DVD rental and
film-streaming service, said it restored its website and Watch
Instantly service after an unspecified outage.  “The website and Watch Instantly are online, but some are
still having issues with activating devices,” the company said
today on its Twitter feed.  The outage was not caused by a hacking attack,  Steve Swasey , a spokesman for the Los Gatos, California-based company
said in an e-mail. He declined to provide additional details.  Netflix said late yesterday on the blog that it was working
to restore service for its website and Watch Instantly, without
saying why they were shut down.  The company’s shares rose 7 cents to $245.74 at 1:56 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Market trading. The shares were up 40
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
