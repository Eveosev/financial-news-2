Japan ’s government raised its
assessment of the economy for the first time in four months as
production and exports show signs of recovering from a slump
caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  “Upward movements have been observed in the Japanese
economy, while difficulties continue to prevail” because of the
disaster, the Cabinet Office said in a monthly report released
in Tokyo today.  The government joined the  Bank of Japan  in expressing a
more upbeat view of the world’s third-largest economy, with the
central bank this month raising its assessment for the first
time since February. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa has said
supply-chain constraints are recovering faster than expected.  The Cabinet Office raised its evaluation of industrial
output, exports and  consumer spending  in the June report.
Overseas shipments fell 10.3 percent in May, a separate report
showed today, less than the previous month’s drop.  The government cut its evaluation on employment and
bankruptcies, citing the damage from the record temblor, tsunami
and nuclear crisis. It also lowered its view on the overseas
economy for the first time since February 2009, saying that the
recovery on the whole is moderating.  Risks to the outlook include electricity constraints, the
consequences of the nuclear accident and high  oil prices , and a
further slowdown in the overseas economy, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
