Oil advanced for a second day in  New
York  as concern eased that  Greece  will default on its debt and
investors bet a report will show U.S. crude stockpiles dropped
for a third week.  Futures climbed as much as 1.1 percent after Luxembourg’s
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said his Greek counterpart
assured him the government would do everything to ensure
financial aid. Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. raised its Brent
price forecasts by 15 percent as fighting in  Libya  continued to
disrupt supplies. An Energy Department report tomorrow may show
U.S. crude inventories fell for a third week, according to the
median of 12 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “There’s a little bit of optimism leading back into the
market and the chances are that the Greece concerns will
probably be solved some way,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who
predicted prices will average $100 a barrel this year. “We feel
oil is due for a bit of a bounce.”  Oil for July delivery rose as much as 98 cents to $94.24 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $94.15 at 3:06 p.m. Singapore time. The contract,
which expires today, climbed 25 cents to $93.26 yesterday. The
more actively traded August future gained 87 cents to $94.50
today.  Crude is up 21 percent the past year. New York futures have
dropped 17 percent from the 2011 settlement high of $113.93 on
April 29. A 20 percent decline is typically considered to be a
“ bear market .”  Technical Indicators  Oil yesterday fell below its lower Bollinger Band, a
technical signal that prices may have declined too far. The
contract also slid below its 200-day moving average of $92.30 a
barrel, a level that can attract buyers, supporting prices.  Brent oil for August delivery was at $112.20 a barrel, up
51 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday fell $1.52, or 1.3 percent, to $111.69.
Prices have advanced 42 percent the past year.  Greece’s cabinet faces a confidence vote in parliament
today. Prime Minister  George Papandreou  is seeking the “widest
possible” consensus for a medium-term budget plan, he told
reporters yesterday after meeting European Commission President
 Jose Barroso  in Brussels. European Union leaders have insisted
he secure multi-party support for austerity measures that are a
condition of the aid needed to avoid default as soon as next
month.  Brent Forecast  Mirae Asset Securities raised its average Brent crude
forecasts for 2011, 2012 and 2013 by 15 percent to $115 a barrel
on the “sustained loss” of Libyan oil supplies, according to a
report e-mailed today. Production in the North African country
has been cut by almost 90 percent since fighting broke out
between rebel forces and troops loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  U.S. inventories dropped 1.63 million barrels, or 0.4
percent, to 363.9 million in the seven days ended June 17,
according to the analysts surveyed before the Energy
Department’s report tomorrow. Nine of the respondents forecast a
decline, two projected a gain and one said there was no change.
The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will report its
own data today.  The third weekly decrease in U.S. crude supplies would be
the longest stretch of declines this year, reflecting an
increase in gasoline output to the highest level in nine months.
Refineries probably operated at 86.6 percent of capacity last
week, up 0.5 percentage point from the prior week, the survey
showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
