Jack McKeon became the second-oldest
manager in Major League Baseball history, returning at age 80 to
the  Florida Marlins  as they try to end a 10-game losing streak.  McKeon takes over the Marlins one day after Edwin Rodriguez
resigned during a 1-18 June run in which the team fell to last
place from second in the  National League East . Connie Mack was
the oldest manager in baseball history, running the Philadelphia
Athletics at 87 in 1950.  McKeon led the Marlins to their second World Series
championship, beating the  New York Yankees  in six games in 2003.  “This club can win,” McKeon said today in a news
conference. “Now we’ve run into some tough times and we’ve just
got to kick a little butt and get a little more aggressive.”  On June 1, the Marlins were 31-22, two games behind the
 Philadelphia Phillies  for first place in the NL East. The team
is now a division-worst 32-40, 12 1/2 games out of first, and
its .053 June winning percentage is the second worst in any
month in MLB history, according to ESPN. The  Baltimore Orioles 
went 1-22 for a .043 winning percentage in April 1988.  “I’m very confident that there’s enough talent in that
room to maybe get things right and play in October,” McKeon
said.  McKeon managed the Marlins from 2003 to 2005, winning the
NL Manager of the Year award in their World Series year, and
will serve this time on an interim basis, Larry Beinfest,
president of baseball operations for the Marlins, said at the
news conference. The team will search for a permanent manager
before moving to its new ballpark in 2012.  Manager Honors  In 15 years as a major league manager with five teams,
McKeon is 1,011-940 with one playoff appearance. McKeon, who was
also named NL Manager of the Year in 1999 with the  Cincinnati
Reds , began his managerial career with the  Kansas City Royals  in
1973, at age 42.  McKeon said his age should have no bearing on his work with
the team.  “Why should experience get penalized?” he said. “Eighty
doesn’t mean a thing. I’m not 80. My birth certificate says
that, but I’m not 80.”  The Marlins were 78-85 under Rodriguez, who assumed the job
on June 23 last year following the firing of Fredi Gonzalez.  Marlins bench coach Brandon Hyde managed in the team’s 2-1
loss to the  Tampa Bay Rays  yesterday. Florida hosts the Los
Angeles Angels tonight in Miami Gardens in the first of a three-
game series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
