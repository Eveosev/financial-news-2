Sugar rose to a two-month high as
shipping delays mounted in  Brazil , the world’s biggest exporter.
Coffee declined to the lowest price since February, while cocoa
advanced.  Backlogs of sugar shipments from Brazilian ports are
expected to last an additional 20 to 30 days, according to
Datagro Ltd., an industry researcher. Last week, futures in New
York climbed 3.4 percent, the sixth straight gain.  “Brazil is the main reason why market is rising,” said
Juliano Ferreira, a broker at ICAP Do Brazil Ctvm in  Sao Paulo .
“We are at levels consistent with supply concerns.”  Raw sugar for October delivery climbed 0.83 cent, or 3.3
percent, to settle at 26.21 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , the most since June 2. Earlier, the
price reached 26.31 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since April 12. The commodity has jumped 70 percent in
the past year.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery fell 6.2
cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.463 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the
most-active contract touched $2.4615, the lowest since Feb. 1.  Cocoa futures for September delivery advanced $51, or 1.7
percent, to $2,968 a metric ton in New York.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , refined sugar and cocoa rose,
while robusta coffee fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
