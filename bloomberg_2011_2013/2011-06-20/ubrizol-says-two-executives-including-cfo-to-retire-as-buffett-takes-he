Lubrizol Corp. (LZ) , the lubricants maker
being acquired by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said
Chief Financial Officer Charles Cooley and Chief Operating
Officer Stephen Kirk will retire following the takeover.  Treasurer Brian Valentine will become CFO and maintain his
current responsibilities, Wickliffe, Ohio-based Lubrizol said
today in a regulatory filing. Cooley, 55, and Kirk, 61, will
leave the company “within a few weeks” of the completion of
Berkshire’s acquisition, Lubrizol said.  Buffett, 80, is counting on Lubrizol Chief Executive
Officer James Hambrick, 56, to run the firm after Berkshire
completes the deal. Buffett, chairman and CEO of Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire, agreed in March to buy Lubrizol for
about $9 billion. In April, Hambrick committed to staying with
Lubrizol for “several more years.”  “James has made a verbal commitment to both Warren, as
well as to all Lubrizol employees, that he will remain with the
company after the sale,” Lubrizol said in an April 18 filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
