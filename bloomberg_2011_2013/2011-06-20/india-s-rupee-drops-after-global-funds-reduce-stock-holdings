India ’s rupee dropped after global
funds reduced holdings of the nation’s shares as inflation
accelerated last month.  Overseas investors sold $224 million more Indian shares
than they bought in the first four days of last week, exchange
data show. Wholesale prices rose 9.06 percent from a year
earlier after increasing 8.66 percent in April, official data
showed on June 14.  “The outflows from the stocks is mainly driving the
rupee,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based currency trader
at Development Credit Bank Ltd. “The concern on  Europe ’s debt
crisis is definitely there, keeping the currency range-bound.”  The rupee dropped 0.1 percent to 44.92 per dollar as of
9:30 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency will trade between 44.85 and 44.95 today,
Raghuvanshi said.  European governments failed to agree on releasing a loan
payment to spare  Greece  from default, ramping up pressure on
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  to first deliver budget cuts in
the face of domestic opposition.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.54 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.48
at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
