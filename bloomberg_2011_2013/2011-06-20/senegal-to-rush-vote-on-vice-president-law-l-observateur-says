Senegal’s ruling party plans to hold
a parliamentary vote on a proposal to create the post of vice
president by June 25, L’Observateur said, citing officials in
the legislature it didn’t identify.  The party will use an emergency provision in the
constitution to break with normal procedure by drafting and
presenting the bill without approval from its Bureau of the
National Assembly, the Dakar-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
