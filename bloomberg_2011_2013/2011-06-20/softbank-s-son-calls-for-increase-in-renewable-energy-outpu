Softbank Corp. (9984)  chief executive
officer Masayoshi Son said the world’s economies must boost
energy generated from renewable resources, and craft policies
looking 60 years ahead, given the cost of fossil fuels and the
risks of nuclear power.  Japan may generate 20 percent of its energy from renewable
by 2020 following the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear accident, up
from an earlier target of 10 percent, Son said at an energy
forum in  Seoul  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
