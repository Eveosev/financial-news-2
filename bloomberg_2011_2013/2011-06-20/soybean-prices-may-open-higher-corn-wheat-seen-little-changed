What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand will
rebound after prices dropped to a one-month low, while adverse
weather threatens output in  China , said Greg Grow, the director
of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a pound higher,
and soybean-meal futures may open steady to up $1 for 2,000
pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open down 1 cent a bushel to up 1
cent in Chicago on speculation that demand will climb following
a price slump to a three-month low, Grow said. Beneficial
weather in the U.S. may boost crop prospects, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents a bushel lower to 2 cents
higher on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the
 Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as rain may reduce prospects for
spring crops in the northern U.S. Great Plains and  Canada  as
output gains in other countries, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
