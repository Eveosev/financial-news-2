A new technical mission will travel
to Greece tomorrow to verify Greek implementation of the terms
of a bailout agreement with the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund , EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said.  “The aim is to verify that the Greek government is
implementing the agreed revised memorandum and that we have the
same understanding by the EU-IMF troika and the Greek
government,” Rehn told reporters in Luxembourg today after euro
area finance chiefs met to discuss Greece.  “I expect that there will be a political decision today on
the condition of the Greek parliament endorsing the EU-IMF
memorandum,” Rehn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
