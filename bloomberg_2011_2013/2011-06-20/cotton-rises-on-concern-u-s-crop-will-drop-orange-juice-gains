Cotton climbed for the second
straight session on speculation that production will drop in the
U.S., the world’s largest exporter. Orange-juice futures rose.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s report on June 30
probably will show a bigger-than-expected decline in cotton
acreage, after drought in Texas and floods in areas along the
 Mississippi River  damaged crops or delayed planting, said  Tom Reardon , the president of Delta Brokerage.  “You’re going to see some surprising reductions in
acreage, even from the last reports, and there’s not enough
cotton right now to meet the amount of sales that are
outstanding,” Reardon said by telephone from New York.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 0.23 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.24 a pound at 10:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Before today, the price tumbled 44 percent since
reaching the record of $2.197 on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.25
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $1.795 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
