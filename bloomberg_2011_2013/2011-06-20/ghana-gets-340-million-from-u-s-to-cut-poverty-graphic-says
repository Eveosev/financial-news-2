The  U.S. Agency for International
Development  will give $340 million to support programs aimed at
alleviating poverty in  Ghana â€™s three northern regions, the Daily
Graphic reported.  The support followed a meeting in  Washington  between
Ghanaian officials, led by Vice President John Mahama, and the
administrator of USAID, Rajiv Shah, the Accra-based newspaper
said, citing Mahama.  The funds will be spent on projects that are part of the
 Savannah Accelerated Development Authority , a Ghanaian
government initiative to bridge the developmental gap between
the southern and northern halves of the West African nation, the
Graphic reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
