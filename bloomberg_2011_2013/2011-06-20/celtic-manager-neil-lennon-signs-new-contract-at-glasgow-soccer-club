Celtic manager Neil Lennon signed a
new 12-month rolling contract, the Glasgow  soccer club  said on
its website  “I am absolutely delighted to agree this new contract with
the club. I have had 10 great years connected to Celtic and I
hope to enjoy many more,” the former Celtic player said.  Celtic finished second to arch-rival Rangers in the
Scottish Premier League in 2010-11, his first full season in
charge, as well as winning the Scottish Cup. He’d taken over
from Tony Mowbray in March 2010.  Off the field, Lennon was the subject of death threats in
the past year and had parcel bombs sent to him. In May he was
attacked by a fan on the touchline during a game.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
