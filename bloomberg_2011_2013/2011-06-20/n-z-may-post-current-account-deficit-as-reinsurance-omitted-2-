New Zealand  may report a current-
account deficit in the year ended March 31 after the statistics
agency said it would exclude reinsurance flows related to recent
earthquakes from the measure, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The decision will prevent insurance claims from distorting
the data and allow the current-account balance to better reflect
the nation’s economic position,  Statistics New Zealand  said in
an e-mailed statement today. The exclusion reverses a policy put
in place last year.  Before the change, economists had predicted New Zealand
would report its first current-account surplus since at least
1987, with the median of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecasting an excess of 0.4 percent of gross domestic product.
The median of nine estimates in a survey after the statistics
agency’s announcement is for a deficit equivalent to 4.3 percent
of GDP.  The inflow of reinsurance money was NZ$3.6 billion ($2.9
billion) in the third quarter of 2010 after a magnitude 7
earthquake hit the city of Christchurch in September. Such flows
may have been larger in the first three months of this year when
a Feb. 22 temblor killed more than 180 people and closed the
central business district, with Westpac Banking Corp. estimating
NZ$6 billion.  Statistics New Zealand  said the reinsurance flows, which
are payments from foreign reinsurers to New Zealand-based
insurers, will now be recorded as capital transfers. First-
quarter current-account figures are due June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
