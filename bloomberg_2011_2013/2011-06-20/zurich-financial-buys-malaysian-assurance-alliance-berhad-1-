Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, will buy Malaysian Assurance
Alliance Berhad from MAA Holding Berhad for $115 million.  Zurich plans to inject $172 million of capital into the
firm to comply with Malaysian requirements after the transaction
closes, the Swiss company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Kuala Lumpur-based insurer was founded in 1968 and had
gross written premiums of about $476 million at the end of 2010,
mainly from selling  life insurance . Zurich also has a 40 percent
joint venture with MCIS in  Malaysia , Zurich spokeswoman Claudia
Magri said in a telephone interview.  “Malaysia is a highly attractive market with considerable
economic potential and young and dynamic population,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Senn said in the statement. Zurich
expects to close the purchase in the third quarter of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
