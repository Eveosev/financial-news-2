Australia ’s Senate will likely
reject the opposition Liberal-National coalition’s motion to
have a plebiscite on Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s plan to
introduce a tax on carbon emissions.  Independent Senator Steve Fielding, whose vote was needed
to pass the motion planned for the Senate today, said he would
not support the move.  “It’s a political stunt and I won’t be supporting it,”
Fielding told reporters in Canberra today. “It’s an A$80
million ($85 million) glorified opinion poll that isn’t going to
be binding.”  Opposition leader  Tony Abbott  wants public support gauged
on the government’s plan because Gillard said before the August
2010 election she would not impose a carbon tax. Gillard’s
support has plunged to a record low following her announcement
in February that she planned to impose a cost on polluters.  Independent Senator Nick Xenophon earlier today said he
would support the motion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
