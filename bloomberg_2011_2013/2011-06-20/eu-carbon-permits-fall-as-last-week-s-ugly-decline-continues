European Union carbon allowances for
December fell to their lowest level since March 4 as permits
continued declining after their biggest weekly drop since 2009.  About 30 million metric tons of phase-three carbon dioxide
allowances may be sold this year, after EU nations agreed June
17 a plan that will allow the first sales, said Barclays Plc.  The  European Investment Bank  may offload about 5 million
tons a week for approximately six weeks leading up to Christmas,
said  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst in London for  Barclays Capital .
Phase three of the market starts in 2013 and runs through 2020.
“It’s ugly,” Sikorski said by phone of the market on June 17,
as traders unwound bets that prices would rise.  Carbon permits for December dropped as much as 1.2 percent
today to 15.47 euros ($21.96) a ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, the lowest level since March 4. They were at
15.57 euros as of 8:10 a.m. local time. Prices decreased 6
percent last week, the biggest fall since the week ended Dec.
