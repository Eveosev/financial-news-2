Sri Lanka  captain Kumar Sangakkara
scored 119 as his team reached 334-5 at tea on the last day of
the third and final cricket Test, virtually ensuring a draw that
would give England a 1-0 series win.  Sangakkara was caught off the bowling of  James Anderson .
The only other wicket to fall today was that of Rangana Herath,
dismissed for 36 after Sri Lanka resumed on 112-3 at the Rose
Bowl in Southampton, England. Thilan Samaraweera has 87 and
Prasanna Jayawardene 6, with play delayed by rain. Sri Lanka
leads by 141.  Ian Bell’s unbeaten 119 had given England a chance of
victory as he helped the team to 377-8 declared, a first-innings
lead of 193 in a match disrupted several times by rain.  Chris Tremlett  claimed 6-48 in Sri Lanka’s first-innings 184.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
