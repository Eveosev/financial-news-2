Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
bank, said it’s holding talks with labor representatives after
the purchase of retail lender  Deutsche Postbank AG. (DPB)   Negotiations on an agreement are “constructive,”
spokesman Michael Lermer said by e-mail today. He declined to
comment on further details.  Deutsche Bank may lower costs per employee by up to 30
percent after its takeover of Postbank, Capital magazine
reported earlier today, without saying where it got the
information. Back-office employees may be moved to separate
units and workers may be required to accept longer hours, less
vacation and lower pay, the magazine said. In exchange,
employees may receive one-time payments and avoid forced
firings, Capital said.  Deutsche Bank gained control of Bonn-based Postbank last
year to more than double German retail customers to 24 million
and lower dependence on  investment banking . Retail head Rainer Neske is seeking to boost revenue and profit while lowering
costs such as information technology and personnel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
