Arsenal investor Alisher Usmanov now
holds 29 percent of the English soccer club.  The billionaire Russian announced his holding in the north
London team today in a Regulatory News Service statement.  Usmanov, using his Red and White Holdings Ltd., is vying
for influence at the club with American Stan Kroenke, who last
month established a 66.1 percent stake in the 13-time
English champion.  Usmanov has bought shares of Arsenal Holding for 14,000
pounds ($22,700) each, 2,250 pounds more than Kroenke offered in
his takeover bid.   The team finished fourth in the just finished season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
