U.S. power-plant output rose 0.1
percent during the week ended June 16, according to an analysis
by Genscape Inc.  Genscape  says it calculates the weekly total generation
using a multiple regression approach that includes power output
measured at more than 280 monitored  power plants  and publicly
available electric demand data.  Power output at plants monitored by Genscape accounts for
about 46 percent of all electricity generation in the nation.
The calculation yields results with an absolute average error of
less than 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
