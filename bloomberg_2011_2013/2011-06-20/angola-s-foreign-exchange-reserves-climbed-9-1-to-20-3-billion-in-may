Angola ’s foreign-exchange reserves
increased 9.1 percent in May to $20.3 billion, an official
central bank document obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Reserves rose from $18.6 billion in April, the document
from the Luanda-based Banco Nacional de Angola, received today,
said.  Reserves in Angola, sub-Saharan Africa’s second biggest oil
producer, have been boosted by higher international  oil prices .
While crude oil fell to its lowest in four months in New York
today, it has gained 10 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
