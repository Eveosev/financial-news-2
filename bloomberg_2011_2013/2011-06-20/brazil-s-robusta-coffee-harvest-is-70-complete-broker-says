Robusta coffee growers in  Brazil 
have harvested at least 70 percent of this year’s crop,
according to broker Flavour Coffee.  “Harvesting is running fast,” the Rio de Janeiro-based
broker said in an e-mailed report of the robusta crop. “Most of
the beans are already dry, clean and ready for usage.”  Rains earlier this year delayed the start of the robusta
harvest. Brazil is forecast to produce 11.4 million bags of the
variety, according to the  Agriculture Ministry ’s crop-
forecasting agency, known as Conab.  Brazil’s harvest of arabica beans is about 20 percent
complete, Flavour Coffee estimated. “If current dry weather
persists, we foresee that the crop will all be harvested in
August,” it said.  The South American nation is the world’s largest arabica
grower and the second-biggest robusta producer after  Vietnam .  To contact the reporter on this story:
