Southern Cross Healthcare Plc plans
to raise 100 million pounds ($164 million) of new equity, close
200 care homes and change its name, the  Sunday Times  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The company, which said this week it is in “financial
difficulties,” is in talks with its shareholders and its banks,
Barclays Plc and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc, according to the
newspaper. Southern Cross may also try to sell its Active Care
division, the Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
