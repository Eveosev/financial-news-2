Horst Seehofer, head of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition partner CSU, said it’s not
certain yet that the lower house of parliament will support more
aid for  Greece ,  Bild am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  “We won’t issue a blank check,” Seehofer, who leads the
sister party to Merkel’s  Christian Democrats  and is also prime
minister of Bavaria’s state government, was quoted as saying by
the newspaper. The parliament will only agree on loans under
strict conditions such as a “maximum” effort by Greece to
consolidate its budget, Seehofer said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
