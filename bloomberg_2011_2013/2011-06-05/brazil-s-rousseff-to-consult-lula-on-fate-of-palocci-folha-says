Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
will consult her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva before
deciding whether to dismiss Cabinet Chief  Antonio Palocci , who
has come under scrutiny for consulting fees he earned while
managing Rousseff’s election campaign, Folha de S.Paulo
 reported , without saying where it obtained the information.  On May 15, Folha reported Palocci earned 20 million reais
($12.7 million) in consulting fees in 2010 while also serving in
congress and managing Rousseff’s election campaign. The company,
Projeto Consultoria Financeira e Economica Ltda, earned 160,000
reais in 2006, its first year of business, Folha said.  Political allies consider the explanations Palocci gave
insufficient to contain the political crisis surrounding him.
There is fear within the government that the scandal may tarnish
the image of President Rousseff, the newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
