Ed Balls , Treasury spokesman for the
U.K.’s opposition Labour Party, said he will push for Parliament
to restore last year’s bank bonus tax to raise money for
homebuilding and job creation.  Balls will submit an amendment to the Finance Bill
proposing a re-imposition of the levy, which raised 2.3 billion
pounds ($3.8 billion), he told Sky News today. With 255 of the
650 lawmakers in the House of Commons, Labour cannot get the
measure approved without attracting votes from the Conservative
and Liberal Democrat parties that make up the ruling coalition.  “We should repeat the bonus tax this year and use that
now,” Balls said. “We could build 25,000 houses and
spend 600 million pounds to get young people back to work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
