The five-week drop in U.S. stocks has
driven technology company valuations to the lowest level in more
than a decade, making them too cheap to pass up for some of the
nation’s biggest money managers.  The largest group in the benchmark gauge for American
equities lost 7 percent through June 3, or about $190 billion in
value, since the market peaked on Feb. 18, falling more than any
industry outside financials. Computer stocks trade for 9.3 times
reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, 1.3 times the index’s multiple, data compiled by
Bloomberg show as of June 3. The ratio is the smallest since at
least 1998.  While signs of a slowing recovery and the initial public
offering of LinkedIn Corp. have spurred concern the industry has
entered a speculative bubble, the numbers show something
different. Profits will rise 35 percent faster than the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index in 2011, and executives are boosting computer
and software spending, data from Bank of America Corp. and
Bloomberg show.  “We see the best supply-demand trend in technology,” said
Michael Sansoterra, a money manager at RidgeWorth Capital
Management in Atlanta, which oversees $48.5 billion including
 Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  shares. “You can measure it
pretty much every way you want and it looks attractive.”  Computer-Industry Earnings  Computer-industry earnings are almost double the level at
the peak of the Internet bubble. Profits for technology makers
in the  S&P 500  totaled $135.6 billion last year, compared with
$72.9 billion in 2000, when the S&P 500 Information Technology
Index reached an all-time high, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Bank of America says corporate expenditures on
equipment and software will increase 10 percent this year, about
four times faster than U.S. gross domestic product.  Per-share earnings at computer and software makers will
climb 24 percent in 2011, outpacing the 17 percent increase for
the S&P 500, according to projections from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Based on those estimates, technology companies trade
for 12.8 times profit, compared with 13.1 for the S&P 500, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. stocks fell last week, the fifth straight decline,
after the government said employers added 54,000 jobs in May,
making it the worst report in eight months, and manufacturing
trailed economists’ estimates. The S&P 500 slipped 2.3 percent
to 1,300.16 as a group of computer and software makers including
Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ)  in  Palo Alto , California, lost 1.9 percent, widening the
decline since Feb. 17 to 7 percent.  The benchmark index for U.S. stocks retreated 1.1 percent
to 1,286.17 at 4 p.m. in New York today, the lowest level since
March 18.  Biggest Retreats  The retreat was exceeded only by financial companies, which
has dropped 11 percent since Feb. 18. Technology stocks’ price-
to-Ebitda ratio of 9.3 compares with an average of 14.5 times
since 1992 and is 76 percent below the record 38.3 multiple
reached on March 27, 2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Economic growth slipped to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first three months of this year from 3.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Technology
shares rose 54 percent during the last nine months of 2009,
trailing only financial stocks, as gross domestic product posted
its biggest two-quarter expansion in six years.  LinkedIn Debut  LinkedIn in Mountain View,  California , the first major U.S.
social-media company to go public, surged 109 percent on its May
19 debut and traded as high as 31 times annual sales. The rally
was a day before Harvard University Professor  Lawrence Summers ,
the former U.S. Treasury secretary, said there’s concern
technology stocks are in a bubble.  Groupon Inc., the largest provider of online coupons, filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 2 to
raise $750 million. The Chicago-based company discussed an IPO
with underwriters in March that would have valued it at as much
as $25 billion, or 9.7 times sales, people familiar with the
matter said at the time.  The S&P 500 Information Technology Index trades for 2.4
times sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with
the average of 2.6 since 1992.  “I’m actually looking at this area, particularly with the
selloff, to see if there might be some stocks that we can add,”
said John Carey, a Boston-based  money manager  at Pioneer
Investments, which oversees about $250 billion including
Microsoft. “It’s out of favor. And yet technology is still a
growing part of the world economy.”  Biggs Favorite  Hedge-fund managers have added computer stocks since Traxis
Partners LP’s  Barton Biggs  said they were among his favorite
investments at the start of 2010. Paulson & Co., the New York-
based firm run by billionaire  John Paulson , disclosed a $1
billion stake in Hewlett-Packard in a May 16 filing. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital Inc. told clients in April that it
bought shares of Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo! Inc.  Hewlett-Packard fell nine straight days through May 23, the
longest streak since at least 1980, as the biggest personal-
computer maker cut its full-year sales forecast. Yahoo dropped
6.5 percent in May as speculation grew it may benefit less from
part ownership of China’s largest e-commerce provider amid
tension with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Greenlight also added 1.39 million shares of Microsoft last
quarter, according to a filing with the SEC. The biggest
software maker has slumped 14 percent this year after lagging
behind the S&P 500 in four out of the previous five quarters. It
trades at 9.7 times reported earnings, down from its peak
multiple of 81 in 1999. The 34 percent discount to the S&P 500
is the widest since at least 1992, Bloomberg data show.  Microsoft Discount  Low valuations may not be enough to drive above-average
gains. Since Oct. 9, 2002, the end of the  bear market  that
followed the collapse of technology shares in 2000, Microsoft’s
price-earnings ratio has averaged 18.6, compared with 23.9 for
technology stocks in the S&P 500. Over the period, Microsoft has
returned 53 percent including dividends, versus 131 percent for
the industry, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The biggest statistical bargains tend to be the most
controversial,” said Howard Ward, a money manager at Mario Gabelli’s Gamco Investors Inc., which oversees $35 billion in
Rye, New York. “So far, momentum investors have not taken the
bait. They are waiting for more evidence of a turn in the cycle.
It will come, but timing the inflection point is murder.” His
firm owns  Mountain View , California-based Google and Qualcomm
Inc. in  San Diego .  Recovery Concern  Investors tend to move money from one sector to another in
anticipation that some industries may profit more in a certain
stage of an economic cycle. Technology companies trailed the
market this year after posting the third-worst performance in
2010. The stocks have suffered in a rotation into companies
whose earnings are least-tied to economic growth amid concern
the U.S. recovery is slowing.  The shift has pushed the size of stock swings for computer
and software makers to an almost-three-year peak. The S&P 500
Information Technology Index’s 90-day volatility relative to the
S&P 500 rose to 1.23 on April 25, matching the level on April
14, 2010, which was the highest since July 29, 2008, less than
two months before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy,
Bloomberg data show.  Microsoft is worth owning because of the income it
generates, said Channing Smith, a money manager at Capital
Advisors in Tulsa,  Oklahoma . The stock offers a dividend yield
of 2.68 percent, compared with the S&P 500’s payout ratio of
1.92 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Income Play’  “It’s a very good income play,” said Smith, whose firm
manages over $900 million. The company had $50.2 billion in cash
and short-term investments on March 31, compared with $11.9
billion in long-term debt, according to a government filing.
“Their balance sheet is unbelievable,” Smith said.  While the pace of hiring in the U.S. is slowing, American
companies may spend more on automation to cut costs, said Smith
of Capital Advisors. U.S. productivity, or employee output per
hour, rose 3.9 percent last year, the most since 2002, according
to Labor Department statistics released in March. Worker costs
fell 1.5 percent following a 1.6 percent decrease in 2009, the
first back-to-back drop since 1962 and 1963.  Corporate spending on equipment and software will increase
10 percent this year, compared with U.S. gross domestic product
growth of 2.5 percent, according to Bank of America in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina . Technology companies derive 60
percent of their sales from business spending, the highest
portion among S&P 500 industries, the firm estimates.  “We are fans of the capital-goods sector,” said John Kattar, chief investment officer at Eastern Investment Advisors
in  Boston , which manages $1.7 billion. “Technology continues to
get cheaper. It will outperform because of the recovery in
 capital spending .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
