John Edwards , who pleaded innocent to
charges of accepting more than $925,000 in illegal campaign
contributions to hide an affair, has turned the focus on the
wealthy donor who made the gifts, the New York Times reported.  Edwards used $725,000 given to him by a person named in the
indictment as Person C, the newspaper said. The Times identified
Person C as Rachel Mellon, who wasn’t named in the indictment.  Mellon, known as Bunny, couldn’t be reached for comment by
the New York Times. Mellon’s representatives told the newspaper
that the money given to Edwards was a personal gift and she
didn’t know how he used the money. Edwards is alleged to have
used the funds to conceal his relationship with filmmaker Rielle
Hunter while running for president in 2008.  Mellon, a 100-year-old heiress, is the widow of banking
heir  Paul Mellon .  Mellon’s attorney, William Taylor, didn’t immediately
respond to a voicemail left by Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
