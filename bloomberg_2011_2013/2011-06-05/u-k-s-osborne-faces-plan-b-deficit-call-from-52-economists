U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  was warned to adopt a “Plan B,” easing the pace
of deficit reduction, by 52 economists in a letter to the
Observer newspaper.  “The breakneck deficit-reduction plan, based largely on
spending cuts, is self-defeating in its own terms,”  the letter ,
whose signatories include Richard Grayson of Goldsmiths
University, said. “It will probably not manage to close the
deficit in the planned time frame and the government’s strategy
is likely to result in a lot more pain and a lot less gain.”  Ed Balls, Treasury spokesman for the opposition Labour
Party, said the letter supported his argument that “confidence
is down, and we’re now seeing, week-by-week, more evidence that
the economy is stalling.” Data released May 24 showed Britain
posted its largest budget shortfall for any April since monthly
records began in 1993 as tax revenue fell and spending climbed.  U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  rejected the call.
“The government strategy is endorsed by the IMF, by the OECD,
by the G-20, by all the major business organizations,” Hague
told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “If we wavered from that for a
moment then economic confidence would be reduced, the confidence
of the financial markets would be very severely affected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
