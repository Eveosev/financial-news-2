The staff of the Amman capital
markets authority have called for an open-ended strike to
protest a decision by the Jordanian government to restructure
wages, the Levatine country’s stock exchange  website said .  “A continuation of the decision will expose the capital
market to risk as a result of mass resignations,” the statement
on the website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
