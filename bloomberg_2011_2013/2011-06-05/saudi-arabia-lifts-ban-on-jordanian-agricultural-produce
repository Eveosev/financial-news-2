Saudi Arabia  lifted a 21-year-old ban
on Jordanian agricultural products, Jordan’s Ministry of
Agriculture said.  Jordanian fruit and vegetable exports to Saudi Arabia are
due to resume in mid-June, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. Shipments were halted after allegations that
Jordan used waste water for irrigation, Mohammad Fawaeer, head
of the crop and production unit at the ministry, said in a
telephone interview today.  “All agricultural produce to be exported to Saudi Arabia
will be irrigated from underground water wells,” Fawaeer said.  Jordan exported last year about 750,000 tons of vegetables
and fruit to the Gulf states, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq,  Egypt  and
 Europe , according to ministry figures. The kingdom exported
213,228 tons of fruits and vegetables to Saudi Arabia in 1990,
the last year produce was allowed to enter the country.  -With assistance from Nayla Razzouk in Amman. Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
