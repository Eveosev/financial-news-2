Sweden’s Alexander Noren won the
Wales Open by two shots today to claim his second European Tour
golf title.  The 28-year-old finished on 9-under-par 275 following a
final-round 70 at Celtic Manor, with Gregory Bourdy of  France 
and  Denmark ’s Anders Hansen on 7-under.  Noren collects a check for 344,400 euros ($504,000), the
biggest prize of his career. His previous victory came at the
European Masters two years ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
