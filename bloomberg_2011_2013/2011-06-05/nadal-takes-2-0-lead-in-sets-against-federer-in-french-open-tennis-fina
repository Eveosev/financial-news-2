Rafael Nadal , seeking a record-tying
sixth French Open tennis title, leads Roger Federer 7-5, 7-6 (7-
3) in the men’s final at Roland Garros today.   The Spanish left-hander will retain the No. 1 ranking,
ahead of Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, if he wins the title. Nadal
will also tie  Sweden ’s Bjorn Borg on six Roland Garros trophies.  Switzerland ’s Federer is looking for a first Grand Slam
trophy since the 2010 Australian Open and to secure a first
victory against Nadal on the Parisian clay courts.   Nadal recovered from 5-2 down in the first set on Court
Philippe Chatrier, saving a set point in the eighth game
before winning five straight games.  He opened the second set with a break, but Federer tied
in the eighth game when the Spaniard hit into the net. Nadal
broke back immediately to go 5-4 up and had a set point in the
next game before a short rain delay. Upon resumption, Nadal was
unable to convert a second set point and Federer broke.  The next two games went with serve, setting up a tiebreak
which Nadal won.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
