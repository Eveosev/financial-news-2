The second cricket Test between
 England  and Sri Lanka may be heading for a draw after rain
restricted the match to less than 40 overs on the third day.  Sri Lanka was 372-3 in its first innings at close of play,
with captain Tillakaratne Dilshan contributing 193, in response
to England’s 486 all out at Lord’s in London.  Dilshan ’s highest Test score included 22 boundaries in 253
balls. He left the field to a standing ovation after being
bowled by Steven Finn, who’d collected the only Sri Lankan
wicket to fall yesterday.  Kumar Sangakkara edged Chris Tremlett to wicketkeeper Matt Prior for 26 for England’s other breakthrough today. Mahela Jayawardene is 40 not out, with Thilan Samaraweera unbeaten on
1.  England won the rain-shortened first Test by an innings and
14 runs after bowling out  Sri Lanka  for 82 in its second innings
when a draw appeared most likely.  The teams are scheduled to play three Tests, a Twenty20
match, and five one-day internationals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
