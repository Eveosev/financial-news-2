PAI Partners, Cinven Ltd. and
Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. may bid for the medical-devices unit of
 AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s Astra Tech business, the  Sunday Telegraph 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  EQT , a Swedish private-equity firm, is expected to bid for
all of Astra Tech, which consists of the devices unit and a
dental-implant operation, the newspaper reported. Second-round
bids are due tomorrow, the Telegraph said. It’s unclear if
Warburg Pincus LLC remains interested, the newspaper said.  Swiss dental-implant maker  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  is no
longer interested in the implant business, and rival  Straumann
Holding AG (STMN)  is out of the running, the newspaper said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., the investment bank working with
AstraZeneca, declined to comment, the newspaper said. Straumann,
PAI Partners, Cinven and Bridgepoint also declined to comment to
the newspaper, according to the report. AstraZeneca said it was
continuing to evaluate options for Astra Tech, the Telegraph
