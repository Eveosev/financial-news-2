Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
issued a decree that will turn the contracts of temporary state
employees permanent within one year, the official  Syrian Arab
News Agency  said today.  The decree concerns employees who have “a job that
actually has a permanent nature” and have been working for at
least two years or four years, depending on the statutes of the
company or institution employing them, it said.  Unrest has swept  Syria , inspired by the uprisings that
ousted the longtime rulers of Egypt and  Tunisia . The unrest has
prompted Assad to lift a 48-year-old emergency law, name a new
government, raise subsidies and grant more benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
