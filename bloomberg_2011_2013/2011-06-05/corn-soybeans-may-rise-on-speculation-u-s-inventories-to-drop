Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that a government report will show declining U.S.
grain inventories.  Fourteen of 25 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
Chicago on June 3 said corn will climb, and 14 of 26 respondents
forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week, corn futures for July
delivery declined 0.6 percent to $7.54 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade, and soybeans for July delivery rose 2.5 percent
to $14.145 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s drop in corn was a surprise to the majority of
analysts surveyed on May 27, while the gain in soybeans was
expected. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will update supply
estimates on June 9.  Bullish on corn: 14    Bullish on soybeans: 14
Bearish on corn: 11    Bearish on soybeans: 12  To contact the reporter on this story:
