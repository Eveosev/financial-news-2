Tottenham striker  Peter Crouch  won’t
play for  England  again under coach Fabio Capello after he was
left out of the matchday squad for yesterday’s Euro 2012 soccer
qualifier with  Switzerland , the  Mail on Sunday  reported.  Crouch was left feeling humiliated, the newspaper said,
citing an unidentified friend of the player, who’s scored 22
goals in 42 games for England. He’s felt “increasingly
marginalized” by Capello, the Mail added.  Goalkeepers  Paul Robinson  and  Ben Foster  are among players
who have already made themselves unavailable for England. The
nation drew 2-2 with Switzerland at Wembley yesterday and tops
Group G on goal difference from  Montenegro .  To contact the reporter on this story:
