Permira Advisers LLP isn’t
considering a sale of  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) ,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with Joerg Rockenhaeuser,
who heads the buyout fund’s German operations.  Permira doesn’t see any time pressure to sell the company
“today or tomorrow,” the newspaper quoted Rockenhaeuser as
saying. There are also no plans to sell the Permira-controlled
