The restaurant in Luebeck,  Germany ,
being investigated after 17 people became ill with E. coli
received supplies from Hamburg, the owner told ZDF television in
an interview today.  Luebeck is about 65 kilometers northeast of Hamburg, which
European Union Health Commissioner John Dalli said last week was
the “epicenter” of the outbreak. Authorities investigated the
restaurant as a possible source of cases in the outbreak,
Luebecker Nachrichten reported last week.  Members of the German Tax Administration Union, a Danish
tour group and a family and became ill with EHEC, or
enterohemorrhagic E. coli bacteria, after eating steak and salad
at the Kartoffelkellar, owner Joachim Berger told ZDF. A 47-
year-old female member of the tax union has died and two other
members have life-threatening conditions, ZDF said, citing the
union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
