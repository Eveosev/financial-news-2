Al Khaliji (KCBK)  plunged the most in almost
two years after the Qatari lender called off a planned merger
with International Bank of Qatar.  The shares tumbled 7.1 percent, the most since June 2009,
to 16.40 riyals at the 1 p.m. close in Doha. The benchmark  QE
index (DSM)  fell 1 percent.  International Bank of Qatar, a closely held lender, said in
May last year it was in merger discussions with Al Khaliji. The
combined entity would have been Qatar’s fourth-largest in total
assets, Al Khaliji Chairman Sheikh Hamad bin Faisal Al Thani
said in February. The merger was expected this year, IBQ
Managing Director George Nasra said in May.  Al Khaliji didn’t give a reason why the merger was
abandoned and said the decision won’t affect the bank’s
performance. "Existing governing, operational and financial
structures in place at the bank will remain unchanged," it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
