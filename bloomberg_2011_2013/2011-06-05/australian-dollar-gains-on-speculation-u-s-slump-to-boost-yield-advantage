The Australian dollar rose, trading
at almost a three-week high against the greenback as signs of a
slowing U.S. economy supported the yield advantage of the South
Pacific nation’s assets.  New Zealand ’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, was within two
cents of a record high versus the U.S. dollar after data last
week showed U.S. payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight
months and the jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent in May. The
Aussie strengthened against most of its 16 major counterparts
before the  Reserve Bank  of Australia meets tomorrow.  “The market is saying bad U.S. data is bad for the U.S.
economy and bad for the U.S. dollar,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
foreign-exchange strategist in Singapore at Westpac Banking
Corp., Australia’s second-largest lender. “We continue to see
U.S. yields come under pressure, and that’s pushing the
interest-rate differential back in  Australia ’s favor.”  Australia’s dollar advanced 0.2 percent to $1.0735 at 12:19
p.m. in  New York , after reaching as high as $1.0768. It closed
at $1.0716 June 3, when it touched $1.0775, the highest level
since May 11. The Aussie was little changed at 86.07 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 81.59 U.S. cents, compared
with 81.57 cents on June 3. It strengthened to a record high
82.64 U.S. cents on May 31. The kiwi fell 0.2 percent to 65.43
yen, from 65.53.  U.S. Economy  U.S. employment growth declined to 54,000 jobs in May from
a revised 232,000 in April, Labor Department data showed on June
3, backing the case for the  Federal Reserve  to keep  interest
rates  near zero. Yields on benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes
were at almost the lowest this year, reaching 2.94 percent last
week before trading at 3.03 percent today.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan.  Australia’s central bank is likely to keep interest rates
unchanged tomorrow, while raising them in the third quarter,
according to two Bloomberg News surveys.  The market “doesn’t want to be too short on the Aussie
dollar ahead of tomorrow’s RBA meeting,” Westpac’s Cavenagh
said. A short position is a bet a currency will fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
