Augusta State University  became the
first school in 26 years to capture back-to-back college golf
championships by beating the  University of Georgia  3-2.  Augusta State’s Patrick Reed beat  Georgia ’s Harris English
2-and-1 in the deciding match at  Karsten Creek  golf course in
Stillwater,  Oklahoma . Reed, a junior from Augusta, Georgia,
played for Georgia as a freshman before transferring to Augusta
State in 2009.  The last school to win consecutive National Collegiate
Athletic Association golf titles was the  University of Houston 
in 1984-85. Augusta State’s campus is about two miles (3.2
kilometers) from Augusta National Golf Club, home of the  Masters
Tournament .  The Jaguars beat top-ranked  Oklahoma State , the
championship host, in the semifinals. In the final against
fifth-seeded Georgia, No. 7 Augusta State got  match-play wins 
from Reed and seniors Carter Newman and Mitchell Krywulycz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
