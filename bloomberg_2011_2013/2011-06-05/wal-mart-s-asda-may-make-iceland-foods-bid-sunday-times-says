Asda, the U.K. supermarket chain
owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , may bid for Iceland Foods
Ltd., the U.K.-based frozen-food chain, the  Sunday Times 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Asda has appointed Lazard to advise it on a possible bid,
the Times said.   William Morrison Supermarkets Plc and Malcolm Walker, the
chief executive officer of Iceland Foods, are also interested in
buying the company, which is being sold by creditors of the
failed Icelandic bank Landsbanki Islands hf, the newspaper
reported. Iceland Foods is valued at between 1.2 billion pounds
($2 billion) and 1.6 billion pounds, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
