A volcanic eruption in southern  Chile 
forced the evacuation of 3,500 people in neighboring
communities, and the resulting ash cloud has caused the closure
of an airport in  Argentina .  A volcano in the Caulle Cordon, in the southern Region de
los Rios, erupted yesterday, according to information on the
website of the government’s emergency response agency  Onemi .  The evacuations are “only a prevention measure,” Miguel
Ortiz, a director at Onemi, said in televised comments,
according to news channel  Canal 24 Horas . “The government
remains on red alert.”  The airport in the Argentine city of Bariloche, on the
other side of the Andes mountains, remains closed today although
the fall of ash has stopped, Argentine news channel TN Noticias
reported on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
