Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki
appointed Hamida al-Jaf as head of the state-owned  Trade Bank of
Iraq , replacing Hussein al-Uzri amid an ongoing corruption case,
the bank’s deputy director general said.  Trade Bank of  Iraq  is under investigation for alleged
irregularities and al-Uzri, the president and chairman, was
reported by the  As Sabah  newspaper today as having fled the
country to  Beirut .  “The Trade Bank of Iraq is operating normally and people
have confidence in the bank,” Deputy Director General Abdel
Hadi Sadeq Abdel Mahdi said in a telephone interview from
 Baghdad . Asked if he knew the whereabouts of al-Uzri, Abdel
Mahdi said: “We don’t know.” He declined to comment further on
the investigation.  Iraqi authorities issued an arrest warrant for al-Uzri,
Reuters reported earlier today, citing an unidentified
government official and the bank’s lawyer. Claude Hankes, the
bank’s lawyer, said Uzri is outside Iraq and not in Lebanon,
according to the  news agency .  Al-Jaf, the new head of the trade bank, previously worked
at state-owned  Rafidain bank . “She is a well-respected banker,
with 30 years of experience,” Abdel Mahdi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
