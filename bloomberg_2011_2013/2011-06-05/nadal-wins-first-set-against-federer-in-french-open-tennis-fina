Rafael Nadal , seeking a record-tying
sixth French Open tennis title, rallied to take the first set
against Roger Federer 7-5 in the men’s final at  Roland Garros 
today.  The Spanish left-hander will retain the No. 1 ranking,
ahead of  Serbia ’s Novak Djokovic, if he wins the title. Nadal
will also tie  Sweden ’s Bjorn Borg on six Roland Garros trophies.  He fought back from 5-2 down in the set, saving a break
point in the eighth game before winning five straight games.  Switzerland ’s Federer is looking for a first Grand Slam
trophy since the 2010 Australian Open and to secure a first
victory against Nadal on the Parisian clay courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
