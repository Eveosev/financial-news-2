Thousands of British clients of  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  who kept money in  Switzerland  may have their
finances investigated by HM Revenue & Customs, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The U.K. tax authority has obtained details of as many as
7,000 HSBC customers from a former employee of the bank in
Geneva, according to the newspaper. The accounts hold assets of
about 13 billion pounds ($21.4 billion), the London-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
