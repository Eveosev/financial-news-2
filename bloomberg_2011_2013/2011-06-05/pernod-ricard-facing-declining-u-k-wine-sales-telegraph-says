Pernod-Ricard SA (RI)  is facing a decline
in U.K. wine sales because of deep discounting, the  Sunday
Telegraph  reported, citing Gilles Bogaert, chief financial
officer.  Price cuts amid a fragile economy resulted in the companyâ€™s
per-liter returns falling to 5.95 pounds ($9.77) in 2010, from
6.40 pounds in 2005, the report said, citing Euromonitor
research group figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
