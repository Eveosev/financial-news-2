Qatar imposed a temporary ban on the
importation of tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers from Germany and
 Spain  on concern the vegetables may be tainted with E. coli
bacteria, the  Qatar News Agency reported , citing a decision from
the Supreme Council of Health.  The decision included a requirement that ships carrying
fruit and vegetables from Europe carry documents proving that
they are free of E. coli, the news agency said.  A strain of the bacteria had killed at least 18 people in
Europe as of yesterday. Overall, 1,833 cases of infection from
the strain have been confirmed, the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
