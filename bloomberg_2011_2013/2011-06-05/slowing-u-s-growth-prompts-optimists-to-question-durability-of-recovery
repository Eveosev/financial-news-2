A string of disappointing economic
data capped by last week’s jobs report is prompting even some of
the more optimistic economists to question the durability of the
U.S. recovery.  While analysts such as  Stephen Stanley  of Pierpoint
Securities LLC and  Michael Feroli  of JPMorgan Chase & Co. still
see growth strengthening in the months ahead, they voiced
concern that the lull in the economy may prove prolonged,
leaving it more vulnerable to external shocks or policy
missteps.  “We’ll do better in the second half,” said Feroli, chief
U.S. economist for JPMorgan in New York and a former member of
the  Federal Reserve ’s forecasting team. “That said, the concern
is that there’s enough weakness that could feed on itself.”  Policy makers have limited leeway to respond to the
accumulating signs of slowdown. The Fed is completing its
purchase of $600 billion of  Treasury securities  this month,
leaving it with a $2.77 trillion balance sheet that some central
bankers fret is already too big.  The record $1.6 trillion federal budget deficit that the
White House projects this year has left President  Barack Obama 
with little room to use fiscal policy to spur the economy,
especially with Republican lawmakers calling for cuts in
spending, rather than more investment.  “Our economy is not creating enough jobs, and Democrats’
binge of taxing, spending, borrowing and over-regulating is a
big part of the reason why,” John Boehner, speaker of the  House
of Representatives  and a Republican from Ohio, said in a
statement on June 3.  Jobless Rate Climbs  Payrolls grew at the slowest pace in eight months in May
and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent
from 9 percent in April, Labor Department figures released on
June 3 showed. The 54,000 rise in jobs followed a 232,000 gain
in April and was below the 165,000 median increase forecast by
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The jobs numbers followed a series of economic statistics
suggesting that the economy is decelerating. Manufacturing grew
at its slowest pace in more than in year in May, according to
Institute for Supply Management data released last week.
 Consumer spending , which accounts for 70 percent of the economy,
rose less than forecast in April as households felt the pinch of
grocery and energy costs, a Commerce Department report showed.  Stanley, who is chief economist at Pierpoint in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said he is betting that the softness in the economy
will prove to be temporary, the result of a surge in gasoline
prices that has since subsided and supply disruptions from the
March earthquake and tsunami in  Japan . Like Feroli, though, he
is becoming more concerned.  Animal Spirits  “I’m starting to get worried,” Stanley said. The
economy’s “animal spirits are fragile.”  Investor concern over the economy sent stocks down. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  lost 97.29 points, or 0.8 percent, to
12,151.26 in  New York  on June 3, extending a fifth straight
weekly loss, its longest slump since 2004. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index dropped 1 percent to 1,300.16. Treasuries rose,
pushing yields on two-year notes down three basis points to 0.43
percent, the lowest this year.  Feroli and Stanley started the year more optimistic than
many of their peers. The economy was forecast to expand 3.1
percent in 2011, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey published Jan. 13. At the time,
Stanley’s projection was 3.8 percent, while Feroli predicted 3.3
percent growth. Stanley has since cut his forecast to 2.9
percent while Feroli has lowered his to 2.4 percent.  Not Alone  The two are not alone in shaving their forecasts. Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
in New York, projected growth of 3.3 percent for 2011 at the
start of the year, on a fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter
basis, and has reduced that to 3.1 percent.  Dean Maki , chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc.,
has trimmed his 2011 forecast to 2.5 percent, down from a 3.1
percent estimate at the beginning of the year.  Economists aren’t the only ones with reason to worry: the
latest jobs numbers pose a challenge to President Obama, whose
re-election prospects hinge on pushing the jobless rate lower.  “The danger is that if we continue to take two steps
forward, two steps back, people are going to continue to suffer
a high level of economic anxiety,” said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist. “There’s no way that can be good
politically for the president.”  Austan Goolsbee, Obama’s chief economist, said the jobs
report represents a “little bump” in the road to recovery and
that the broader trends are “substantially more positive” than
when Obama took office in January 2009.  Facing Headwinds  “We should never read too much into any one month’s
report,” Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, said in a June 3 interview on Bloomberg Television.
“No doubt we face some headwinds.”  The slow pace of the recovery doesn’t come as surprise to
 Kenneth Rogoff , a former International Monetary Fund chief
economist who is now a professor at  Harvard University  in
Cambridge,  Massachusetts . History shows that it takes time for
economies to recover from financial crises like the one that hit
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
