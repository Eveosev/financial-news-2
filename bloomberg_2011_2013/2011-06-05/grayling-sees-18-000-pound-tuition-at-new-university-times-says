U.K. professors, including AC Grayling and Richard Dawkins, will charge 18,000 pounds
($29,600) a year for tuition at a private university scheduled
to open next year, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing an
interview with Grayling.  The London-based New College of Humanities will start
taking applications from students next month and will begin
teaching in autumn 2012, the newspaper said. A Swiss couple,
several financiers in  London  and some of the 14 professors
involved in the project have provided the funding for the
university, the Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
