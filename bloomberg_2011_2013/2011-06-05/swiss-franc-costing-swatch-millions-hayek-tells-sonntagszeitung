Swatch Group AG (UHR)  Chief Executive
Officer Nick Hayek said the watchmaker is losing 50 million
Swiss francs ($60 million) to 60 million francs in revenue every
month because of the Swiss currency’s appreciation,
 SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an interview.  Hayek was also named chief executive of the year in a
survey conducted by financial-research company Obermatt for
SonntagsZeitung, the Zurich-based newspaper said today.  Synthes
Inc. (SYST)  CEO Michel Orsinger came second and UBS AG’s Oswald Gruebel
was third.  The franc has strengthened 6.2 percent, the best performer
among a basket of 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
