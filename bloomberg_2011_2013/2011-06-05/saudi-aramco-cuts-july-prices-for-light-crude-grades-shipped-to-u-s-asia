Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest oil
exporter, cut official selling prices for light crude grades for
July shipments to the U.S. and  Asia . The company raised prices
on the rest of its grades for July.  Saudi Arabia’s state-owned producer reduced the formula
price for its Arab Extra Light crude to Asia by $1.40 a barrel,
trimming it to $3.45 above the average of Oman and Dubai grades,
the two Gulf benchmarks used by traders in Asia. It pared the
price of Arab Super Light to Asia the most, by $2.90 a barrel,
to a premium of $4.85 a barrel over the benchmark, Aramco said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Aramco set the price for July loadings of Extra Light crude
to U.S. buyers at a $2.90 premium to the  Argus Sour Crude Index ,
or 55 cents less than June cargoes, the company said.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most
of their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of
the region’s state oil companies price their oil at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  The following table gives price differentials to benchmarks
for the four regions in which Aramco sells, as well as month-on-
month changes and the degrees of gravity as defined by the
 American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S. dollars a
