Alex Burrows scored an unassisted
goal 11 seconds into overtime to give the  Vancouver  Canucks a 3-
2 win over the  Boston Bruins  in the National Hockey League
 Stanley Cup  Final.  Burrows recorded the second fastest playoff overtime goal
in NHL history behind Montreal Canadien Brian Skrudland who
scored nine seconds into overtime against the Calgary Flame in
Game 2 of the 1986 Stanley Cup Final.  The victory gives the Canucks a 2-0 advantage in the best-
of-seven series. Of the 27 teams that have taken a 2-0 lead, 25
have gone on to win the Stanley Cup which has so far eluded the
Vancouver team.  Burrows put the Canucks ahead 1-0 in a power-play goal 12
minutes, 12 seconds into the first period.  The Bruins rallied in the second period off goals by Milan Lucic and Mark Recchi, the oldest NHL player at 43, to claim a
2-1 lead before Daniel Sedin tied the game with 10 minutes, 23
seconds left at Rogers Arena in Vancouver.  The top-seeded Canucks are the 1-2 favorite at Las Vegas
Sports Consultants to win the title after losing in their
previous trips to the championship series in 1982 and 1994.  The Bruins have lost five times in the Stanley Cup Final,
most recently in 1990, since they collected the last of their
five NHL titles in 1972.  Four teams have recovered from a 2-0 deficit to win the
Stanley Cup since the best-of-seven playoffs were introduced in
1939. The  Pittsburgh Penguins  were the last team to lose the
first two games and win the title when they defeated the  Detroit
Red Wings  in seven games in 2009.  The teams move to Boston tomorrow for Game 3 of the
playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
