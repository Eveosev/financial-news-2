President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
can learn from Germany about how the development of
environmentally friendly technology can foster economic growth,
 Tagesspiegel  reported, citing an interview.  “Germany’s commitment to the environment is admirable,”
the newspaper quoted Obama as saying. “There are things we can
learn from Berlin about how becoming greener can actually push
economic growth.”  Referring to the unrest in North Africa and the  Middle
East , Obama said “violence against peaceful protesters is
unacceptable and must stop,” according to an advance release
from the publication. “Leaders engaged in violence against
their people need to understand that they cannot smother calls
for change through oppression,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
