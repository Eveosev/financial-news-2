Volkswagen AG (VOW)  abandoned its plan to
increase its stake in Suzuki Motor Corp.,  Spiegel  reported,
citing people familiar with the matter.  The cooperation with Suzuki “is a true disappointment,”
Spiegel quoted an unidentified Volkswagen manager as saying.
While Suzuki is interested in Volkswagen’s modern drive
technology, the company isn’t willing to come to an
accommodation in joint projects, Spiegel reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
