Greece ’s new aid package may amount
to more than 100 billion euros ($146 billion) if the country
also needs support in 2013 and 2014,  Spiegel  reported.  The sum will be needed for the follow-up financing of
sovereign bonds maturing in 2014, the magazine said, citing
officials at Germany’s Finance Ministry, the  European Central
Bank  and the International Monetary Fund. German Deputy Finance
Minister Joerg Asmussen said on June 1 that he opposed new aid
for Greece if private creditors aren’t involved,  Spiegel said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
