Daniel Abugattas, a Peruvian
congressman and spokesman for presidential candidate  Ollanta Humala , comments on today’s election. Humala led Congresswoman
Keiko Fujimori in a quick count of ballots nationwide by Lima-
based researcher Ipsos-Apoyo.  Abugattas spoke to Lima-based station America Television.  On the election result:  “There isn’t going to be a tax on your chickens. Nobody’s
going to take away your house or your garage. Nothing that’s
being posted on Facebook or Twitter is going to happen.”  On market reactions:  “If the stock market falls tomorrow, it will rise on
Tuesday and on Thursday. The market won’t drop unless private
pension funds gang up and decide to sell. I hope the central
bank and the Banking Superintendent are watching tomorrow. We
plan to have a meeting with market agents this week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
