Rafael Nadal  won a record-tying sixth
 French Open  title by beating  Roger Federer  at  Roland Garros 
today, a victory that preserved his No. 1 ranking.  The Spanish left-hander retained his title by defeating
Switzerland’s Federer 7-5, 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 6-1 on the main Court
Philippe Chatrier in Paris. His victory ties him with Sweden’s
Bjorn Borg, who won six Roland Garros trophies from 1974 to
1981.  Nadal’s win means he retains the No. 1 ranking ahead of
Serbia’sNovak Djokovic, who was beaten in the semifinals by
Federer. Switzerland’s Federer was seeking a record-extending
17th major title.  The Spaniard recovered from 5-2 down in the first set,
saving a set point in the eighth game before winning five
straight games.  He opened the second set with a break, but Federer leveled
in the eighth game when Nadal hit into the net. Nadal broke back
immediately to go 5-4 up and had a set point in the next game
before a short rain delay. Upon resumption, Nadal was unable to
convert a second set point and Federer broke. The next two games
went with serve and Nadal took the tiebreak.  Five straight games went with serve in the third set before
Nadal broke to love as Federer struck a forehand wide. Federer
then won to love on Nadal’s serve in the next game and secured
another break in the 11th as he took the match into a fourth
set.  Nadal had two service breaks in the fourth set as he
advanced to victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
