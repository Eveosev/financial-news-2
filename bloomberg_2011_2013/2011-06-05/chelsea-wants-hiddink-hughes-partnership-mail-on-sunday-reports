Chelsea is in advanced negotiations
with Guus Hiddink and  Mark Hughes  to form a new management team
at the Premier League soccer club, the  Mail on Sunday reported .  Hiddink would be director of football with Hughes as first-
team coach, the newspaper said, without citing anyone. Chelsea
parted company with Carlo Ancelotti after finishing last season
without a trophy.  Hughes, a former Chelsea player who quit as Fulham coach
three days ago, will be available at the end of the month, while
Hiddink is ready to quit as Turkey coach, the Mail reported.  Inter Milan has also targeted Hiddink, but he has a good
relationship with Chelsea owner  Roman Abramovich  and the
approval of senior players, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
