The Bundesbank mispriced securities
it accepted as eligible collateral from banks against European
Central Bank cash, a spokeswoman for the bank confirmed today.  Germany ’s  Spiegel  reported earlier that the Frankfurt-based
central bank mispriced two bonds of Depfa Bank Plc by applying
too low a discount for several months. The Bundesbank confirmed
the report, saying the mispricing happened for about three
months.  “The bank greatly regrets the incident,” Bundesbank
spokeswoman Ute Bremers said by phone. No other collateral was
affected, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
