Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s
Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  is looking to attract
sovereign wealth funds in the  Middle East  ahead of the
government’s sale of the U.K. bank, the Sunday Times reported.  Hester met with investment funds in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Qatar
and Kuwait during a tour of the Gulf last week, according to the
newspaper. The bank’s CEO wants the government to sell a part of
its shareholding worth between 5 billion pounds ($8.2 billion)
and 10 billion pounds early next year, the newspaper said,
citing people close to the lender it didn’t identify.  Hester said during his visit to Abu Dhabi that he would be
disappointed if the sale of the government stake didn’t start in
2012, the Sunday Times quoted the CEO as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
