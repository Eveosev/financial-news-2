Syria  will build a nitrogenous
fertilizer plant in the eastern province of Deir-ez-Zor, the
official  Syrian Arab News Agency  said, citing Oil Minister
Sufian Alao.  The Arab country also plans to start “new gas investment
projects,” he said, without providing more details. The
ministry provides 85 percent of the gas burnt by electricity
generation companies in the country, he said.  Syria will also pursue plans for the installation of two
pipelines, one for natural gas and the other for crude oil, for
the shipment of Iraqi hydrocarbons through Syrian ports, he
said. Alao and Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem Al-Luaibi signed
a memorandum of understanding June 1 to build the new pipelines.  Iraq  is due to start crude shipments through Syria by the
end of 2011 after repairing existing pipelines, according to
Sana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
