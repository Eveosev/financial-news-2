Rick Dudley won’t be retained as
general manager of the former Atlanta Thrashers team that’s
moving to Winnipeg for the 2011-12 National Hockey League season.  The team is headed to  Canada  after being sold last week to
Winnipeg, Manitoba-based True North Sports & Entertainment.
After meeting with Dudley, the team “decided to go in another
direction” in running its hockey operations, True North
Chairman Mark Chipman said in a statement.  “We informed Rick of our decision late yesterday afternoon
and thanked him for his work in building a foundation and future
for this team,” Chipman said. He added the team won’t comment
further on personnel matters.  Winnipeg regains an NHL team after losing the Jets in 1996,
when the franchise was moved to Phoenix and renamed the Coyotes.
While the sale must be approved by the NHL’s board of governors
on June 21, the team yesterday reached a goal of selling 13,000
season tickets.  Dudley in February signed a four-year extension with the
Thrashers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
