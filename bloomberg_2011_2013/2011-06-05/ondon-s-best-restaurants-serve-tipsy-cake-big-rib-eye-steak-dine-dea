London  offers no shortage of choice
when it comes to business dining.  There’s been a trend toward informality in the past couple
of years and a focus on value, yet it’s still easy to find
traditional establishments where conversations are hushed and
mobile phones are silent.  1: Dinner by  Heston Blumenthal : Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, 66

and the food is superb. Meat Fruit and Tipsy Cake are among
dishes that diners keep going back for.  Where: In the Mandarin Oriental hotel, with floor-to-
ceiling windows looking over Hyde Park.  When: It’s difficult to get a table any time and marginally
less difficult for lunch. Take what you can get.  Bar: The hotel bar is adjacent to the restaurant. Bar
