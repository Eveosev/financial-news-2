The large number of patients sickened
by the E. coli outbreak in  Germany  has created a “tense
situation” for hospitals in the north of the country, Health
Minister Daniel Bahr said in an interview with  Bild am Sonntag .  The lack of capacity at hospitals, particularly in the
hard-hit cities of Hamburg and Bremen, could be offset by
hospitals in other regions, the newspaper cited Bahr as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
