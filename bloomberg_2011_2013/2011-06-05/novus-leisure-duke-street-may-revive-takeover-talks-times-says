Novus Leisure Ltd., the company
behind Tiger Tiger nightclubs, and private-equity firm  Duke
Street  may revive takeover talks, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Discussions between the companies, which had been taking
place for several months, broke off in the past 10 days,
according to the newspaper. Novus Leisure said the company
wasn’t for sale and wasn’t involved in a sale process, while
Duke Street declined to comment, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
