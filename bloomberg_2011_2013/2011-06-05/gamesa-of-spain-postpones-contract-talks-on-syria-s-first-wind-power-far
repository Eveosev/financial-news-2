Gamesa Corp. of  Spain  postponed
negotiations indefinitely on a contract to build Syria’s first
wind-farm power project.  Negotiations have been put off to an unspecified date,
Susana Sanjuan, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. She did not say in her June 3 statement
whether unrest in Syria over the past three months was a factor
in the company’s decision.  Syria’s National Energy Research Center selected Gamesa out
of five bidders to build the 60 million euro ($88 million) wind
farm for generating 50 megawatts of electricity, the center’s
general manager at the time, Khalil Sheikhi, said on Jan. 12. The
wind farm is to be located southwest of the central
city of Homs, al-Baath newspaper said that day, citing Sheikhi.  Syria , an oil producer in the eastern Mediterranean region,
seeks alternative sources of energy as its crude output falls
from a 1996 peak. The country plans to spend 350 billion Syrian
pounds ($7.5 billion) under a five-year power plan, including
wind and solar projects, SANA news agency reported on Dec. 16,
citing former Electricity Minister Ahmad Kayali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
