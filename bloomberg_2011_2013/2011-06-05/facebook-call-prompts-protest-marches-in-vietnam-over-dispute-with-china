Young Vietnamese, spurred by calls on
 Facebook  and other social media, marched through Hanoi to
protest  China ’s recent actions in disputed territories in the
 South China Sea .  Holding signs that read “Stop Chinese Invasion of Vietnam
Lands” and singing the national anthem, a crowd of mostly
Vietnamese college students demonstrated on Hanoi’s streets
yesterday after police blocked their path to the Chinese embassy.  The protests, announced on Facebook, blogs and chat forums,
highlight growing tensions in the South China Sea as Vietnam,
the Philippines and China are unable to agree on renewing joint
exploration in the disputed area.  For the Vietnamese demonstrators, it was an unusual public
opportunity to engage politically. Most said they heard about
the protest on Facebook, which is routinely blocked in  Vietnam .
The marchers were often flanked by security police.  Vietnam’s Ministry of  Foreign Affairs  last week formally
protested a recent incident in which Chinese naval ships
threatened Vietnamese fishermen with weapons in the area of the
Spratly Islands, according to a statement on the government
website. Vietnam also protested Chinese ships cutting survey
cables of a boat operated by Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, or
PetroVietnam, last month.  “I’m marching for peace,” said Nguyen Ly Nga Hien, a 21-
year-old university student. “If we allow China to continue its
bullying behavior, it will upset world peace. This dispute needs
to be solved through foreign affairs channels not with Chinese
boats provoking us.”  Chinese Embassy  In 2007, hundreds of people demonstrated outside the
Chinese Embassy in  Hanoi  over the Spratly and Paracel islands.  Vietnam and China have verbally sparred over the disputed
territories in recent weeks ahead of the annual  IISS  Asia
Security Summit, also known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, that
took place over the weekend in  Singapore .  The Spratly Islands are claimed all or in part by China,
Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
