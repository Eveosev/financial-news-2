Volkswagen AG (VOW)  aims to more than
double its car production in  Russia  over the medium-term, dpa-
AFX reported, citing a company spokesperson.  The company decided to increase output to benefit from tax
incentives granted by the Russian government for automakers that
produce 300,000 cars domestically, DPA said. Currently
Volkswagen produces about 150,000 cars in its Kaluga plant in
the south of Moscow, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
