The state-run  Iraq  Drilling Co.
started to drill and repair wells for the first time in 21 years
in the Hamrin mountains north of  Baghdad , Iraqiya television
said today.  The company, affiliated with the country’s Oil Ministry,
started this week to work on a total of 72 wells, the state-
sponsored television said, citing Idriss Mohsen al-Yaseri,
director general of the drilling company. The company is due to
drill 12 wells in 2011 and 18 next year, he said.  The Hamrin mountains had been a haven for insurgents,
including members of the al-Qaeda terror network, after the 2003
U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that ousted the regime of President
 Saddam Hussein . U.S.-Iraqi forces waged battles against
insurgents in the mountains in recent years.  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
depends on oil for most government revenue. It is struggling to
raise crude exports and is seeking foreign investors to boost
output after decades of conflict and sanctions destroyed its
infrastructure. The crude industry has also suffered in recent
years from insufficient spending and insurgent attacks.  Iraq has signed 15 gas and oil licenses since 2003. It
expects oil output to rise to more than 3 million barrels a day
by the end of this year, compared with 2.4 million barrels a day
in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
