Spain  still has much work to do to
improve its economy, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker  told  ABC  during an interview.  “No one doubts that the situation is difficult: there’s
high unemployment, high mortgage debt and the banking system has
problems,” the newspaper quoted Volcker as saying. “There is
still much work to do in many directions.”  Spain’s economy has the capacity to be stable and
competitive although at the moment it is stagnating, Volcker
said, according to ABC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
