Australian companies including
 Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) ’s Coles unit removed advertising from a Sydney
radio station after a nurse in London who took a hoax phone call
about the Duchess of Cambridge was found dead.  Coles instructed 2Day FM to remove advertising from the
station as soon as possible, the supermarket said on its
Facebook  page . Telstra Corp., Australia’s biggest phone company,
has suspended advertising on the station until an investigation
into the issue has concluded, the Australian newspaper  reported 
on its website, citing an unidentified spokesman.  Two presenters from Southern Cross  Austereo  phoned London’s
King Edward VII hospital this week seeking details about the
health of the former  Kate Middleton  after she was admitted for
acute morning sickness. The nurse who took the call has been
found dead, the  BBC  reported yesterday.  “We respect the right of our advertisers to make the
decisions that they think is best for them,”  Southern Cross
Media Group Ltd. (SXL)  Chief Executive Officer Rhys Holleran said at a
press conference in Melbourne today. “Southern Cross Austereo
and the hosts have mutually decided that their show will not
return until further notice.”  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are deeply saddened by
the death, according to a  statement .  “We’re satisfied that we haven’t broken any laws,”
Holleran said. The station “is committed to working with
authorities in any investigation into this tragedy,” he said.  The duchess left hospital on Dec. 6. Wesfarmers is
Australia’s second-biggest retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
