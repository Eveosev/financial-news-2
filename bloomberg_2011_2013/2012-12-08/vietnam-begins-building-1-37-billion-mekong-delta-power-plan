Vietnam  Electricity began building a
28.5 trillion-dong ($1.37 billion) coal-fired electricity plant
in the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh as the country seeks to
reduce its dependence on hydropower.  The Duyen Hai 3 power station will have a capacity of 1,244
megawatts, with annual projected output of about 7.8 billion
kilowatt-hours, the government said on its website. The plant
will use about 3.6 million metric tons of domestic coal a year.  Vietnam is seeking to curb reliance on hydropower to avoid
shortages during the dry season. By building coal-fired capacity
it can take advantage of reserves that have made it Southeast
Asia’s biggest coal-producing nation after  Indonesia . Vietnam’s
coal output has more than tripled since 2001, BP Plc  data  show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
