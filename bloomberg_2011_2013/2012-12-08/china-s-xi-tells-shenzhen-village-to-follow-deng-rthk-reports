Xi Jinping, the new head of  China ’s
Communist Party, told residents of a fishing village near the
southern city of Shenzhen to follow the path set by former
leader Deng Xiaoping, Radio Television Hong Kong reported.  Xi spent 45 minutes in the village in Guangdong province
and asked after living and economic conditions, the report said,
citing residents and village officials. He waved from the car
window as he departed for Lotus Hill, RTHK reported.  Lotus Hill is a park in Shenzhen that has a bronze statue
of Deng, whose 1992 tour of Guangdong spurred China’s economic
reform and opening up.  Xi, who succeeded Hu Jintao as general secretary of the
party last month, arrived in Shenzhen yesterday on his first
trip since taking power, the South China Morning Post reported
today. Xi made “low-key” visits to the Qianhai experimental
zone and to  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , according to the newspaper,
citing an unidentified propaganda official.  Xi ordered that his reception, banquet, security, and
traffic controls during his visit be kept “low profile,” the
newspaper said, citing Shenzhen propaganda officials.  The official Xinhua News Agency and state-run China Central
Television have yet to report on Xi’s visit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
