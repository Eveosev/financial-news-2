Outfielder Brett Gardner, who led the
American League in 2011 with 49 stolen bases before being
limited by injury to 31 at-bats last season, is returning to the
 New York  Yankees.  Gardner, 29, and the Yankees have agreed to a $2.85 million
contract for the 2013 Major League Baseball season to avoid
salary arbitration, the Associated Press reported yesterday
without saying where it got the information. Gardner can earn an
extra $150,000 in performance bonuses, the AP said.  Gardner was sidelined last season from mid-April until late
September by a right elbow injury. He made $2.8 million in 2012,
the AP said.  Gardner has 137 stolen bases and a .266 batting average in
five major league seasons, all with the Yankees. He has 15 home
runs and 23 triples in his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
