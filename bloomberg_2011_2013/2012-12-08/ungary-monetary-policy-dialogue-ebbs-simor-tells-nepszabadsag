Hungary ’s monetary policy makers are
becoming less open to dialogue and professional debate, Magyar
Nemzeti Bank President Andras Simor said.  “I noticed at the beginning of my term that dialog among
Monetary Council members is less than what I’d regard optimal --
and willingness for debate has declined, deteriorated further
recently,” Simor said in an interview with the daily
 Nepszabadsag , published today.  The president, whose six-year term ends next year, argued
that Council members who supported recent interest-rate cuts
“overestimate” the impact of monetary easing on economic
growth or lending and warned that the rate cuts have led to a
rise in inflation expectations, the Budapest-based newspaper
reported.  The central bank may lower the level of its foreign-
currency reserves when the external debt level declines, Simor
said, adding that currently the amount of reserves was
appropriate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
