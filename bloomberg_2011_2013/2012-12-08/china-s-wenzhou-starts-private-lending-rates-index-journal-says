The Chinese city of Wenzhou started
publishing a weekly index to track private lending rates in the
city, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing the
local government.  Borrowing costs were 21.4 percent for the week Nov. 26 to
Nov. 30, according to the first “Wenzhou Index,” down 0.56
percentage point from the previous week, the newspaper reported.  Wenzhou, located in the eastern province of Zhejiang, is an
export hub dominated by private companies where lending outside
of the formal banking system is prevalent. The government in
March announced a trial project in the city to ease funding for
small companies and monitor underground financing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
