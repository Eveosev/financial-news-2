A case of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
1945 Bordeaux sold for $147,000 to a U.S. private collector at a
Sotheby’s sale in  New York  which started this month’s final
series of wine auctions in the run-up to the holiday season.  Six bottles of Romanee-Conti 1995 Domaine de la Romanee-
Conti Burgundy fetched $79,625 and a similar lot of the 1996
vintage sold for $73,500, while a case of La Tache 1990 DRC went
for $67,375 at the Dec. 1 auction, according to e-mailed results
from Sotheby’s.  The auction featured Champagne from the Krug cellars,
including 12 bottles of Krug Clos du Mesnil 1990 which fetched
$58,187 from a U.S. buyer and a case of the 1996 vintage which
 sold  for $42,875 to a Latin American collector.  The sale came after global wine auctions exceeded $50
million in November, driven by  demand  for top Burgundies as well
as classic Bordeaux producers.  Following are auction results this year from the five
biggest houses: New York-based Acker Merrall & Condit Company
Inc., Christie’s, based in London,  Sotheby’s (BID) , with its
headquarters in New York,  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  of Chicago

aren’t included.  Links on auction-house names are to results or catalogs on
