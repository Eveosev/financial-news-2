Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
indicated he intends to resign and will seek to corral his
splintering parliamentary majority to pass a budget before
leaving office.  “The prime minister doesn’t think continuing his term is
possible and has therefore expressed his intention to resign,”
President Giorgio Napolitano’s office said in an e-mailed
statement today. Monti will check with lawmakers to see if
“they are prepared to approve the budget law in the short
term.”  After that, “the Prime Minister will formalize his
irrevocable resignation,” Napolitano said.  The statement was issued after a two-hour meeting between
the two men in  Rome  tonight.  Monti’s government is being pushed to an early end as his
biggest backer in parliament, former prime minister  Silvio Berlusconi , withdraws his support. Napolitano, who has met with
Monti’s supporters in recent days, said the political parties
don’t want to force Italy into an emergency budget.  Pierluigi Bersani, leader of the  Democratic Party  -- which
still supports Monti -- said he wants to pass the budget,
according to RAI 24 news today.  Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party will back the budget
bill, party General Secretary Angelino Alfano told Ansa after
Naplitano’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
