The euro fell against the dollar and
yen for the first time in four weeks after the European Central
Bank lowered its economic forecast for the region and policy
makers discussed trimming benchmark interest rates.  The 17-nation currency had the biggest one-day decline in a
month on Dec. 6 as the central bank joined  Germany ’s Bundesbank
in scaling back growth projections. The dollar weakened against
higher-yielding currencies after the nation’s employment rate
unexpectedly fell to an almost four-year low. The Federal
Reserve meets next week when the central bank if forecast to
increase its asset purchases.  “Lowering interest rates is just plain negative for a
currency,’ Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain
Capital Group LLC in New York said Dec. 7. “With the ECB’s
downward revisions to inflation, it’s going to be below the 2
percent target and in that case it’s pretty likely that they
would lower rates.”  The shared currency fell 0.5 percent to $1.2927 in New York
for the first weekly loss since Nov. 9. It touched $1.2877 on
Dec. 7, the weakest since Nov. 23. The euro declined 0.4 percent
to 106.67, reaching 106.12 yen yesterday, the lowest in more
than a week. The yen was little changed versus the dollar at
82.49.  Annual Accounting  The euro has lost 2.5 percent this year, the second-worst
performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen slid 9.5 percent
and the dollar fell 2.2 percent.  Futures traders  cut bets  that the euro will decline against
the dollar to the least since September 2011, figures from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. Net shorts were
32,795 on Dec. 4, compared with net shorts of 66,693 a week
earlier.  Net long positions in the Australian dollar totaled a
record 92,229, while net-short yen positions against the dollar
 reached  90,326, the most since July 2007, the data show.  New Zealand’s dollar rose to a two-month high against the
greenback of Dec. 6 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said
economic growth was likely to quicken.  Domestic Outlook  “The overall outlook is for stronger domestic demand and
the elimination of current excess capacity by the end of next
year,” central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler said in Wellington
on Dec. 6. “This is expected to cause inflation to rise
gradually toward the 2 percent target midpoint.”  It rose 1.5 percent to 83.24 U.S. cents in its biggest
weekly advance since Sept. 14.  The Swiss franc fell against all its major counterparts as
Credit Suisse Group AG said in a notice distributed to bank
clients Dec. 3 that it will communicate the currencies involved
in its plan to charge negative interest rates on cash balances,
plus the thresholds and rates on an individual basis to those
customers during the next five business days.  The franc declined 0.2 percent to 1.2075 per euro after
depreciating to the weakest since Sept. 18.  The Swiss central bank’s  foreign-currency reserves  fell for
a second month in November after pressure to defend the 1.20 on
the franc per euro eased.  European Policy  The ECB held its  benchmark  at a record low of 0.75 percent
and kept the deposit rate at zero. A majority of ECB policy
makers were open to cutting the benchmark rate yesterday and
there is a possibility of a reduction early next year, three
officials with knowledge of the Governing Council’s
deliberations said.  The central bank lowered its inflation forecast for next
year to 1.6 percent from 1.9 percent. The euro fell as much as
0.9 percent on Dec. 6, its largest daily decline since Nov. 7.  “The market hears what it perceives to be as hints as to
the way policy may be moving in the future, so it’s
understandable that the market is going to respond in the way it
has been in weakening the euro,” Robert Lynch, head of currency
strategy for HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Sara Eisen on Dec. 6.  The Frankfurt-based Bundesbank also cut its growth
projection for 2013 to 0.4 percent from the 1.6 percent
predicted in June and said the economy.  Dollar Measure  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, rose 0.3 percent to 80.412, for its first gain in
three weeks. It touched 80.658 on Dec. 7, the strongest since
Nov. 23.  The dollar weakened versus higher-yielding currencies such
as the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso as U.S. employment
climbed by 146,000 Labor Department figures showed. The median
estimate of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
gain of 85,000.  The Canadian dollar added 0.6 percent to 98.84 cents per
U.S. dollar.  Mexico ’s peso advanced 0.9 percent to 12.8505.  The Fed is working to boost the economy and reduce
unemployment by continuing purchases of housing debt that have
helped drive borrowing costs to an all-time low. The policy-
setting Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting of this
year is scheduled for Dec. 11-12 in  Washington .  Japan ’s currency touched a seven-month low against the euro
on Dec. 5 after BOJ Deputy Governor  Kiyohiko Nishimura  said the
central bank was ready for action when needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
