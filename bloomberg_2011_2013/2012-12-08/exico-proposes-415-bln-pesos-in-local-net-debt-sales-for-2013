President Enrique Pena Nieto’s
administration is proposing 415 billion pesos ($32.3 billion) of
domestic debt sales next year, the  Finance Ministry  said today
in the budget proposal sent to Congress.  The government will favor domestic sales to cover its
financial needs and expects to carry out syndicated bond sales
via auctions handled by the nation’s central bank, according to
the ministry’s presentation published on its  website .  Mexico will sell as much as $7 billion of debt overseas
next year and will consider issuing bonds in currencies other
than the  U.S. dollar , the ministry said.  The government “will evaluate several financing sources,
including the possible issuance of bonds in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, such as the yen, euro and sterling
pound,” according to the proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
