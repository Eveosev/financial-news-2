The president of Mexico’s Senate said
the upper house probably will approve “very quickly” the
revenue portion of the 2013 budget presented yesterday by
President Enrique Pena Nieto’s government, Milenio reported.  Ernesto Cordero  told the newspaper in an interview that the
Senate will pass the proposal before the Dec. 31 deadline. The
Senate president declined to discuss the spending portion of the
budget, saying he still needs to analyze it, Milenio said.  Pena Nieto proposed a balanced budget for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
