Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) 
offered $550 million to buy out Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler
from a company holding interests in copper and cobalt licenses
in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo.  The cash bid is for 49.5 percent of Camrose Resources Ltd.,
which is indirectly owned by a Gertler family trust, London-
based ENRC said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The offer,
which also is for minority shareholdings in some Camrose units,
is expected to close by Dec. 28, ENRC said.  ENRC, which produces ferroalloys and iron ore as well as
copper, bought its 50.5 percent stake in Camrose from Gertler,
38, for $175 million in 2010. ENRC said the latest deal will
simplify its structure and create cost savings across its
operations in the region. The Camrose assets produce about
100,000 metric tons of copper annually and estimated 2013
capital expenditure is about $300 million, ENRC said.  “This transaction is an integral part of the corporate
governance and company structure optimization which I set as a
key priority when I assumed chairmanship,” ENRC Chairman Mehmet Dalman said in the statement.  Camrose lost $14.8 million in the six months through June
30 and had gross assets of $326 million at that date, ENRC said.
Camrose holds about 64 percent of Vancouver-based mining company
 Africo Resources Ltd (ARL) , according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  ENRC’s board was advised by Morgan Stanley. Its independent
directors were advised by  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  The shares fell 0.1
percent to 283 pence at the close in  London . ENRC’s lost 55
percent of its market value this year.  (ENRC will hold a conference call at 9:30 a.m. London time
on Dec. 10. Dial +44-20-3140-8286, pass code 8407438.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
