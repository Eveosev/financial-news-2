Chelsea would consider Dortmund’s
Jurgen Klopp as coach if it can’t persuade former Barcelona boss
Pep Guardiola to take over the Premier League club in the
summer, the Daily Mail said.  Guardiola has concerns about working for Blues owner  Roman
Abramovich  and was surpsised by Roberto Di Matteo’s firing last
month after winning the Champions League and F.A. Cup in May,
the Mail said. He also wants total control of soccer operations,
something that hasn’t been given under Abramovich, the newspaper
said.  Chelsea’s senior staff is making contingency plans with
Klopp, who’s led Dortmund to two straight German Bundesliga
titles, high on the list, the Mail said. Former manager  Jose
Mourinho , who looks set to leave Real Madrid, may also feature,
the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
