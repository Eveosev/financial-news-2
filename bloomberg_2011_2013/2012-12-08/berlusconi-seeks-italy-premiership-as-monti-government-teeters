Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced out of office a year ago, confirmed
he will run for the premiership again in next year’s elections.  “I am returning to the public sphere due to desperation,”
Berlusconi told reporters today, according to a video posted on
the website of Sky TG24. He accused Prime Minister Mario Monti
of implementing policies to please a “German-centric” European
Union.  Berlusconi, 76, is preparing a comeback by disowning his
ties to Monti’s government and appealing to voters weary of
austerity and recession. The billionaire media magnate, who was
sentenced in October to four years in prison for fraud,
reiterated that his People of Liberty party will withdraw its
support for the government and said he is in favor of scheduling
parliamentary elections for March 10.  Berlusconi is pending appeal of his fraud conviction. In an
unrelated case, he is standing trial on charges of abuse of
power and engaging a minor in prostitution, allegations he has
denied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
