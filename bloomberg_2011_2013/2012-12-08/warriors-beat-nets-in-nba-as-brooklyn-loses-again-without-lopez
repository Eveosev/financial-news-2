David Lee had 30 points and 15
rebounds and Stephen Curry added 28 points as the visiting
Golden State Warriors defeated the Brooklyn Nets 109-102 in a
National Basketball Association game.  Joe Johnson  scored a season-high 32 points last night for
the Nets, who were missing starting center and leading scorer
Brook Lopez for the fourth straight game because of a sprained
right foot.  Golden State, which trailed by eight points at halftime,
improved to 12-7. The Nets (11-7) have lost three straight games
to fall three games behind the  New York Knicks  in the Eastern
Conferenceâ€™s Atlantic division.  The game was played at the Barclays Center, which is
located seven blocks from where Warriors coach Mark Jackson went
to high school.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
