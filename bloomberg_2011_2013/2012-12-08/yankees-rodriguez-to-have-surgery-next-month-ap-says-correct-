(Corrects spelling of Rodriguez in headline.)  New York  Yankees third baseman  Alex
Rodriguez  said he’ll undergo surgery on his injured left hip
next month, the  Associated Press  reported.  The Yankees announced Dec. 3 that Rodriguez will have
arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum, as well as correct
bone alignment and a cyst. He’ll be out for as long as six
months, the team said.  Rodriguez, 37, said today at a function for a high school
tournament he hosts in Miami that the procedure will be
performed in “mid-January,” AP reported.  Rodriguez, who is owed $115 million on the final five years
of his contract with New York, batted .272 with 18 home runs and
57 runs batted in over 122 games in 2012. He’s hit 647 homers
during his 19-year career, most among active players and fifth
all-time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
