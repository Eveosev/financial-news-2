Billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , an
investor in businesses from Facebook Inc. to Arsenal soccer
club, was re-elected president of the  International Fencing
Federation  before its 100th anniversary next year.  Usmanov, who has headed the organization since 2008, was
elected for a second term during a meeting at Moscow’s Ritz-
Carlton Hotel today.  With a fortune estimated at $17.4 billion by the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index , Usmanov has plowed millions of dollars into
fencing through a dedicated charity fund. The entrepreneur, who
made more than $1 billion investing in Facebook and founded
Russian mining company Metalloinvest, has long had a passion for
the combative sport, having participated since the age of 13.  The federation almost doubled its budget during Usmanov’s
first term to as much as 24.5 million Swiss francs ($26.2
million), it said today in a statement. It’s seeking to increase
the number of Olympic fencing medal events at the 2016 Rio de
Janeiro games to 12 from 10, according to the statement.  Usmanov also supports the Russian Volleyball Federation,
the country’s Kontinental Hockey League and the Association of
Winter Olympic Sports. He controls about 30 percent of Arsenal
with partner Farhad Moshiri.  To contact the reporter on this story:
