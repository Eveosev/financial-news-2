China’s Wanxiang America Co. won the
bidding for  A123 Systems Inc. (AONEQ) , a maker of electric-car
batteries, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter.  Wanxiang bid between $250 million and $260 million, which
surpassed an joint offer from  Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  and  NEC
Corp. (6701) , the newspaper said. Germany’s  Siemens AG (SIE)  had also bid for
A123 during the auction held by the law firm of  Latham &
Watkins , the WSJ said.  A spokesman for A123 declined to comment to the WSJ, while
a spokeswoman for Johnson Controls wasn’t immediately reached by
the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
