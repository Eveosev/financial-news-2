President  Robert Mugabe  was nominated
unopposed as the candidate for the  Zimbabwe  African National
Union-Patriotic Front to contest next year’s elections and vowed
to restore lost “honor and pride.”  “We are now like a wounded beast, let’s fight back and
restore our honor and pride,” Mugabe told supporters at the
party’s conference in the city of Gweru in central Zimbabwe. He
said it was “sad that people say” one faction of his ZANU-PF
party belongs to Defense Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa and another
to Vice President Joice Mujuru.  “That is dangerous, absolutely dangerous,” he said.
“Those ambitions are causing the splits down the party. Unity,
unity, unity. We must speak unity and unite the people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
