Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto
lowered the proposed amount Petroleos Mexicanos will spend on
exploring, producing and refining oil next year, presenting a
budget 4 percent below the company’s expectations.  Next year’s 326 billion-peso proposal ($25.4 billion) for
 capital expenditures  for the state-owned oil producer comes
about $1.1 billion short of the 340 billion pesos the company
had requested.  “Once again, Pemex is being unilaterally limited by the
 Finance Ministry  regardless of its operational needs and
opportunities,” board member Fluvio Ruiz said yesterday in a
telephone interview from Mexico City after the budget proposal
was submitted. “It’s disappointing, that an artificial ceiling,
set by Deputy Minister  Miguel Messmacher , is hitting the
company,” Ruiz said, citing a government cap on investment of 2
percent of gross domestic product.  The budget allocated is 8.4 percent higher in nominal terms
than this year’s investment program, according to the Finance
Ministry’s  website . The amount, as in previous years, is about 2
percent of the nation’s GDP.  The ministry’s budget plan assumes exported oil will sell
in 2013 for an average of $84.90 a barrel, about the same as
this year’s budgeted $85 a barrel price. Mexico, the third-
largest supplier of oil to the U.S., paid 11.7 billion pesos to
lock in prices for 2013 oil exports, according to a quarterly
public finances report on Oct. 30.  Oil Hedges  Luis Videgaray, the nation’s finance minister, said  Mexico 
purchased hedges to lock in prices for 2013 oil exports at a
price that is in line with the government’s estimate. He spoke
at the Congress yesterday after submitting the budget to
lawmakers.  The Finance Ministry expects Pemex’s oil output to rise
next year to 2.6 million barrels a day, compared with the
government’s estimate of 2.55 million barrels a day for this
year, Videgaray said.  Pemex’s total budget, including administrative costs, will
be 477 billion pesos, up from 442.5 billion pesos this year.
Pemex had invested 224 billion pesos, or 74 percent, of its 2012
budget as of Oct. 31,, according to a monthly company report.  Pemex’s budget proposal for 2012 was also cut on Sept. 8 of
last year by the administration of then-President  Felipe Calderon  to 301 billion pesos from the 331 billion pesos the
company had originally requested.  Mexico’s Congress must approve the new budget by Dec. 31.
Emilio Lozoya, a former board member of  OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*) , was
appointed last week as Pemex CEO by Pena Nieto, who took office
