Falling inflation rates in Colombia,
Chile and  Peru  last month reflected easing fuel and food prices
and are unlikely to lead to a change in monetary policy,
Peruvian central bank President Julio Velarde said today.  The three Andean nations all reported that inflation slowed
in November, even as all three are on track to exceed the
average economic growth rate this year in  Latin America  and the
world, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Chile and Peru kept borrowing costs unchanged in their last
meetings of policy makers, while Colombia reduced its key rate,
surprising analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. November inflation
will do little to sway policy makers because it reflects
external rather than internal economic conditions, Velarde told
reporters in Santiago.  “This was a reverse in the supply shock, not demand,” he
said when asked about easing inflation rates. “This isn´t
something that should change monetary policy.”  Chile’s inflation rate dropped to 2.1 percent in November
from 2.9 percent the month before, while Peru’s fell to 2.66
percent from 3.25 percent and  Colombia ’s to 2.77 percent from
3.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
