Asian  stocks  rose for a third week,
with the regional benchmark gauge capping the longest winning
streak in three months, as  China ’s government pledged to boost
urban development and gains in U.S. services and factory orders
boosted exporters.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 4.1 percent this week,
the biggest such gain since October 2011. Anhui Conch Cement Co.,
China’s biggest cement maker, paced gains among construction-
related shares as the country’s new leadership vowed to support
urbanization.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , which gets 67 percent
of sales from the U.S., rose 3.9 percent in Sydney. Shimizu Corp.
paced gains among construction companies in Tokyo on bets a
deadly highway-tunnel collapse will lead to more public works
spending.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 1.2 percent to 126.14
this week, capping a seven-day rally, the longest rising streak
since September. Gains were limited as U.S. lawmakers continued
to negotiate a budget compromise to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff.  “The economic data looks OK and that’s been supporting the
share market,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of strategy
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion
under management. “Markets will have to see a resolution of the
U.S. fiscal cliff for the rally to continue.”  The MXAP measure advanced almost 16 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 as central banks from Europe, the U.S.,
Japan and China took steps to support economic growth. The gauge
traded at 14.2 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 13.6 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled

China’s stock exchanges, rose 4.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index gained 0.7 percent while a gauge of Chinese companies
listed in the former British colony advanced 2.8 percent.  China ETF  The  iShares FTSE A50 China Index  exchange traded fund, the
biggest such vehicle that allows people outside China to invest
in the country’s domestic shares, surged 6.5 percent in  Hong
Kong .  China’s official manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
rose to 50.6 in November, the highest reading in seven months,
data released by the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing on Dec. 1 showed. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion. Another private survey
also showed expansion.  China will keep its proactive fiscal policy and prudent
monetary policy and promote economic restructuring and
urbanization, Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping was
cited as saying by the official  China Central Television  on Dec.
6.  ‘Positive Benefit’  “There’s a lot of talk about potential policy support for
 China’s economy ,” said Tim Leung, a  fund manager  who helps
oversee about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. “While
urbanization is not new, people will probably be focusing on
that trend. There’s a lot of positive benefit from urbanization,
like infrastructure spending.”  Anhui Conch Cement jumped 9.1 percent to HK$28.15 and China

an electronics maker that gets 20 percent of its sales in
America, advanced 5.3 percent to 1.48 million won in Seoul.  Fiscal Cliff  The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent this week as U.S. policy
makers continued to grapple with a budget compromise that would
avert a series of tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called
fiscal cliff.  Japanese construction companies advanced this week after a
fatal tunnel collapse raised the outlook for infrastructure
spending. Shimizu rose 6.1 percent to 263 yen and Obayashi Corp.
