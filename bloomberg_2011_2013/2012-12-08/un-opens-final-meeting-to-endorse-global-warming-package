Envoys from more than 190 countries
at United Nations global warming talks began their final meeting
on whether to endorse a package of measures that would limit
pollution and channel aid for climate projects.  The diplomats were discussing a proposal from Qatar aimed
at breaking a deadlock between rich nations and poorer ones over
how to move on restraining fossil fuel emissions blamed for
damaging the atmosphere. None of the delegates spoke about the
plan in an informal meeting about the package in Doha today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
