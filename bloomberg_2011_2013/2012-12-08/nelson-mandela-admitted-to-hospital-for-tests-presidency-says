Nelson Mandela , the former South
African president, was admitted to a Pretoria hospital for
undisclosed tests and is doing well, President  Jacob Zuma  said.  “Former President Mandela will receive medical attention
from time to time which is consistent with his age,” Zuma said
in an e-mailed statement. “There is no cause for alarm.”  Mandela, who turned 94 in July and hasn’t appeared in
public since the 2010 soccer  World Cup , divides his time between
Johannesburg and his ancestral home in Qunu, in South Africa’s
Eastern Cape province. He underwent exploratory surgery for an
abdominal complaint in February and was hospitalized a year
before that for an acute respiratory infection.  Mandela spent 27 years in prison on an island near  Cape
Town  over his fight for black rights and became the country’s
first black president after apartheid, the official racial
segregation policy, ended in 1994. He negotiated a peaceful end
to the old regime with leaders of South Africa’s white minority
government and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. He
stepped down as president voluntarily in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
