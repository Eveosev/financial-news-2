The U.S. and  South Korea  signed a
contingency plan of action against attacks from North  Korea ,
which this month threatened preemptive nuclear strikes against
the two allies.  General James Thurman, commander of U.S. Forces Korea,
signed the agreement on March 22 with South Korean Joint Chiefs
of Staff Chairman General Jung Seung Jo, South Korea’s  Defense
Ministry  said today in a statement on its website.  The document outlines South Korean-led, U.S.-backed action
against various scenarios from a North Korean provocation, the
ministry said. The two militaries decided to draft a joint
blueprint after North Korea shelled the South Korean border
island of Yeonpyeong in November 2010.  Inter-Korean tensions are the highest at least since the
2010 attack after Kim Jong Un’s regime detonated a nuclear
device in February. The U.S. and South Korea are in the middle
of military drills that  North Korea  has said put the peninsula
on the brink of war, and the Obama administration is boosting
its regional anti-missile defenses as a result.  “By completing this plan, we improved our combined
readiness posture to allow us to immediately and decisively
respond to any North Korean provocation,” the allies said in an
e-mailed statement. “The completed plan includes procedures for
consultation and action to allow for a strong and decisive
combined ROK-US response.”  ROK stands for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of
Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
