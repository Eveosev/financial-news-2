The European Central Bank said it
won’t stop the  Cypriot central bank  from providing the island’s
banking sector with emergency funding, after euro-area leaders
agreed on the terms of a 10-billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout.  “The Governing Council decided not to object to the
request for provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance by the
Central  Bank of Cyprus , in accordance with the prevailing
rules,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in an e-mailed statement
today. “It will continue to monitor the situation closely.”  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed early this
morning to shut the country’s second-largest bank and tax
deposits of more than 100,000 euros after a week of negotiations
that saw the parliament in Nicosia reject an earlier version.
The ECB had threatened to veto emergency funds if a deal that
promised fresh capital and ensured the solvency of the
Mediterranean island’s banks wasn’t signed by today.  “The Governing Council also notes the agreement reached on
restoring the viability of the Cypriot financial system in order
to finance the Cypriot economy,” the ECB said. “Now steadfast
implementation is key for Cyprus to regain access to financial
markets and return to growth as soon as possible.”  Cyprus’s banks will begin to open tomorrow after a bank
holiday imposed since last week. The Brussels deal will see
 Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl (CPB) , the country’s second biggest, wound
down, and the viable assets taken over by  Bank of Cyprus Plc (BOCY) ,
the biggest lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
