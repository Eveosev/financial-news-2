Taiwan’s 10-year bonds fell as
Cyprus agreed terms on a bailout, easing concern that  Europe ’s
debt crisis will escalate. The local dollar rebounded from its
weakest level in almost seven months.  The accord between Cyprus and the “troika” representing
international lenders was reached overnight in Brussels and
ratified by finance ministers from the 17-nation euro area.
Taiwan plans to issue NT$140 billion ($4.7 billion) of bonds in
four sales next quarter, less than the NT$185 billion sold in
the same period of 2012. The central bank will leave the
benchmark  interest rate  at 1.875 percent at its next policy
meeting on March 28, according to all 10 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Yields are rising as the Cyprus situation is
alleviated,” said Sam Chang, a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Issuance for the next quarter is
less than last year but that’s not the biggest news of the day,
so the impact on the market is limited.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 was 1.305 percent as of 4:27 p.m. in Taipei, compared with
1.301 percent on March 22, according to Gretai Securities Market.
The local dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.889 against
its U.S. counterpart, after touching NT$29.91 earlier, the
weakest level since Sept. 7, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
was 0.2 percent stronger than March 22 one minute before the
close of trading.  Forwards Rise  The central bank has sold the local currency in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
NT$29.835, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 3.52 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.385 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
