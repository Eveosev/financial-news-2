Nigeria, Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, will export one cargo of its Okono crude in May, the
same number as for next month, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The 900,000-barrel consignment will now be shipped from May
14 to May 15 compared with the original schedule of April 20 to
April 21, the plan showed.  The nation will also export one lot of Pennington in May, a
separate schedule showed. No cargoes of the grade will be
shipped next month.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
