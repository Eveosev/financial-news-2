Visa Inc. (V)  climbed to a record high
after Nomura Holdings Inc. said a long-term global shift away
from cash would help the bank-card network at  Western Union
Co. (WU) ’s expense.  Visa advanced $2.70, or 1.7 percent, to $162.79 at 11:52
a.m. in New York. The shares earlier touched $162.92, the
highest intraday price since the Foster City, California-based
company’s March 2008  initial public offering . Western Union, the
world’s largest money-transfer business, slid 0.6 percent to
$14.55 and has dropped 19 percent in the past year.  “Visa continues to thrive in a world of electronic
payments,” Bill Carcache and Tulu Yunus, Nomura analysts, said
today in a research note. Englewood, Colorado-based Western
Union, which benefits from paper-based transactions, is “a
value trap based on our belief that its core money-transfer
business is in secular decline,” they wrote.  Worldwide purchases with credit and debit cards are
projected to surpass $21.3 trillion in 2016, a 73 percent
increase from 2011, according to the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter. Visa, the world’s biggest payments network, posted a
$1.29 billion  profit  in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31,
a 26 percent increase from a year earlier, as card spending
climbed 8.7 percent.  “Our No. 1 competitor is cash,” Visa Chief Executive
Officer  Charlie Scharf , 47, said last week during an investor
presentation. “There is so much cash out there that our jobs
have to be to eliminate the cash.”  Overweight Visa  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  CEO Ajay Banga, 53, whose Purchase, New
York-based company runs the second-biggest network by processed
transactions, previously declared a “war on cash.”  Western Union said last month that fourth-quarter profit
plunged 47 percent to $237.9 million and that it expects “low
single digit” revenue declines this year before sales and
profit growth resume in 2014.  Carcache and Yunus, who titled their research note “Cash
Is Not King,” have an overweight rating on Visa and a target
price of $172. They rate Western Union as neutral and predict
the shares will fall to $13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
