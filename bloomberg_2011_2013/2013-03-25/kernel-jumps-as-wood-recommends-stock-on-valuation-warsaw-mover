Kernel Holding SA (KER) , Ukraine’s
biggest sunflower-oil producer, jumped the most in two months in
Warsaw trading as Wood & Co. recommended buying its stock after
a recent slump made it “attractively priced.”  The  shares  advanced as much as 4 percent and traded 3.2
percent higher to 57.3 zloty at 12:25 p.m. in Warsaw, the
biggest gain since Jan. 23. Wood upgraded the stock to buy from
hold with a price estimate at 66.7 zloty.  Kernel has slumped 14 percent  this year  after the Kiev-
based company cut its 2013 profit forecast and fiscal second-
quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  “Against the stock’s undemanding valuation, on what we
perceive as trough earnings and Kernel’s potential to halt its
margin erosion next season, we consider Kernel’s current price
as a buying opportunity,” Piotr Drozd, an analyst at Wood in
Warsaw, said in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
