Vital SA, a Romanian water utility,
awarded a contract for upgrading and expanding the water and
sewage system in the northern town of Baia Mare to a group led
by  Germany â€™s Ludwig Pfeiffer Hoch-und Tiefbau GmbH.  Vital plans to rehabilitate the water and wastewater
infrastructure in Baia Mare for about 63 million lei ($19
million), less than the initial estimated 72 million-lei value
of the contract, a European Union  procurement document  showed.  The group also includes the Romanian companies
Electroechipament Industrial SRL, Intellinstal SRL and Wurp
