Arabtec Holding (ARTC)  PJSC, the Dubai
real-estate developer, appointed former  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
executive Shohidul Ahad-Choudhury as head of mergers and
acquisitions and said growth is resuming in the industry.  Ahad-Choudhury will also act as a financial advisor to the
managing director and chief executive officer, Arabtec said
today in a statement to the Dubai stock exchange. He worked at
Deutsche Bank for 12 years, with responsibility for banking
activities in Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait, the company said.  The construction industry has returned to growth and levels
of activity similar to those before the financial crisis are
likely to be reached by 2014 or 2015, Arabtec said in a separate
investor presentation. The company has a “strong” current
backlog of 22 billion dirhams ($6 billion) with “clear
visibility on future earnings,” it said.  The company, which is also expanding its so-called
affordable housing, power and infrastructure units after Abu
Dhabi-based Aabar Investments increased its direct stake to 21.6
percent, is preparing for growth by raising capital and
enhancing management, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
