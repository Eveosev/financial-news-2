Lawmakers representing English
districts in the British Parliament should be given extra rights
to decide on legislation that only affects  England , according to
a government-appointed commission.  Since 1999, the smaller countries in the U.K.,  Scotland 
Wales and  Northern Ireland , have had their own legislatures,
with varying levels of control over policy, including health and
education. England, which has 53 million of the U.K.’s 63
million people, has no dedicated assembly.  This means that while English members of the U.K.
Parliament can’t vote on Scottish health policy, lawmakers from
Scotland can vote on English matters. In 2012, the government
asked a commission headed by William McKay, a former clerk of
the House of Commons, to investigate and suggest solutions.  In his report, published today, McKay suggested a
convention whereby matters that only affect England should be
decided only with the consent of a majority of English
lawmakers. He presented a range of procedural options to give
English lawmakers an extra voice on such subjects.  “Surveys have shown that people in England are unhappy
about the existing arrangements, and support change,” McKay
said in an e-mailed statement. “There is a feeling that England
is at a disadvantage. The status quo clearly cannot be
sustained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
