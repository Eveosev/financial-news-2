Drug use in Egypt has reached
“disastrous levels” and surpassed the international average,
the state-run Middle East  News Agency  quoted the head of the
Fund for Drug Control and Addiction Treatment as saying.  About 7 percent of the population uses drugs compared with
5 percent internationally, said Amr Othman, the fund’s chief. He
linked the figures to weakness in the role of the family, too
much free time and a desire for experimentation.  Egypt has endured rising violence and crime since the 2011
ouster of  Hosni Mubarak , with security deteriorating after the
police largely withdraw from the streets in the first days of
the uprising. State media report near-daily seizures of drugs
and weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
