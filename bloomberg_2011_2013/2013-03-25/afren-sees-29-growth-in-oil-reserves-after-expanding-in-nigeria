Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil and gas
company focused on West Africa and  Iraq , will expand reserves by
29 percent after increasing its stake in a Nigerian explorer.  Proven and probable reserves will climb to 270 million
barrels of oil equivalent from 210 million barrels, the London-
based company said today in a statement. Afren agreed to pay
about $37 million for 10.4 percent of First Hydrocarbon Nigeria
Co., raising its stake to about 55 percent.  Oil companies are adding reserves to gain from a four-year
increase in prices. Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil-producing
nation, accounted for 92 percent of Afren’s sales in 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The country provides cash to invest
in other regions including East  Africa  and the Middle East.  “We are currently drilling very exciting wells in
Kurdistan, which are going very well,” Chief Executive Officer
Osman Shahenshah said today in an interview. In Africa, the
company is adding a “whole suite” of wells in Kenya, Tanzania
and Madagascar, he said.  Afren advanced as much as 3.2 percent to 152.3 pence in
London trading, the highest in a month. The stock was at 152
pence as of 9:59 a.m. local time, extending its gain this year
to 16 percent.  The company also reported a 66 percent jump in 2012 net
income to $202.5 million. Sales rose to a record $1.5 billion,
according to a separate statement today. Its exploration program
is targeting 650 million barrels of oil and gas resources this
year, and output is forecast at 40,000 to 47,000 barrels a day.  Afren began production at the Barda Rash field in Iraqi
Kurdistan last year. Volumes from the deposit may enable the
company to exceed its output guidance in 2013, Galib Virani, an
associate director at Afren, said in January.  The company’s other producing assets are in Nigeria and
Ivory Coast. Elsewhere in Africa, it completed a seismic study
in the Seychelles this quarter, the first three-dimensional
survey in the archipelago, where the company may hold 2.8
billion barrels in prospective resources, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
