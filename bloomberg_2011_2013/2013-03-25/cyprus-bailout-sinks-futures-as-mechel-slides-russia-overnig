(Corrects bank title in third paragraph.)  RTS Index futures fell and  OAO
Mechel (MTL)  dropped to an almost four-year low in  New York  amid
concern Cyprus’ bailout deal will lead to losses on the $60
billion of Russian loans and deposits in the island nation.  Futures on the RTS stock gauge expiring in June declined
0.2 percent to 140,670 in U.S. hours. American depositary
receipts of  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest maker of steelmaking coal,
dropped 2.7 percent to $5.13, the lowest level since April 7,
2009. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most traded
Russian companies in the U.S. slid 0.7 percent to 97.04.  Cyprus agreed yesterday to shut its second-largest bank and
tax deposits of more than 100,000 euros ($129,000) after
lawmakers rejected an earlier plan. The new bailout is “clearly
worse” for  Russia , Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, reducing
its recommendation on the nation’s equities to neutral. Cyprus
is the biggest recipient of Russian investment abroad because of
a double-tax avoidance treaty.  “Russia has shown the most painful reaction to Cyprus’
problems,” Ivan Manaenko, head of research at Veles Capital
LLC, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “Many companies, many
individuals kept their money in Cyprus, therefore there is
direct impact on the stock market. The market remains nervous as
the outlook is unclear.”  Russian lenders and companies had about $31 billion in
Cypriot banks by the end of 2012, according to a March 18
Moody’s Investors Service report, while another $29 billion has
been given in loans to Cypriot firms with origins in Russia.
Moscow’s benchmark Micex Index posted its steepest decline since
May last week after Cyprus mooted taxing  savings accounts  to
secure a 10-billion euro bailout from the euro area.  ETF Retreats  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 1.1 percent to $27.46
yesterday in New York, the lowest level since Nov. 28. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock
futures , declined 1.7 percent to 21.55.  Mechel’s  preferred shares  led declines on the Micex
yesterday, tumbling 5.7 percent to 91.98 rubles, or $2.97, the
lowest level on record. The Moscow-based company’s  ordinary
shares , which are equal to one ADR, dropped 3.4 percent to
158.10 rubles, or $5.11, the lowest level since April 6, 2009.  ADRs of  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s biggest lender, fell 1.3
percent to $12.70 in New York, the lowest level this year. The
depositary receipts settled at a 0.6 percent discount to the
bank’s Moscow-listed shares, the biggest gap in five days.
Sberbank slipped 0.7 percent to 98.66 rubles, or $3.19, in
Moscow yesterday. Each ADR represents four shares.  While Sberbank’s CIB brokerage has a Cypriot unit, VTB
Group, Russia’s second-biggest lender, is the “most exposed”
to risks in the island nation because its subsidiary manages
about $13.8 billion of assets, according to Moody’s.  Cyprus Levies  Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who leads the
group of 17 euro finance ministers, said imposing losses on
depositors and bondholders must be part of the bailout toolkit
after such measures were taken to avoid default in Cyprus. His
comments, to Reuters and the Financial Times, were confirmed
yesterday by Dijsselbloem’s spokeswoman, Simone Boitelle.  The euro-area group decided that the rescue package for
Cyprus will require levies of as much as 40 percent on bank
deposits of greater than 100,000 euros.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , the world’s largest nickel and
palladium producer, sank 2.9 percent to $16.29 in New York
trading yesterday, the lowest close since Dec. 4. The company’s
Moscow-listed  stock  dropped 2.2 percent to 5,046 rubles, or
$163.11. One ADR represents one-10th of a Micex share.  Abramovich Report  Norilsk declined after RBC TV in Moscow reported that  Roman Abramovich , a Russian billionaire who gained 20 percent
of  voting rights  in the company in December, was being held by
the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  yesterday. Abramovich wasn’t
detained or arrested, an FBI spokeswoman who declined to be
named on agency policy, said by phone.  John Mann , a spokesman
for the billionaire, said the report was “utter rubbish” when
contacted by phone in Moscow.  Ruble futures showed the currency strengthening 0.3 percent
to 31.89 per dollar in U.S. hours. Russia’s ruble declined 0.3
percent to 30.924 per dollar yesterday and gained 0.2 percent to
34.9011 against the dollar-euro basket used by the central bank
to manage swings that erode exporter competitiveness.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 1.2 percent to $94.81 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest settlement price since Feb. 19. Brent oil for May
settlement rallied 0.5 percent to $108.17 a barrel.  Urals crude ,
Russia’s major export oil blend, rose 0.4 percent to $105.97 per
barrel.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 3.4 percent to HK$3.94 in Hong Kong trading as of the
city’s noon trading break. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
