Algeria  signed accords with  Norway 
and Qatar to build fertilizer factories as growing populations
boost food demand, spurring farmers to plant more crops.  Yara International ASA (YAR)  of Norway is investing in a $2
billion ammonia, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and nitrogen
fertilizer factory, according to the state-run Algeria Press
Service. It’s sharing ownership with  Asmidal , part of Algeria’s
state-owned Sonatrach.  Norway is also joining Qatar in constructing a $3.5 billion
ammonium plant in Hadjar Essed, and a phosphoric acid factory in
Oued Koubrite, in the northeast near the border with Tunisia,
APS said. They are also sharing ownership with Algeria.  The Algerian government said last year it was allocating
$14 billion to build three fertilizer factories by 2020, with a
total installed capacity of 35 million tons per year. Foreign
ownership in Algeria is limited to 49-51 percent, under its
investment law.  Algeria’s Hyproc, another Sonatrach unit, agreed to
purchase two LPG tankers from  Qatar , each with 117,000 cubic-
meter capacities and at a total cost of $450 million, according
to the APS report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
