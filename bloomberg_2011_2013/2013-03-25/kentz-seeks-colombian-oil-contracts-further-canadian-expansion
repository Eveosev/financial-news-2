Kentz Corp., an Irish oil and gas
engineering company, plans to expand into Colombia as it seeks
further growth opportunities in  Canada .  “I’d watch the Colombian environment,” Chief Executive
Officer Christian Brown said today on a conference call with
analysts. “We’ve seen more opportunities in Colombia.”  Colombia has raised oil output 80 percent since 2008 as
army victories over guerrillas opened up swathes of countryside
to investment. Kentz said earlier this month it won a contract
from  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  for an oil-sands project in  Alberta ,
Canada, which will run until 2016. Another area of focus is the
Dominican Republic, the CEO said.  Net income climbed to $69.7 million in 2012 from $58.9
million a year earlier, the Tipperary-based company said today
in a statement. The order backlog rose 6.9 percent to $2.57
billion at the end of 2012 and stood at $2.73 billion at the end
of last month, it said.  The results “underline a period of exceptional growth in
revenue and earnings,” according to a note by  Investec Plc (INVP) ,
which has a buy rating on the stock.  Kentz rose 2.7 percent to 426 pence as of 11:55 a.m. in
London trading.  The company increased its full-year dividend by 18 percent
to 14.5 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
