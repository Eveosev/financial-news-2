Steel reinforcement-bar futures
rose, extending the first weekly gain in five, on speculation
demand is strengthening after inventory fell from a record and
Cyprus agreed to the outlines of an international bailout.  The contract for October delivery gained as much as 1
percent to 3,918 yuan ($631) a metric ton on the  Shanghai 
Futures Exchange and was at 3,907 yuan at 10:31 a.m. in Shanghai.
Rebar gained 0.5 percent last week.  China ’s total inventory of rebar  fell  0.8 percent to 10.1
million tons on March 22 from a record 10.2 million tons a week
earlier, according to data by Shanghai Steelhome Information.  “The unexpected fall in inventory gives market some
optimism that demand is picking up,” Dang Man, analyst at Maike
Futures Co., said by phone from Xi’an today.  The accord between Cyprus and the “troika” representing
international lenders was reached in overnight talks in Brussels
and ratified by finance ministers from the 17-nation euro area,
paving the way for 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of emergency
loans and eliminating the threat of default.  The average spot  price  for rebar was little changed at
3,686  yuan  a ton on March 22, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose
0.8 percent to $135.30 a dry ton on the same day, according to
The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
