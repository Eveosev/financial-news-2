(Corrects reference to KSK Power in first paragraph.)  Miasole Inc., the thin-film solar
panel maker owned by China’s Hanergy Holding Group Ltd., said
 KSK Power Ventur Plc (KSK)  has begun operating a project that uses its
equipment adjacent to one of the company’s coal-fired power
plants.  The U.S. Export-Import Bank provided $9 million of debt
financing for the 11.6-megawatt project, which began operating
Feb. 26 in Rajasthan, India, Miasole said today in an e-mailed
statement. It’s adjacent to KSK’s coal-fired power plant and
part of 100 megawatts of solar it expects to install within the
next year, according to the statement.  Miasole, based in  Santa Clara , California, has supplied its
panels to three additional projects completed in India since
2012, and one of those also was funded by an Ex-Im Bank loan,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
