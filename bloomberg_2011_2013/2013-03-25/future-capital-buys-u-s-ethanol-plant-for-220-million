Future Capital Partners Ltd., a U.K. investment company, agreed to buy Appomattox Bio Energy LLC, as it aims to cut costs at a planned bioethanol plant in Britain.  FCP didn’t disclose how much it paid for Appomattox, which it said was worth $220 million. It plans to sell the assets to its investment vehicle Future Fuels Partnership, which is developing a refinery in Grimsby,  England , the London-based investor said today. About three-fourths of the plant and machinery may be shipped from Virginia to the U.K. to build the new plant, according to Jonathan Turney, associate director for renewable energy at FCP.  Britain aims to get 5 percent of transport fuels from renewables including bioethanol by 2014, and 10 percent by 2020 in order to meet European Union targets. That compares with about 3.5 percent in 2011. The EU also requires the U.K. to produce 15 percent of all energy, including for power and heat, from renewables by then.  “This project is essential if the U.K. is serious about meeting its long-term renewable energy targets,” Turney said in a phone interview. “A lot of projects in  Europe  have fallen by the wayside, but the mandated targets remain in place. It’s a significant chunk of the U.K.’s requirement.”  Bioethanol Production  The U.K. capacity for bioethanol production at the end of 2011 was about 475 million liters, according to the latest data available from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The Grimsby plant will produce about 220 million liters of bioethanol and 175,000 tons of high-protein  animal feed  per year when completed, according to the company.  Construction may begin as soon as th end of this year and will probably take about two years, Turney said.  Future Fuels Partnership aims to raise 47 million pounds ($71 million) from investors for the project in Grimsby. It’s already raised a first tranche of 4.5 million pounds, and it’s targeting a second tranche of 16 million pounds by the end of the current tax year next month, Turney said. the minimum investment is 50,000 pounds. The company intends to raise the balance of 26.5 million pounds by year-end.  Acquisition of Appomattox’s new  plant  near Richmond,  Virginia  should cut the cost of building the Grimsby facility bu about 50 million pounds, taking it to 160 million pounds, Turney said. The U.S. facility is “essentially pristine,” having never started commercial production after commissioning, because it didn’t receive the necessary permits, he said.  The balance between the funds raised and the project cost will be made up by bank loans, and possibly by mezzanine finance and selling equity stakes in the plant, Turney said.
