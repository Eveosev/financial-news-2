Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) ’s India
joint venture is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for possible violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.  “We have been informed by the SEC that it is conducting an
investigation into our affiliates in India, including our non-
consolidated Indian joint venture, InBev Indian Int’l Private
Ltd., and whether certain relationships of agents and employees
were compliant with the FCPA,” the company said today in a
regulatory  filing . “We are investigating the conduct in
question and cooperating with the SEC.”  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, declined to comment.  The investigation is at an early stage and no claims have
been asserted by regulators,  Marianne Amssoms , an AB InBev
spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. AB InBev’s market share in
India is about 2 percent, she said. Operations are run by an
Indian subsidiary, Crown Beers India, and a joint venture with
RKJ Group for local production, in which AB InBev holds a
minority stake.  “We have an extensive compliance program which includes
robust policies, training, and an employee hotline,” Amssoms
also wrote. “We do not tolerate any violations and are fully
cooperating with this investigation.”  Beam Inc. (BEAM) , the distiller of  Jim Beam , Maker’s Mark and
Canadian Club liquors, said in October that it was investigating
its operations in India after a report of possible FCPA
violations.  AB InBev rose 0.6 percent to 75.43 euros today in Brussels
trading. The shares have climbed 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
