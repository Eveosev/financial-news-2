Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,  Australia ’s
second-largest lender by market value, said soured loans have
continued to fall for its biggest unit as the bank seeks to cut
costs by simplifying its business.  Westpac expects to decrease the size of its branches by 25
percent and reduce its product range, the lender said in a
strategy update today for its Australian Financial Services
division. The bank expects the Internet and mobile technology to
account for 95 percent of transactions in five years, up from 85
percent now, Brian Hartzer, who heads the unit, said in the
stock exchange filing.  Banks in Australia are simplifying products and trimming
costs to overcome the slowest credit growth since 1977 as
customers focus on savings. Westpac and its main competitors
have cut jobs, frozen pay of top managers and moved roles to
lower-cost countries such as  India  and the  Philippines .  Westpac  shares  dropped 1 percent to A$30.70 as of 10:17
a.m. in Sydney, paring their gain this year to 18 percent. The
benchmark Australian stock index fell 0.6 percent.  Stressed asset exposures at the Australian Financial
Services unit dropped by A$1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) from 2010
to Dec. 31, 2012, according to today’s filing.  The unit includes the company’s retail and business bank,
St George Banking Group and BT Financial Group. The division
contributed A$4 billion in cash profit last year, more than 60
percent of the bank’s earnings, filings show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
