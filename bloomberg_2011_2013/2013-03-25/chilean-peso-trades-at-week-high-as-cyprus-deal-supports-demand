Chile ’s peso traded at a one-week
high after European leaders reached a $13 billion deal to save
Cyprus from a disorderly default that would force it to exit the
euro, spurring demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso advanced less than 0.1 percent to 472.53 per U.S.
dollar at 10:25 a.m. in Santiago, the strongest level on a
closing basis since March 18. Copper, which accounts for more
than half of Chile’s exports, fell 0.1 percent to $3.4610 a
pound in New York.  “There was a little bit of relief from the Cyprus
situation,” said  Alejandro Cuadrado , a Latin America currency
strategist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in Santiago.
“Today’s a stronger start, but the moves are modest.”  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed to shut the
country’s  second-largest bank  after negotiations that threatened
to rekindle the debt crisis and rattle markets. The European
Central Bank had warned it would cut off emergency financing for
the country’s banks as soon as today.  The peso reached the strongest level against the country’s
major trading partners since at least 1992 in the first two
weeks of March, according to the central bank. Investors in
Latin American currencies may reduce positions before the Easter
holiday weekend, Cuadrado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
