The value of water trading in
 Australia  rose 6.7 percent in the year ended June amid above-
average rainfall in the eastern part of the country, according
to the National Water Commission.  The estimated value of the Australian water market
increased to A$1.6 billion ($1.67 billion) in 2011-2012, from
A$1.5 billion a year earlier, the Canberra-based commission said
today in a  statement . Trading in water allocations and
entitlements rose 23 percent and 10 percent respectively.  “In a second consecutive year of well-above average
rainfall in eastern Australia, growth in both the allocation and
entitlement volumes traded has shown that even when it is wet,
irrigators are still seeking to buy and sell water,”
Commissioner Rob Freeman said.  Water trading in Australia continued to be concentrated in
the Murray–Darling Basin, which accounted for 85 percent of
entitlement trade and 98 percent of allocation trade, according
to the commission.  A water access entitlement gives the holder an ongoing
entitlement to exclusively access a share of water, the
commission said on its  website . A water allocation refers to the
specific volume of water assigned to that entitlement in a given
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
