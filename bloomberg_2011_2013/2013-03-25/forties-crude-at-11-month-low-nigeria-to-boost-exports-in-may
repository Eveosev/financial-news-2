North Sea  Forties crude fell to the
lowest in 11 months as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold. BP Plc failed
to sell Russian Urals and Algerian Saharan Blend.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, will boost crude
exports to 71 cargoes in May, according to a partial loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News that includes 16 grades.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties for loading on April 13 to April 15 to
Morgan Stanley at 75 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with a trade
in the previous session at minus 75 cents to the cash cost of
Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk for June and matches the
lowest deal since April 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 28 cents to a discount of 62 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest since April 23.  Brent for May settlement traded at $107.71 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $107.39 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $107.33, a discount of 38 cents to May.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP failed to sell Urals at $2.15 a barrel less than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts survey
showed. Shell also offered the grade unsuccessfully at $2.10
less than the benchmark. Those compare with a Feb. 25 trade at
minus $2.75.  BP offered either 600,000 barrels or 1 million barrels of
Saharan Blend at 80 cents more than Dated Brent to be loaded on
April 4 to April 8 from  Algeria , according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 32 cents to 99 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the smallest differential since Feb. 15.
In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.89 a barrel,
compared with minus $1.97 in the previous session.  Russia plans to ship 1.95 million barrels a day of Urals
from two export terminals on the  Baltic Sea  in April, according
to a preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Primorsk will export 57 cargoes and Ust-Luga plans to ship
23 cargoes, according to the schedule. Cargoes at the ports are
100,000 metric tons each.  Iraq plans to increase exports of its Kirkuk crude in April
from the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 19 cargoes, nine more than
this month, according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News .  Shipments will total 10.81 million barrels, or 360,333
barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with 289,677
barrels planned for March.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 1 cent to $3.19 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 28.  Nigeria will ship 11 consignments of Qua Iboe, nine of
Forcados, eight each of Bonny Light and Agbami, five each of
Akpo, Bonga and Brass River, four of Erha, three each of Amenam,
Escravos and Yoho, two lots of Abo and Okwori, and one each of
EA Blend, Okono and Pennington, the plans showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
