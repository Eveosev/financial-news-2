The Bovespa index fell to an eight-
month low as retailer  Cia. Hering (HGTX3)  led losses by companies linked
to domestic demand after economists covering  Brazil  raised their
forecasts for the benchmark lending rate.  Homebuilders including  PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes (PDGR3)  and  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  also fell
after a central bank survey showed the median forecast for the
year-end Selic rate among about 100 economists rose to 8.50
percent from 8.25 percent.  The Bovespa fell 0.5 percent to 54,985.97 at 12:27 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest since July
26. Forty-six  stocks  advanced on the gauge while 21 retreated.
The real weakened 0.3 percent to 2.0163 per dollar.  “The central bank won’t be able to delay rate increases
much longer, which surely won’t make the environment for the
stock market any better,” Clodoir Vieira, an economist at Sao
Paulo-based brokerage Souza Barros Corretora, said in a phone
interview.  Annualized inflation in the month through mid-March
accelerated for a sixth straight month to 6.43 percent, a report
from the national statistics agency showed last week. The
central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2
percentage points.  Hering lost 2 percent to 36.90 reais. MRV dropped 1.5
percent to 8.57 reais. PDG declined 2.8 percent to 2.77 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
