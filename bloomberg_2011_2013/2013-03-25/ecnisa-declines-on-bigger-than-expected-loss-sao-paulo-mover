Brazilian homebuilder  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3) 
fell to a one-month low after reporting a bigger-than-expected
loss, the sixth consecutive quarter in which earnings have
missed analysts’ estimates.  Shares slid 2.1 percent to 8.32 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Feb. 26. Trading volume
was 3.8 times the three-month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tecnisa had a  net loss  of 180.1 million reais ($89.5
million) in the three months through December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg after the Sao Paulo-based homebuilder
reported earnings late on March 22. That compares with an
average loss estimate of 650,000 reais from four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales were weak and “costs are still reason for concern,”
Wesley  Bernabe (BNBC) , an analyst at  Banco do Brasil SA , wrote in a
note to clients dated today. The 56 percent increase in costs in
the fourth quarter of 2012 from the same period in 2011 was
caused by “advertising expenses to try to boost sales, a trend
that should continue given the low speed of sales,” he wrote.  Revenue declined 16 percent to 309.4 million reais in the
three months through December from the fourth quarter of 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Tecnisa has  risen  3.2 percent this year while the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate index declined 10 percent during that
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
