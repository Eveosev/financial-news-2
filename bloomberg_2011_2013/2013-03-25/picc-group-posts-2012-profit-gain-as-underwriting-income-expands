People’s Insurance Company (Group)
of China Ltd. (1339) , parent of the nation’s biggest non-life insurer,
said profit rose 32 percent last year as underwriting revenue
and investment income expanded.  Net income  climbed to 6.83 billion  yuan  ($1.1 billion), or
0.2 yuan a share, in 2012 from 5.19 billion yuan, or 0.16 yuan a
share, a year earlier, Beijing-based PICC Group said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. The profit
compares with the 7.7 billion yuan mean estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  PICC Group raised HK$24 billion ($3.1 billion) in Hong Kong
in November in the city’s largest initial public offering in two
years, paving the way for Chairman Wu Yan to expand premiums as
the world’s second-biggest economy rebounds. Net income at  PICC
Property & Casualty Co. (2328) , the main profit contributor, climbed 30
percent after the unit’s underwriting profit margin rose to the
highest since its shares first traded in 2003 in the first half
of last year as the company tightened controls on claims and
expenses.  “The level of underwriting profitability can’t be
maintained this year as there’s considerable pressure from
rising costs on the property-insurance side,” said Li Wenbing,
a Beijing-based analyst at Bocom International Holdings.
“Competition in the industry is getting more and more
intense,” he added, citing looser risk selection and pressures
to cut prices to attract clients among insurers.  Underwriting Profit  The combined ratio, used to gauge claims and expenses as a
percentage of premiums earned, rose to 95.1 percent last year,
compared to 94 percent in 2011, according to the statement.  Investment income increased 34 percent to 22 billion yuan,
the company said. The company booked 1.53 billion yuan in fair
value gains on investments, while impairment losses rose to 4.15
billion yuan from 2.59 billion last year.  The  stock  rose 0.2 percent to HK$4.3 yesterday, extending
the rally since its Nov. 30 IPO to 23.6 percent.  Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co. (2318) ,  China ’s second-biggest insurer which
reported a 3 percent profit increase March 14, fell 0.3 percent
to HK$60.25.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
