The U.K. finance regulator will
renew its focus on consumers and continue to investigate market
abuse and other rule breaches, including manipulation of the
London interbank offered rate, as it prepares to split into two
new agencies.  The U.K. Financial Services Authority will be replaced on
April 1 with a consumer-focused watchdog and a prudential
regulator that will be a unit of the  Bank of England . The
consumer agency, the Financial Conduct Authority, will continue
many of the current initiatives of the finance regulator, the
FSA said in a statement today.  The main risks in the industry for the coming year are
firms designing products that aren’t in the long-term interest
of consumers and don’t respond to their needs, a lack of
transparency on what’s being sold, a poor understanding by
consumers of risk, and a shift toward more complex structured
products that lack oversight, according to the statement.  “We are introducing new approaches to the way we do much
of our work, becoming much more proactive and consumer-
focused,” said Martin Wheatley, the chief executive officer-
designate of the FCA. “A risk for all regulators is becoming
bound to conventional thinking. That is why the new regulator
will be much more transparent, so we can learn from our
mistakes. There is no room for the poor behavior of the past.”  The FCA will regulate the conduct of around 26,000 firms
and the prudential standards of as much as 23,000 financial
companies, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
