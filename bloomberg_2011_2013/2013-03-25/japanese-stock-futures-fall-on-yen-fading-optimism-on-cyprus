one-off or something that may be used as a precedent,” said
Prasad Patkar, portfolio manager who helps manage about $1
billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “Equity
markets have had a very strong run, reflecting the improved
economic conditions and earnings, but those gains will need to
be consolidated. Cyprus was the catalyst for that consolidation
to commence.”  Cyprus Bailout  Asian shares rose yesterday as Cyprus, the euro-area’s
third-smallest economy, met the terms for a 10 billion-euro ($13
