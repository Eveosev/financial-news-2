JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , the biggest
solar-cell producer by capacity, fell after reporting a fourth-
quarter loss that exceeded analysts’ estimates on declining
panel prices.  JA Solar’s American depositary receipts dropped 11 percent
to $3.71 at the close in New York, and earlier declined 14
percent, the most intraday since May 18. Each ADR is worth one
ordinary share.  JA Solar’s loss widened to 637.9 million  yuan  ($102.7
million) from 429.6 million yuan a year earlier, the company
said today in a statement. The loss exceeded the 375.9-million-
yuan average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  It was a challenging year, JA Solar’s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Baofang Jin said in the statement, as the
“industry-wide overcapacity continued to put downward
pressure” on prices and margins.  The company shipped 500 megawatts of solar cells and panels
in the quarter, more than its 420 megawatt forecast, on better-
than-expected sales in China and  Japan . Shipments for the year
totaled 1.7 gigawatts.  JA Solar was the largest solar-cell maker by capacity in
2011, the most recent year for which data is available,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
