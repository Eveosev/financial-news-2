Mexico ’s peso advanced as euro area
finance ministers agreed that Cyprus had met the conditions for
a bailout, easing speculation that the island’s banking crisis
would hurt global growth.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 12.3435 per U.S. dollar at
7:34 a.m. in Mexico City, after touching 12.3220 per dollar, the
strongest intraday level since September 2011. The currency has
rallied 4.1 percent this year, the most among the dollar’s 16
major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Cyprus reached a deal with the European Central Bank, the
European Commission and the International Monetary Fund that
sets the framework for a 10 billion-euro bailout for the island
nation,  the euro-area’s third-smallest economy. Mexico’s
economic activity, as measured by the so-called IGAE, probably
rose 2.6 percent in January, according to the median projection
of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a report due today
at 8 a.m. local time.  “The rally was mostly Cyprus,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin
America currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The IGAE could also
matter.”  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.01 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.14 centavo to 144.26
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
