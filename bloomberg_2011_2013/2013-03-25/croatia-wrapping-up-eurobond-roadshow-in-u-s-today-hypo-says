Croatia, the next European Union
member, will complete its roadshow for a new  bond issue  today in
line with a plan to tap the U.S. market this spring, Hypo Alpe-
Adria Bank d.d. in Zagreb said.  With the roadshow for a $1.5 billion, 10-year bond ending,
investors will be watching for any pricing information on the
sale, which may take place the coming days, the bank said in a
note to investors today.  “We still see the issue priced around 5.5 percent to 5.7
percent,” Hypo Alpe-Adria analysts including Hrvoje Stojic
wrote in the note.  Croatia wants to borrow in dollars for the second time in
less than a year as optimism about the global economic recovery
and extra liquidity from central banks push investors to higher-
yielding assets. In February it picked Deutsche Bank AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to manage the sale.  Government officials were not immediately available to
comment on the state of the road show, which started in the U.S.
on March 18.  Moody’s Investors Service cut the ex-Yugoslav republic’s
bond rating to Ba1 from Baa3 on Feb. 1, citing a stalled
recovery, lack of budget discipline and vulnerability to
external shocks. Standard & Poor’s cut  Croatia  to junk in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
