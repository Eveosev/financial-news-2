Canadian  stocks  fell to the lowest
level in about a month, as raw-material and energy producers
declined after enthusiasm for Cyprus’s bailout deal waned.  Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI)  and Goldcorp Inc. lost at least 1.9
percent as gold slumped to a one-week low.  AltaGas (ALA)  Ltd. slid 3.2
percent after agreeing to buy power generator Blythe Energy LLC
for $515 million. Agrium Inc. and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
Inc. retreated at least 0.8 percent after an analyst cut his
rating for the fertilizer sector.  BlackBerry (BB)  dropped 4.5 percent
to extend losses a third day as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered
its rating on the stock.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 76.64
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,680.71 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
lowest level since Feb. 26. The S&P/TSX is up 2 percent for the
year. Trading volume was in line with the 30-day average.  “The trading is all fallout from Cyprus,” Arthur Salzer,
chief executive officer with Northland Wealth Management, said
from Toronto. His firm oversees C$225 million ($220 million).
“Investors with a short to mid-term outlook are throwing in the
towel.”  Stocks opened higher, with the S&P/TSX index rising as much
as 0.2 percent, and then erased gains as investors weighed
whether the Cypriot bailout terms will be applied to other euro-
area nations that need to recapitalize financial institutions in
the future.  Cyprus, the euro-area’s third-smallest economy, agreed to
shrink its banking system by shuttering its second-largest
lender in return for a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout.
Under the deal, senior Cypriot bank bond holders will take
losses and uninsured depositors will be largely wiped out.  Gold Falls  Raw-materials producers  contributed  most to the S&P/TSX
decline, falling 1.5 percent as a group. All 10 industries in
the benchmark equity index retreated.  Gold dropped 0.1 percent to settle at $1,606.50. The metal
slipped as much as 1.1 percent earlier. Yamana lost 3.3 percent
to C$15.47 and Goldcorp declined 1.9 percent to C$33.67.  Agrium fell 1.5 percent to C$101.36 after Adam Samuelson,
analyst with Goldman Sachs, lowered his rating for the
fertilizer industry to neutral from attractive. Potash Corp.,
the world’s largest fertilizer maker, slid 0.8 percent to
C$40.10.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  dropped 3.5 percent to C$19.41,
as copper futures for May delivery fell 0.6 percent to $3.445 a
pound in  New York . Stockpiles of copper in warehouses monitored
by the London Metal Exchange expanded to the highest level since
October 2003, LME data today showed.  AltaGas Acquisition  AltaGas slipped 3.2 percent to C$34.90 after saying it
would issue C$352 million in stock to help pay for the
acquisition of Blythe Energy, which owns a 507 megawatt natural
gas-fired plant in  California .  Pengrowth Energy Corp., the oil and gas producer, lost 3.4
percent to C$5.20. Cenovus Energy Inc. dropped 1.7 percent to
C$31.40. Crude for May delivery advanced to a one-month high,
adding 1.2 percent to settle at $94.81 a barrel.  BlackBerry fell 4.5 percent to C$14.51 after  Simona Jankowski , analyst with Goldman Sachs, lowered her rating for
the stock to neutral from buy following the U.S. debut of the
smartphone maker’s new Z10 device last week.  “Our retail checks at over 20 store locations since March
22, including AT&T, Best Buy and Radio Shack, revealed a
surprising lack of marketing support and poor positioning,”
Jankowski said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
