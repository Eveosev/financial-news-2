The  yuan  strengthened beyond 6.21
per dollar for the first time in 19 years after the central bank
raised the currency’s reference rate and as a bailout deal for
Cyprus spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The People’s Bank of  China  increased the daily  fixing  by
0.03 percent to 6.2692 per dollar today, the strongest level
since Jan. 15. The currencies of Asia’s developing economies
appreciated today as euro-area finance ministers approved a
bailout for Cyprus. China will maintain a “reasonable” level
of investment as it targets a pickup in domestic demand, the
China Securities Journal reported today, citing National
Development and Reform Commission Vice Chairman Zhu Zhixin.  “A stronger exchange rate could help China tame
inflationary pressures and boost domestic consumption by
lowering prices of imports,” said Daniel Chan, a Hong Kong-
based executive vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd.
“The yuan is also hailed as a stable currency and hence has
attracted some fund flows in times of uncertainty.”  The yuan gained 0.02 percent to close at 6.2107 per dollar
in  Shanghai , prices from China Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. It touched 6.2095 earlier, the strongest level since the
government unified official and market exchange rates at the end
of 1993. The currency traded at a 0.95 percent premium to the
reference rate, near the 1 percent limit allowed by the central
bank.  BRICS Summit  The stronger yuan may be an indication that China wants to
show its fellow BRICS nations that it is making efforts to
balance external positions, Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based
Credit Agricole CIB strategist, wrote in a note today. Leaders
of  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India , China and South Africa will meet
tomorrow for the fifth annual BRICS summit in Durban, South
Africa. Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, who arrived in  Tanzania 
yesterday, will attend the two-day meeting.  Chinese banks bought $121.2 billion of foreign currency
from their clients and sold $89 billion in February, leaving a
surplus of $32.2 billion, the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said today.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency was
steady at 6.2040 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.04 percent to
6.3014, trading at a 1.4 percent discount to the spot rate in
Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
