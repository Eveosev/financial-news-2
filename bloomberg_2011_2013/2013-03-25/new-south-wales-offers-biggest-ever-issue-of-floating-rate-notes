New South  Wales  is offering at
least A$1 billion ($1 billion) of floating-rate notes, its
largest issue of such debt, spurred by demand from banks seeking
to increase their holdings of liquid assets.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  and  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
are managing the sale of securities maturing April 8, 2016,
according to a statement from New South Wales Treasury Corp.,
the funding arm of  Australia ’s most populous state. The
securities are being marketed at 6 to 10 basis points above swap
rates, said a person familiar with the matter, asking not to be
named as the terms aren’t set.  “This is the first time we have done such a large
floating-rate note,” said Tim Hext, head of funding at Sydney-
based TCorp. “We expect to see this market develop on strong
demand from mostly domestic banks for this sort of product.”  Australian banks boosted their holdings of state government
bonds to a record last year to help meet new rules on assets
aimed at making lenders more resilient against financial crises.
Banks held A$70.7 billion of so-called semi-government notes as
of Sept. 30, or 34.7 percent of the debt outstanding, according
to data published by the Bureau of Statistics on Dec. 20.  South Australia  raised A$2 billion last month selling
floating-rate notes that mature in May 2016. Those securities
pay 20 basis points above the quarterly bank bill swap rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
