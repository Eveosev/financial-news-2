Sanofi (SAN) ,  France ’s biggest drugmaker,
is seeking more deals with venture-capital funds like its
partnership with biotechnology company Warp Drive Bio, Chief
Executive Officer  Chris Viehbacher  said.  Sanofi teamed with venture-capital firms Third Rock
Ventures and  Greylock Partners  last year to finance  Warp Drive
Bio , which is using genomic technology to develop new
treatments. The Paris-based drugmaker has recruited someone to
look at venture-capital projects, though Viehbacher declined to
identify the person.  “The Warp Drive model where we are doing in-kind
contributions for equity, where our researchers are directly
involved in the project, that’s to me more where we want to
go,” Viehbacher said in an interview in Lyon, France. “I don’t
want to have a portfolio of assets over here and then research
and development projects over there.”  Sanofi is also interested in partnerships that involve
using mobile technology to keep patients connected with health-
care providers. The drugmaker is working with another company on
implantable blood-sugar meters for diabetics, though he declined
to identify the company.  “The marrying of digital technologies with therapeutics is
a whole interesting area,” Viehbacher said. “You have to have
space within a company where you can contemplate some of these
things. You have to go beyond the pill.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
