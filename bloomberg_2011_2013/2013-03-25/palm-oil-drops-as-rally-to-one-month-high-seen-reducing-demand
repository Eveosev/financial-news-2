     March 25 (Bloomberg) -- Palm oil  fell for the first time in
five days on concern that a rally to a one-month high may reduce
exports from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in June dropped as much as 1.2
percent to 2,463 ringgit ($797) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,470
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures gained 3.3 percent last week,
closing at 2,493 ringgit, the highest price since Feb. 22.  Exports from Malaysia fell 7.5 percent to 1.07 million tons
in the first 25 days of this month from the same period in
February, surveyor Intertek said today. Shipments had been 11
percent higher during the first 20 days of the month, according
to the surveyor. Inventories in Malaysia were 2.44 million tons
in February after reaching a record 2.63 million tons in
December, according to the nation’s palm oil board.  “The exports we had seen in the last few weeks may not be
sustained as with the current tax exporters don’t have much of
an incentive,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte., said by phone from  Singapore . “Higher prices will also
weaken demand.”  Malaysia retained a tax on crude palm oil shipments at 4.5
percent for a second month in April. Indonesia, the biggest
producer, may keep the levy on exports unchanged at 10.5 percent
in April, according to the nation’s palm oil association.  Soybean oil  for May delivery dropped 0.2 percent to 50.32
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May fell 0.3 percent to $14.3575 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.4 percent
to 6,412 yuan ($1,032) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.3 percent to
8,102  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
