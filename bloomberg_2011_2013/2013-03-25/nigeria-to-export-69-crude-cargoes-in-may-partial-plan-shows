Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, will boost crude exports to 69 cargoes in May,
according to a partial loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News  that includes 15 grades.  The nation will ship 11 consignments of Qua Iboe, nine of
Forcados, eight each of Bonny Light and Agbami, five each of
Akpo, Bonga and Brass River, four of Erha, three each of Amenam,
Escravos and Yoho, two lots of Abo, and one each of EA Blend,
Okono and Pennington, the plans showed.  That compares with the 66 shipments due to be exported next
month, a revised schedule showed. Three Bonny Light cargoes, two
lots of Brass River and one Okono consignment have been deferred
from April to load in May.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  lifted a two-week force majeure on
Bonny Light exports on March 19. The country has been hit by
rising oil theft and the Nembe Creek Trunkline will close in
April to clear points along the link that are vulnerable to
thieves, according to Shell.  The May programs for Antan, Okwori and Usan weren’t
available. They totaled eight cargoes in April.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
