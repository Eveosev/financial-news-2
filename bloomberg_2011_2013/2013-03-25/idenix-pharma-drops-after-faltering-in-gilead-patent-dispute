Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (IDIX) , a
maker of drugs for viral diseases, fell the most in six months
after losing a decision over whether it or  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) 
was first to request a patent related to hepatitis C treatments.  Idenix fell 10 percent to $4.13 at 10:35 a.m.  New York 
time, after falling as much as 15 percent in the largest
intraday decrease since Sept. 19. The U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office determined that Idenix’s application for compounds used
to treat hepatitis C was filed later than Gilead’s, Idenix said
in a statement on March 22.  The patent office’s determination makes Foster City,
California-based Gilead the “senior party” in the case and
Idenix, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , the “junior party,”
Idenix said. The agency will next determine which company was
the first to invent.  Idenix said it doesn’t believe the application at issue is
relevant to any of its compounds under development. Idenix plans
to begin the second of three phases of clinical trials on one of
its hepatitis C therapies, IDX719, in the first half of this
year.  Idenix fell 55 percent in the 12 months through last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
