U.S. National Security Adviser
Thomas Donilon will visit Moscow next month to discuss issues
including missile defenses, said  Yuri Ushakov , President
 Vladimir Putin ’s foreign-policy aide.  Donilon will meet his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, and Ushakov on April 15 and has also asked for a
meeting with Putin, the Kremlin adviser told reporters today in
Moscow.  “We still have concerns and we need to discuss the
details,” Ushakov said of the Obama administration’s decision
to slow work on missile defenses in eastern Europe by deploying
resources elsewhere.  U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on March 15 that
the Pentagon will add 14 land-based missile interceptors in
Alaska in response to threats from  North Korea . To pay for that
move and develop an advanced warhead, he said about $1 billion
would be shifted from efforts to develop a missile shield in
Poland and  Romania .  In response, Russia called on the U.S. on March 18 to issue
“reliable, legally binding” guarantees that it isn’t targeted
by plans to expand missile defenses. That reaction dashed the
hopes of arms-control advocates that the decision to scale back
the missile-defense plans could pave the way to improved U.S.-
Russian relations and revive talks on reducing both countries’
nuclear arsenals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
