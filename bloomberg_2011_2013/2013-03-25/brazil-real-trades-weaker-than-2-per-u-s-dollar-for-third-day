Brazil ’s real traded weaker than 2
per dollar for a third day on speculation the central bank won’t
intervene to strengthen the currency after analysts lowered
their forecasts for economic growth.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0117 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:02 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the weakest level on a
closing basis since Jan. 25. Swap rates on the contract due in
January 2014 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 7.78 percent.  “The government seems to think that a dollar around 2 is
positive for the economy without harming inflation,” Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimento SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  The real weakened to 2 per dollar on March 21 on
speculation government intervention in  Latin America ’s largest
economy to spur flagging growth is prompting investors to
withdraw money from the country.  The currency last crossed that level in January, when the
central bank stepped in to strengthen the currency as inflation
accelerated. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said last
week in  Sao Paulo  that policy makers were ready to intervene to
avoid excessive volatility.  Gross domestic product will expand 3 percent this year,
according to the median forecast of about 100 analysts in a
central bank survey published today. That is down from a
previous projection of 3.03 percent. The economy grew 0.9
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
