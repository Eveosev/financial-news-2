Gasoline advanced along with crude
oil as Cyprus met conditions to obtain a bailout, reducing
concerns that  Europe ’s debt crisis would worsen. May crack
spreads widened for the first time in three days.  Futures rose 1.6 percent and West Texas Intermediate crude
touched the highest level since Feb. 20. Cyprus reached an
agreement with creditors on an international bailout, avoiding a
default and exit from the euro. May gasoline’s premium over WTI
grew 18 cents to $34.62 a barrel, and the spread versus Brent
increased 71 cents to $21.20.  “This just removes some of the fear there would be a
default in Europe,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for April delivery rose 4.85 cents to $3.111 a
gallon at 10:09 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Trading volume was 30 percent below the 100-day average for the
time of day.  Crude oil for May delivery on the Nymex advanced $1.92, or
2.1 percent, to $95.63 a barrel.  Cyprus, the euro area’s third-smallest economy, is the
fifth country to tap international aid since the region’s debt
crisis broke out in Greece in 2009.  “The market is relieved that a solution was found to the
Cyprus crisis,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for April delivery gained 4.01 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.9244 a gallon on volume that was 33 percent below
than the 100-day average.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
$3.667 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are the
lowest since Feb. 14 and are 22.7 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
