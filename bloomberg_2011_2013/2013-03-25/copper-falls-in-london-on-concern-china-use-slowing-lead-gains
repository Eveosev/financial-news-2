Copper fell the most in four
sessions in  New York , on speculation that metals demand will
slow as  China ’s government will take steps to tame inflation and
global growth weakens.  China’s swap market is signaling interest-rate increases
for the first time since 2011, after inflation accelerated to a
10-month high and the government measures failed to slow the
rise in housing prices.  Hedge funds  are making the biggest bet
against copper on record, U.S. government figures showed last
week.  “China’s growth story remains intact, but there are
serious concerns about the short-term outlook given the property
bubble and the ratcheting up of the government response,”
 Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone in New York, said in a
report. “The global outlook remains patchy at best.”  Copper futures for May delivery retreated 0.6 percent to
$3.445 a pound at 1:19 p.m. on Comex in New York. The metal
dropped 1.5 percent last week, the biggest loss in a month.  Supplies that are outstripping demand are also weighing on
prices, Meir said.  Stockpiles of copper in warehouses monitored by the London
Metal Exchange expanded 0.5 percent to 565,350 metric tons, the
highest since October 2003, LME data today showed. Inventories
have jumped 77 percent this year.  Speculators raised net-short positions in U.S. copper
futures and options by 53 percent to 25,719 contracts in the
week ended March 19, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. That’s the lowest since the data began in 2006.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.5
percent to $7,620 a ton ($3.46 a pound).  Nickel, zinc, aluminum and lead also were lower in  London ,
while tin advanced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
