International Petroleum Investment
Co. plans to approach banks this year to finance an  oil refinery 
at the United Arab Emirates’ largest port outside the  Strait of
Hormuz , a person with knowledge of the plans said.  The Abu Dhabi-owned fund, known as IPIC, appointed  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  as financial adviser for the project, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public. The person didn’t say when the company would raise
funds or how much it would seek. HSBC declined to comment, and
IPIC didn’t have an immediate comment when contacted by
telephone today.  Oil producers in the  Persian Gulf  are expanding refining
capacity to meet domestic demand for fuel. IPIC plans to build
the refinery at the port of Fujairah in the U.A.E. sheikhdom of
the same name. Fujairah is the only of the U.A.E.’s seven
emirates with a coastline fully outside Hormuz, the oil-shipping
chokepoint at the mouth of the Gulf.  The 250,000 barrel-a-day refinery project may cost $4
billion to $5 billion, Khadem al-Qubaisi, the company’s managing
director, said in July. MEED magazine reported IPIC had awarded
the mandate to HSBC on March 14.  IPIC said in November it was considering funding options
including non-recourse  project financing  for its Fujairah plant
and another facility planned at Duqm in neighboring Oman.
Together with state-owned Oman Oil Co., its partner in the Duqm
refinery, the company may seek bank advisers for that project
later this year, said the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
