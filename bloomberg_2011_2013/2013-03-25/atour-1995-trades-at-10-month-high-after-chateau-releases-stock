The 1995 vintage of Bordeaux
first-growth  Chateau Latour  sold at a 10-month high of 4,100
pounds ($6,190) a case on London’s Liv-ex wine market in the
past week, according to Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The sale on March 19 was 11 percent above a 23-month low
of 3,700 pounds reached in March last year, although below the
$7,170 a case paid at a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. auction in
Chicago on Feb. 2., according to Liv-ex and Hart’s online
auction results. Chateau Latour this month announced its first
annual release of wines held in its stocks, a system it intends
to use instead of selling through the Bordeaux futures market,
according to Decanter magazine’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
