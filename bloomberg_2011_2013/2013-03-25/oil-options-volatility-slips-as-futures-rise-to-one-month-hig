Crude options volatility fell as
oil futures jumped to a one-month high, breaking above $95 a
barrel in intraday trading for the first time since Feb. 20.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 17.17 percent on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 3:21 p.m., down from 17.47 percent on March 22.  West Texas Intermediate oil for May delivery advanced $1.10
to $94.81 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement since
Feb. 19.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $85 calls, which fell 5 cents to 6 cents a barrel on volume
of 6,575 contracts at 4:11 p.m. May $90 puts were the second-
most active, with 3,871 lots traded. They declined 21 cents to
37 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 66 percent of electronic trading volume.
Trading volume was almost equally divided between puts and calls
in the prior session.  May $95 calls were the most active options traded in the
March 22 session, with 4,318 contracts changing hands. They rose
38 cents to $1.16 a barrel. May $90 puts were down 37 cents to
58 cents a barrel on 2,768 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,505 contracts. Next were June $90 puts at 31,996 and December
$110 calls at 30,633.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
