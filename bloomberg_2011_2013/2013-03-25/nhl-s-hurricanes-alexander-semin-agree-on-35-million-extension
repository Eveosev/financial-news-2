Alexander Semin , the Carolina
Hurricanes’ second-leading scorer, has agreed to terms on a
five-year, $35 million contract extension.  Semin, 29, has eight goals and a team-leading 22 assists in
his first season with Carolina after signing as a free agent on
July 26. He spent his first seven National Hockey League seasons
with the  Washington Capitals .  “Alex is an elite player and has been a major contributor
to the Hurricanes having a very strong top line,” Carolina
General Manager Jim Rutherford said yesterday in a  statement .  Semin, whose 30 points are second on the team to Eric Staal’s 35, is now under contract through the 2017-18 season. A
first-round pick in the 2002 draft, Semin has totaled 205 goals
and 233 assists in 499 career NHL games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
