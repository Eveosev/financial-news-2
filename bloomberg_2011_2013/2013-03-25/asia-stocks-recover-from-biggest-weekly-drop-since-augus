Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark gauge recovering from its biggest weekly drop
in seven months, after Cyprus agreed to an international bailout
and profit at  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  topped forecasts.  Sony Corp. gained 3.1 percent as the yen weakened, boosting
the outlook at  Japan ’s No. 1 consumer-electronics exporter.
Sinopec, as Asia’s biggest refiner is known, rose 2.7 percent
after net income beat analyst estimates.  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) 
surged 4.3 percent as Australia’s largest construction company
appointed Bob Humphris chairman after his predecessor resigned
in a dispute with shareholder Hochtief AG over board
independence.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 0.9 percent to 135.45
as of 7:20 p.m. in Tokyo. All 10  industry groups  climbed.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent. The
provisional deal makes Cyprus the fifth country to tap a rescue
since the euro debt crisis broke out in  Greece  in 2009.  “Markets are beginning to assume that with these mini
crises coming out of Europe, a resolution is always found,”
 Stephen Halmarick , the Sydney-based head of investment markets
research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which
oversees about $150 billion, said by phone. “That’s good
news.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.7 percent, with
the measure close to the highest level since September 2008.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 0.5 percent, while South
Korea’s Kospi Index gained 1.5 percent. Trading volumes in Japan
and Australia were more than 25 percent below the 30-day average
for the time of day.  Lagging Performance  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.6 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite was little changed. About three shares rose
for each that declined on Hong Kong’s benchmark gauge, which was
the developed world’s worst-performing primary measure this year
through March 22.  The accord between Cyprus and the “troika” representing
international lenders was reached in overnight talks in Brussels
and ratified by finance ministers from the 17-nation euro area.
The deal paves the way for 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of
emergency loans and moves Cyprus toward eliminating the threat
of default and lessens the chance of a disorderly exit from the
shared currency.  Sony gained 3.1 percent to 1,712 yen, while  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  advanced 0.8 percent to 4,920 yen. The yen fell 0.3
percent to 94.74 against the dollar and dropped 0.7 percent
against the euro.  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will
appear in parliament tomorrow to speak about monetary policy. He
said last week at his inaugural press conference as the central
bank chief that he’ll do whatever it takes to achieve a 2
percent inflation target.  Cyprus Concern  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index last week posted its biggest
decline since the period ended Aug. 31, amid concern that an
unprecedented levy on  bank deposits  in Cyprus may be a sign of
deepening crisis in Europe. The  gauge rallied  12 percent through
March 22 from mid-November as improving economic data from the
U.S. and speculation that Japan will deploy more stimulus
countered concern China will move to cool its  property market .  Asia’s benchmark trades at 15 times average  estimated
earnings , compared with 14.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The uncertainty is out of the way,”  Binay Chandgothia ,
Hong Kong-based fund manager at Principal Global Investors,
which oversees more than $280 billion, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “Stick to equities. We’re looking to
add” to an overweight position on Asian shares, he said.  China Earnings  Sinopec climbed 2.7 percent to HK$8.99 as the energy
company reported net income of 63.9 billion  yuan  ($10.3
billion), more than the 61.8 billion yuan mean of 26 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  China Construction Bank Corp., the world’s second-largest
lender by market value, increased 2.3 percent to HK$6.31 after
fourth-quarter profit surpassed expectations on loan growth.  Emerging market stocks are posting their worst first
quarter since 2008 and are lagging shares of developed economies
by the most in 15 years. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  trades
for 10 times analysts’ 12-month profit estimates, against 13
times for the MSCI World Index, the widest gap since November
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Leighton advanced 4.3 percent to A$21.07 after the
appointment of Humphris, the former managing director of  Peabody
Energy Corp. (BTU) ’s local unit and a director of Australian
Infrastructure Fund Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
