The pound rose to a six-week high
against the euro amid concern political wrangling over a 10
billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout of Cyprus has undermined
faith in Europe’s financial system.  Sterling extended two weeks of gain versus the common
currency as Reuters reported Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as saying the Cypriot rescue plan, which included
losses for some bondholders and depositors, may become a
template for euro-area bank bailouts. The pound was also
supported as an U.K. industry report showed house prices rose
this month. Gilts advanced, pushing 10-year yields to the lowest
level this year.  “This is a negative euro effect,” said Jane Foley, a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “People were already beginning to wonder if there was
enough bad news priced in sterling. That speculation was already
out there and then we’ve had this news from Cyprus.”  The pound appreciated 0.6 percent to 84.77 pence per euro
at 4:47 p.m. London time after reaching 84.71 pence, the
strongest level since Feb. 11. The U.K. currency weakened 0.3
percent to $1.5180.  Cyprus avoided a disorderly default by bowing to demands
from creditors to shrink its banking system in exchange for the
bailout. President Nicos Anastasiades agreed to shut the
country’s second-largest bank under pressure from a German-led
bloc of creditors in night-time negotiations.  The accord spares bank accounts below the insured limit of
100,000 euros, while imposing losses that two European Union
officials said would be no more than 40 percent on uninsured
depositors at Bank of Cyprus Plc, the island’s largest bank.  Leaving Euro  Cypriot lawmaker Nicholas Papadopoulos, chairman of the
parliamentary finance committee, said the nation must explore
the benefits of exiting the euro area, speaking in an interview
with Bloomberg News in Nicosia.  Average house values in England and Wales increased 0.3
percent in March, the biggest advance since March 2010, property
researcher Hometrack Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement. London
home prices jumped 0.7 percent, the most since February 2010.  Sterling appreciated 0.8 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro weakened 1 percent and
the dollar climbed 0.7 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  gilt  declined four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.82 percent after dropping
to 1.81 percent, the lowest level since Dec. 31. The 1.75
percent bond maturing in September 2022 gained 0.31, or 3.10
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.425.  Gilts returned 1.2 percent this month through March 22,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
0.5 percent, while Treasuries fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
