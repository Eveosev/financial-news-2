Central African countries agreed to
mobilize as many as 1,000 soldiers and law-enforcement officials
to combat a group of 300 elephant poachers from  Sudan , the World
Wildlife Fund said.  The deployment was agreed by the Economic Community of West
African States at a meeting in Yaounde, Cameroon, between March
21 and 23, the WWF said in an e-mailed statement today. It comes
after horsemen slaughtered 89 elephants in  Chad  on the night of
March 14 and 15 in the worst poaching incident in the region
since February last year, when 300 elephants were killed.  The emergency plan will cost about 1.8 million euros ($2.3
million), the WWF said.  Elephants throughout  Africa  are under threat from poachers
who harvest the animalsâ€™ ivory for sale to buyers in countries
including China and Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
