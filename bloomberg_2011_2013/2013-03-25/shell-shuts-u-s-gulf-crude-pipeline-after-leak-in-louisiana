Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  shut a
170,000-barrel-a-day pipeline that moves  Gulf of Mexico  crude to
Houma,  Louisiana , after the pipe leaked in Terrebonne Bay.  Shell shut the 16-inch (41-centimeter) pipeline, which
starts on Caillou Island, at about 5 p.m. March 23 after a light
oil sheen was observed near a pump station, Kim Windon, a
Houston-based spokeswoman for Shell, said in an e-mail. Less
than a gallon of crude was released based in initial
information, she said.  Shell plans to inspect and repair the pipeline as soon as
possible, weather permitting, and is investigating the cause of
the leak, Windon said.  The Caillou-to-Houma pipeline connects with a 20-inch
pipeline that brings crude from producers in Eugene Island, Ship
Shoal, Green Canyon and other Gulf formations to Caillou Island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
