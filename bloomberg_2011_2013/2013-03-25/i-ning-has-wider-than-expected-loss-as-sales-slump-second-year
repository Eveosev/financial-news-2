Li Ning Co. (2331) , the largest China-
based sportswear company by revenue, posted its first annual
deficit since listing in 2004, as slowing economic growth caused
sales to fall a second year. The shares fell.  The  net loss  was 1.98 billion  yuan  ($319 million) last
year, compared with a profit of 385.8 million yuan in 2011, Li
Ning said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
That compares with the 1.4 billion yuan average loss of 10
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The manufacturer and retailer said it hired executives from
rival  Nike Inc. (NKE) ,  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and Procter & Gamble Co. to help
transition to a more “retail oriented” business model from
wholesale, after saying on Jan. 25 it would raise as much as
HK$1.87 billion ($241 million) in a sale of convertible
securities to fund the effort. Slowing economic growth follows a
surge of store openings for Li Ning, Nike and  Adidas AG (ADS) , leading
the Chinese retailer to trim inventory after sales fell.  “Competition and inventory pose near-term challenges for
the industry,” Executive Chairman Li Ning told reporters today
in Hong Kong. The company will introduce new basketball products
and focus on the sport to help revive profit, he said.  Li Ning fell 4.1 percent, its biggest decline since Feb. 5,
to HK$4.46 as of the close in Hong Kong trading. The shares have
slumped 12 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent drop
in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Sales Slump  Sales at the Beijing-based sportswear maker plummeted 25
percent to 6.74 billion yuan last year, it said.  Li Ning, which posted an 85 percent drop in profit in the
first half of the year, had warned of a “substantial” loss in
2012 in a exchange filing on Dec. 17. The company founded by the
Olympic gold medalist of the same name, announced plans last
December to revive growth, while competitors including Nike have
pared inventories and closed some stores.  Nike is the largest sportswear company in  China  with a 12
percent market share, according to data from Euromonitor
International. Adidas has an 11 percent share, while  Anta Sports
Products Ltd. (2020)  controls 5.8 percent and Li Ning 5.4 percent.  Li Ning has said it plans to spend on marketing, clear old
inventory and take steps toward “improving product freshness.”
The efforts, which will include buying back inventory, will cost
between 1.4 billion yuan and 1.8 billion yuan, the retailer said
in December.  Gymnast Li Ning was the final torchbearer at the opening
ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He won three gold,
two silver and one bronze medals in the 23rd Los Angeles Olympic
Games in 1984, and founded the company after retiring from
athletics, according to the retailer’s annual report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
