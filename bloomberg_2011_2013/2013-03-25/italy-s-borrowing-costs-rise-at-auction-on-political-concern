Italy sold 2.8 billion euros ($3.6
billion) of zero-coupon bonds today as rates rose to the highest
since December amid concerns the country will fail to form a
government after last month’s inconclusive elections.  The Treasury in  Rome  sold the 2014 zero-coupon bond at
1.746%, the highest since Dec. 27 and up from 1.682 percent at
the previous auction of similar maturity debt Feb. 25. The
Treasury also sold a total of 1 billion euros of inflation-
linked bonds due in 2018 and 2023 to yield 2.16 percent and 3.02
percent respectively.  At today’s auction investors bid for 1.43 times the amount
of the 2014 debt offered, down from 1.65 times last month.
Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped 6 basis points to 4.46
percent after the sale at 11:20 a.m. in Rome.  To contact the reporter on this story:
