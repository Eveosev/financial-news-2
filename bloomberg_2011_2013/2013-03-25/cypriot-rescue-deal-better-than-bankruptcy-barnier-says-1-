The 10 billion-euro ($13 billion)
rescue deal provided to Cyprus by the European Union is “better
than bankruptcy,” the bloc’s finance chief said.  The rescue, which allows the island nation to escape a
disorderly default and unprecedented exit from the common
currency by shrinking its banking system, saves people from
losing everything, Michel Barnier said today in Brussels.  The situation in Cyprus is “exceptional” and “something
that exists nowhere else,” Barnier said, when discussing the
capital controls keeping savers from withdrawing their deposits
and forcing losses on accounts with more than 100,000 euros. He
said the capital controls can only last a few days. EU laws
don’t set out a maximum duration for how such controls can stay
in place.  “It is for the Cypriots to tell us” how long capital
controls, which can only be enacted “exceptionally,” will
last, Barnier said. “It must be temporary. I can’t say how many
days.”  He said discussions with Cypriot authorities on capital
controls are continuing and conceded the EU probably should have
been more vigilant earlier on regarding the out-sized Cypriot
banking system.  Barnier blamed the banking crisis on “arbitrage,” adding
Cyprus must move away from a “short-term” financial culture.  Had the European Central Bank already taken on its role as
banking supervisor in the EU, it wouldn’t have allowed Cypriot
banks to “do what they have been doing for some time now.”
Barnier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
