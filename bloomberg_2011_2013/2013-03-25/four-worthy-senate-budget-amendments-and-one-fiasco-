In a wonders-never-cease development, the U.S. Senate, just before 5 a.m. Saturday, adopted a federal budget -- its first in four years. It would raise taxes by $975 billion over 10 years, add $100 billion to the public-works purse, make minor and mostly unspecified changes to entitlement programs and withdraw $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts. It would leave the U.S. with a $566 billion deficit -- 2.2 percent of gross domestic product -- in 2023. The contrasts with the House-passed blueprint are sharp. Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican most responsible for the House plan, would balance the budget in 10 years without raising taxes, retain the $1 trillion in domestic spending cuts from sequestration, cut most domestic programs still more, convert Medicare to a voucher-like program and overhaul the tax code. Don't look for the chambers' respective leaders to convene a conference committee to make the budgets mesh -- they are hopelessly incompatible -- like in the good old days (pre-2008).  In other words, none of the policies embedded in these budgets is binding. Still, the Senate lays down some worthy legislative goals among the dozens of amendments it adopted, out of about 500 offered on the floor. I cherry-picked four worth mentioning (and one worth a Bronx cheer): Now for the fiasco. The Senate voted 79-20 to repeal a 2.3 percent  sales tax on medical devices , caving in to a sophisticated industry lobbying campaign that relies on falsehoods and exaggerations. The tax, in effect as of Jan. 1, is meant to raise about $30 billion in 10 years to help pay for Obama's health reforms.   The rationale for the tax is that health reform will result in millions of previously uninsured people buying medical devices, getting tests and using hospital equipment, which means fatter profits for the industry. The device industry argues that the tax will push jobs overseas as manufacturers try to get around the levy. The tax, however, covers all devices sold in the U.S., no matter where they are made. Devices sold outside the U.S. aren't taxed. The tax, then, creates exactly zero incentive to move jobs offshore. The medical-device industry also claims that the tax raises prices and thus crimps sales by as much as $6.7 billion. But as any health-care economist will tell you, the medical market doesn’t behave like most other markets. When prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction. The extent of opposition to the tax implies that it may actually be repealed later, but luckily that won't happen unless lawmakers can find $30 billion in offsetting tax increases or spending cuts.
