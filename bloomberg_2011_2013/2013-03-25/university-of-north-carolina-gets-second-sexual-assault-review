The University of  North Carolina  at
 Chapel Hill  will undergo an Education Department review of its
reporting of sexual assaults, the second federal probe of the
college’s practices to be announced this month.  The review will begin April 2 and will examine UNC’s
compliance with the Clery Act, according to a  letter  dated March
21 that was posted on the university website. The Clery Act
requires that universities submit reports of sexual assaults and
other violent crimes to the department.  UNC said March 8 that the Education Department’s  Office for
Civil Rights  was investigating the university’s compliance with
the Title IX legislation, which prohibits discrimination on
campus after five people complained about its response to sexual
assaults. That complaint, lodged in February, said that the
school was regularly underreporting campus crime statistics, the
Education Department’s letter said.  “The objective of the program review is twofold; the
review team will evaluate the complainant’s allegations as well
as the university’s overall  Clery Act  compliance,” the letter
said.  Violations of the Clery Act can result in fines and can
affect a school’s eligibility for federal student aid, the
letter said.  Mike McFarland, a spokesman for the college, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
