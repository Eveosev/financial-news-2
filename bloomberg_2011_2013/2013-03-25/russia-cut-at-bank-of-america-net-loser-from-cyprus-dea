Russia  was cut to marketweight at
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch , which called the nation a “net
loser” from the Cyprus bailout plan.  “While the rest of the world welcomes the Cypriot bailout,
the major haircuts and freezing of deposits over 100,000 euros
is clearly worse for Russia than the originally proposed Cypriot
bailout,” Bank of America strategists said in an e-mailed note
today.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed to shut the
country’s second-largest bank under pressure from its euro
partners. The Micex Index slumped 3.6 percent last week as
Cyprus -- Russia’s biggest direct investor because of a dual
tax-avoidance treaty -- proposed a levy on savings accounts that
was later rejected by lawmakers. The revised accord spares bank
accounts below the insured limit of 100,000 euros.  Bank of America could take a “more bullish” view on
Russia in the second quarter, depending on the effect of the
bailout, it said.  The analysts’ “favorite” global emerging market is
 Turkey , according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
