National Bank of Kenya Ltd. , a
state-controlled lender, retreated the most in more than five
years after it said profit dropped 53 percent last year.  The shares  plunged 10 percent  to 20.25 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest decline since
January 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than
108,000 shares traded, or 1.8 times the three-month daily
average.  Net income fell to 729.8 million shillings ($8.5 million)
in the 12 months through December, compared with 1.55 billion
shillings a year earlier, Managing Director Munir Ahmed told
reporters today. Total interest expenses were 3.66 billion
shillings from 1.38 billion shillings in 2011, he said.  High interest rates weighed on National Bank’s profit and
customer deposit costs rose 166 percent, Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd. said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  For all lenders, the average interest rate paid to
customers for deposits rose to 8.71 percent in November from
7.66 percent in January 2012, according to  data  from the Central
Bank of  Kenya .  Today’s decline pared National Bank’s gain this year to 17
percent, underperforming the Nairobi Securities Exchange All-
Share Index’s rise of 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
