SAC Capital Advisors LP, the
 investment company  owned by  Steven Cohen , more than doubled its
stake in  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  as the company’s shares traded at
the lowest in more than three years.  SAC reported owning 3.33 million shares, or 5.3 percent, of
Walter Energy, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. SAC is now the second-
largest shareholder in Birmingham, Alabama-based Walter,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Walter, which mines
coal used in steelmaking, is facing calls from an activist
investor to replace board members.  The shares have  fallen  55 percent in the past year as the
price of metallurgical coal, a steelmaking ingredient, has
tumbled amid stagnating steel production. Walter fell 4.6
percent to $28.10 at the close in New York, the lowest since May
1, 2009. Walter said on on Feb. 20 its average sales price fell
39 percent to $149 a metric ton in the quarter compared with a
year earlier.  Audley Capital Advisors LLP, an investment advising firm,
has proposed five board members to replace a majority of
Walter’s independent directors and promote changes in the
company’s operations and  capital structure . Walter shareholders
will vote on directors at the April 25 annual meeting.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC Capital, declined
to comment on the share purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
