Platts, whose Dated Brent crude
assessment is used to price more than half of the worldâ€™s oil,
will keep the discount for April North Sea Forties with a higher
sulfur content unchanged from March.  The unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos. applies a so-
called de-escalator to compensate buyers of Forties crude that
contains more than 0.6 percent sulfur.  Sellers will pay 35 cents a barrel for every 0.1 percentage
point of sulfur over that limit in April, Platts said today in
an e-mailed statement. The pricing agency reviews the de-
escalator every month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
