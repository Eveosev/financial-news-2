Nigeria, Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, will increase exports of its Forcados crude to nine
cargoes in May, three more than in April, according to a loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The consignments range from 350,000 barrels to 1 million
barrels, the plan shows. Loading programs are monthly schedules
of crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers
and sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
