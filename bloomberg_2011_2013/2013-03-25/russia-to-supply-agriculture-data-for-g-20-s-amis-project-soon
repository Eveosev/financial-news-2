Russia  will provide crop production
and stocks data soon to the Agricultural Market Information
System set up by Group of 20 countries, according to the
country’s agriculture ministry.  Agriculture ministry experts and Russia’s mission to the
United Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization are working on
the format and manner of providing the necessary information,
the ministry wrote in an e-mailed reply today to questions.  Russia is one of five countries that still need to supply
data to AMIS, according to David Hallam, head of markets and
trade at the FAO. The system was set up by the G-20 to avoid a
repeat of the 2007-08  food price  crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
