New Zealand moved within six
wickets of a first Test cricket series win against England in 14
years after setting the touring team a record 481 for victory
and reducing it to 90-4.  Boosted by Peter Fultonâ€™s second century of the match, the
Blacks Caps declared their second innings at 241-6 and then
dismissed England batsmen Nick Compton, Jonathan Trott,  Alastair Cook  and Steven Finn before stumps on day four in Auckland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
