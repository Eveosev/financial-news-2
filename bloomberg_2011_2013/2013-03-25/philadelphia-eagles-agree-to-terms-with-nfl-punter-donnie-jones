Former All-Pro punter Donnie Jones
agreed to terms on a one-year contract with the  National
Football League ’s Philadelphia Eagles.  Financial details weren’t disclosed in a news release sent
by the team. The 32-year-old Jones has played nine seasons with
the Houston Texans, St. Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and  Seattle
Seahawks , earning All-Pro honors with the Rams in 2008 and 2009.  “Donnie Jones is a guy that we have admired over the last
several years,” Eagles General Manager Howie Roseman said in
the release. “He has one of the strongest legs in the entire
NFL and we’re excited we had a chance to sign him.”  Mat McBriar, the Eagles’ punter last year when they went
4-12, was cut by the club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
