Chinese  stocks  fell from a two-week
high as declines by phone stocks overshadowed higher-than-
estimated profit from  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)   ZTE Corp. (000063)  led telecommunications stocks lower for a second
day on concern a rally this year was overdone.  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (386)  dropped from a 13-month high and was the biggest
drag on the  Shanghai  Composite Index even as it reported profit
that beat estimates. Construction Bank rose to a one-month high.
Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Union Co. surged 9.9 percent on
speculation demand for the material is rising.  About five stocks declined for every four that advanced in
the Shanghai Composite Index, which lost 0.1 percent to 2,326.72
at the close. A 3.9 percent rally in the past four days had
driven the gauge to its highest close since March 6, bolstered
by a March 21 purchasing managers index showing manufacturing is
likely to expand at a faster pace this month. The CSI 300 Index
retreated 0.2 percent to 2,613.10 after ending last week at its
highest level since March 7.  “Investors are taking a break,” Deng Wenyuan, an analyst
at Soochow Securities Co., said by phone from Suzhou, near
Shanghai. “There is a lack of drive after we had gained for
four days. Investors are also waiting to see how the other
companies will do for their earnings.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.9 percent today after
Cyprus agreed to the outlines of an international bailout,
paving the way for 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of emergency
loans and eliminating the threat of default. Hong Kong’s  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  jumped 0.6 percent. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  advanced 1 percent on March 22.  PMI Reading  The Shanghai Composite has dropped 4.4 percent from a Feb.
6 peak on concern that an economic recovery will falter. A
preliminary reading for a Purchasing Managers’ Index released
March 21 by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics was 51.7,
more than the 50.4 final reading for February, when factories
closed for a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  The Shanghai gauge’s trading volumes were 17 percent lower
than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The index’s 30-day volatility jumped last week to the
highest level since February 2012, the data show. The measure is
valued at 9.6 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
the seven-year average of 15.8, the  data  show.  China ’s swap market is signaling interest-rate increases
for the first time since 2011 after inflation accelerated to a
10-month high and the housing market defied government cooling
efforts.  Technical Signal  Two-year contracts that exchange the People’s Bank of
China’s 3 percent savings benchmark for a fixed payment rose
eight basis points this month to 3.03 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The swap had been lower than the one-year PBOC
deposit  rate  for 16 months. Of the 27 economists surveyed this
month by Bloomberg, 13 predicted higher rates in 2013, with
Credit Agricole CIB, Daiwa Capital Markets and Nomura Holdings
Inc. forecasting two increases.  ZTE fell 4.7 percent to 11.46  yuan , extending March 22’s
3.2 percent slump. The stock rallied 27 percent this year to
March 21, sending its 14-day  relative strength index  to 68.40.
Some analysts see a reading of 70 or more for the RSI, which
measures how rapidly prices have advanced or declined during the
specified time period, as a signal to sell.  China Petroleum, known as Sinopec, declined 1.6 percent to
7.60 yuan after ending last week at the highest level since Feb.
15, 2012. Net income last year fell to 63.9 billion yuan ($10.3
billion) from 73.2 billion yuan in 2011, the company said in a
statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. That compares with the
61.8 billion yuan mean of analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Beating Estimates  Construction Bank advanced 1.7 percent to 4.79 yuan, the
highest close since Feb. 20. Fourth-quarter  net income  rose 16
percent from a year earlier to 35 billion yuan, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on full-year figures released
yesterday. The result exceeded the 34.5 billion-yuan average
estimate of 29 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Some 62 percent of  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  companies
posted annual profit that missed estimates, according to  data  on
140 earnings reports compiled by Bloomberg since Jan. 1.  Baotou Steel surged 9.9 percent to 5.32 yuan.  Chongqing
Iron & Steel Co. (601005)  increased 7 percent to 3.23 yuan. Steel
inventories held by traders fell 1.89 percent last week from the
previous seven days, the first decline after three months of
increases, Liu Yuanrui and Wang Hetao, analysts at Changjiang
Securities wrote in a report dated today.  Solar Stocks  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.3 percent to $36.94
March 22 in New York, trimming its second weekly slump to 1.3
percent.  Solar stocks, the most volatile Chinese equities in New
York, will extend declines as  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) ’s
bankruptcy stokes concern they are over-leveraged, according to
Gamco Investors Inc.  Four of the five stocks with the highest annualized
volatility among the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S.
are solar makers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  LDK Solar
Co. (LDK) , the solar wafer maker which has fallen 15 percent in 2013,
is posting the widest price swings behind Suntech, which plunged
40 percent last week after defaulting on $541 million of bonds.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
