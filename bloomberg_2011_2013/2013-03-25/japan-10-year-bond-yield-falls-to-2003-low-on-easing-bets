Japan’s bonds rose, sending 10-year
and 20-year yields to the lowest in almost a decade, amid
speculation  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will use
parliament testimony tomorrow to outline new easing steps.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year bonds
instead of 3-year notes narrowed to the least since June 2003 on
prospects the BOJ will buy longer-dated securities. At his
inaugural press conference as BOJ chief last week, Kuroda
reiterated a pledge to achieve a 2 percent price target. The 30-
year yield dropped to a 2 1/2-year low.  “There are expectations in the market that the BOJ will
eventually buy super long bonds in additional easing,” said
Satoshi Yamada, a Tokyo-based manager of debt trading at Okasan
Asset Management Co., which manages the equivalent of $12
billion. “ Japan ’s bond yields are falling despite stock gains
globally and losses in bonds overseas.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note touched 0.55
percent, the lowest since June 2003, before trading unchanged at
0.555 percent as of 3:30 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
all-time low for the 10-year rate is 0.43 percent, also reached
in June 2003.  The 20-year rate fell 4 1/2 basis points, or 0.045
percentage point, to 1.44 percent, after earlier touching 1.43
percent, the least since July 2003. Yields on 30-year bonds
dropped six basis point to 1.55 percent, a level unseen since
August 2010.  ‘Decisive’ Easing  Kuroda will appear in parliament tomorrow to speak about
monetary policy. He said on March 21 he was confident that
“decisive monetary easing” would lead to 2 percent inflation,
adding that the nation’s biggest task is to end deflation.  The BOJ currently buys government bonds with maturities of
up to three years through its 76 trillion-yen ($802 billion)
asset-purchase program.  Kikuo Iwata, one of two new deputy governors at the BOJ,
told reporters last week the bank should commit to achieving
price goals within two years.  Consumer prices excluding fresh
food  probably declined 0.4 percent in February from a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The statistics bureau releases data on March
29.  Japan’s leading bond futures on Japan’s bonds slid as
domestic stocks rallied after Cyprus agreed to the outlines of
an international bailout. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped
1.7 percent, rallying from a 2.4 percent slide on March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
