China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) ,
Asia’s biggest refiner, rose the most in over seven months after
the company said it would form a joint venture with its parent
to acquire overseas oil and gas assets.  The shares rose as much as 4 percent to HK$9.10 in Hong
Kong trading, headed for their biggest gain since Aug. 6. At
9:50 a.m. they were 3.2 percent higher at HK$9.03. The city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  was up 1 percent.  The company, known as Sinopec, will set up a 50-50 join
venture with its state-owned parent China Petrochemical Corp. to
acquire upstream assets in Kazakhstan, Colombia and Russia, the
company said in a statement yesterday to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange. Sinopec will pay about $1.5 billion for the assets.  “Although the deal size is relatively small compared to
Sinopec’s market cap of $98 billion, we believe this upstream
asset acquisition is one of many to come in the months ahead,
and will certainly improve the overall profitability of the
firm,” said  Gordon Kwan , head of energy research at Mirae Asset
Securities Ltd., in an e-mail today.  The deal will boost Sinopec’s proven reserves by 9.1
percent to 3.1 billion barrels and its annual crude oil
production will rise 11 percent to 365 million barrels, Kwan
said.  Sinopec’s fourth-quarter profit may stand at 21.1 billion
yuan,  Neil Beveridge , Ying Lou and  Lu Wang , Hong Kong-based
analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a research note
today. That would be 79 percent higher from a year earlier and
above the 19.3 billion yuan mean of 6 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sinopec didn’t provide fourth-quarter
data in its earnings statement yesterday.  Sinopec’s full-year net income was 63.9 billion  yuan , down
from 73.2 billion yuan in 2011. That was higher than the 61.8
billion yuan mean of 26 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
