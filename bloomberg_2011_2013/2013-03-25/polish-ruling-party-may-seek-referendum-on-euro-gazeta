Poland ’s ruling Civic Platform
party may agree to a referendum on euro adoption if the main
opposition party approves constitutional amendments allowing for
the currency switch,  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported today.  The newspaper didn’t say where it got the information.
Civic Platform lacks the two-thirds majority in the lower house
of parliament needed to change the constitution, which gives the
Narodowy Bank Polski the sole right to issue the currency.  Poland last month delayed setting a date for euro adoption
until after a general election in 2015, when Prime Minister
Donald Tusk said all requirements to switch currencies will have
been met. Recent opinion polls have shown most Poles are against
the change. The surveys were taken before Cyprus became the euro
region’s fifth economy to receive a bailout.  “There are no talks” about the euro with the opposition
Law & Justice party and the constitution should be amended
without “political haggling,” Andrzej Halicki, a lawmaker and
a spokesman for  Civic Platform ’s parliamentary caucus, said on
TVP Info today.  He wasn’t available to comment when contacted at his office
in Warsaw. Pawel Olszewski, another ruling-party lawmaker
authorized to speak to the media, said by phone that he “won’t
be able to comment until tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
