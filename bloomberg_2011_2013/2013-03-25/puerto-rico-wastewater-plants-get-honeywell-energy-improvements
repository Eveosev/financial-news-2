Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , whose
product line includes flight controls and thermostats, agreed to
wastewater-treatment plant and energy-efficiency upgrades for
the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority.  The water and wastewater utility serves 97 percent of
Puerto Rico’s businesses and 3.7 million residents, according to
a statement from Honeywell. It said the improvements are
expected to trim PRASA’s annual costs by $2.7 million, reduce
carbon emissions and cut energy use by about 50 percent in one
plant and 30 percent in another.  The energy-savings program will start with $16.3 million of
improvements at plants in Barceloneta and Caguas, Puerto Rico,
Morris Township, New Jersey-based Honeywell said in last week’s
statement. Works will also include replacing old water pumps and
other infrastructure improvements, Honeywell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
