Turkish tourism companies rose on
expectations that Israeli tourist arrivals to Turkey will
rebound after an apology by Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
for the Israeli army’s killing of nine Turks three years ago.  The  Istanbul Stock Exchange ’s  tourism index  gained 1.5
percent to 5978.07 at 4:15 p.m. in Istanbul, heading for its
highest level in almost two months. The Istanbul Stock Exchange
National 100 Index gained 0.4 percent.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on March 22
apologized to Turkey for the deaths, which occured during a May
2010 raid by Israeli commandos on a Turkish aid ship headed for
the  Gaza Strip . The number of Israeli tourists visiting Turkey
dropped to 83,740 in 2012 from 558,000 in 2008 as Turkey broke
off diplomatic relations and tensions between the two countries
increased after the raid, according to data on the Turkish 
statistics agency's website.  “Today’s gains are related to developments regarding
Israel, with investors expecting an increase in tourist
arrivals,” Nalan Ozdemir, an analyst at Ekinciler Yatirim in
Istanbul, said in a phone interview.  Izmir-based  Altinyunus Cesme Turistik Tesisler AS (AYCES)  gained as
much as 14 percent, its biggest gain since February 2007. More
