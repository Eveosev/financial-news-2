Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards snapped
an eight-day decline and government bonds rose as a bailout
accord for Cyprus damped concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen and bolstered demand for emerging-market assets.  The  Jakarta Composite (JCI)  Index rose 1.2 percent, the most in
two weeks, after Cyprus agreed broad terms for a financial
rescue that was approved by euro-area finance ministers.
Indonesia’s budget deficit may exceed 2 percent in 2013,
compared with a 1.65 percent target, on high subsidy costs,
Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said March 19.  “Following this agreement, demand for safe havens will
recede and give room for riskier assets like Indonesia’s to
regain their losses,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “The rupiah’s rally will be
limited by domestic issues such as concern over the budget
deficit and fuel subsidies.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
9,795 per dollar as of 4:28 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest gain
since March 5, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts
traded at a 0.6 percent discount to the spot rate, which
advanced 0.1 percent to 9,736, prices from local banks show.  The government’s priority is to limit subsidized-fuel usage
and increasing prices isn’t the emphasis, Martowardojo said in
Jakarta last week.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,741 by the Association of Banks in  Singapore , compared with
9,750 on March 22.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, lost 22 basis
points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 5.79 percent.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 fell for
the first time in five days today, losing one basis point to
5.47 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
