Thailand ’s baht strengthened for
the first time in three days as Cyprus agreed a bailout with
international lenders, easing concern that Europe’s debt crisis
will escalate.  Government bonds  held steady.  The accord with Cyprus was approved by euro-area finance
ministers and paves the way for 10 billion euros ($13 billion)
of emergency loans to be made. Global funds  bought  $2.9 billion
more of Thailand’s debt than they sold in March, adding to net
purchases of $6.4 billion in the first two months of 2013,
according to the Thai Bond Market Association. The baht last
week reached its highest level since a 1997 devaluation sparked
the Asian financial crisis.  “The Cyprus deal improved risk sentiment and boosted
regional currencies,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at
Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Thailand has
seen big fund inflows to its bonds due to its economic
outperformance in the region.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 29.26 per dollar as of 3:27
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 29.08 on March 20, the strongest level since
July 1997. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.14 percent.  Thailand’s $346 billion economy expanded 6.4 percent in
2012, outpacing growth of 5.6 percent in  Malaysia , 6.2 percent
in Indonesia and 1.3 percent in Singapore, according to official
data. A government report on March 28 may show Thailand’s
imports climbed 11 percent in February after a gain of 41
percent the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Exports were forecast to be
unchanged following a 16 percent increase in January.  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds due June
2023 was little changed at 3.54 percent, the lowest level this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
