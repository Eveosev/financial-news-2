Advertising sales in  Portugal  are
set to decline a third consecutive year after falling an
estimated 18 percent in 2012 amid the country’s recession,
according to  Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC)   Industry sales last year dropped to 508 million euros ($655
million), the lowest level since 1997, from 618 million euros in
2011, Luis Mergulhao, head of the advertising company’s
Portuguese unit, said in an e-mailed statement.  Portugal’s government forecast on March 15 that the economy
will shrink 2.3 percent this year before growing 0.6 percent
next year. The jobless rate will climb to 18.2 percent in 2013
and 18.5 percent in 2014, it said. The drop in gross domestic
product last year accelerated to 3.2 percent from a 1.6 percent
contraction in 2011.  “Family and company confidence levels have continued to
deteriorate,” Mergulhao said in the statement from his Lisbon
office. “Still, 2013 advertising sales will fall less than in
previous years.”  Free-to-air television, which includes  Impresa SGPS SA (IPR) ’s
SIC channel, the TVI channel owned by  Media Capital (MCP)  SGPS SA and
state-owned broadcasters RTP1 and RTP2, widened their share of
industry revenue to 49.2 percent last year from 48.4 in 2011, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
