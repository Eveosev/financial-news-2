Caplin & Drysdale Chartered’s
Washington-based lawyers H. David Rosenbloom and Scott D. Michel
comment on U.S. authorities’ focus on funds held by Americans in
 Singapore  and  Hong Kong .  They also talk about agreements between U.S. and Asian
governments to share tax information of individuals, instead of
non-U.S. financial institutions directly reporting American
client details to U.S. tax authorities under the Foreign Account
Tax Compliance Act.  They spoke in an interview in Singapore last week.  Rosenbloom on Singapore and Hong Kong:  “There’s a lot of focus on Singapore and Hong Kong because
people think that a lot of money that was in  Switzerland  has
shifted out here. We expect a lot more activity out here in
respect to enforcement and compliance. Once it goes into effect
and account holders are told their names are going to be turned
over, we expect a lot of people to come out of the woodwork.”  Michel on Asian financial institutions and Fatca:  “They recognize that inter-governmental agreements are
likely to reduce both their compliance cost and their regulatory
burden, and that they also offer the likelihood that Fatca-
related enforcement will be delegated to their home country
regulatory authorities, with whom they are more familiar.  ‘‘It was clear to us in both Hong Kong and  Seoul , probably
more so than in Singapore, that there are substantial numbers of
U.S. citizens and green card holders who are beginning to
grapple with their tax compliance issues in light of Fatca’s
impending effect.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
