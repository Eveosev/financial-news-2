Infirst Healthcare said it raised
25 million pounds ($38 million) from Invesco Asset Management to
help break into the $20 billion market for cold and pain
medicines.  Infirst plans to introduce its initial product, a cocoa-
flavored cough liquid, in  Europe , and is conducting late-stage
trials on a non-narcotic, non-opioid cough treatment that may
reach the market by 2015, the London-based company said in a
statement today. Closely held Infirst also said it’s developing
an ibuprofen-based product for inflammatory pain.  “Cough and cold and pain are the largest and most
prevalent conditions in the consumer-health sector and represent
an enormous opportunity for Infirst,” Chief Executive Officer
Manfred Scheske said in the statement. “We are delighted that
Invesco has become a major shareholder in our company.”  Scheske was president of GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s European
consumer health-care business until 2010. Infirst Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Waters also worked at London-based
Glaxo.  Infirst is a spin-out from  Seek , a London-based privately-
owned drug discovery group. The company’s board includes former
investment bankers Lynn Drummond, who was a managing director at
Rothschild, and Kimbell Duncan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
