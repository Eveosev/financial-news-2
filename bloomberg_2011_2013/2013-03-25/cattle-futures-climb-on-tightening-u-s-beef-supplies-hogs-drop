Cattle futures rose for the third
time in four sessions on signs of shrinking U.S. supply of
animals available to beef processors. Hogs declined.  About 1.482 million young cattle were placed into feedlots
last month, 14 percent less than a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a March 22 report after the
close of trading in  Chicago . The February placements were the
lowest for that month since the government began tracking the
data in 1996.  The report “is supportive” for cattle prices,  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial Services, said in a
telephone interview.  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$1.21425 a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices dropped 8.4 percent this year through March 22.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose 0.3 percent
to $1.407 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.2 percent to 89.525
cents a pound in Chicago. The price was up 4.7 percent this year
through March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
