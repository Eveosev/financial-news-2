U.S. regulators should apply
domestic derivatives rules to overseas firms when foreign laws
don’t demand comparable requirements, Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Elisse B. Walter said in a speech today.  That approach to oversight required by the Dodd-Frank Act
would be an alternative to finding overseas rules are “broadly
equivalent” in a way that might ignore regulatory gaps between
countries, Walter said in a speech prepared for an Australian
Securities and Investments Commission conference in Sydney.  The comments by Walter come as the SEC is preparing to
issue a proposal for outlining cross-border application of its
rules for security-based swaps. Overseas regulators have pressed
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to curb the reach of
its requirement that trades be guaranteed at clearinghouses and
traded on exchanges or other platforms.  “The domestic regulator would continue to have the ability
to apply certain key policy requirements of local law when
foreign law does not impose comparable requirements or provide
comparable protections,” Walter said.  Her call for substituted compliance was a “middle ground”
between  Europe ’s call for equivalence and the most strict
approach requiring U.S. and overseas regulations to align
perfectly, Walter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
