Japanese  shares  rose, with the
Topix Index climbing from the first weekly drop in five weeks,
as the yen weakened after European Union finance ministers
approved a bailout agreement for Cyprus today.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer-electronics exporter that gets 20
percent of its sales from  Europe , gained 3.1 percent. Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. rose 2.5 percent on a Nikkei newspaper report
that the Subaru maker’s operating profit may surge.  Furukawa (5715)  Co.
soared 22 percent to lead gains on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
after the industrial-machinery maker raised its dividend
forecast.  Konica Minolta  Holdings Ltd. slumped 2.9 percent after
the lensmaker’s investment rating was cut.  The Nikkei 225 gained 1.7 percent to 12,546.46 at the close
in  Tokyo , with volume 30 percent lower than the 30-day average.
The Topix climbed 0.8 percent to 1,047.29. All but three of its
33 industry groups advanced.  “Now that they’ve reached an agreement, there’s relief as
it seems the financial system has been saved for now,” said
 Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees about $74 billion.
“Fundamentals here remain strong, with the trend toward a
weakening yen, as well as the global economic recovery with the
U.S. and  Asia  boosting Japanese exporters.”  The Topix rallied 45 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced that brought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to power
on a platform of increased stimulus and monetary easing from the
central bank. The gauge is trading at 1.2 times  book value ,

compiled by Bloomberg.  Cyprus Agreement  Futures on the  S&P 500  climbed 0.4 percent today. The U.S.

weekly drop, as earnings from Nike Inc. and Tiffany & Co. beat
estimates and optimism grew that Cyprus would secure a bailout.  Finance ministers from the 17-nation euro area approved a
rescue agreement for Cyprus during talks in Brussels today,
eliminating the threat of default and the country’s disorderly
exit from the shared currency.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed to shut the
country’s second-largest bank under pressure from a German-led
bloc of creditors in a night-time negotiating melodrama that
threatened to rekindle the debt crisis and rattle markets.  The yen fell 0.7 percent to the euro and 0.3 percent to
94.78 against the dollar today, paring last week’s gain of 0.9
percent. A weaker currency boosts overseas earnings when

billion yen in profit last fiscal year.  Furukawa surged 22 percent to 123 yen, its biggest gain
since October 2008. The company said it will pay a dividend of 2

from buy at Jefferies Group LLC, which also cut its price target
by 50 yen to 800 yen.  The Nikkei Stock Average  Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 6.8 percent
