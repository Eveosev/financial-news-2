Obagi Medical Products Inc. (OMPI) , which
makes prescription-strength skin care systems, was sued by an
investor seeking to block a $360 million acquisition by  Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)   The offer undervalues Obagi,  Michael Rubin , the
shareholder, said in a filing made public today in Delaware
Chancery Court. Rubin seeks to represent all Obagi shareholders
in his request for a court order barring the deal.  Obagi announced March 20 that its directors unanimously
approved Montreal-based Valeant’s purchase of the company for
$19.75 a share in cash. The transaction is expected to close in
the second quarter, the companies said in a statement.  Rubin accused Obagi’s board of breach of fiduciary duties,
alleging the purchase price was inadequate given the company’s
“excellent” prospects for growth, according to the complaint.
Deal-protection clauses within the agreement, including a $16.2
million termination fee, preclude other bidders from making a
successful competing offer, Rubin said in the complaint.  Mark Taylor , a spokesman for Long Beach, California-based
Obagi, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment on
the complaint.  The case is Rubin v. Obaji Medical Products Inc., CA8433,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
