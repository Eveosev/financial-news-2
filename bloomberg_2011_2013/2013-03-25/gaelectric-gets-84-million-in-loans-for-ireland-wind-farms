Gaelectric Holdings Plc , a Dublin-
based renewable energy developer, received $84 million in loans
to build wind farms in Ireland.  Proventus AB led the financing, which included debt from
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale,  Matthew Clark , a
Gaelectric spokesman, said today by e-mail.  Enercon GmbH agreed to provide wind turbines for 13 onshore
projects, which will cost about $325 million. They are expected
to provide 164 megawatts of generation capacity and be completed
by 2017, closely held Gaelectric said today in a statement. The
NordLB debt financed construction of Gaelectricâ€™s 13.8-megawatt
Carn Hill project in  Northern Ireland .  McCann Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets advised
Gaelectric on the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
