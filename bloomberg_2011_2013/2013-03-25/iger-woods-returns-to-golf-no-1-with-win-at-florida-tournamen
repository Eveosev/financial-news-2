Tiger Woods  reclaimed the No. 1
spot in golf’s world rankings after a 2 1/2-year absence with a
record-tying eighth win at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in
Orlando, Florida.  The final round of the tournament at the Bay Hill Club &
Lodge was completed today after heavy rain and winds of 50-60
miles per hour (80-95 kilometers per hour) halted play
yesterday.  Woods, 37, won his third title this season by posting a 2-
under-par 70 today for a four-round total of 13 under and a two-
shot victory over  Justin Rose . It is Woods’s sixth victory in
his last 20 events on the U.S. PGA Tour.  It’s his eighth win at the tournament, tying  Sam Snead  for
the most titles at a single PGA Tour event. Woods now has 77 PGA
Tour wins, five behind Snead for the career mark.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
