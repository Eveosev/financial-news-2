U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  is closing in on
an agreement with Slovakia on keeping its operations in the
central European country after the government offered
incentives, Prime Minister  Robert Fico  said.  The largest steel producer in the U.S. and the Slovak
administration are “on the right track” to agreeing the
company won’t sell its unit, one of the largest employers in the
eastern euro-area member, Fico said following a meeting with
company officials in Pittsburgh today.  “In the coming hours, experts on both sides must finalize
some details,” Fico said in an e-mailed statement distributed
by his press department in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. “If
this succeeds, we shall be able to announce good news for
employees as early as this week, maybe even tomorrow.”  U.S. Steel said in November it was considering selling the
unit after it received unspecified offers. Concern that the sale
would lead to job losses at a time when unemployment hovers
close to a nine-year high prompted Fico to offer concessions,
including lower electricity-related charges.  The plant located in Kosice, eastern Slovakia, is the
steelmaker’s sole operation in  Europe , where slowing demand is
weighing on prices and shipments. Last year, it sold its Serbian
mill for $1, triggering a $450 million charge.  U.S. Steel bought its Slovak operations in 2000 for $475
million. The plant, with an annual capacity of 5 million tons,
has two coke batteries, three blast furnaces and units that
produce sheets, tin-mill products and pipes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
