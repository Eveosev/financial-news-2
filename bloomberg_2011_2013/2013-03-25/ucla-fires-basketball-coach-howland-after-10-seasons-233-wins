UCLA fired men’s basketball coach
Ben Howland after a 10-year tenure that featured three
consecutive trips to the Final Four of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament.  Howland had a 233-107 record and seven NCAA tournament
berths at the University of California Los Angeles.  The Bruins went 25-10 this season and lost their opening
game in the NCAA tournament after being left out of the field
two of the previous three years. UCLA, whose 11 national
championships are the most in college basketball history, hasn’t
won more than one game in the NCAA tournament since its third
straight trip to the Final Four in 2008.  “The UCLA community and fans have been unbelievable to my
family and I, and it’s been an honor and privilege to represent
this great institution,” Howland said in a statement. “I look
forward to what comes next.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
