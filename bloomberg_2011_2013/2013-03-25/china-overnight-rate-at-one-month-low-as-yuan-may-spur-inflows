China ’s overnight money-market rate
fell to a one-month low on optimism a strengthening yuan will
spur capital inflows, boosting cash in the financial system.  The rate dropped for a fifth day as the yuan rose beyond
6.21 per dollar today for the first time in 19 years after the
People’s Bank of China raised the currency’s reference rate.
 Foreign direct investment  climbed 6.3 percent from a year
earlier to $8.21 billion in February, the Ministry of Commerce
said on March 19. That’s the first increase in nine months.  “Liquidity appears fairly ample of late, with likely
continued inflows,” said  Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “The strong  yuan  fixing
points to the same direction.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.71 percent as of 10:09 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It touched 1.70 percent earlier, the
lowest level since Feb. 20.  China’s growth is likely to accelerate this year and next
as the world’s second-biggest economy weathers a fragile global
recovery, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said on March 22.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, slipped one basis
point to 3.27 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
