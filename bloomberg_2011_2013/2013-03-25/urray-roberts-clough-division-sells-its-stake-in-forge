Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
South Africa’s second-largest construction company, said its
 Clough Ltd. (CLO)  unit in Australia sold its 36 percent stake in  Forge
Group Ltd. (FGE)  services provider for A$187 million ($195.8 million).  Clough will use proceeds from the disposal of about 30.9
million shares in Forge to “deliver shareholder value” through
acquisitions or “capital management initiatives,”
Johannesburg-based Murray & Roberts said in a statement today.
The sale was arranged under a block trade agreement with
Macquarie Capital (Australia) Ltd.  Murray & Roberts returned to  profit  in the six months
through December, with net income of 262 million rand ($28
million) compared with a loss of 528 million rand a year
earlier. Perth-based Clough, an energy, chemical and mining
engineering business that’s 62 percent-owned by the South
African company, posted a fourfold jump in operating profit in
the period, excluding figures from Forge.  Murray & Roberts  rose  as much as 3.5 percent to 24.04 rand
and was trading up 1.6 percent at 4:19 p.m. in Johannesburg.
That pared the stock’s decline this year to 4.7 percent,
compared with a  0.3 percent  gain in the seven-member  FTSE/JSE
Africa Construction and Building Materials Index . Clough fell 4
percent to A$1.31 and Forge declined 2.9 percent to A$6.10 at
the close in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
