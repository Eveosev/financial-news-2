Florida  Gulf Coast University
became the first No. 15 regional seed to ever reach the round of
16 at college basketball’s national men’s tournament with a
81-71 win over San Diego State.  Florida Gulf Coast, which was seeded 15th out of 16 teams
in the South region, followed its opening-game upset of No. 2
 Georgetown University  with today’s victory against seventh-
seeded San Diego State in Philadelphia.  The Eagles (26-10) advance to play the third-seeded
University of Florida in the final 16 of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament on March 29 in Arlington,  Texas .
Florida Gulf Coast is a school of 13,000 students in  Fort Myers 
that held its first class in 1997 and started playing at college
basketball’s top level in 2007.  Six other schools won NCAA tournament games as a No. 15
regional seed since the field was expanded in 1985. Five of the
six had lost their second game by at least 11 points, with
Coppin State in 1997 coming the closest to reaching the final 16
with a 82-81 second-round loss against Texas.  Top regional seeds Kansas and Indiana both won earlier
today, with Kansas defeating No. 8 North Carolina 70-58 in the
South and Indiana rallying past No. 9 Temple in the East. Ohio
State, the No. 2 seed in the West, beat Iowa State 78-75 on a
last-second 3-pointer. Florida reached the final 16 with its
78-64 victory today over No. 11  Minnesota .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
