Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may announce it will
return cash to shareholders before the second half of this year
as the company’s shares decline, said Lawrence Haverty, a
portfolio manager at  Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)   “My guess is it will be before June 30,” Haverty said on
Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance.” “The pressure is just
increasing because last week we had 700 stocks -- an incredibly
broad market -- in the new high list in the  New York  Stock
Exchange and here is Apple crashing into the new low list.
Something is going to happen. It just has to.”  Apple shares have slumped 13 percent this year, sliding to
their lowest price in more than 13 months on March 4. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has rallied 9.2 percent in 2013.  Separately, a bidding war for  Dell Inc. (DELL)  shows the
availability of money to finance takeovers, Haverty said.  Dell said today it received bids from Blackstone Group LP
and Carl Icahn that may be considered superior to founder
 Michael Dell ’s buyout offer for the personal-computer maker.  “What you have is a number of very serious people looking
at this thing, and they are trying to figure out whether or not
it can be financed,” Haverty said. “The fact that this much
money is available to be financed indicates that there is
mountains of money behind this on deals that are probably much
less risky.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
