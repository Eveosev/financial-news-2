Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the
U.K.’s second-largest government-owned lender, paid 25 employees
more than 1 million pounds ($1.52 million) even after posting a
third straight full-year loss.  Lloyds paid five bankers more than 2 million pounds, the
London-based firm said in a statement today. Its top eight
executives received 13.4 million pounds in total compensation,
down from about 16.2 million pounds in 2011. Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio’s pay almost doubled to 3.38
million pounds last year, the bank said.  Horta-Osorio’s efforts to return the 39 percent U.K.-owned
lender to profitability are being stymied by past regulatory
missteps such as the improper selling of loan insurance. The
firm has set aside 6.8 billion pounds in redress for payment
protection insurance mis-selling and this month posted a net
loss of 1.43 billion pounds for 2012.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets,
this month said it paid 428 bankers more than 1 million pounds,
while  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said it had 204 employers earning that
level and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  had 95.  Lloyds said it would claw back some of the bonuses awarded
to executives in 2010 for their involvement in the inappropriate
sale of PPI.  The lender’s bonus pool shrank to 365 million pounds for
2012, down from 375 million pounds a year earlier.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporters on this story:
