Power-station coal stockpiles at
 China ’s largest port for the fuel rose to the highest level in
32 weeks as prices slid to a three-year low.  Inventories of coal with an energy value of 5,500
kilocalories per kilogram at the port of Qinhuangdao climbed to
8.3 million metric tons as of yesterday, the China Coal
Transport and Distribution Association said today in Beijing.
That’s the highest since July 29, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price of the fuel for immediate delivery was at a
range of 610  yuan  ($98.22) TO 625 yuan a ton as of yesterday,
down 5 yuan from the previous week and the lowest since October
2009, the data show.  Utilities in China, the world’s biggest energy user, cut
coal consumption as hydro power generation increased in the
first two months, according to  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. Stockpiles also rose because the
landed cost of imported coal is about 10 yuan to 20 yuan a ton
cheaper than domestic supplies, she said. Coal at the Australian
port of Newcastle, a benchmark grade for  Asia , cost $89.15 a ton
as of March 15, according to data from IHS McCloskey.  “ Power plants  are keen to restock inventories when
domestic coal is still at a premium to imports, leading to high
inventories,” Lau said. Chinese prices are “close to a
bottom” as the country’s power demand is set to pick up in the
second quarter, she said.  Power Consumption  China’s hydropower generation from its biggest plants rose
24 percent to 82 billion kilowatt-hours in first two months,
data from the China Electricity Council showed March 18. Thermal
power generation rose 1 percent to 643 billion kilowatt-hours.
Electricity use will increase by as much as 8.5 percent this
year to as much as 5.33 trillion kilowatt-hours, the council, a
group of the nation’s biggest electricity providers, said in a
statement on its website.  Growth in total electricity output slowed to 3.4 percent in
the first two months of 2013 from December’s 7.6 percent.
Industrial production, which accounts for about two-thirds of
the nation’s electricity use, had the weakest start to a year
since 2009, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed
