Gulf Coast crudes strengthened
after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  shut a 170,000-barrel-a-day pipeline
that moves  Gulf of Mexico  oil to Houma,  Louisiana , following a
leak Mar. 23 in Terrebonne Bay.  The 16-inch pipeline carries oil inland from a 20-inch
pipeline that gathers crude produced in the Eugene Island, Ship
Shoal, Green Canyon and other offshore formations in the Gulf of
Mexico.  “The shut line is obviously going to have an effect, but
just in general, I think the markets are pretty well bid and are
going to stay that way going forward,” said Carl Larry,
commodities trader with Houston-based Atlas Commodities, LLC.
“You’re going to see all the crudes in the Gulf stay high,
especially as oil refineries come back from turnarounds.”  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) ’s 160,000-barrel-a-day Lima, Ohio,
refinery started ramping up after the completion of a
turnaround, and work at  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ’s 268,000-
barrel-a-day Houston refinery was expected to conclude by the
end of March.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate widened $2 a barrel to $20 as of 12:01 p.m.
in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet added 50 cents to $18 a barrel over WTI.  Eugene Island oil strengthened 50 cents a barrel to a
premium of $16.  Poseidon, Mars  Poseidon oil’s premium to WTI widened 25 cents to $12.50.
Mars Blend’s strengthened 5 cents to $13.25 a barrel over WTI,
and Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at $11.25. The premium
for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was unchanged at $15
above WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.50, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude, a
Canadian light synthetic oil processed from  oil sands , weakened
50 cents to a premium of $5.50 a barrel.  Index trading for April delivery for the Canadian grades
ended on March 15. Most of the volume in the grades is traded
