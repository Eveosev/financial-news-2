Rubber futures advanced as Cyprus
reached a tentative agreement on an international bailout and
Japan’s currency weakened, boosting the appeal of the yen-
denominated contracts.  The contract for delivery in August advanced as much as 1.5
percent to 282.7 yen a kilogram ($2,983 a metric ton) before
trading at 281.7 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:04
a.m. The gain pared this year’s loss to 6.9 percent.  The yen dropped to 94.96 per dollar as the euro rallied on
indications Cyprus is moving toward a deal eliminating the
threat of default.  “The news about Cyprus eased concerns about the crisis,
spurring investors to buy back the futures,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone.  Finance ministers from the 17-nation euro area are now
meeting in Brussels to consider approving the accord, reached by
Cyprus with the “troika” representing international lenders, a
European official said today.  The contract for September delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange gained 1.2 percent to 23,070  yuan  ($3,714) a ton on
March 22. Natural-rubber inventories climbed 2,188 tons to
115,991 tons, the highest in about three years, the bourse said
on March 22, based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber free-on-board declined 0.5 percent to 86.20
baht ($2.94) a kilogram on March 22, the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand  said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
