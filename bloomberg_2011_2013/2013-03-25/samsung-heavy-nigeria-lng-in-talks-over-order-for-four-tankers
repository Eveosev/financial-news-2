Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140) , the
world’s second-largest shipyard, is in talks to supply Nigeria
LNG Ltd. with four ships as  Africa ’s biggest exporter of
liquefied natural gas seeks to expand its deliveries abroad.  Nigeria LNG is still working on the proposed deal, Gloria
Ita-Ikpeme, a Lagos-based spokeswoman for the company, said in
an e-mailed response to questions. A spokesman for Samsung Heavy
said negotiations were making progress toward an agreement.  Nigeria LNG operates the Bonny Island plant with six
production units able to produce 21.7 million metric tons of the
gas a year, or about 8 percent of the world total, according to
data from the International Group of LNG Importers. The company
has long-term contracts with buyers in  Europe  and is seeking to
boost shipments eastward to meet growing demand from Asia.  Plans to boost the tanker fleet of Nigeria LNG’s shipping
unit, Bonny Gas Transport Ltd., include an order with Hyundai
Heavy Industries Co. for two ships, MoneyToday reported on Feb.
22. The expansion follows a $1 billion loan brokered by BNP
Paribas SA, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Africa Finance Corp.  Nigeria LNG exported 333 cargoes in 2012, the most since
sales began in 1999, according to its  website . State-run
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. is the biggest shareholder
with 49 percent. Units of Shell, Total SA and Eni SpA hold 26
percent, 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively.  Hyundai Heavy couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
