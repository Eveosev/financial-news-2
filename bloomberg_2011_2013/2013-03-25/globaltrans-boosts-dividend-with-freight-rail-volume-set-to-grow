Globaltrans Investment Plc (GLTR) , a
Russian freight rail operator listed in  London , plans to
increase its dividend payout for 2012 by 26 percent even as
profit declined because of acquisitions.  Net income fell to $258 million from $266 million in 2011
as financing costs because of after Globaltrans’s acquisition of
a rail unit from billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s Metalloinvest,
the company said in a statement. Revenue rose 22 percent to $2.1
billion.  Globaltrans’s board recommended paying 2012 dividends of 70
cents a share or global depositary receipt, for a total of $125
million compared with $99 million a year earlier, according to a
separate statement. The company paid 64 cents a share on 2011
profit, and has since issued new stock.  The rail company’s stock jumped as much as 8.9 percent in
London, trading up 4.3 percent at $14.79 by 11:17 a.m.  Along with Neftetransservice and billionaire  Vladimir
Lisin , Globaltrans has been buying rail freight assets to expand
its presence in the Russian market. Last month, the company
completed a $335 million acquisition of MMK-Trans, which owns
3,500 railcars serving steelmaker  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel. (MMK)   “The current market environment may well be a catalyst for
further consolidation,” Globaltrans said today in the
statement. “Smaller rail operators are increasingly deprived of
access to premium cargo bases as well as being impacted by
recent market headwinds.”  Unlike  Russian Railways , which had a 4.8 percent decline in
cargo volume in the the first two months of 2013, Globaltrans
increased freight rail turnover 35 percent in January through
February this year as it acquired fleets from Metalloinvest and
MMK, according to the company’s statement.  Steelmakers  OAO Severstal (SVST)  and OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  haven’t yet sold
their captive rail freight carriers, Globaltrans Chief Executive
Officer Sergey Maltsev said by phone today, when asked what
remains to be acquired in the Russian market.  Cargo volume at Russian Railways is unlikely to grow in
March as this month has been abnormally cold and snowy, hurting
business for scrap-metal processors and producers of gravel and
sand, Maltsev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
