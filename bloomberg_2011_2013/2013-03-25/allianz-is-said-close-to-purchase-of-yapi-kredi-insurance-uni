Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest
insurer, is close to buying Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS’s insurance
unit and a stake in its pension business for less than 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion), two people person with knowledge of the
matter said.  Yapi & Kredi, the Istanbul-based bank controlled by
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Turkey ’s biggest business group,  Koc Holding
AS (KCHOL) , may complete the sale of  Yapi Kredi Sigorta AS (YKSGR)  to Munich-
based Allianz within weeks, said the people, asking not to be
identified because the discussions are private.  Yapi Kredi controls 94 percent of Yapi Kredi Sigorta,
according to the bank’s website. UniCredit and Koc are selling
Yapi Kredi Sigorta and Yapi Kredi Emeklilik AS as part of a
reorganization of Yapi Kredi. UniCredit is reviewing its
strategy in countries where it operates to focus on the most-
profitable businesses and Turkey remains a “core market,”
Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  has said.  Yapi Kredi Sigorta generated 959.4 million liras ($526.3
million) of premiums in the first 10 months of 2012, up 21
percent from a year earlier, and had a 7 percent market share,
according to the Insurance Association of Turkey’s website.  The news was reported by Reuters earlier today. Officials
at Allianz and UniCredit declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
