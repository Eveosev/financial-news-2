Shi Zhengrong, founder of  Suntech
Power Holdings (STP)  Co. Ltd. and an Australian citizen, has been
barred from leaving China along with the company’s chief
executive officer,  David King , while authorities investigate the
state of the company’s finances.  Immigration officials have been instructed to temporarily
prevent Shi, who was once China’s richest man, from venturing
outside China following Suntech’s bankruptcy, the Shanghai
Securities News said March 22, citing people it didn’t identify.  E-mail and phone requests for comment to Australia’s
Department of  Foreign Affairs  and Trade weren’t immediately
answered. The Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing didn’t
immediately respond to faxed questions. Suntech officials
declined to comment.  Suntech, which last week said it wouldn’t resist a
bankruptcy petition filed in China, owes 221 million  yuan  ($36
million) in payables to Jiangsu Akcome Solar Science &
Technology Co., Changzhou Almaden Stock Co. and Xi’An Longi
Silicon Materials Co., the report said.  The company, based in Wuxi, outside Shanghai, had more than
$2 billion in credit lines and defaulted on $541 million in
bonds due on March 15, prompting eight Chinese banks to ask a
local court to push Suntech’s main unit into insolvency. The
court accepted the petition on March 21.  Shi’s stake of about 30 percent in Suntech was valued at
$1.7 billion when he emerged at the top of the Wall Street
Journal’s rich list for China in 2006.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
