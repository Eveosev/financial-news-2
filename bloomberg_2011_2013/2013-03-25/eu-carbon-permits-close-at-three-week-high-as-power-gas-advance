European Union carbon permits for
December rose to the highest level in three weeks as power and
natural gas advanced amid forecasts for lower temperatures.  Electricity for delivery in April in  Germany ,  France ,  the
U.K.  and the Nordic region gained at least 2.5 percent,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Temperatures
were forecast to decline in the coming days and wind generation
was set to fall, Bloomberg’s wind-power model showed. Higher
power prices encourage utilities to sell electricity ahead,
boosting demand for carbon permits.  Month-ahead natural gas  in
the U.K. also climbed.  December carbon futures rose as much as 11 percent before
closing 8.2 percent higher at 4.49 euros ($5.77) a metric ton,
the highest since March 4, on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The closing price was above a technical resistance level of
4.48 euros, which represents the 38.2 percent Fibonacci
retracement level of the low on Jan. 24 of 2.81 euros to the
high on Feb. 18 of 5.52 euros.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
