Gold futures dropped to a one-week
low after Cyprus agreed with euro-area finance ministers on a
rescue package, reducing demand for the precious metal as a
haven.  Cyprus received a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout
after agreeing late yesterday to shrink its banking system. Gold
advanced 1 percent last week amid concern that the European
crisis would escalate. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
raw materials jumped as much as 1.1 percent.  “The ‘risk-on’ appetite is back because of the overnight
news out of Cyprus,” Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based vice
president at TD Securities Inc., said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for June delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,606.50 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $1,590.40, the lowest for a
most-active contract since March 18.  The metal pared losses after Reuters reported that Dutch
Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said the Cyprus deal should
be viewed as a template, and nations with large banking
industries must look to restructure and reduce their size.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to $28.815
an ounce in New York.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
July delivery advanced 0.1 percent to $1,586.90 an ounce.  Gold and platinum trading was double the average volume in
the past 100 days.  Palladium futures for June delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$757.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
