Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest maker of auto parts, expects sales growth to accelerate
next year if economic conditions don’t deteriorate.  Continental is “likely to post high single-digit growth in
sales again in 2014,” the Hanover, Germany-based company said
in its annual report today.  Continental stuck with its forecasts for 2013 even as the
Europe’e auto market declined more than industry executives had
anticipated in the first quarter. The manufacturer expects sales
growth of 5 percent this year and targets adjusted earnings
before interest and taxes above 10 percent of revenue.  Continental, also the region’s second-largest tiremaker,
has partly avoided the effects of Europe’s recession by
following  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and Daimler
AG into growing markets such as  China  and the U.S. Focus on
high-value parts such as fuel-injection technology, safety
sensors and emergency braking systems has also won high-end
customers willing to pay more for the products.  The 2014 predictions are based on the International
Monetary Funds’ forecast from January that the global economy
will grow more than 4 percent next year and that economic
activity in the euro area will see a considerable pickup.  “To accompany this growth with sufficient capacity,
investments equivalent to roughly 6 percent of consolidated
sales would be necessary, although we would still finance these
entirely from free  cash flow ,” Continental said.  Net debt is expected to decrease next year, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
