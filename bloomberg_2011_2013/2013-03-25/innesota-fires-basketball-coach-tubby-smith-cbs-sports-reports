The  University of Minnesota  fired
men’s basketball coach Tubby Smith one day after the Golden
Gophers’ season ended in the Round of 32 at the national
tournament.  Smith, 61, was dismissed today after six seasons in
 Minnesota , Athletic Director Norwood Teague announced in a
statement on the school’s athletics website. He was 124-81,
including 46-62 in Big Ten play.  “Tubby has had a long and distinguished career and we feel
it’s time for a fresh set of eyes for our student-athletes and
our program in general,” Teague said.  Minnesota started the 2012-13 season 15-1 but lost 12 of
its final 18 games and entered the NCAA tournament as a No. 11-
seed in the 16-team South region of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association championship event.  The Golden Gophers beat sixth-seeded UCLA 83-63, Smith’s
first NCAA tournament victory with Minnesota, before falling 78-
64 yesterday to the  University of Florida .  The Golden Gophers made the tournament three times in
Smith’s tenure, losing their opening game in 2009 and 2010.  Smith was the coach of the  University of Kentucky  from 1997
to 2007. He won a national title with the Wildcats in 1998 and
was named  Southeastern Conference  Coach of the Year in 1998,
2003 and 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
