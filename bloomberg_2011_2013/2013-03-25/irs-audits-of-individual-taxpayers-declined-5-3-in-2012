The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service 
audited 5.3 percent fewer taxpayers in 2012 compared with 2011,
according to  data released today  by the agency.  The IRS audit rate for individuals declined to 1.0 percent
from 1.1 percent.  High-income taxpayers are much more likely to get audited
than others. In 2012, the IRS audited 12.1 percent of
individuals with income exceeding $1 million, down from 12.5
percent  the year before .  Taxpayers making between $50,000 and $100,000 have the
least chance of being audited, according to the data. Of those
taxpayers, IRS examined 64 out of every 10,000 returns, or 0.6
percent.  By contrast, the IRS examined returns for 27.4 percent of
taxpayers who reported adjusted gross incomes exceeding $10
million.  The IRS budget was reduced to $12.1 billion in fiscal 2012
from $12.4 billion the year before. At the end of the fiscal
year, the agency had 89,551 workers, down 2 percent.  The data released today demonstrate the rise in  identity
theft  occurring through tax returns. The taxpayer advocate
service, an independent organization within the IRS, received
54,748 identity theft cases in 2012, up 61 percent from the
prior year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
