U.K. Asset Resolution Ltd. , the
government-owned bank, repaid 4 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) to
taxpayers in 2012 and posted a full-year profit.  Pretax profit at the firm, which manages the assets of
nationalized banks Bradford & Bingley Plc and Northern Rock
(Asset Management) Plc, fell to 690.5 million pounds in 2012
from 1.38 billion pounds a year earlier, the firm said in
statement today. The number of customers with mortgages more
than three months in arrears fell 23 percent to 25,581 last
year.  “We still have a long way to go, but it remains our
expectation and determination to repay that debt in full,”
Chairman Richard Pym said in the statement.  U.K. Asset Resolution was formed in October 2010, taking
mortgages from Bradford & Bingley, which is closed to new
customers, and some from nationalized lender  Northern Rock  Plc.
The banks were taken over by the taxpayer in 2008 and now
operate separately, under a single board and management
structure. Northern Rock Plc operates as a separate company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
