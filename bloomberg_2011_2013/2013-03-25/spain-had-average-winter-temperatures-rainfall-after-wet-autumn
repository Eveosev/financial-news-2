Spain had a winter with average
rainfall and temperatures close to normal, the Agriculture
Ministry’s weather service reported. That followed the country’s
third-wettest autumn in 12 years.  Spain on average received 205 millimeters (8.1 inches) of
rain from December through February, in line with normal values
for the period, and temperatures averaged 8.1 degrees Celsius
(46.6 degrees Fahrenheit), 0.2 degree above normal, the ministry
wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Winter rainfall was spread unevenly, with Navarra and the
Basque provinces in the north getting triple normal rainfall and
the south of Murcia on the Mediterranean Sea getting less than
25 percent of usual precipitation, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
