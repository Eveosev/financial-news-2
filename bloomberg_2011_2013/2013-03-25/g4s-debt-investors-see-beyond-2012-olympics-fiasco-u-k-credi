G4S Plc (GFS) , pilloried for its failure
to supply enough security workers for the  London  2012 Olympics,
is back in favor with bondholders.  Investors demand 200 basis points more yield to own its 350
million pounds ($531 million) of 7.75 percent notes due 2019
rather than similar-maturity British gilts. That’s down from 247
basis points in July, the month the U.K. government said it
would draft in extra troops to augment protection for Olympic
athletes and spectators after the world’s largest security
company failed to provide enough personnel.  Since Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles told lawmakers
in July that G4S’s reputation was “in tatters,” the Crawley,
England-based company has worked to win new contracts and
restore its credibility. G4S ousted two executives, won deals
from  British Airways  and a young offender institution, declined
to bid for complex contracts at the 2014 soccer  World Cup  and
the 2016 Olympics, and outlined plans to lift emerging markets
sales as European margins get squeezed.  “They’ve clearly learnt from the Olympics debacle, so they
can judge better than others what is needed for such big
events,” said Volker Schmidt, a Luxembourg-based portfolio
manager at YCAP Asset Management. “While the company’s size
alone doesn’t ensure its competence, it makes it more and more
difficult for the smaller players.”  YCAP Asset Management holds 0.5 percent of a 500 million-
euro ($648 million) G4S bond due in December 2018, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Government Contracts  The stock has risen 14 percent since the start of the year
in London trading, valuing the company at 4.1 billion pounds and
beating the 8.4 percent gain of the U.K. FTSE 100 benchmark
index. On March 22, the stock rose 0.5 percent to 292.10 pence.  In February, G4S won a five-year  deal  to provide cleaning
services to a U.K. public healthcare organization, showing that
its relationship with the British government is improving.  The government had stripped G4S of a contract to run the
Wolds prison in Yorkshire, northern  England , in November. The
jail will return to the public sector in July, after being run
by the company since it opened in 1992.  G4S has several contracts with the U.K. government,
including deals with the  Home Office  valued at 600 million
pounds, Buckles said in July when he faced lawmakers questions
over its Olympics security contract.  ‘Rehabilitation’  The company generated about 10 percent of  revenue  last year
from U.K. government contracts and the Olympics contract
represented 2 percent of its business.  Europe , its biggest
source of revenue, accounted for 39 percent.  “People are appreciating that actually there is a sort of
rehabilitation going on with the U.K. government, which is where
most of the sensitivity was,” G4S Treasurer Nigel Youngman said
in a phone interview. “Bondholders have always seen us as an
attractive prospect. Fundamentally it’s a steady growth business
with a predictable  cash flow  from one year to another.”  Free cashflow attributable to shareholders was little
changed at 341 million pounds last year compared with 350
million pounds in 2011, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
The company’s debt is rated BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  G4S is expanding business in emerging markets such as the
 Middle East ,  Africa  and  Latin America  as European  margins , based
on earnings before interest, taxes and ammortization, declined
to 7 percent last year from 7.4 percent in 2011 at its secure
solutions business, and to 10 percent from 10.6 percent in the
cash business. Both exclude the Olympics charges.  U.S. Sale  The company said March 5 it would sell its U.S. Government
Solutions business partly because of reduced  government spending 
and tighter margins. It has received interest from 15 companies,
Buckles said March 13 in a Bloomberg television interview. More
sales may follow and some of the proceeds will go into expanding
its presence in developing markets, he said.  G4S plans to generate 50 percent of revenue from  emerging
markets  by 2019 compared with 33 percent last year.  “The whole point of the Olympics contract is that it was
very different from their core business,” said David Greenall,
an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in London, in a phone
interview. “They’ve also got a mantra of moving much more
towards emerging markets. It reflects a greater confidence in
the long-term perspective.”  ‘Tight Control’  On March 12, the yield premium of G4S’s 7.75 percent notes,
issued at a spread of 410 basis points in 2009, dropped to an
all-time low of 195.13 basis points. The same day, companies
with 5 to 7 year bonds and a BBB rating in a Merrill Lynch index
had an average yield premium of 280 basis points.  G4S, formed from the merger of Securicor Group and Group 4
Falck A/S in 2004, has a total 1.68 billion pounds of debt
 outstanding,  including a 389 million-pound revolving  credit line 
maturing in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There
are no significant bond repayments due before then.  Demand in November for the company’s 500 million-euro bond
due 2018 exceeded supply at least five times with 75 percent of
the debt sold to investors outside the U.K., Treasurer Youngman
said.  “It’s really only in the U.K. that sensitivity was
heightened off the back of media and political comment,” he
said. “We wanted to expand our investor base, as we’d issued a
bond in the U.K. before.”  G4S debt is also attractive because of the company’s
“tight control” over spending, Chief Financial Officer Trevor Dighton, due to retire on April 30, told analysts in a March 13
conference call.  Pre-Crisis Levels  The company will save about 25 million pounds in
procurement this year, adding to the 35 million pounds of cost
cuts achieved in 2012 while the ratio of debt to earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization is set to decline,
Dighton said.  “One of our key financial  ratios  is the net debt to
Ebitda,” Dighton told analysts. “I said before that we are
comfortable with it up about 2.5 times. It’s increased in 2012
to 2.6 times but we anticipate that it will return to our target
range within 2013.”  In March, the company posted a decline in pretax profit to
175 million pounds last year from 257 million pounds, taking a
hit of 88 million pounds from bungling the 2012 Olympic Games
contract.  Organic sales growth, excluding the Olympics, increased 6.9
percent compared with 4.5 percent a year earlier.  As G4S bonds return to favor, the company’s  shares  are also
in demand. G4S, which declined 17 percent in four days in July
after the company said July 12 it couldn’t handle its Olympics
contract, closed higher than its pre-crisis level for the first
time on Feb. 19.  “The Olympics is behind the group now and they’ve
effectively drawn a line in the sand,” said David Brockton, an
analyst at Espirito Santo. “The way to sustain growth is to
continue to build share in emerging markets and that’s what
they’re doing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
