C.A.T. Oil AG (O2C) , Russia’s largest
provider of hydraulic fracturing services, surged to the highest
in almost five years in Frankfurt trading after holding meetings
with investors.  The shares rose as much as 11 percent to 9.88 euros, the
highest since May 2008, before paring gains and trading at 9.4
euros as of 2:40 p.m. local time. Trading volumes were about 70
percent greater than the three-month daily average.  Management have concluded meetings with about 30 different
funds and financial institutions in  New York  and  London , Leonid
Mirzoyan, the company’s chief corporate financial officer, said
by telephone from Moscow today.  OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil and OAO Gazprom Neft are spending
billions of dollars to boost horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, which splits underground rock by blasting it with a
pressurized mixture of water and sand, after the technology
increased crude output in the U.S.  More than 90 percent of this year’s forecast revenue of as
much as 425 million euros ($549 million) are already secured in
C.A.T. Oil’s order book, Mirzoyan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
