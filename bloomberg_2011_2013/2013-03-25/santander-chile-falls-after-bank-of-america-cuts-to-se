Banco Santander  Chile , the
country’s second-largest lender by loans, fell to a two-month
low after Bank of America Corp. cut its rating of the stock to
the equivalent of sell.  Shares retreated 1.3 percent to 33.90 pesos at 2:32 p.m. in
Santiago after touching 33.70 pesos, the lowest intraday level
since Jan. 7. The Ipsa  benchmark index  fell 0.6 percent.  Bank of America cut its  recommendation  from neutral and
lowered its target price by 9 percent to 34 pesos, according to
an e-mailed note. Slower inflation will lead to a lower net
interest margin, or NIM, the bank’s analysts wrote.  “Over the long-term horizon, we see soft loan growth, NIM
pressures, rising provisions and higher corporate taxes
affecting earnings,” analysts BofA Jose Barria and Jorg Friedemann said in an e-mailed note. “These trends plus a
regulatory overhang and high valuations make Chilean financials
unattractive at the moment.”  Chilean banks hold inflation-linked instruments among their
assets including loans in Unidades de Fomento, the country’s
inflation-linked accounting unit.  Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in February from a year
earlier, below the central bank’s target range of 2 to 4
percent. Inflation will probably speed up the rest of the year,
with inflation at 2.7 percent in 2013, according to the median
estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
