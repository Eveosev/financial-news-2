Oil production in  Texas ’s Eagle
Ford shale formation climbed 50 percent in January versus a year
earlier, boosted by drilling from companies including
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)   The nine geographic fields that make up the majority of the
Eagle Ford yielded 373,303 barrels of crude a day in January,
according to preliminary data released by the  Texas Railroad
Commission , which oversees oil and gas drilling in the state. In
January 2012, those fields produced 248,403 barrels a day.  Railroad Commission production totals typically increase in
subsequent months as the state receives revised, corrected or
late reports. December output was revised to 417,879 barrels a
day from the preliminary report of 384,964.  Production of condensates, or natural gas liquids, was
52,703 barrels a day in January, down from 105,861 a year
earlier, as drillers moved away from less profitable gas.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle
Ford play, with 644,000 net acres. Chesapeake is next with
490,000, followed by companies including ConocoPhillips,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Growing production out of Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas crude. The  state  produced 2.22 million
barrels a day in December, the highest monthly level since June
1986, according to the U.S. Energy Department’s Energy
Information Administration.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford oil today
was $101.12 a barrel, compared with the most recent settlement
prices of $93.71 for West Texas Intermediate and $107.66 for
Brent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
