Wolfgang Putschek, one of the most
senior investment bankers at  Austria ’s  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI) , is leaving after 18 years.  Putschek, 48, is departing from Raiffeisen’s Centrobank
unit at the end of March to join Swimsol, a maker of
photovoltaic systems he founded with his brother, he told
 Bloomberg News  today.  Raiffeisen, eastern Europe’s second-largest lender, merged
its investment-bank unit, Raiffeisen Investment, of which
Putschek was a co-head since 2004, with Centrobank last May.
Putschek continued as head of regions, responsible for corporate
finance in eastern Europe and Austria, under the Vienna-based
lender’s roof.  A Raiffeisen Centrobank spokeswoman, Andrea Pelinka-Kinz,
confirmed Putschek is leaving. No replacement will be named as
his tasks will be divided among Gerhard Grund, Henning von Stechow and Klaus Imhof, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
