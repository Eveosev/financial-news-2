Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state-owned ports and rail operator, plans to raise 20 billion
rand ($2.16 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2014 to
fund its expansion plans.  The figure compares with about 18 billion rand raised in
the current financial year, Transnet Chief Financial Officer
Anoj Singh said in an interview in Johannesburg today. About 60
percent of the target may be reached by selling five-to-ten year
bonds, he said. “Beyond that, it gets expensive.”  Transnet plans to tap the South African market for about 60
percent of the  bond issue  and offshore investors for the rest,
according to Singh. The 20 billion rand will go toward capital
expenditure for the year of 35 billion rand, while  debt funding
requirements will be 11 percent higher than a year ago, he said.  Transnet started a seven year 300-billion rand development
plan across  Africa ’s biggest economy and neighboring
commodities-producing countries last year. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 20 percent
to 18.9 billion rand in the fiscal year 2012.  The company’s financial performance for the year ending
March 2013 will be “reasonable,” Singh said. Transnet is
“commodities linked” and weaker “global economic growth has
impacted us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
