First Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov ’s working group is expected to reach agreement on the
duty removal measure with other Custom Union members, Kazakhstan
and Belarus, in days, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich 
told reporters after govt meeting today.
* Implementation of duty-free grain imports regime is expected
no later than in April if Customs Union approves the measure,
“otherwise this won’t have any sense,” Dvorkovich says
* Russia’s govt decided today to spend some additional budget
funds on spring grain sowing that started in March and on
support of animal farms, which suffered from record grain prices
earlier this season, Dvorkovich says
* Total agriculture financing will be up to 42b rubles,
including 30b rubles for spring sowing and animal farmers’
support, he says  To contact the reporter on this story:
