The Miami Heat extended their
winning streak to 26 games with a 109-77 rout of the Charlotte
Bobcats, as  LeBron James  had 32 points, 10 assists and eight
rebounds to help erase an 11-point first-quarter deficit.  The Heat improved their record to 55-14 and pulled within
seven wins of matching the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers for the
longest run in National Basketball Association history.  The Bobcats, who were outscored 62-38 in the second half,
have an NBA-worst 16-54 record.  The Heat overcame the absence of All-Star guard  Dwyane Wade , who sat out last night’s game because of a sore right
knee.  Chris Bosh  and Norris Cole each scored 15 points for
Miami, which hasn’t lost since Feb. 3 and now goes on the road
for games in Orlando, Chicago, New Orleans and San Antonio.  “This team is built around a lot of depth, veterans, guys
who are going to be able to step in,” James told reporters.
“The feeling that D-Wade was out was that, ‘OK, we’ll find
someone to step up.’ It wasn’t a big thing.’”  The San Antonio Spurs have the NBA’s second-best record at
53-17 after last night’s 96-95 loss to the Houston Rockets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
