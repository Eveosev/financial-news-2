Ethanol weakened against gasoline
on speculation that improved profitability of making the biofuel
will boost output.  The price difference, or spread, widened 0.41 cent to 52.26
cents a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S.
ethanol producer, said March 22 that it resumed output at a
distillery in Linden,  Indiana , and the most recent Energy
Information Administration report showed  production  rose 1.5
percent to 809,000 barrels a day in the week ended March 15, the
highest level since Feb. 22.  “Late last week, we started to see more producers offering
product,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc., a
Jupiter, Florida-based brokerage. “We’re definitely seeing more
product available. It’s still tight, but not as tight.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 0.4 cent to
$2.54 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have risen
16 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery rose 0.1 cent to
$3.0626 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Damask said ethanol companies are seeing better returns
after profits were eroded as corn jumped following drought in
the Midwest.  Corn for May delivery increased 7 cents, or 1 percent, to
$7.3325 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
15 cents a gallon, down from minus 12 cents on March 22. The
spread was more than twice as wide at the beginning of the year.  The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Output is down 16 percent from the record 963,000 barrels a
day in December 2011, data from the Energy Department’s
statistical agency show.  Stockpiles have fallen a record seven consecutive weeks to
18.5 million barrels, the lowest level since Nov. 23, according
to the EIA report.  “They’re selling as much inventory as they can to get
product out the door,” Damask said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 95 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended March 15, the EIA
report showed, up from 93 percent the previous week.  Ethanol Imports  The U.S.  imported  27,000 barrels of the fuel, the first
time it’s made foreign purchases of ethanol in three weeks, EIA
said.  Brazil , the largest supplier of ethanol to the U.S., uses
sugarcane to make the fuel, while U.S. distillers mostly
manufacture the biofuel from corn.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.38 a gallon last week,
10 percent below today’s futures price.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 2.5 cents to $2.80 a
gallon on the West Coast, the most expensive U.S. hub, while the
biofuel was unchanged in New York at $2.66; in Chicago at $2.54
and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.60 a gallon, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol premium to the Gulf expanded 11 percent
to 20 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York was unchanged
at 12 cents.  Ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers for the corn-based
variety sank 7 cents, or 10 percent, to 60.5 cents, the lowest
level since Feb. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
RINs are assigned to each gallon of fuel introduced the market,
then submitted by refiners to the Environmental Protection
Agency to show compliance with the law or traded.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, slumped 2.5 cents, or 3.3 percent, to
73 cents, the lowest level since March 1.  The credits each peaked at a record on March 8 at $1.06 for
the conventional grain-based variety and $1.08 for the advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
