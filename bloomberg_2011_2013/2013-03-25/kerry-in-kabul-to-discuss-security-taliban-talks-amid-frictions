U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
arrived in Kabul today to meet Afghan President  Hamid Karzai ,
with whom he’ll discuss the conditions for any U.S. troops to
remain beyond 2014, the outlook for peace talks with the Taliban
and the security and economic transition.  Kerry’s visit, his first as the top U.S. diplomat, was not
announced in advance for security reasons. The trip comes on the
heels of a series of disputes between the two nations over the
transfer of detainees to Afghan custody, the expulsion of U.S.
Special Forces from a restive area and Karzai’s recent
accusation that the U.S. was colluding with the Taliban to stoke
violence in his country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
