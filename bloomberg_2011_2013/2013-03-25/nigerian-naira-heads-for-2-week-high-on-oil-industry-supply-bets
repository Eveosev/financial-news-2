The naira gained for a third day
and headed for its strongest in more than two weeks on
speculation that Nigerian oil producers will sell dollars to
meet month-end expenses before a currency auction today.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest economy rose less
than 0.1 percent to 158.15 per dollar by 12:21 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital, poised for the highest close since March
8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil producers, which sell dollars to meet local expenses
around the end of the month, are the second-biggest source of
foreign currency after the Central Bank of Nigeria. The
institution sells dollars at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays
to help manage the exchange rate.  “We anticipate appreciation of the naira in the forex
market amid dollar sales by multinationals to meet month-end
obligations,” analysts at Lagos-based Cowry Asset Management
Ltd., led by Edgar Ebinum, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 dropped four basis points to 11.20 percent in the
secondary market, according to March 22 data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
$500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined nine basis
points to 4.24 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.9390 per
dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
