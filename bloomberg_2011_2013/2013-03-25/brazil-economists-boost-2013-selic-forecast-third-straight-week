Analysts covering Brazil’s economy
raised their forecast for the benchmark rate at year-end, as
policy makers seek to control accelerating annualized inflation
in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  Brazil’s Selic rate will be 8.50 percent at the end of this
year, according to the median estimate in a central bank survey
of about 100 analysts published today. Analysts had forecast
8.25 percent the previous week. The rate will be 8.50 percent at
year-end 2014, the survey showed.  Brazil’s economy has reacted slowly to stimulus aimed at
spurring the slowest growth among major  emerging markets  while
cooling inflation. After gross domestic product grew by 0.9
percent last year, measures including tax cuts and record-low
interest rates have helped drive recent retail sales and
industrial output above forecasts. Brazil may require additional
measures to slow inflation levels approaching the upper limit of
the central bank’s target range, bank President Alexandre Tombini said on March 22.  Annualized inflation in mid-March  accelerated  for the sixth
straight month to 6.43 percent, even as the pace of monthly
consumer price increases slowed. Brazil’s inflation is under
control and will not hinder the country’s growth, Finance
Minister Guido Mantega said on March 21. The central bank
targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  Economists in the survey cut their forecast for inflation
this year to 5.71 percent from 5.73 percent the previous week,
and raised their call for inflation next year to 5.60 percent
from 5.54 percent.  Brazil ’s retail sales rose 0.6 percent in January from the
month prior, beating analysts’ forecasts of a 0.4 percent
increase, the national statistics agency said on March 14.
Industrial production in January jumped 2.5 percent, compared
with a median forecast of 1.6 percent.  Gross domestic product will expand 3 percent this year, the
survey showed, down from 3.03 percent the previous week. Brazil
grew by 2.7 percent and 7.5 percent in 2011 and 2010,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
