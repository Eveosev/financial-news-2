Sensys Traffic AB (SENS) , a Swedish maker
of automated traffic safety monitoring systems, advanced to its
highest level in more than two years in Stockholm trading after
the company won its third order from  Washington  in as many
months.  Sensys jumped as much as 0.13 krona, or 14.3 percent, to
1.04 kronor, its  highest level  since March 11, 2011. The shares
were up 12 percent at 1.02 krona as of 11:45 a.m. local time,
with trading volumes at almost triple the daily average in the
past three months. The shares were the biggest gainer on the OMX
Stockholm Index, which tracks 278 companies.  Sensys said today it won an 11 million-krona ($1.7 million)
order for speed and red light monitoring systems from Sensys
America Inc., its exclusive distributor in the U.S. that signed
a framework agreement in October to deliver traffic safety
systems to the U.S. capital. Today’s announcement brings Sensys’
total orders under the agreement to 16.2 million kronor, which
represents 40 percent of the company’s entire 2012 sales.  “It has gone a bit quicker than we had expected and while
it’s difficult to forecast the amount of further orders given
the scope for delays, we do expects more orders to come,” Johan Frilund, the chief executive officer of Joenkoeping, Sweden-
based Sensys, said in a telephone interview today.  While Sensys doesn’t make financial forecasts, the
“prerequisites” for a potential full-year profit are within
Sensys’ prospects, Frilund said. Sensys reported a net loss of
43.1 million kronor last year and sales of 41 million kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
