Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG)  has hired
Dave Howard as president of MSG Sports, putting the longtime New
York Mets’ executive in charge of the business operations of
basketball’s Knicks and hockey’s Rangers.  Howard succeeds Scott O’Neil, who resigned in September
after four years on the job. Howard, who most recently served as
the baseball team’s vice president of business operations, will
start his new job April 9.  Hank Ratner, chief executive of MSG, which is undergoing a
$1 billion, privately financed renovation of its namesake arena,
said in a statement yesterday that Howard is “one of New York’s
premier sports executives.”  “We’re confident Dave’s vision and management skills will
ensure we continue to earn the passionate loyalty of generations
of fans, while developing strategic growth opportunities that
help drive our business,” Ratner said.  Howard played a key role in moving the Mets to Citi Field
from Shea Stadium, the statement said. A Fordham University Law
School graduate, he has a degree in economics from Dartmouth
College.  Howard spent 20 years with the Mets in a variety of roles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
