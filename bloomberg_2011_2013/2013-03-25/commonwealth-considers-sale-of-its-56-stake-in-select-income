CommonWealth REIT (CWH)  may sell some or
all of its 22 million shares, or 56 percent holding, in  Select
Income REIT (SIR)  to cut its debt and buy properties.  Select Income, which has a market value of about $1
billion, applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to
allow CommonWealth to sell “all, some or none” of its shares,
according to a statement today. CommonWealth will use any money
raised from the share sale to repay debt and buy new buildings
in city-center business districts, the statement showed.  Corvex Management LP and Related Cos. are trying to oust
CommonWealth’s board and have said they are prepared to buy the
Newton, Massachusetts-based company, which they claim is
undervalued because of “misalignment of incentives” between
the real estate investment trust and its external management. A
Maryland court ruled last week that they had “failed to provide
sufficient facts” to halt the arbitration of a governance
dispute with the company over bylaws that make it harder for
investors to replace board members.  Select Income was a unit of CommonWealth before the
company’s shares were listed on the  New York  stock exchange last
year. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is book runner for
CommonWealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
