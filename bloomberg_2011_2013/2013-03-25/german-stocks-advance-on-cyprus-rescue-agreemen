German stocks  advanced after Cyprus
agreed to a rescue package, lowering the risk of default and an
exit from the euro currency union.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  paced gains in the
benchmark index.  The  DAX (DAX)  Index rose 1.1 percent to 7,996.28 at 9:22 a.m. in
Frankfurt, after last week falling for the first time in a
month. The broader HDAX Index also added 1.1 percent today.  Cyprus bowed to demands to shrink its banking system in
exchange for a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout. President
Nicos Anastasiades agreed to shut the country’s second-largest
bank under pressure from a German-led bloc of creditors.  The revised accord spares bank accounts with less than the
insured limit of 100,000 euros. A loss of no more than 40
percent will be imposed on uninsured depositors at the Bank of
Cyprus, two European Union officials said. Uninsured depositors
at Cyprus Popular would largely be wiped out, two other
officials said.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s biggest lender, advanced 1.5
percent to 32.87 euros. Commerzbank, the country’s second-
largest, climbed 1.4 percent to 1.20 euros. Bank shares in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 1.2 percent for the third-best
performance among the 19 industry groups.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s third-largest maker of
cement, jumped 2.4 percent to 57.41 euros for the biggest gain
in the DAX.  To contact the reporter on this story:
