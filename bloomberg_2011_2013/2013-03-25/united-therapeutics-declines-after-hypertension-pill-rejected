United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR)  declined
after U.S. regulators rejected for the second time the company’s
oral version of its treatment for high  blood pressure  in the
arteries that supply the lungs.  United Therapeutics fell 2.2 percent to $59.62 at 4 p.m.
 New York  time. The Silver Spring, Maryland-based company has
increased 25 percent in the past 12 months.  The  Food and Drug Administration  told United Therapeutics
about the rejection of its treprostinil pill for pulmonary
arterial hypertension in a so-called complete response letter,
the company said in a statement today. United Therapeutics will
immediately seek a meeting with the FDA to discuss the letter.  “We remain confident that oral treprostinil will play an
important role in treating PAH and we are committed to working
collaboratively with the FDA to accomplish this goal in the most
timely and appropriate manner,” Martine Rothblatt, chairman and
chief executive officer of the company said in the statement.  Treprostinil is already approved to treat the life-
threatening disorder by injected, intravenous and inhaled
administration.  When United Therapeutics received the first complete
response letter in October, the FDA questioned whether the drug
slowed the progress of pulmonary arterial hypertension in three
final-phase studies and questioned the lack of a statistically
significant effect on a six-minute walking test in two studies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
