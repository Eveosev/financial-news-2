New Zealand  needs three wickets in
the final session to secure its first Test cricket series win
against England in 14 years after reducing the touring team to
237-7 in Auckland.  Neil Wagner ended  Ian Bell ’s 271-ball innings by having him
caught for 75 in the slips by Tim Southee in the last over
before tea to leave Matt Prior 45 not out at the interval.
Southee earlier removed Jonny Bairstow for 6.  Wagner broke a 78-run partnership between Bell and Prior
that had boosted England’s chances of batting out the final day
to avoid a 1-0 defeat in the best-of-three contest.  New Zealand removed Joe Root and Bairstow with the second
new ball either side of the lunch break, before Prior joined
Bell, who was dropped when on 40. Prior also had a reprieve on
28 when a bouncer from Wagner hit his bat handle and helmet
before falling onto the stumps without dislodging the bails.  England  had resumed at 90-4 on day five after being set a
world record 481 runs for victory yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
