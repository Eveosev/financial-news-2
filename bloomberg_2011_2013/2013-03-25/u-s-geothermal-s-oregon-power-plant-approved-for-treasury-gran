U.S. Geothermal Inc. (HTM) , a renewable-
energy developer with projects in three Western states and
Guatemala, was approved for a U.S. Treasury Department grant for
a power plant it operates in Oregon.  U.S. Geothermal’s $36 million grant for the Neal Hot
Springs geothermal plant will be reduced 8.7 percent to about
$33 million due to automatic cuts to the  federal budget  that
took effect March 1, the Boise, Idaho-based company said today
in a statement.  About $13.3 million will pay an outstanding project loan
and $8.5 million will be held in cash reserves. The balance will
be distributed among equity partners.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  owns 30
percent to 40 percent of the U.S. Geothermal unit that operates
Neal Hot Springs.  Idaho Power Co. purchases electricity from Neal Hot Springs
under a 25-year contract. The plant is expected to produce about
183,000 megawatt-hours a year.  The grant was awarded under the Treasury Department’s 1603
program that provides cash when projects go into operation
instead of tax credits the plants would receive in the future.
U.S. Geothermal received March 6 the balance of an $11.8 million
federal grant under the same program for a project in Nevada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
