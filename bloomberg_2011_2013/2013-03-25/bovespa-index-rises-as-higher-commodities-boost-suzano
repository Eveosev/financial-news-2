The Bovespa index rose for the
first time in five days as Suzano Papel & Celulose SA led gains
by raw-material producers amid a rally in commodity prices.  Oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  advanced as crude gained
on eased concern that Europe’s crisis will worsen after lenders
agreed to the outlines of a bailout for Cyprus.  The Bovespa index gained 0.3 percent to 55,397.79 at 10:47
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . Forty-five  stocks  rose on the gauge while 22
fell. The real weakened 0.1 percent to 2.0120 per dollar. Crude
for May delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent in  New York  after
Cyprus reached an accord with creditors, setting the framework
for 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of emergency loans to stave
off the threat of default.  “You can see gains one day or the other, but overall the
outlook for the stock market is still doubtful,” Clodoir Vieira, an economist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Souza Barros
Corretora, said in a phone interview. “You can have stocks
rising in a day of more positive headlines, but problems in
 Europe  are still serious and need to be watched closely.”  Suzano gained 1.4 percent to 7.16 reais. Petrobras, as
Petroleo Brasileiro is also known, advanced 0.8 percent to 18.77
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
