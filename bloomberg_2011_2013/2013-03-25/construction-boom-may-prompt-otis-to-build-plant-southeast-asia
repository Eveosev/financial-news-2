Otis , whose elevators power people
up and down the  Eiffel Tower , is considering setting up its
first plant in Southeast Asia to tap a market that could pass
Western Europe by the end of the decade.  A decision on the location may be made by the middle of
next year, Otis President Pedro Baranda said in an interview
yesterday.  China  and  India , along with Western Europe, are the
biggest markets for elevators and escalators, he said.  Demand from Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia is increasing
while economic growth and construction in India have prompted
the  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  unit to expand capacity at its
Bangalore factory, Baranda said. There are 0.2 elevators per
1,000 people in India compared with 11 in Western Europe, 10 in
Hong Kong and 3 in the U.S., he said.  “The future of our industry is here,” Baranda said in
Singapore. “It’s inevitable, because it’s driven by
demographics and urbanization. We are investing in engineering
and manufacturing facilities in this part of the world.”  The Philippine and Taiwan economies grew more than forecast
last quarter, and Singapore’s jobless rate fell to a five-year
low, signaling an upswing at the end of 2012 that underscored
Asia’s role leading a global recovery.  Indonesia, Thailand and  Malaysia  were identified by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG to be among the biggest
beneficiaries of Japanese monetary easing and a 10.3 trillion
yen ($109 billion) stimulus plan by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
who wrapped up a tour of Southeast Asia on Jan. 18.  More Demand  “Economies in Southeast Asia should continue to lead
global growth,” Song Seng Wun, a Singapore-based economist at
CIMB Research Pte. “We’re already seeing urbanization
happening. More money in the pocket means more demand for
services, more demand for services means everything needs to be
upgraded.”  Otis’s worldwide sales totaled $12.1 billion last year,
little changed from the $12.4 billion a year earlier, according
to a  statement  on its website. The Farmington, Connecticut-based
company is projecting sales of between $12 billion and $12.5
billion this year, he said.  Revenue from Asia Pacific region may be almost $5 billion
this year, up from less than $4.5 billion in 2012, Baranda said.  Otis’s parent United Technologies said earlier this year it
expects Asian sales will increase about 7 percent to 8 percent
in the next decade as construction of skyscrapers in China
boosts demand for elevators and air conditioners, made by United
Technologies’s unit  Carrier .  Chinese Skyscrapers  Almost 60 percent of all the new tall buildings in the
world are going to be in China, and that will stoke demand at
United Technologies businesses such as Carrier air conditioners
and Otis elevators, United Technologies Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  said in February.  China’s orders for Otis, the third-biggest contributor to
United Technologies’s sales, posted a 17 percent increase in the
fourth quarter. That comes after three quarters of declines.  Otis’s competitor,  Schindler Holding AG (SCHP) , abandoned a
profitability target in February for its elevators and
escalators business to focus on winning market share in China
and India, part of billionaire Chairman Alfred Schindler’s
strategic push. Schindler has already begun building new
factories in China, India and Slovakia.  It is no longer strategically acceptable to focus
exclusively on the optimization of the operating margin, the
Ebikon, Switzerland-based Schindler said in a Feb. 19 statement.  Otis is developing new technologies for its elevators that
will save energy and increase efficiencies, Baranda said. The
company is offering models that can be powered by batteries, so
that they can operate even during outages, he said.  Otis has been moving some of its businesses to Asia,
including its global head of strategy, who moved to  Shanghai  as
part of a strategy to be closer to customers, he said.  “We’re very bullish about the prospects in the region,”
Baranda said. “The market is going to grow at significantly
higher levels than the GDP for the next few decades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
