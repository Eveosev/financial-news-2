A shipping subsidy and lower excise
tax linked to the export of as much as 1.2 million metric tons
of sugar by  Pakistan  may lead to low inventory and high domestic
prices, a unit of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  The decision by Pakistan’s Economic Coordination Committee
of the cabinet and the Federal Board of Revenue “is being
heavily criticized as a politically motivated move by the
government to garner support from the sugar industry in the
upcoming elections,”  the USDA’s  Foreign Agricultural Service 
said in a  report  posted today on its website.  Stockpiles may drop to a “precariously low level” of
400,000 tons, down from an average of 1 million tons in the past
five years, according to the report.  On March 6, the coordination committee approved an inland
freight subsidy of about $18 a ton on exports of as much as 1.2
million tons after previously setting the quota at 895,000,
according to the report. The federal excise duty on domestic
sales was lowered to 0.5 percent from 8 percent to provide an
increased incentive to export, according to the report.  “The government efforts to increase the competitiveness of
Pakistani sugar in the international market by means of
providing direct payment to millers for export could be a
violation” of World Trade Organization obligations under an
agriculture accord, according to the report.  The government of President Asif Ali Zardari became the
first civilian administration to complete its full term. General
elections are scheduled for May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
