Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo ,
 Brazil ’s second-largest power generator by capacity, slumped for
a fourth day after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short
of analysts’ estimates.  Shares dropped 0.7 percent to 19.61 reais at 2:53 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier sliding as much as 1.6 percent to 19.42
reais, the lowest intraday price since March 20. The benchmark
 Bovespa index  retreated 0.6 percent.  Cesp, as the electrical utility is known, said in a
regulatory filing on March 22 after the market closed that sales
rose 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter to 805.2 million reais
from a year earlier. That compares with an average estimate of
851.6 million reais of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Shares gained 1.8 percent this year through March 22 while
the Bovespa declined 9.4 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
