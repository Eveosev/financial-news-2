OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, gained for the first time in three days after Economy
Minister  Mihaly Varga  ruled out introducing measures to help
foreign-currency debtors without consulting banks.  The shares advanced 2.8 percent to 4,574 forint by 10:28
a.m. in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  rose 1.8
percent, also climbing for the first day in three.  Demand for riskier assets increased after Cyprus agreed to
the outlines of an aid package, paving the way for 10 billion
euros ($13 billion) of emergency loans. Hungary’s government
only wants to use existing tools to help people indebted in
Swiss francs or euros for now, with new methods to be introduced
only after a compromise with lenders, news website  portfolio.hu 
reported, citing an interview with Varga.  “The news is slightly positive for banks as these tools
don’t hurt banks’ profitability,” Erste Group Bank AG analysts
including Jozsef Miro in Budapest wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
