Sugar futures fell for a third
session in  New York  on signs that supplies will be ample as
near-record output in Brazil’s main producing region extends a
global surplus. Coffee gained.  Sugar production in Brazil’s center south, the world’s top
producing region, will be 34 million to 35.2 million metric tons
in 2013-14, according to the average estimate of six mill owners
surveyed by Bloomberg last week. The region produced an all-time
high of 34.1 million tons a year earlier. World output in the
2013-14 season that starts in April may exceed demand by 3.8
million tons, a fourth straight surplus, Brisbane, Australia-
based researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty. says.  “We remain bearish on sugar given our estimates for a
global surplus,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Adam Longson
said today in an e-mailed report. “We believe that the bulk of
bullish news is behind us and larger-than-expected production
out of  Brazil  could push supplies even higher.”  Raw sugar for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to 18.13 cents
a pound by 6:44 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
declining 3.7 percent last week. White sugar for May delivery
was down 0.1 percent to $526.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Arabica coffee for delivery in May climbed 0.3 percent to
$1.3575 a pound in New York, while robusta coffee for the same
delivery month advanced 0.2 percent to $2,143 a ton in London.  Hedge funds  were holding the biggest bearish bet in arabica
coffee on record as of March 19, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said on March 22. Speculative net-short
 positions  totaled 30,162 futures and options contracts.  Bearish investor positions “should facilitate the
Brazilian government’s attempts to shore up prices for domestic
coffee producers,”  Carsten Fritsch , a Commerzbank AG analyst in
 Frankfurt , said in a report today. “A credible announcement
that market interventions will be made to prevent any further
price slide could result in short coverings and cause prices to
climb.”  Cocoa for May delivery advanced 0.4 percent to $2,168 a ton
in New York. Cocoa for the same delivery month rose 0.6 percent
to 1,454 pounds ($2,211) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
