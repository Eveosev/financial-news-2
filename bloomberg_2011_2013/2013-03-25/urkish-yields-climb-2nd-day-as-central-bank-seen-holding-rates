Turkey ’s benchmark  bond yields 
climbed for a second day, heading for the highest level in more
than 11 weeks, on speculation the central bank will hold
 interest rates  after six consecutive months of cuts.  Two-year yields rose 8 basis points, or 0.08 percent, to
6.30 percent at 1:40 p.m. in Istanbul, advancing 61 basis points
in March, the biggest monthly gain since October 2011. Ten-year
yields were unchanged at 7.22 percent, giving a 41 basis-point
advance for the month.  The central bank’s monetary policy committee meets tomorrow
to decide on interest rates. The committee may keep the one-week
repo rate, the overnight lending rate and the overnight
borrowing rate at 5.5 percent, 8.5 percent and 4.5 percent,
respectively, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The committee has implemented cuts on one or more
rates in every one of its six meetings since Sept. 18.  “The continuing weakness of the lira, coupled with the
expectation that the central bank will not cut interest rates,
results in bond selling across the whole curve, including the
two-year benchmark,” Jerome Broex, a currency and fixed income
trader at Turkish Bank in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.
“We could see the 2-year yield at between 6.5 percent and 7
percent over the next two months.”  The lira strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 1.8139 per
dollar, appreciating for a second day. The currency has lost 1.7
percent against the  U.S. dollar  this year.  If a resistance level of 1.83 is broken, “the way toward
1.84-1.86 is pretty much open,” Broex said.  Resistance is an area on a price graph where technical
analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
