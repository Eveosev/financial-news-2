Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM) 
is in settlement talks with an investor group that sued the
mortgage servicer over auctions of home loans backing
securities.  Nationstar was accused in a lawsuit this month of
auctioning loans at the expense of mortgage-bond investors. In a
letter dated March 22 and filed in  New York  state court, a
lawyer for the plaintiff asked for an adjournment of a scheduled
hearing, citing talks to resolve the dispute.  “The parties are engaged in settlement discussions and
hope that the additional time will lead to their successful
resolution,” the lawyer, Jonathan Pickhardt, said in the letter
to Justice Eileen Bransten of New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan.  Nationstar, which is majority-owned by Fortress Investment
Group LLC, was sued by KIRP LLC on March 7. KIRP said the loan
liquidations are a “blatant abdication” of Nationstar’s duties
as servicer.  KIRP comprises a group of investment funds that holds in
aggregate $3.5 billion in original face amount of securities
from securitization trusts at issue in the case, according to a
court hearing transcript.  The case is KIRP LLC v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC, 650794-
