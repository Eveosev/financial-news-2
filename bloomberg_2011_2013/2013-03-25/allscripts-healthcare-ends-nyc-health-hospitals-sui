Allscripts Healthcare Solutions
Inc. (MDRX) , a provider of electronic medical records, dropped a
lawsuit against  New York  City Health & Hospitals Corp. over a
$303 million contract given to another company.  Allscripts, based in Chicago, sued in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan in December over a contract for
computer hardware and software awarded last year to Epic Systems
Corp., a closely held medical-software provider based in Verona,
 Wisconsin .  The company has discontinued the suit and “looks forward
to having the opportunity to work with HHC on other matters in
the future,” Allscripts said in an e-mailed statement. Ariana Nikitas, a spokeswoman for the company, declined further
comment.  “New York City Health & Hospitals Corp. is pleased that
Allscripts has withdrawn the lawsuit,” the corporation said in
an e-mailed statement. Evelyn Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the
corporation, didn’t respond to a question about whether the
case had been settled.  The case is Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. v. New
York City Health and Hospitals Corp., 654362/2012, New York
State  Supreme Court , New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
