U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened
from a  three-week high  as refineries were expected to finish
maintenance, boosting supplies in the region.  Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur,  Texas , plant and
 Chevron Corp. (CVR) ’s Pascagoula site in  Mississippi  are expected to
complete planned work this week.  The 600,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur refinery shut
production units for 38 days of scheduled work beginning Feb.
14, two people familiar with operations said. The Pascagoula
plant, which has a capacity of 330,000 barrels, is expected to
restart a coker this week, according to a person familiar.  Reformulated,  84-octane gasoline  to be blended with
ethanol, or RBOB, dropped 3.5 cents to 7 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:10 p.m,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount shrank to
3.5 cents on March 22, the smallest gap since Feb. 27.
Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol dropped 1.5
cents to 32.5 cents under futures.  Gasoline supplies on the  Gulf Coast , referred to as PADD 3,
were  72.1 million  barrels in the week ended March 15, Energy
Information Administration data show. Refineries processed about
7.39 million barrels a day of crude and other feedstock, up
 138,000 barrels  from the previous week.  “The sharp increase in refinery utilization rates likely
portend continued deterioration in refined product cracks,”
according to a research note from Energy Analytics Group Ltd.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , slipped 16 cents to $27.45 a barrel, the lowest level
since Feb. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same
spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil declined $2.16 to $7.45 a
barrel, the first drop in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
