Deutsche Bahn  AG and its main labor
union agreed to a 19-month contract providing a total 6 percent
pay increase, ending a dispute that prompted a railway strike
across  Germany  a week ago.  The agreement will raise wages by an annual 3 percent in
May 2013 and April 2014, and the 130,000 employees covered by
the contract will also receive a 500-euro ($640) one-time bonus,
the state-owned, Berlin-based train operator said today in a
statement. Deutsche Bahn will also increase pension-fund
payments, it said.  The pay talks reached a “respectable result,” the
Eisenbahn- und Verkehrsgewerkschaft labor group said in a
separate statement.  The EVG held a five-hour strike that led to cancellation of
150 trains on March 18, with disruptions to long-distance,
commuter and cargo services. The union was demanding a 6.5
percent raise. Deutsche Bahn had offered increases of 2.4
percent this year and 2 percent in 2014, while the EVG said the
proposal didn’t cover all workers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
