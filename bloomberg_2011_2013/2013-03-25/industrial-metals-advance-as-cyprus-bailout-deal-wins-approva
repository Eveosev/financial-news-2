Copper rose, pacing gains in
industrial metals, as the demand outlook improved after euro-
area finance ministers approved a bailout deal for Cyprus.  Copper for delivery in three months added 0.2 percent to
$7,671 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 4 p.m. in
 Seoul . The price fell 1.3 percent last week, the first drop in
three. The contract for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to close at 55,890  yuan  ($9,000) a ton.  Cyprus agreed to the outlines of an international bailout,
paving the way for 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of emergency
loans and eliminating the threat of default.  “The agreement is sending a signal to markets that the
Cyprus problem is stabilizing, albeit not fully resolved yet,”
Will Yun, a commodity analyst at Seoul-based Hyundai Futures
Corp., said today. “That’s a positive signal for base metals.”  China’s manufacturing is expanding at a faster-than-
forecast pace this month and Americans bought existing homes at
the fastest pace in three years in February.  China  and the U.S.
are the biggest consumers of copper.  Japan’s copper wire and cable shipments may increase 2.2
percent in the next fiscal year, the Japanese Electric Wire and
Cable Makers’ Association said. Shipments, which include exports
and domestic transactions, may rise to 701,000 tons for the year
starting from April 1 from this year’s estimate of 685,700 tons,
the industry group said.  On the LME, aluminum, tin, zinc and lead also increased,
while nickel fell. Copper for May delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$3.4775 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
