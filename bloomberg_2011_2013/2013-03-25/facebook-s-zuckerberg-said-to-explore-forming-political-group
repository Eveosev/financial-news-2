(Corrects location of town hall meeting in third paragraph
of story that ran March 26.)  Facebook Inc. (FB)  Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  is exploring the formation of a
political advocacy group that would focus on topics such as
immigration, the economy, education and scientific research
funding, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Zuckerberg is considering establishing the group with
others in the technology community, according to the person, who
asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been made
public.  Zuckerberg, co-founder of the world’s largest social-
networking website, has been expanding his own role in politics.
Last month, the billionaire welcomed New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to his California home, holding his first political
fundraiser. In 2011, Zuckerberg hosted President  Barack Obama  at
a town-hall meeting at Facebook’s then-headquarters in Palo
Alto,  California , appearing with Obama on stage as he fielded
questions.  Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment
yesterday on whether Zuckerberg was planning to form an advocacy
group.  The news was reported earlier by Politico and the San
Francisco Chronicle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
