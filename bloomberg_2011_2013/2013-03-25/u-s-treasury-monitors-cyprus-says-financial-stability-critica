The U.S. Treasury Department said
it will continue monitoring developments in Cyprus as a bank
restructuring agreement reached today is being implemented.  “The agreement in Cyprus fully protects insured
depositors, which is important, while resolving and
recapitalizing troubled banks,” the Treasury said in an e-
mailed statement today. “It is critical to lay the foundation
for a return to financial stability and growth in Cyprus. The
European Central Bank commitment to provide liquidity is
important in this regard.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
