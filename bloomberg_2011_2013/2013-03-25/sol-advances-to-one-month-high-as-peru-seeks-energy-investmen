Peru ’s sol rose to its strongest
level in a month as the government’s plans to double investment
in its offshore oil and natural gas industry stoked the outlook
for overseas capital entering the country.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.5830 per U.S. dollar at the
close of trading in Lima, according to prices from Datatec. The
central bank said on its website today it bought $120 million 
dollars  for 2.5859 soles each in the spot market.  Peru, which has lined up $20 billion in energy projects
through 2018 in a bid to double oil and gas output, plans to
auction rights to develop 36 new oil and gas blocks, Luis Ortigas, the president of state oil contracting agency
Perupetro, said today in  Lima . The announcement reflects
“continued positive sentiment” toward foreign direct
investment in Peru, said Bret Rosen, a Latin America strategist
at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.  “It is beneficial, not super huge, but part of the overall
FDI story which is important to the sol,” Rosen said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. “They want long-term capital
in the country.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond
due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 3.79 percent at 4:21 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to own
Peruvian government bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell five
basis points to 144 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
