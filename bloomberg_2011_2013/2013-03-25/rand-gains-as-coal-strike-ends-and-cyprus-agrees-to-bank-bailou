The rand appreciated for a third
day after a strike at South Africa’s second-biggest coal miner
ended and Cyprus reached an accord on an international bailout,
sparking demand for riskier assets.  The currency gained as much as 0.5 percent to 9.2572 per
dollar, and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 9.2780 by 9:05 a.m.
in Johannesburg. The rand weakened 1.3 percent last week, its
fifth straight five-day fall. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent
bonds due December 2026 were unchanged at 7.48 percent.  Employees at  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  agreed to return to work
today after a two-week strike that threatened coal supplies to
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state-owned electricity company,
and a repeat of January 2008 blackouts that paralysed mines and
factories. Cyprus agreed to the outlines of an aid package,
paving the way for 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of emergency
loans to stave off the threat of default.  “The Cyprus bailout and the reduced threat of electricity
shortages should result in the rand rallying today,” John Cairns, a currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “We’re also seeing
risk-on in global markets, with equities and other risk
currencies rallying.”  Emerging-market stocks  advanced the most in two weeks and
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index gained for a second day as
prices of metals including copper and platinum rose. Metals and
other mining commodities accounted for 53 percent of South
Africa’s exports in 2012, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
