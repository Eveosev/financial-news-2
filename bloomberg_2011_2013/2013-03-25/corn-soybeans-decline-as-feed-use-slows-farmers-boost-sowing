Corn and soybeans declined for a
second session in Chicago on signs feed use in the U.S. may slow
just as the nation’s farmers prepare to boost plantings.  Feedlots in the U.S.  placed  1.48 million young animals in
February, down from 1.71 million a year earlier and the fewest
for that month since the U.S. government began tracking the data
in 1996, Department of Agriculture data showed March 22. U.S.
farmers may sow the largest area of soybeans ever and plant the
most corn since 1936, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “With normal seasonal conditions, the large area will
support a record corn crop and a sharp increase in inventories
in the year ahead,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in a report today. The
drop in cattle placements in  feedlots  suggest lower feed demand
in months ahead, he said.  Corn for delivery in May fell as much as 0.7 percent to
$7.215 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, adding to a drop
of 0.9 percent on March 22, and was at $7.245 a bushel by 8:50
a.m. local time. Soybeans for delivery in the same month fell
0.6 percent to $14.325 a bushel on volume 57 percent below the
100-day average for that time of day.  Soybeans may be planted in the U.S. on 78.35 million acres
(31.71 million hectares) and corn seeding may reach 97.3 million
acres, according to Bloomberg’s survey. The U.S. government
acreage report is due March 28.  Wheat for May delivery slipped 0.7 percent in  Chicago  to
$7.2475 a bushel in Chicago. Milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris for delivery the same month slipped 0.1 percent to 241
euros ($311.76) a metric ton.  European Union wheat yields are forecast to rise 4.4
percent this year to 5.4 tons per hectare (2.47 acres) from 5.17
tons last year, the bloc’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources
unit wrote in a report today.  Crops in the bloc haven’t suffered winter-kill damage yet,
and winter grains in France and  Germany  have sufficient water
for spring growth, according to MARS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
