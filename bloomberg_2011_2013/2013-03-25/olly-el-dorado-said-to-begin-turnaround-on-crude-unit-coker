HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  began planned
maintenance yesterday on a crude unit, coker and gofiner at its
135,000-barrel-a-day  refinery  in El Dorado, Kansas, according to
a person familiar with operations at the plant.  The work is expected to last until April 15, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isnâ€™t public.  HollyFrontier Chief Operating Officer David Lamp said
during a Feb. 26 conference call that the company expected to
begin a turnaround on the units in the third week of March.  Julia Heidenreich, a Holly spokeswoman in  Dallas , did not
immediately respond to an e-mail for comment on the work.  The El Dorado refinery can process a variety of crudes and
has direct access to the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub that is
the delivery point for crude futures contracts traded on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange.  The refinery has 19,000 barrels a day of coking capacity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
