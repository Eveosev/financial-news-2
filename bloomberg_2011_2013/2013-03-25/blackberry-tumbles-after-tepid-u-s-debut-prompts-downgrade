BlackBerry (BBRY)  shares tumbled for a
second straight day after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its
rating on the struggling smartphone maker, citing a
disappointing debut for the company’s Z10 phone in the U.S.  The  shares  fell 4.6 percent to $14.23 today in New York,
following a decline of 7.7 percent on March 22, the last trading
day. Before the two-day drop, the stock had climbed 36 percent
this year, lifted by optimism that the company’s new lineup
would fuel a turnaround.  The Z10 went on sale last week in the U.S. -- BlackBerry’s
biggest single market -- almost two months after its rollout in
the U.K. and  Canada . The country is “critical for BlackBerry’s
ultimate success,” said Goldman Sachs analyst  Simona Jankowski ,
who found that initial sales at AT&T Inc. and Best Buy Co.
stores were “tepid.”  “Our retail checks at over 20 store locations since March
22, including at AT&T, Best Buy, and RadioShack, revealed a
surprising lack of marketing support and poor positioning of the
product,” she said in a report today. “We also saw limited
advertising around the launch.”  Jankowski cut her rating on the stock to a neutral and now
gives the new BlackBerry lineup a 20 percent chance of being
successful, down from 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
