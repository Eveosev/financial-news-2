Investment Corp. of Dubai, the
emirate’s main state-owned holding company, will pay 2.15
percentage points over Libor to raise $2 billion in a syndicated
loan, a banker familiar with the deal said.  Lenders will be paid additional fees depending on the size
of their commitment, according to the banker, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private. Reuters
reported the story on March 21. A spokeswoman for ICD could not
be reached for a comment.  The five-year syndicated loan includes both conventional
and Islamic portions, ICD said March 18. The proceeds will be
used to repay the $2 billion, five-year portion of a $6 billion
borrowing from August 2008, it said. The remaining $4 billion
was settled in August 2011.  Dubai’s borrowing costs have dropped as the city’s tourism,
hotel and transport industries recover from a property market
crash in 2008 that sent home prices plunging. The emirate’s
government sold $750 million of 10-year Islamic bonds in January
at a yield of 3.875 percent, compared with a rate of 6.45
percent for similar-maturity notes issued in April.  The Dubai government’s $500 million of 6.7 percent bonds
due October 2015 traded at a Z-spread of 190 basis points, or
1.9 percentage points over the benchmark midswap rate, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its $750 million of 7.75 percent
bonds due October 2020 traded at a spread of 246 basis points.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Commercial
Bank of Dubai PSC (CBD) ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  will
help arrange the conventional funding, while  Abu Dhabi Islamic
Bank (ADIB)  PJSC,  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
will oversee the Shariah-compliant segment, ICD said.  ICD was set up in May 2006 and holds stakes in more than 30
companies, including Emirates, the world’s biggest airline by
international passenger traffic, and Emirates NBD, the United
Arab Emirates’ biggest bank by assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
