The euro erased its advance against
the dollar, to trade little changed at $1.2996 as of 7:51 a.m.
London time.  The currency climbed as much as 0.5 percent earlier after
Cyprus agreed to the outlines of an international bailout that
will eliminate the threat of default.  Europe â€™s shared currency was 0.3 percent stronger at 123.04
yen, after advancing 0.9 percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
