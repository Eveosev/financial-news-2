Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. sold a combined 212.4 million
shares in  Samsonite International Sa. (1910) , the world’s largest
branded luggage maker, for about $528 million, according to a
term sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The  stock  was sold at HK$19.28 a share and about 65 percent

this month reported a 71 percent jump in profit from the
previous year to $148.4 million in 2012.  Goldman Sachs is the sole bookrunner and the transaction
was priced on March 25, the terms said. Samsonite fell 1.8
percent to close at HK$19.62 in  Hong Kong  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
