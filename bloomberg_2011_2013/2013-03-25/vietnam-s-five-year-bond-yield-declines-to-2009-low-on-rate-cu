Vietnam’s bonds rose, driving the
five-year yield to the lowest since February 2009, as slowing
inflation allowed the central bank to cut  interest rates  to spur
the economy. The dong was steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam lowered the refinance rate to 8
percent from 9 percent and the discount rate to 6 percent from 7
percent, effective March 26, according to a statement on its
website today. It also reduced a rate cap on dong deposits due
in a month to less than a year to 7.5 percent from 8 percent.
Inflation decelerated to 6.64 percent in March, the slowest pace
since September 2012, according to figures released March 23 by
Hanoi-based General Statistics Office.  “Demand for  government bonds  is still energetic,” Pham
Luu Hung, associate director of institutional research and
investment advisory at  Saigon Securities Inc. (SSI) , wrote in a note
today. “Lower bond yields reflected short-term inflation
stabilization and lower deposit rates.”  The five-year yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 8.92 percent, the lowest level since Feb.
25, 2009, according to a daily fixing from lenders compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,945 per dollar as of 3:50 p.m. in
Hanoi, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The State Bank of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since December 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
