Japanese household assets rose at
the fastest pace in five years last quarter as the weaker yen
fueled a stock market rally.  Assets rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier to 1,547
trillion yen ($16 trillion) in the final three months of 2012,
the steepest gain since 2007, a  Bank of Japan (8301)  quarterly report
showed today. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose more than 17
percent over the period.  Rising household wealth may boost consumer sentiment in an
economy that emerged from its third recession in five years last
quarter, helping BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda in his efforts to
end deflation. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on March 18 raised its
growth forecast for the fiscal year starting next month to 2.3
percent from 2.1 percent.  “There is a sense of optimism in  Japan  and that’s
something I haven’t seen for several years,” said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management
Co. in  Tokyo . “The increase in assets should give a tailwind to
 consumer spending  and the economy.”  Net household assets -- which excludes housing loans and
borrowing through consumer finance -- rose 4.4 percent to 1,193
trillion yen, the highest since 2007, today’s BOJ report showed.  Fifty-five percent of household assets were in cash, the
report showed, little changed from the previous quarter.  Consumer confidence  in Japan rose to a 5 1/2 year high in
February. Support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet was at
69 percent in March, according to a poll published in the Nikkei
newspaper today, down one percentage point from February.  Nikkei’s Gain  The Nikkei closed 1.9 percent higher in Tokyo, up from the
first weekly drop in six weeks, after European Union finance
ministers approved a bailout agreement for Cyprus. The yen was
0.3 percent lower at 94.79 per dollar at 3:01 p.m., extending
its nearly 18 percent fall since the start of last quarter.  The BOJ’s holdings of Japanese  government bonds  rose to a
record 115 trillion yen last quarter, or 12 percent of all
outstanding JGBs, today’s report showed. Foreign investors held
8.8 percent of the assets, or 84 trillion yen, down from a
record 9.1 percent in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
