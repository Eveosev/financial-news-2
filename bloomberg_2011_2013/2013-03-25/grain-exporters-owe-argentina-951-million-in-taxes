Cargill  Inc. and Bunge Ltd. are
among grain exporters that owe the Argentine government $951
million in taxes and won’t be eligible for a reduced  interest
rate  under a payment plan unveiled by the government today.  Argentina  will reduce monthly interest charges to 1.35
percent from 2 percent for some unpaid taxes that were due Feb.
28. The payments can be made in as many as 120 monthly
installments, the government said.  “Grain exporters have been excluded as they were
disingenuous and therefore don’t deserve a plan to regularize
their situation,” Ricardo Echegaray, head of Argentina’s
Federal Administration of Public Revenue, known as AFIP, said
today at a press conference in Buenos Aires.  The second-largest South American economy has boosted
federal tax collection to 31.8 percent last year from 16.5
percent of gross domestic product in 2002, according to the
Buenos Aires-based Center for the Implementation of Public
Policies Promoting Equity and Growth.  The nation is seeking full repayment with interest from
Cargill ($228 million),  Bunge (BG)  ($126.3 million),  Molinos Rio de
la Plata SA  ($197 million), Louis Dreyfus Corp. ($141 million),
Nidera SA ($132 million), Vicentin SAIC ($62 million), Aceitera
General Deheza SA ($48 million) and Oleaginosa Moreno Hermanos
Sacifia ($17 million).  Andres Alcaraz, a spokesman for Camara de la Industria
Aceitera de la Republica Argentina, the nation’s association of
grains exporters, declined to comment on Echegaray’s statement.
Cargill and Bunge didn’t respond to calls seeking comment.  The local unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, which last week was
accused of tax evasion of 224 million pesos ($44 million), won’t
be allowed to apply either as it faces a criminal case for
alleged  money laundering , Echegaray said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
