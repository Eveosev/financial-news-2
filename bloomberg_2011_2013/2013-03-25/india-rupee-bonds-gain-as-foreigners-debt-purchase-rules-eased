India’s rupee and sovereign bonds
due 2022 rose the most in more than a week after the government
said it will make it easier for foreign funds to buy local-
currency debt.  All restrictions and sub-limits governing purchases of
government and corporate notes will be removed from April 1,
while keeping the overall cap at $25 billion for sovereign debt
and $51 billion for securities issued by companies, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi on March 23.
A new “on tap” system will replace the existing auction
procedure for foreign investment in corporate bonds, he said.  “The government’s step to simplify the investment
framework for foreign institutional investors is positive,”
said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in
Singapore. “Over the medium term, this should result in inflows
into Indian local-currency bonds.”  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 54.1800 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest gain since March 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.63 percent.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point to 7.95 percent, the first decrease since March 15,
according to the central bank’s trading system. Benchmark 10-
year bonds yield a  premium  of 599 basis points over similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries.  ‘Greater Worry’  The shortfall in India’s current account, the broadest
measure of trade, is expected to be “significantly higher” in
the year through March 2013 than the previous period’s record
4.2 percent of gross domestic product, Reserve Bank of India
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Feb. 11. The debt-buying measures
will help finance the nation’s current-account deficit,
according to Moody’s Analytics.  This gap is a “greater worry” than the fiscal shortfall,
Chidambaram said on Feb. 28. “This year, and perhaps next year
too, we have to find over $75 billion to finance the current-
account deficit.”  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.26 per
dollar, compared with 55.42 on March 22, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.17 versus 55.39. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
