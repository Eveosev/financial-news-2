Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud traveled to  Turkey  in his first trip abroad to bolster
defense and trade ties.  Turkish President Abdullah Gul welcomed Mohamoud in a
military ceremony today, state-run Anatolia news agency said.
Mohamoud was elected as president in September, marking the 16th
attempt to establish central government since ouster of former
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  Mohamoud told reporters yesterday before leaving the
capital Mogadishu that his trip was designed to strengthen
military, technical and economic ties. He’s scheduled to meet
Turkish businessmen in Istanbul on Dec. 6 and 7, Anatolia said,
citing the presidential office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
