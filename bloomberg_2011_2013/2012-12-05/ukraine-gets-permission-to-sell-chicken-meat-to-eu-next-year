Ukraine  received permission from the
European Union to export eggs, egg products, poultry and game
starting next year, according to the European Commission office
in country’s capital, Kiev.  The EU “agreed to start export of these products,” said
David Stulik, the EU spokesman in Ukraine, by phone from Kiev
today. “This is a final stage of a process that started several
years ago.”  The EU started inspecting Ukrainian poultry producers in
2009. The former Soviet republic started negotiations on a free
trade agreement with the EU in 2008.  “This is a very positive news,” said Anastasiya Sobotyuk,
head of investor relations at  Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA (MHPC) , a
Ukrainian poultry producer and agriculture company. “As soon as
Ukraine will be ready, we will be able to star shipping fast. We
can start exporting poultry to the EU starting from the
summer.”  Ukraine also will have to provide a program to control
salmonella, the state Veterinary and Phyto Sanitary Service said
in a statement on its website.  “After this formal confirmation, a couple of procedural
steps need to be made,” Stulik said. “When this is complete,
exports from Ukraine can start.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
