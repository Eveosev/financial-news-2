European Union regulators are 
seeking powers to investigate government subsidies granted to 
entire industries under a proposed overhaul of state aid rules
published today.  The so-called sector inquiries would enable regulators to
examine how aid affects industries such as postal services or
health care, the European Commission said in an e-mailed
statement. The Brussels-based authority is seeking to revamp
rules governing its role as a watchdog for  state support  to
companies.  “The proposals will streamline our decision-making and
refocus enforcement on the aid that really matters,” EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in the statement.  The commission wants to speed up inquiries and gain the
right to seek more information from companies under threat of
fines. It also wants the right to ignore some of the 300-plus
complaints it receives over state aid every year.  Regulators are seeking to exempt from review some aid for
broadband Internet and transport infrastructure, innovation,
natural disaster compensation, forestry and cultural activities.  EU governments and lawmakers will examine the proposals
before they can enter into force, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
