Pakistan , the world’s fourth-largest
rice shipper, may miss a target to boost sales by 8 percent this
year as surging shipments from India increase competition, an
exporters’ group said.  Sales may fall below the 3.72 million metric tons posted in
the year ended June 30 and less than the 4 million tons targeted
earlier, Jawed Ali Ghori, chairman of the Rice Exporters
Association of Pakistan, said in an interview in Karachi.
Exports have slumped 25 percent in the first four months this
year, he said.  Rice gained 3.6 percent in  Chicago  this year compared with
a 31 percent jump in wheat and a 16 percent rally in corn. Rice
export prices, tracked by the United Nations, declined 3.6
percent in the 12 months to October, as shippers including
 India , Vietnam and Pakistan competed for market share, curbing
 food costs  and preventing a global food crisis.  “The new crop may push prices further which will make
selling the commodity difficult,” Ghori said. “It will be
difficult to match last year’s exports by value or volume.”  Pakistan’s rice exports including, aromatic basmati
variety, fetched $2.2 billion in 2011-2012, according to the
shippers’ group. Sales plunged to 645,333 tons valued at $376
million in the four months through October, Ghori said.  “Basmati sales will decline this year because of rising
competition from India, which is creating a pricing problem for
us in the international market,” Ghori said.  Record Output  Exports from India will total 7.25 million tons in
2012-2013, compared with 10.4 million tons the previous year,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Global milled
rice production will rise to an all-time high of 486 million
tons in 2012, increasing inventories to a record 170 million
tons, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization said
in a report last month. Opening stockpiles for 2012-2013 will
climb to the highest in a decade, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  Pakistan’s rice harvest is set to climb 9 percent to 6.5
million tons this year as increased use of a hybrid seed boosts
yields, Ghori said. The harvest of the new crop started last
month, he said.  Pakistan will continue to export rice to traditional buyers
such as Somalia and  Kenya  and also to  China  and the  Philippines ,
Ghori said. The Philippines will buy 250,000 tons from Pakistan
under a World Trade Organization quota and traders have already
sold 120,000 tons to China last month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
