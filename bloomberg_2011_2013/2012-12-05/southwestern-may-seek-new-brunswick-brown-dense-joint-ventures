Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN) , which
pioneered natural-gas development from Arkansas’ Fayetteville
Shale, may enter into joint ventures next year for its New
Brunswick acreage in Canada and Brown Dense holdings in the U.S.  Joint ventures in the oil and gas business can be used to
fund projects or share risk, Southwestern Chief Executive
Officer Steve Mueller said in an interview at a Capital One
Southcoast energy conference in New Orleans yesterday.  “We’ve got projects that fall into both of those
categories, whether it’s a really high wildcat project in New
Brunswick where we have 2.5 million acres, or if it’s just
trying to figure out if the Brown Dense works,” Mueller said.  The Houston-based company may seek transactions on New
Brunswick and Brown Dense properties that include selling a
piece of the holdings or creating a structure that involves a
percentage of wells or acreage, Mueller said.  Southwestern had more than 500,000 net acres in the Brown
Dense formation in Louisiana and  Arkansas  as of a November
company  presentation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
