South African wheat fell to the
lowest in two weeks as the rand strengthened against the dollar,
making imports cheaper.  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract,
closed 0.6 percent lower at 3,749 rand ($427) a metric ton on
the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, the lowest
since Nov. 21.  The rand advanced 0.3 percent to 8.7709 a dollar by 1:35
p.m. after speculation that the central bank will leave  interest
rates  unchanged.  “The rand strengthened and that is why the wheat prices
are down today,” Kallie van Heerden, a trader at brokerage
 Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd. , said by phone from Johannesburg.
“These are good levels to price the wheat at and also good
prices to sell, so everyone is happy.”  South Africa  is a net importer of the grain and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer after  Ethiopia . The nation is the
region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and Sudan, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in the same month fell 0.3 percent
to 2,454 rand a ton, while the yellow variety for delivery in
July, rose 0.4 percent to 2,350 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
