Nautilus Inc. (NLS)  closed at its highest
price in more than two years after the maker of gym equipment
introduced a new machine that protects a person’s joints during
exercise.  The  stock  rose 8.6 percent to $3.80 in New York, the
highest level since March 2010. The Vancouver, Washington-based
company’s stock has more than doubled this year.  Nautilus, which counts investor Norman H. Pessin as its
 largest  shareholder, released the Schwinn 520 Reclined
Elliptical machine today. The recumbent device is designed to
simulate a “natural walking motion” and provide an effective
workout that “relieves pressure from the joints,” according to
the company’s statement.  The new machine joins Nautilus products such as the
CoreBody Reformer, the Peak Fit System and the Bowflex
TreadClimber, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Cazenave said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
