Colombia’s  exports  rose 5.8 percent
to $4.99 billion in October compared with the same month last
year, the government statistics agency said today in a report on
its website.  In the same period a month earlier, exports rose 6.1
percent in September from the same month last year.  The central bank cited weak demand for the Andean nation’s
exports in its decision to cut interest rates a quarter point to
4.5 percent last month.  The peso has gained 7 percent this year, the sixth biggest
gain among 25 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
