Colombian peso bond yields fell for a
third day as speculation mounted that inflation slowed, boosting
demand for the fixed-rate securities.  Inflation was 0.15 percent in November, slowing from 0.16
percent in the prior month, according to the median forecast of
29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics
agency is due to release the report today after markets close.
The central bank has an inflation target of 3 percent, plus or
minus one percentage point.  “Right now the market will be very focused on inflation,”
said Daniel Lozano, the head analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in
Bogota. “Today’s number will signal how prices are set to end
the year, and if it’s lower than expected we could see inflation
fall below 3 percent.”  The yield on the government’s 10 percent bonds due in July
2024 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to a
record low 5.94 percent, according to the central bank. The peso
appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,811.73 per  U.S. dollar  at the close
in Bogota.  Colombian inflation is under control, Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  said in a speech today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
