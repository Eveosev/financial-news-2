U.S. aerospace  sales will rise 2.8
percent to $223.6 billion next year, led by demand for
commercial aircraft, an industry trade group predicted.  The Aerospace Industries Association today projected the
increase from an estimated $217.9 billion in revenue this year.
An 11 percent boost to commercial airplane sales in 2013 would
make up for a decline in orders for military jets and missiles
amid cuts to defense spending, the group said in its year-end
review and annual forecast.  “The overall projections for 2013 are generally positive
–- excluding the domestic military market -– and illustrate the
health of the industry,” the Arlington, Virginia-based group
said in its report. “The defense sector appears to be the most
problematic in 2013 and beyond, particularly with respect to the
domestic market.”  The association, with members including  Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT) ,  Boeing (BA)  Co.,  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , and  Raytheon Co. (RTN) , has
led the U.S. defense industry in lobbying against Pentagon
budget cuts. The Defense Department’s projected budget over 10
years already has been cut by $487 billion. The agency may lose
an additional $500 billion in the next decade if Congress and
the White House fail to agree on a plan to avert automatic
budget cuts and tax increases before the end of this month.  The trade group’s projections were based on the assumption
that the automatic cuts, known as sequestration, won’t take
effect.  In the longer term, the U.S. may have to increase its air
and naval power to support the Pentagon’s strategic shift toward
the Asia-Pacific region, the group said.  Air Traffic  Global air traffic is estimated to grow at an annual rate
of 5 percent for the next 20 years, faster than the anticipated
rate of economic growth, which will drive airlines to take
deliveries of 34,000 new airplanes by 2031, with a value of
about $4.5 trillion, the group said.  Boeing and Airbus SAS, a unit of European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co. are the world’s largest markers of
commercial planes.  Demand for general-aviation aircraft and  business jets  is
projected to recover during the five years ending in 2017.  Larger business jets will lead sales, “particularly in the
 Middle East  and  Asia ,” the group said. “ China  is a prominent
growth market and it has been estimated that by the end of the
decade, the nation could account for 20 percent of all global
business jet deliveries, up from today’s seven percent,” the
organization said.  Export Sales  General Dynamics Corp. (GD) ’s Gulfstream unit makes the G450 and
G550 large-cabin business jets.  Sales of military aircraft -- including fighters,
transports and helicopters -- may decline 2.4 percent to $56.8
billion in 2013 compared with 2012, the group said. Missile
sales are projected to decline 5.6 percent, while sales of space
and other defense equipment will increase slightly, the trade
group said.  Net exports of aerospace products grew 14 percent to $63.5
billion in 2012, led by commercial airplane sales, the
organization said.  Overseas demand for U.S. military equipment “is also
anticipated to remain strong for the next few years,” the group
said, citing threats posed by  Iran ’s and China’s growing defense
spending.  The group said the U.S. must “resolve export issues” to
allow foreign sales of unmanned aerial vehicles to avoid losing
the market to other exporters.  Overall, aerospace orders for 2012 may fall 2.5 percent to
$241.9 billion, and the backlog may grow 5.1 percent to $526.5
billion, the association said.  Even with job cuts in U.S. defense work, employment in the
 aerospace industry  may increase less than 1 percent to 629,000
compared with 2011, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
