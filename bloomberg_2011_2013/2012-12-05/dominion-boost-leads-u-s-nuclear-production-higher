Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  returned the
799-megawatt Surry 2 reactor to full power in  Virginia , lifting
U.S. nuclear-power production for a ninth day, the longest
stretch of gains since May.  U.S. generation  increased 2.4 percent to 88,703 megawatts,
or 87 percent of capacity, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 5.8 percent
less than a  year earlier  with 12 of the 104 reactors offline.  Surry 2, about 17 miles (27 kilometers) northwest of
Newport News, ran at full power, compared with 38 percent of
capacity yesterday. The unit resumed service after a refueling
outage that began Oct. 31, commission  filings  showed.  During the outage, crews inspected the service water piping
system and the reactor vessel head, Rick Zuercher, a company
spokesman based near Richmond, said in a phone interview. “We
did numerous inspections and maintenance activities related to
refueling.”  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s McGuire 2 reactor in North Carolina
operated at 74 percent of power from 45 percent yesterday. The
1,100-megawatt unit slowed last week after a turbine trip, said
Valerie Patterson, a spokeswoman based at the plant.  Output at Surry 2 and McGuire 2 led nuclear production
higher by 3.6 percent to 25,613 megawatts in the Southeast, the
highest level since Oct. 7. Generation advanced 1.7 percent to
24,792 megawatts in the Northeast.  Refueling, Repairs  Constellation Energy Group Inc. boosted the Nine Mile Point
1 reactor in New York to 80 percent of capacity. The 621-
megawatt unit, which shut Nov. 30 for turbine repairs, operated
at 75 percent of power at 8 a.m. yesterday, according to Jill Lyon, a company spokeswoman based in Scriba, New York.  Oyster Creek 1, an  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  plant near Atlantic City,
New Jersey, was at 99 percent of power early today, up from 74
percent yesterday. The reactor, which has the capacity to
generate 619 megawatts, is accelerating to full power after
completing a refueling shutdown that began Oct. 21, said Suzanne
D’Ambrosio, a company spokeswoman based at the plant.  Nuclear-power production in the West gained 3 percent to
19,938 megawatts, the highest since Oct. 1.  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ’s Diablo
Canyon 1 led the increase as the company returned the 1,151-
megawatt unit to full power today from 50 percent yesterday.
Output in the Midwest increased to  18,361 megawatts .  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
