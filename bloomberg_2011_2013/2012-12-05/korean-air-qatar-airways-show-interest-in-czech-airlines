Korean Air Lines and Qatar Airways
showed interest in Ceske Aerolinie AS, the Czech national
carrier, Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said.  The two airlines responded “positively” to letters sent
out to the world’s largest carriers as part of CSA’s search for
a strategic partner, Kalousek said today in Prague. The
government expects to receive binding bids for the CSA stake,
including the price, by the end of February and the government
should choose a buyer in early April, Kalousek said.  Any agreement needs approval by the European Commission,
Kalousek said. The government doesn’t expect any complications
because the sale fulfills European watchdog conditions for state
support, Kalousek said.  The government already scrapped the sale of the airline in
2009 after receiving a sole bid from Unimex Group and charter
carrier Travel Service and said it would overhaul CSA instead.
CSA, which reduced its fleet, staff and services, is now part of
Cesky Aeroholding AS, which also operates Letiste Praha AS.  The government indicated earlier that it will sell only as
much as 49 percent to a carrier outside of  Europe .  Officials expect to receive tentative bids and plans for
the further development of CSA from the carriers at the end of
January, according to Kalousek. CSA also settled law disputes
with Prague-based airline Travel Service about charter flights
before the sale, Kalousek added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
