Canada has the option to extend the
Dec. 10 deadline for deciding on  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s bid for  Nexen Inc (NXY) ,
Industry Minister Christian said today, adding that his comments
shouldn’t be interpreted as a signal about the timing of an
announcement.  Dec. 10 “is the deadline. It could be extended, but once
again, I won’t speculate,” Paradis told reporters after giving
a speech in Ottawa. “It’s too market-sensitive.”  “I don’t want to send any signals,” Paradis said. “Don’t
interpret nothing from what I’m saying here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
