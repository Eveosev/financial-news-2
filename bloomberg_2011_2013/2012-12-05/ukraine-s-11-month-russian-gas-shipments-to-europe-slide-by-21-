Ukraine’s shipments of Russian gas to
 Europe  fell 21 percent in the first 11 months of 2012 from a
year earlier, according to the state pipeline operator.  Natural-gas volumes slid to 72.6 billion cubic meters from
92.2 billion, Kiev-based DP Ukrtransgaz said in a  statement 
today on its website. Volumes sank 36 percent to 5.8 billion
cubic meters in November from the same month a year ago, the
operator said, citing warmer weather in European countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
