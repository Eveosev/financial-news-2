Greece  invited investors to build,
manage and operate four sewage treatment plants in the greater
Athens region, according to the countryâ€™s Development Ministry.  The contracts are budgeted for a total of 350 million euros
($458 million), the ministry said today in an e-mailed
statement. Investors would operate the water treatment plants
for 27 years, with European Union financing funding 40 percent
to 60 percent of the cost of each facility.  Greece is also inviting investors to build five more sewage
treatment plants elsewhere in the country, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
