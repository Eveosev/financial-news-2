BlueMountain Capital Management LLC
predicts returns in “the mid-teens” from the riskiest pieces
of junk-loan pools at a time when corporate bonds are paying
record-low yields.  “We still like CLO equity,” Stephen Siderow,
BlueMountain’s president, said at the Bloomberg Hedge Fund
Summit in  New York  today, referring to the portions of
collateralized loan obligations that are the first to absorb
losses. “We like it because we like the loan asset class
relative to unsecured bonds.”  CLOs pool together high-yield, high-risk loans and slice
them into securities of varying risk and return. Leveraged loans
have gained 9.7 percent this year, according to the Standard &
Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan  index .  Yields on high-yield bonds dropped to a low of 6.8 percent
on Oct. 18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
 data , as the  Federal Reserve ’s stimulus measures push investors
into lower-rated debt. The gap between yields on the bonds and
loans, which are usually paid first in a bankruptcy, has fallen
to less than half its historic average, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
