The Czech banking industry would
withstand an escalating crisis in  Europe  and the domestic
economy even as some lenders would need a capital injection,
central bank stress tests showed.  The Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said it tested banks
under two outlooks, including economic developments according to
the bank’s own forecast, and a stress scenario assuming “a
long-lasting and significantly deeper decline in economic
activity” over three years caused by trends in the euro area
and tighter fiscal austerity.  “The capital adequacy of the industry as a whole would
stay above the 8 percent regulatory minimum even in the
significant-stress scenario, which combines very negative
developments in the domestic and foreign economies caused by an
escalation of the financial crisis in Eurozone countries,”
according to the central bank.  The  Czech Republic  didn’t have to bail out any banks during
the global financial crisis as the amount of toxic assets
accounted for less than 1 percent of all assets and deposits
exceeded loans, according to central bank data. The economy is
affected by changes in demand from the euro area, which takes
about 70 percent of all Czech exports.  The capital level of “several” lenders would fall below
the regulatory minimum and they would need a capital injection
totaling 18.7 billion koruna ($971 million), or 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product, in the recession scenario that assumes
an economic contraction in every quarter of the next three
years, the bank said.  The bank didn’t name which institutions incorporated in the
Czech Republic would need to increase their capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
