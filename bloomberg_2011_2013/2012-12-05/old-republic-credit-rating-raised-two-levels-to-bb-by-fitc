Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) , the
insurer that reached an agreement with a North Carolina
regulator related to its mortgage guarantee business, had its
credit rating lifted two levels to BB+ by Fitch Ratings.  The deal with North Carolina regulators “will likely allow
ORI to avoid a covenant breach and related debt acceleration,”
since a mortgage insurance unit is more likely to avoid
bankruptcy or insolvency, Fitch said today in a statement about
the Chicago-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
