Keegan Resources Inc. (KGN) , a Canadian
company that explores for gold in  Ghana , agreed to acquire  PMI
Gold Corp. (PMV)  for C$339 million ($341 million) to add properties in
the West African nation.  Investors will get 0.21 of a Keegan share for each PMI
share, the Vancouver-based companies said today in a statement.
The new company will be called Asanko Gold Inc. Keegan’s offer
represents an 11 percent premium, based on the companies’
closing share prices yesterday.  The combined company will have about $340 million in cash
and two Ghanaian mines within 15 kilometers (9 miles) of each
other. PMI’s Obotan project is expected to produce about 200,000
ounces annually starting in 2014 and Keegan’s Esaase will
produce 150,000 to 200,000 ounces by 2017.  “We expect significant synergies through the joint
development of Obotan and Esaase,” Keegan Chief Executive
Officer Peter Breese said in the statement. Breese will be CEO
of the new company and PMI CEO Collin Ellison will become
president.  Keegan declined 4.4 percent to C$3.74 at 9:34 a.m. in
Toronto. PMI gained 8.1 percent to 80 Canadian cents, the
biggest intraday increase since Aug. 28. The shares had dropped
21 percent this year through yesterday.  Keegan’s financial adviser on the deal is Canaccord Genuity
and its legal adviser is McMillan LLP. PMI is being advised by
Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. and Stikeman Elliott LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
