The U.S. cleared 35 drugs for sale in
fiscal 2012, matching the total for those that made it to market
in the previous year, regulators said.  The Food and Drug Administration approvals of novel
medicines included 10 cancer medicines, as well as treatments
for cystic fibrosis and HIV, a meningitis vaccine and the first
cord blood product, the agency said today in a report.  “Most of the drugs were approved for U.S. patients before
they were available in other countries, and the efficiency of
the drug review process continued to grow,” the FDA said in the
report.  The agency was the first to approve 75 percent, or 24 of 32
drugs cleared in other countries, according to the report. Of
the 35 new drugs in the fiscal year, 77 percent were approved
without the need for additional information that lengthens
review time.  For the calendar year, U.S. regulators have approved  31
novel new drugs , beating the FDA’s seven-year high of 30 last
year, according to the agency’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
