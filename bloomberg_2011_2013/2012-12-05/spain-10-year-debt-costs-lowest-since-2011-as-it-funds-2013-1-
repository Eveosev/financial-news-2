Spain  auctioned 10-year debt at the
lowest in more than a year as the nation raises funds for 2013,
buying Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy time to mull a bailout.  The Treasury sold its  10-year benchmark  at 5.29 percent,
the least since September 2011 and down from 5.458 percent on
Oct. 18. The treasury also sold its three-year benchmark bond at
3.39 percent, compared with 3.617 percent on Nov. 22 and 2019
bonds at 3.39 percent. The Treasury sold 4.25 billion euros
($5.6 billion) of the securities, shy of its maximum target of
4.5 billion euros.  Demand was 2.29 times the amount offered for the 2022 notes
up from 1.88 times on Oct. 18 and twice the amount of 2015
bonds, down from 2.09 times on Nov. 22. The bid-to-cover ratio
was 2.46 for the 2019 bonds.  Spain has retained  market access  and avoided a sovereign
bailout as it frontloaded sales when borrowing costs were at
their lowest earlier this year. Its 10-year debt rose a fourth
day yesterday after European finance chiefs meeting in Brussels
voiced confidence a Greek government bond buyback will be
successful this week.  ECB Policy  The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond rose 4 basis points
after the sale to 5.344 percent at 10:58 a.m. in  Madrid . That
compares with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 25, a
day before European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  first
signaled the ECB’s willingness to intervene in markets when he
pledged to do whatever it takes to defend the euro. The spread
with similar German maturities widened to 396 basis points.  “The lower yield on the 10-year note is a further
illustration of the enduring signalling effect of the ECB’s
bond-buying program,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of
Spiro Sovereign Strategy in  London , said in an e-mail. “The
rally in Spanish debt not only looks overdone but is becoming
more and more detached from economic fundamentals.”  Rajoy continues to deliberate over whether to seek aid from
 Europe ’s ESM rescue-fund, a move that could trigger ECB
purchases on secondary debt markets. A rescue would be the
second after his government agreed to a 100 billion-euro  credit
line  for the nation’s banks in June.  “The importance of central bank policy cannot be
understated as yields have fallen markedly following several
initiatives over the last year,” Peter Goves, a London-based
fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc., wrote in an e-mailed
report yesterday. “The real test for non-core markets will be
when issuance picks up in the first quarter next year.”  The Treasury is scheduled to return to the markets three
times this month, on Dec. 11, Dec. 13 and Dec. 18, as it faces a
2013 gross debt issuance program of 207 billion euros, up from
192 billion planned for 2012. The figure has yet to be updated
with the regions’ needs, estimated at a minimum 23 billion euros
by Rajoy’s ruling  People’s Party . The government pledged the
state will fund them as long as they remain shut out of markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
