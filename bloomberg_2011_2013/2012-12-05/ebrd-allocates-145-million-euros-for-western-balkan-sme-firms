The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development has allocated 145 million euros ($190 million)
to a new fund to finance small- and medium-size firms in the
western Balkans as the region struggles to spur economic growth.  The Western Balkan Enterprise Development and Innovation
Facility will “promote the emergence and growth of innovative
and high-potential companies” and “the creation of a regional
venture capital market,” the London-based lender said in an e-
mail today.  The fund will provide equity financing, capital for
expansion and development, and loan guarantees to lower the cost
of borrowing at small- and medium-size companies, the bank said.
The 145 million euros from the EU, international financial
institutions, beneficiaries and bilateral donors will eventually
amount to more than 300 million euros in direct financing, the
bank said.  International lenders, including the EBRD, the European
Investment Bank and the World Bank, agreed Nov. 8 on plan for
eastern  Europe  for loans and investment in private and public-
sector projects including infrastructure, corporations and
financial services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
