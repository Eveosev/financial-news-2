Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a water
purification and ultraviolet technology solutions provider for
municipalities, was awarded a UV disinfection systems contract
by the Los Angeles water and power department.  The contract for the L.A. aqueduct filtration plant and the
Los Angeles reservoir from the second-largest U.S. water
provider is valued at $12.4 million, the company said today in a
statement. The water agency serves 3.9 million residents.  The disinfection systems apply a controlled dose of UV
light to drinking water without the use of chemicals, altering
the DNA of harmful organisms and rendering them unable to
reproduce and cause harm, Pittburgh-based Calgon said.  It’s Calgon’s second UV contract from the largest cities in
 California  following the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission’s Tesla treatment facility that opened last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
