Daniel Rossetto, managing director of
Climate Mundial Ltd., a London-based consulting company that
works in carbon markets, comments on the pace of United Nations
climate-protection talks. Negotiations are taking place this
week in Doha, the Qatari capital. He wrote yesterday by e-mail.  On accountability:  “There is no accountability among the envoys and
negotiators. How many of them return home to receive criticism
from their governments if they have not secured a global
agreement? Look at the track record: we had a Bali road map in
2007, which was supposed to result in a comprehensive global
agreement in 2009, but this failed. The Copenhagen pledges have
equally not materialized. Now we are being asked to pin our
hopes on a 2011 Durban mandate to negotiate a global agreement
starting in 2020, but this will not come until 2015. That’s
analogous with the pace at which the glaciers of the world
themselves are receding.”  On the need for focus on adaptation to climate change:  “Fairly soon, unless something radical changes in the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change forum, we will need to
shift our efforts to adaptation rather than mitigation. There
will no longer be justification to continue pouring resources
into mitigation if we are not delivering what the scientists
tell us needs to be done to deal with the climate risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
