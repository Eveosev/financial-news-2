U.S.  stocks  advanced, following a two-day decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid optimism lawmakers will reach a budget agreement before the end of the year and after economic data topped estimates.  Plains Exploration & Production Co. and  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  surged at least 23 percent as  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  agreed to  acquire  them for about $9 billion. Citigroup Inc. gained 6.3 percent on plans to eliminate more than 11,000 jobs and pull back from some  emerging markets .  Apple Inc.

The market will continue to react to any news in connection with a potential resolution.”  Equities rose as a few dozen Republicans joined a bipartisan call to break the impasse between President Barack Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner  over taxes for the highest- earning Americans, signing a letter calling for exploration of “all  options. (COST) ” Obama told a business group that “nobody wants to get this done more than me” and lawmakers probably could solve the budget debate in about a week if Republicans move.  Tax Rates  U.S. stocks fell yesterday after Obama held his ground about raising tax rates for the highest-income Americans. The S&P 500 has slipped 1.3 percent since Obama was re-elected on Nov. 6 as he seeks a deal with Republican lawmakers to prevent more than $600 billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts from coming into effect next year.

Service industries in the U.S. unexpectedly grew at a faster pace in November.  Jobs Report  This week’s Labor Department report will provide further clues on the outlook for the economy. Private payrolls increased by 90,000 in November, while unemployment held at 7.9 percent, according to the median of economist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Overall hiring including government jobs probably climbed by 87,000 after rising 171,000 in October.  “The market is looking for any semblance of economic growth,” John Augustine, who helps manage $26.1 billion as chief market strategist at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, said in a phone interview. “Stocks are going to ebb and flow from day to day on those prospects.”  Seven out of  10 groups  in the  S&P 500  rose today as utility and financial shares had the biggest gains.

Facebook will replace Infosys Ltd. before the start of trading on Dec. 12, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said, about seven months after the company’s $16 billion IPO.  The waiting period for entry into the index was a negotiating point with Facebook as it considered listing on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, a person with knowledge of the matter said in April.  Technology stocks in the S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent for the biggest decline among 10 groups.  Apple dropped 6.4 percent to $538.79. China Mobile Ltd. agreed to carry the Lumia 920T, a device based on Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone 8 software. While Apple has agreements with China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. to sell iPhones, the company hasn’t yet forged a deal with China Mobile in the world’s largest mobile-phone market.  ‘Technical Breakdown’  Apple’s slide also may be the result of traders predicting a drop after the stock failed to sustain a recent rally, a “classic technical breakdown,” according to  Gene Munster , an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos.  Munster said new so-called margin rules also may have been put in place by some investors that could limit how many Apple shares a firm can own.
