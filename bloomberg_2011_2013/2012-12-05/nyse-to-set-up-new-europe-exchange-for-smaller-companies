NYSE Euronext (NYX) , which runs bourses in
Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon, said it will set up a new
pan-European exchange for small and medium-sized companies.  The operator of the  New York  Stock Exchange will create a
subsidiary and fold in smaller companies listed on its Euronext
and Alternext markets, according to an e-mailed statement today.
There are about 800 companies from the four countries in which
NYSE Euronext operates in  Europe , the exchange said. It plans to
allocate 50 employees and 18 million euros ($24 million) to the
annual operating budget of the new unit.  NYSE is committed to “revitalizing market financing” for
small and medium-sized businesses, Dominique Cerutti, president
and deputy chief executive officer of NYSE, said in the
statement.  In November, NYSE Euronext reported a smaller decline in
third-quarter profit than estimated as cost cuts and lower taxes
partly offset a slump in trading. Cerutti said in an interview
in July that the company is seeking to expand clearing services
and is reviewing ways to cut costs after its failed merger with
 Deutsche Boerse AG. (DB1)   To contact the reporter on this story:
