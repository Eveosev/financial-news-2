Germany  may face a shortage of power-
generation capacity during the country’s peak-demand winter
season, according to TransnetBW, the grid operator owned by
utility  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG. (EBK)   Since the shutdown of eight nuclear reactors last year,
including two in TransnetBW’s network in southwest Germany, the
nation’s grid operators are struggling to maintain stability in
periods of high demand as intermittent renewable energy replaces
the more stable-running atomic plants,  TransnetBW  Managing
Director Rainer Joswig said today in an interview.  “After the phase-out of the two nuclear reactors in our
grid and further reactors in the neighboring networks, there is
a lack of power generation in the system,” Joswig said in
Wendlingen, Germany. “The situation is turning unpleasant.”  The decommissioning of the Philippsburg 1 and
Neckarwestheim 1 plants, with a total generation capacity of
1,766 megawatts, was part of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s nuclear
exit strategy in the wake of last year’s disaster at the
Fukushima plant in  Japan . A cold spell in February brought
Germany’s power grids close to collapse after some gas plants
needed to shut down power generation due to a lack of fuel.  “During critical situations, the net will face the same
difficulties as last winter,” Joswig said. “The system is the
same and the problems will be the same.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
