Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
plans to announce a port improvement program to attract about 55
billion reais ($26 billion) of investment by 2030 and will offer
licenses for three terminals next year, according to two
government officials familiar with the plan.  The plan, which will affect 20 ports, will increase
capacity and cut costs, said the people, who asked not to be
named because Rousseff will announce the program publicly
tomorrow. The government will offer contracts to operate ports
in Ilheus, Manaus and Imbituba in 2013, they said.  The license to operate Imbitubaâ€™s port, currently held by
Royal Transportes e Servicos Ltda, will not be renewed and will
be subject to a new round of public bidding, the people said.  Port operators whose licenses have expired or are about to
expire will be offered an option to renew the contracts if they
agree to meet investment requirements and open up to third-party
cargo, according to the officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
