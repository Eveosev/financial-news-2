Gold, still in its longest winning
streak in at least nine decades, will probably peak in 2013 and
keep declining the following year as U.S. growth accelerates,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Prices will peak in 2013 before declining even as the
 Federal Reserve  expands stimulus, the bank said in an e-mailed
report today. Bullion will be at $1,825 an ounce in three
months, $1,805 in six months and $1,800 in a year’s time, it
said, lowering its three-month forecast from $1,840 and its six-
and 12-month outlooks from $1,940. It introduced an average 2014
estimate of $1,750. This year’s average is $1,670.  The metal is headed for a 12th consecutive annual gain as
central banks from the U.S. to  Europe  to  China  pledged more
steps to spur economic growth. Investors are holding a record
amount in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  and nations from
 Russia  to  South Korea  added to gold reserves this year. Global
growth will accelerate to 3.6 percent in 2013, from 3.3 percent
this year, the International Monetary Fund estimates.  “In the short term, the combination of more easing and
weaker growth should prove supportive to gold,”  Jeffrey Currie ,
an analyst at the bank, wrote in the report. “Medium term,
however, the gold outlook is caught between the opposing forces
of more Fed easing and a gradual increase in U.S. real rates on
better US economic growth. Our expanded modeling suggests that
the improving U.S. growth outlook will outweigh further Fed
balance sheet expansion and that the cycle in  gold prices  will
likely turn in 2013.”  Gold Price  Gold traded at $1,695.60 by 9:19 a.m. on the Comex in  New
York , set for an 8.2 percent advance this year. Futures reached
a record $1,923.70 in September 2011. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities added 0.2 percent since the beginning of
January and the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities rose 11
percent. Treasuries returned 2.7 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  Gold rallied 70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of
debt in two rounds of monetary easing from December 2008 through
June 2011. The central bank said Oct. 24 it will maintain $40
billion in monthly purchases of mortgage debt and probably hold
 interest rates  near zero until mid-2015. It has swapped shorter
term securities for longer term debt through its $667 billion
Operation Twist program that is scheduled to end by year-end.  “We find that gold prices ‘look through’ easing that does
not require Fed balance sheet expansion - like Operation Twist -
increasing instead on announcements of easing through expansion
on the Fed’s balance sheet,” Currie said. “Risks to our growth
outlook remain elevated, however, especially given the
uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, making calling the peak in
gold prices a difficult exercise.”  Fiscal Cliff  President  Barack Obama  is hardening his stance in his first
post-election confrontation with Republicans, declaring that he
will make no deal on the country’s fiscal future unless
congressional leaders first accept tax-rate increases for top
earners. If the so-called fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax
increases that will kick in at the beginning of next year isn’t
averted, the U.S. may face a recession, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office .  Without additional easing by the Fed late next year, gold
may fall to $1,625 by the end of 2014, Goldman predicts. Under
weaker U.S. growth, prices may reach $1,900 by the end of next
year, while better growth means bullion may stall near current
prices, before falling to $1,500 by the end of 2014, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
