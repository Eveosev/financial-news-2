Intersnack Group said it hired banks
for debt financing to back its acquisition of KP Snacks.  Commerzbank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) 
underwrote the loans to Intersnack, which will remain an
investment-grade company, according to a statement today.  Dusseldorf-based Intersnack said it agreed to buy KP
Snacks, spun off this year from United Biscuits by owners
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and PAI Partners for an undisclosed amount,
to create a group with more than 1.7 billion pounds ($2.74
billion) of net sales.  Intersnack will buy the unit for more than 400 million
pounds, three people familiar with the discussions said
yesterday.  KP Snacks, the maker of Hula Hoops and KP Nuts, has annual
sales of 280 million pounds, according to the joint statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
