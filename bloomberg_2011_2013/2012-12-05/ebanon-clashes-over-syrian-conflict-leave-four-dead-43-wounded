At least four people were killed and
43 wounded in clashes between supporters and opponents of Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad in Lebanon’s northern city of Tripoli,
the official National News Agency said today.  Tensions have been high in the city, with intermittent
violence following news that several of its residents were
killed in an ambush by the Syrian army last week in the Syrian
border town of Tal Kalakh.  Syria ’s state television said seven Lebanese men died in a
gun battle with the army on Nov. 30. It said they were part of
an armed “terrorist” group that had infiltrated from Lebanon.  Clashes have erupted between pro-and-anti Assad groups in
Tripoli,  Beirut  and south Lebanon since the Syrian conflict
began in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
