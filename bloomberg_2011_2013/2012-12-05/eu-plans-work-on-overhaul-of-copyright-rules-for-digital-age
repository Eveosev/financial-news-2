European Union regulators plan to
work on an overhaul of the bloc’s copyright rules to “make them
fit” for the digital age.  The European Commission decided today to adapt the rules
governing how copyrights are used and enforced across the 27-
nation EU to meet challenges presented by the Internet. The
regulator seeks to complete work by 2014.  The goal is to “work for a modern copyright framework that
guarantees effective recognition and remuneration of rights
holders in order to provide sustainable incentives for
creativity” and combating piracy, the Brussels-based commission
said in a statement.  EU lawmakers in July rejected a global anti-piracy treaty,
known as ACTA, that would have established global rules for
cracking down on piracy, including illegal file-sharing. Key
goals in today’s initiative are to improve enforcement of
copyright rules across the EU and harmonize the fragmented way
copyrights apply across the bloc’s 27 nations.  The commission next year will have discussions with
industry officials to tackle six “concrete problems.” This
includes how to solve the effect of copyright territoriality
when consumers who have legally downloaded content such as music
or e-books in one EU nation, can’t access it in another EU
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
