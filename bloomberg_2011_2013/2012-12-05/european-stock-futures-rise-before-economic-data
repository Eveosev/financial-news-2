European stocks  rose to an 18-month
high as  China  signaled wider policy support for economic
recovery, outweighing a report that showed euro-area
manufacturing and services output shrank for a 10th month.  HSBC Holdings Plc climbed to 1 1/2-year high after the bank
agreed to sell its stake in China’s Ping An Insurance (Group)
Co. for $9.4 billion.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  jumped 2.6 percent.
Tesco Plc rallied the most in 14 months after starting a review
of its U.S. Fresh & Easy business.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  gained 9.7 percent
after winning a deal to sell its flagship smartphone in China.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.2 percent to 276.91 at
the close of trading. The benchmark gauge has  surged 18 percent 
from this year’s low on June 4 as the European Central Bank and
the Federal Reserve expanded economic support and optimism grew
that U.S. lawmakers will avoid a looming fiscal deadlock.  “Investor sentiment is improving, and the market is
receptive for positive news, such as the news out of China,”
Otto Waser, chief investment officer at Research & Asset
Management AG in Zurich, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s still a wall of worry regarding the fiscal cliff that
causes investors to be cautiously positioned which implies room
to increase equity allocations.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 12 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX each added
0.3 percent. U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  rose 0.4 percent.  China Economy  China will keep macroeconomic policies stable, making
adjustments as needed to deal with difficulties, the Communist
Party’s Politburo said in its first assessment of the economy
under new leader Xi Jinping.  The country will “face various challenges that should not
be underestimated” next year, the official Xinhua News Agency
said yesterday, citing a statement issued after a meeting of the
ruling party’s top leaders. The world’s second-largest economy
will expand domestic demand, actively promote urbanization,
strengthen real-estate controls and support small business,
Xinhua said.  Separately, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission
abolished a rule limiting insurance companies’ investments in
commercial banks.  “The government is gradually opening the channel for
universal banking,” said Xie Jiyong, a Shanghai-based analyst
at Capital Securities.  Euro-Area Output  European stocks  briefly pared gains as a report showed that
euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank for a 10th
month in November. Separate data showed retail sales dropped
more than forecast in October.  In the U.S., companies added 118,000 workers in November,
fewer than projected by economists in a Bloomberg survey,
according to the ADP Research Institute. Another report showed
service industries expanded at a faster pace in November than
economists projected.  HSBC (HSBA)  gained 1.2 percent to 644.1 pence, the highest since
May 13, 2011. The bank agreed to sell its stake in China’s Ping
An Insurance to Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont for $9.4
billion as Europe’s biggest bank by market value moves to revive
profit and boost capital.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  rose 2.6 percent to 83 euro cents
and  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  added 1.4 percent to 1.41 euros, as a gauge
of European lenders advanced for a second day.  An index of mining shares posted the best performance among
the  19 industry groups  in the Stoxx 600. Vedanta Resources
climbed 2.6 percent to 1,094 pence. Rio Tinto Group and  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  jumped 3.1 percent to 3,226 pence and 2.4 percent
to 1,998 pence, respectively.  Tesco, Nokia  Tesco rose 3.3 percent to 337.45 pence, the most in 14
months. The U.K.’s largest grocery company said it’s reviewing
its U.S. Fresh & Easy business and that Tim Mason, the
unprofitable unit’s head, will leave.  Nokia gained 9.7 percent to 2.77 euros, the highest in
seven months. The Finnish mobile-phone maker unveiled a version
of its Lumia 920T smartphone for China’s largest wireless
carrier, China Mobile Ltd.  Aker Solutions ASA increased 5 percent to 109.70 kroner
after saying it seeks to raise its margin based on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to 15
percent by the end of 2017. The company also said it will double
revenue from 2012 to 2017.  Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC) , which owns 49 percent of Virgin
Trains, climbed 5.9 percent to 308.7 pence. First-half pretax
profit of 124 million pounds ($200 million) beat the average
analyst estimate that called for 114 million pounds.  Valiant Talks  Valiant Holding AG (VATN)  rallied 6 percent to 100.1 Swiss francs,
the biggest jump since June 1999, after the bank confirmed it’s
in takeover talks with Berner Kantonalbank AG. Swiss blog Inside
Paradeplatz reported earlier today that Berner Kantonalbank may
acquire the company for about 2 billion francs ($2.2 billion).  Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL)  fell 1.7 percent to 176.10 euros after
Morgan Stanley cut Europe’s largest publicly-trader property
owner to underweight, a recommendation similar to sell, from
equal weight.  Swedish Match AB (SWMA) , a maker of snuff, dropped 3.4 percent to
225 kronor. The European Commission may continue a ban on the
export of Swedish snuff, Dagens Nyheter reported, citing a copy
of the proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
