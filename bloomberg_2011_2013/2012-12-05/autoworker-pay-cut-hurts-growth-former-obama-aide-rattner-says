Wage cuts aimed at increasing the
competitiveness of U.S. auto companies may harm the economy by
reducing workers’ disposable income, said  Steven Rattner , the
former leader of President  Barack Obama ’s auto task force.  Rattner, now chairman of the Willett Advisors LLC
investment firm in New York, led the $63.4 billion bailout in
2009 of  General Motors Corp. (GM)  and Chrysler LLC, which he said
would have shut down and fired their workers without government
support.  “What I saw when I started to spend time in the  auto
industry  is this incredible downward pressure on wages that
comes from other countries being able to do things increasingly
as well as we do at much, much lower wages,” Rattner said today
at the Bloomberg Hedge Funds Summit in New York. “So today,
General Motors workers are getting hired at half of what these
old line workers were getting.”  U.S. economic growth will probably be limited in part
because of wage reductions, he said.  Americans unexpectedly pared spending in October as
superstorm Sandy depressed wages. The 0.2 percent decrease in
purchases followed a 0.8 percent gain, Commerce Department
figures showed in  Washington  last week.  Adjusted for inflation, the decline was 0.3 percent, the
biggest in more than three years. Incomes were little changed as
the biggest Atlantic storm to ever hit the U.S. shaved $18.2
billion in wages at an annual rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
