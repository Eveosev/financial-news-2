Ukraineâ€™s  economy  may expand 2.5
percent next year under a pessimistic scenario in which export
growth is slower than planned, the government said.  Inflation may quicken to 6.1 percent under the analysis,
the Cabinet said today on its  website  before lawmakers vote
tomorrow on the 2013 budget.  The draft budget assumes gross domestic product will
advance 3.4 percent and inflation will be 4.8 percent, First
Deputy Finance Minister Anatoliy Myarkovskyi told Parliament
yesterday. Ukrainian exports, which generate more than half of
GDP, will rise 2.3 percent under the pessimistic scenario
compared with the 6.4 percent envisaged in the draft budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
