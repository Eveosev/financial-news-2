Moody’s Investors Service cut the
outlook for  South Africa ’s banking system to negative from
stable on concern that slowing economic growth will put pressure
on the quality of lenders’ assets.  Moody’s estimates that the nation’s gross domestic product
will expand 2.5 percent this year and 3 percent in 2013, less
than what is needed to “tackle high unemployment and
substantially improve  living standards ,” the company said in a
statement today.  “As a result of the weakened domestic environment, the
rating agency expects credit growth and new corporate business
opportunities for banks to remain subdued over the 12- to 18-
month outlook period,” Moody’s said. “Sizable holdings of
 government securities  that will continue to link the banks’
credit profiles to South Africa’s creditworthiness” also
contributed to the reduction, it said.  Africa’s biggest economy struggles with an unemployment
rate of  25.5 percent  and economic growth that slowed to 1.2
percent in the third quarter from the previous three months, the
lowest since the 2009 recession. The central bank and government
expects growth to be 2.5 percent this year.  Moody’s Investors Service reduced its assessment of South
African debt one level to Baa1, the third-lowest investment
grade, on Sept. 27, the first downgrade since elections that
ended white rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
