Andrew Redleaf, founder of Whitebox
Advisors LLC, said he sees a “massive reallocation” from fixed
income to equities within the next three years.  “For the past 20 years, generally speaking, credits have
been more interesting than equities,” Redleaf said today at the
Bloomberg Hedge Funds Summit in  New York . “As far as I can see
in the future that’s generally reversed.”  Whitebox is a Minneapolis-based firm with about $2.3
billion in assets under management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
