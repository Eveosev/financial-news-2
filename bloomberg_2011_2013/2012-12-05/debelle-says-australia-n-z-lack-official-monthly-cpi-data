Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant
Governor Guy Debelle said his nation and New Zealand are the
only advanced countries without official monthly inflation data.  In the text of a speech to be delivered to the Melbourne
Institute today that didn’t refer to monetary policy or the
outlook for the economy, Debelle praised the institute’s work
with TD Securities Inc. to establish a price gauge that they
release monthly.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics and Statistics New
Zealand each release a consumer price index quarterly.  To contact the reporters on this story:
