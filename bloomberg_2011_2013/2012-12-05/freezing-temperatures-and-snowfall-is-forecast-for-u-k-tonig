Tonight is likely to be the coldest
night so far this winter in parts of the U.K., with much of the
country facing a risk of ice or frost, the Met Office said.  Temperatures may drop as low as minus 8 degrees Celsius (18
degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of  Scotland , and most of the
country will experience rain, sleet or snow through tomorrow
morning, the country’s national weather service said today in an
online  statement . Areas of western Scotland may receive as much
as 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) of snow.  “With temperatures falling below freezing, lying snow and
the formation of ice will lead to some treacherous conditions
and disruption to travel,” Martin Young, chief forecaster at
the Met Office, said in the statement.  Snow may accumulate in the Pennines and the Lake District
in northern  England  and temporary snow cover is expected as far
south as Lincolnshire. Sleet and snow may turn to rain tomorrow,
while southeastern areas of the country may experience snowfall
on Dec. 7, the  Met Office  said.  The weekend will be drier, with temperatures remaining
“very cold and frosty,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter for this story:
