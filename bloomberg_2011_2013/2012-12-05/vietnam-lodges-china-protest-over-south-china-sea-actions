Vietnam  lodged a protest with China
after it said Chinese fishing boats intentionally blocked a
Vietnamese seismic survey vessel, according to a statement on
the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website late
yesterday.  Two Chinese fishing boats Nov. 30 obstructed the Binh Minh
2 in waters within Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone, according
to the statement. The block caused the survey vessel’s cables to
break, and occurred despite warning signals from Vietnamese
authorities, according to the statement.   The incident is one of a series of recent actions that
“seriously violated Vietnam’s sovereignty over Hoang Sa and
Truong Sa archipelagos as well as Vietnam’s sovereignty and
jurisdictional rights over its waters,” Luong Thanh Nghi,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said in the statement.
Hoang Sa and Truong Sa are the Vietnamese names for the Paracel
and Spratly islands.  China ’s Hainan province on Nov. 27 adopted revised border
security regulations for its coastal regions, covering Hoang Sa
and Truong Sa, Vietnam’s foreign ministry said in the statement.
The ministry said China published on Nov. 23 a map of Sansha
City that includes the two archipelagos and which incorporates
parts of Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone and continental
shelf.   Representatives from Vietnam’s foreign ministry met with
Chinese Embassy representatives in Hanoi on Dec. 3 to “firmly
protest those actions by China, demand China respect Vietnam’s
sovereignty, immediately stop those wrongful practices and not
let similar actions recur,” Nghi said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
