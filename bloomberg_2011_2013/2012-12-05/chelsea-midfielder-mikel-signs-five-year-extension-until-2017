Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel has
signed a five-year contract extension with the Premier League
soccer club until 2017.  Mikel, 25, joined Chelsea in the summer of 2006 after
backing out of a move to  Manchester United . He’s helped the
Blues win four F.A. Cups, one Premier League title and last
season’s  Champions League .  “I have basically won everything with Chelsea and those
years have been really special for me” Mikel said on the club’s
 website . “Being 25 I think I am now hitting my peak but as a
player you want to improve every day and there is still room for
that.”  Mikel was involved in an October incident in which Chelsea
complained to England’s Football Association that referee Mark Clattenburg had used racist language toward the midfielder
during a game against Manchester United.  Clattenburg was cleared last month by the F.A. The
governing body then charged Mikel with confronting Clattenburg
in the officials’ dressing room after the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
