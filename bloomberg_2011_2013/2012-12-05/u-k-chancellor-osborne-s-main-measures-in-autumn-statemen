The following are the main measures
announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his
autumn statement today.  INCOME TAX  The personal tax-free allowance will rise by 235 pounds
($378) to 9,440 pounds in April 2013. The point at which people
start paying the higher 40 percent rate of income tax will rise
by 1 percent to 41,865 pounds in April 2014 and to 42,285 pounds
in April 2015. Increasing it by less than inflation will raise
an extra 295 million pounds in the first year and 875 million
pounds in the second.  PENSIONS TAX RELIEF  The government will save 1 billion pounds by reducing the
tax-free amount people can put into their pension funds to
40,000 pounds a year from 50,000 pounds. The new cap, to take
effect from April 2014, will come alongside lowering the
lifetime cap for tax-free contributions to 1.25 million pounds.  CORPORATION TAX  The main rate of corporation tax, a levy on company
profits, will fall in April 2014 by a further 1 percentage point
to 21 percent. The measure will cost the Treasury 415 million
pounds in 2014-15.  BANK LEVY  A levy on bank balance sheets is raised to 0.130 percent
from January to ensure banks do not benefit from the cut in
corporation tax. The increase means the levy will generate 515
million pounds more for the Treasury than previously estimated
next year.  CAPITAL SPENDING  An extra 5.5 billion pounds of capital spending has been
announced for the period up to 2015, funded by cuts to
government running costs. It goes mainly to school-
building and transport projects.  WELFARE  Most working-age benefits will rise by 1 percent, rather
than inflation, for three years from April. That will save 1.4
billion pounds in 2014-15.  FUEL DUTY  A decision to help motorists by canceling an increase in
fuel duty that was due to take effect in January will cost the
Treasury 1.6 billion pounds in the next fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
