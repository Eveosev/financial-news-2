Heating oil rose on speculation that
global diesel demand will increase as  China  eases restrictions
on investing in banks.  Futures gained as China’s regulators eliminated a rule
limiting insurers’ investments in commercial banks. China will
make macroeconomic policies more targeted and effective, the
official Xinhua News Agencyreported, citing a meeting of the
Communist Party’s ruling Politburo.  “The new government is talking about more stimulus in
China and that is supportive for the market,” said Phil Flynn,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  January-delivery heating oil rose 1.3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.017 a gallon at 9:49 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington . The department
will probably say that supplies of distillates, including
heating oil and diesel, increased 850,000 barrels, according to
the median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.
Gasoline inventories rose 1.55 million barrels, the survey
showed.  “I expect that gasoline is going to build as refineries on
the East Coast and other refineries around the country have
returned from maintenance,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 0.28 cent to $2.6862 a
gallon, the third consecutive decline.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  fell 0.1
cent to a $3.38 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s
the lowest level since July 6. The pump price reached a 2012
high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
