A group of baseball and hockey fans
can go forward with claims that the National Hockey League and
 Major League Baseball  violate U.S. antitrust law in their
control over television and Internet broadcast rights.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York today
denied the leagues’ request to dismiss the suits, filed by
subscribers to broadcasts of hockey and baseball games. The
group sued the leagues; individual clubs; regional TV sports
networks;  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable broadcaster; and
 DirecTV LLC (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite television provider.  The plaintiffs, seeking to represent other MLB and NHL
viewers in a class-action suit, claim the practice of dividing
live game broadcasts into exclusive territories, protected by
local blackouts, is anti-competitive. They also targeted the
sale of “out-of-market” packages only through the leagues.  “Plaintiffs have adequately alleged harm to competition
with respect to the horizontal agreements among individual
hockey and baseball clubs, as part of the NHL and MLB, to divide
the television market,” Scheindlin said today in a written
opinion. “The consumers have plausibly alleged that they are
the direct victims of this harm to competition.”  The cases are Laumann v.  National Hockey League , 1:12-cv-
01817, and Garber v. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, 12-
cv-3704, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
