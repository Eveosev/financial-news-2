AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
mobile-phone company, increased its forecast for fourth-quarter
smartphone sales as more users snapped up plans with high-speed
Internet access.  The company will sell 26 million smartphones such as  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s Lumia, up from a prior forecast of
25 million, said Ralph de la Vega, chief executive officer of
AT&T’s wireless unit. AT&T had sold 6.4 million smartphones
through November, he said today at a UBS AG conference.  While higher smartphone sales encourage more customer
spending on data over the life of a wireless contract, they hurt
profits at first because they’re often sold at a heavy discount.
Susan Johnson, AT&T’s head of  investor relations , declined in an
interview today to provide a forecast for profit margins.  About one-quarter of users on Dallas-based AT&T’s shared-
data service are choosing its 10-gigabyte plan, de la Vega said.
That’s the third-most expensive shared-data offer at $120 a
month, according to the company’s website. The service allows
customers to combine as many as 10 devices under one monthly
data alignment.  AT&T was little changed at $33.91 at the close in New York.
The shares have risen 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
