The yield premium Swedish 10-year
 government bonds  pay over benchmark German bunds widened to a
six-month high amid signs the largest Nordic economy is
deteriorating faster than estimated.  The spread, or difference in yield, between  Sweden ’s 10-
year note and German debt with the same maturity grew to 13
basis points today, the widest since June 11, according to data
available on Bloomberg.  Swedish annual  services production  fell by the most in
three years in October,  Statistics Sweden  said today, adding to
evidence the economy is stalling. Slowing growth has prompted
the nation’s debt office to raise its borrowing forecasts for
next year, most recently by 17 percent in October.  “Today’s data prints suggest that the global downturn now
also is setting its mark on the domestic sector in Sweden,”
said Tina Mortensen, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  London , in
a client note. This “supports our call for a December  rate  cut,
and additional monetary easing heading into 2013,” she said.  The $500 billion economy will contract in the last three
months of the year, Mortensen forecast. That “stands in sharp
contrasts to the Riksbank’s forecast of a 0.2 percent quarter-
on-quarter gain,” she said.  Swedish growth will slow to 0.8 percent this year from 3.9
percent in 2011 after weakening to an annual 0.7 percent in the
third quarter led by falling exports, the Swedish Public
Employment Services predicted today. Unemployment will rise to
8.4 percent in 2013 from 7.8 percent this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
