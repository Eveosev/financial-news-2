Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s largest
publicly traded hedge fund manager, hired John Rohal as its
first-ever executive chairman for  North America  as the London-
based firm seeks growth outside the U.K.  Rohal joins on Jan. 1 from  Menlo Park , California-based
Makena Capital Management LLC, where he oversees the firm’s
public equity and so-called tactical hedged equity investments,
Man Group said in a statement today.  Rohal will help develop the company’s products for the U.S.
market and “deepen Man’s relationships” with institutional
clients such as pension funds, foundations and family offices,
the statement said.  Man Group shook up its management team in June and has been
cutting costs as investors become increasingly cautious about
adding money to the $2 trillion hedge-fund industry. Clients
worldwide withdrew a net $2.2 billion from Man Group in the
third quarter, up from $1.4 billion in the second quarter, the
company said in October.  The company has about 400 investment professionals
globally, including 50 at its New York-based U.S. operations.
The firm manages about $60 billion globally through its AHL, FRM
and GLG Partners units.  Man Group declined to specify what proportion of its assets
comes from U.S. institutions or comment further beyond
the statement.  Makena declined to comment. The firm, which manages $16
billion, was started in 2005 by Michael McCaffery and other
managers of  Stanford University ’s endowment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
