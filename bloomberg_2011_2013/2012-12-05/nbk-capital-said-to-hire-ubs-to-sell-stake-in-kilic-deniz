NBK Capital, the private-equity arm of the  National Bank of Kuwait , hired  UBS AG (UBSN)  to sell its 20 percent stake in Kilic Deniz Urunleri AS, a Turkish producer and supplier of fish products, two people familiar with the matter said.  NBK Capital, which bought the stake through its $250 million NBK Capital Equity Partners I fund in 2010 after providing mezzanine funds to the company, is now seeking to sell the stake, said the people, who asked for anonymity as the process is private.  An official at UBS declined to comment. Salah Al Fulaij, NBK Capitalâ€™s chief executive, did not reply to e-mailed questions about the sale. Zulfu Murat Bakirci, chief executive of Kilic Deniz, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.  NBK Capital bought a minority stake at  Dunyagoz Hastaneleri , a Turkish eye hospital operator, in 2010. Other investments in  Turkey  include providing mezzanine financing to Dem Ilac, a pharmaceutical company, according to its  website .
