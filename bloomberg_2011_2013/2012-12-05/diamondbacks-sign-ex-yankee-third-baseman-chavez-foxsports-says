The Arizona Diamondbacks signed third
baseman  Eric Chavez  to a one-year, $3 million contract,
 FoxSports reported , removing one of the New York Yankees’ free-
agent options for replacing  Alex Rodriguez .  Chavez, who turns 35 in two days, spent the past two years
with the Yankees and last season hit .281 with 16 home runs and
37 runs batted in. He was used in a part-time role, with 313 at-
bats while making 50 starts in place of Rodriguez at third base,
six at first and 17 as a designated hitter.  Rodriguez will miss the start of the 2013 Major League
Baseball season while recovering from hip surgery and may be out
until July.  Chavez spent his first 13 major-league seasons with the
 Oakland Athletics , hitting .267 with 230 homers and 787 RBI. He
made four All-Star appearances with the A’s and won six straight
Gold Glove awards for defense, from 2001 to 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
