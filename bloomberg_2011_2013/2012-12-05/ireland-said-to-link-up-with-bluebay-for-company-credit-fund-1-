BlueBay Asset Management LLP, a
London-based fixed-income investment firm, will join with
Ireland’s National Pensions Reserve Fund to create a fund
offering loans to small and medium-sized companies in the
country, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The fund will raise as much as 450 million euros ($588
million), according to one of the people, who asked not to be
identified as the matter isn’t public. The fund may be announced
as soon as today as Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  lays
out the 2013 budget.  The fund will be backed by 300 million euros of senior debt
financing from investors including the Irish authorities, in
addition to 150 million euros from BlueBay and the Irish pension
fund, said one of the people.  The fund, looking to start senior secured lending by the
end of the first quarter, will seek to deliver an annual return
of 15 percent for equity investors, said one of the people.
Officials at BlueBay declined to comment.  Ray Gordon , a pension
fund spokesman, wasn’t immediately able to comment.  BlueBay is owned by Toronto-based  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the
country’s biggest lender, which paid about 963 million pounds
($1.6 billion) for the firm in 2010 to expand its wealth-
management business.  To contact the reporters on this story:
