Czech shares rose to the highest in
more than eight months, led by  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and Vienna
Insurance Group AG, as an easing of investment rules in China
boosted investor demand for financial stocks worldwide.  Komercni, a unit of Societe Generale SA, climbed 2 percent
to 3,941 koruna by the end of trading in  Prague , while VIG of
Austria advanced 1.2 percent. The  PX (PX)  index, in which the two
companies have a combined weight of 34 percent, advanced 0.3
percent to 997.73, the highest close since March 19.  Lenders were among the biggest stock gainers in Europe
today after China curbed restrictions on investments in banks
and HSBC Holdings Plc agreed to sell its stake in China’s Ping
An Insurance (Group) Co. to Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont
for $9.4 billion to boost profit and capital.  “Favorable news from China and a successful asset sale by
HSBC are the main factors supporting gains for financial stocks
across  Europe , including Czech banks,” Marek Hatlapatka, an
analyst at Cyrrus brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, said by e-
mail.  The koruna strengthened 0.1 percent to 25.225 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
