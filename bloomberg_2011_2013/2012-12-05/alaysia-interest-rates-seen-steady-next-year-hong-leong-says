Malaysia  is likely to keep  interest
rates  steady through 2013 as inflation risk deters cuts and the
central bank avoids policy shifts that may spur capital inflows,
according to the nation’s fourth-biggest banking group.  Consumer-price gains will accelerate when the government
trims fuel subsidies to address its  budget deficit  after a
general election that must take place by early 2013, said
Geoffrey Ng, Chief Executive Officer at Hong Leong Asset
Management Bhd., part of Hong Leong Group. Prices rose 1.3
percent from a year earlier in October and September, the
smallest increases since February 2010, official data show.  “Depending on how quickly they pull back subsidies, we
will see an inflationary impact and this would make it more
difficult for the central bank to want to move interest rates
down,” Kuala Lumpur-based Ng, who helps oversee $1.8 billion of
assets, said in a Nov. 30 interview. Against this backdrop, Hong
Leong favors  bank deposits  over short-maturity  government bonds 
in Malaysia, he said.  Bank Negara Malaysia  has kept its policy rate at 3 percent
this year as central banks in Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand lowered borrowing costs to support their economies.
Gross domestic product in Malaysia increased 5.2 percent from a
year earlier in the third quarter, compared with growth of 6.2
percent in Indonesia, 7.1 percent in the Philippines and 3
percent in Thailand, official figures show.  Malaysia’s economy will expand 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent
in 2013, after growth of as much as 5 percent in 2012, while the
budget deficit will narrow to 4 percent of GDP from 4.5 percent,
Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a budget speech on Sept. 28.  Of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, eight predict the
central bank’s benchmark interest rate will be the same at
end-2013 as it is now. Three forecast an increase of a quarter
of a percentage point to 3.25 percent and five said they expect
a 3.5 percent rate.  The nation’s banks offer an average 12-month deposit rate
of 3.17 percent, higher than the 3.01 percent yield on one-year
sovereign bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
