Cornerback Brandon Browner is banned
from the Seattle Seahawks’ final four regular-season games for
violating the  National Football League ’s policy on performance-
enhancing drugs.  Browner’s suspension begins immediately, the NFL said
yesterday in a statement, and he’ll miss games against the
 Arizona Cardinals , Buffalo Bills,  San Francisco 49ers  and St.
Louis Rams as the Seahawks (7-5) pursue a playoff berth.
Browner, 28, would be eligible to return for the postseason.  Browner had six interceptions for the Seahawks last season
in making the Pro Bowl. His three interceptions this season are
second on the team to cornerback Richard Sherman, who ESPN
reported also tested positive for a banned substance and has an
appeal hearing scheduled for Dec. 14.  Browner had appealed his suspension after ESPN reported
last month that he tested positive for the prescription drug
Adderall, a stimulant used to treat attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Sherman also tested positive
for Adderall, ESPN said on Nov. 26 without citing the source of
its information.  The Seahawks’ defense has allowed the fifth-fewest passing
yards among the NFL’s 32 teams this season. With Browner
beginning his suspension this week, the Seahawks won’t be
without their two top cornerbacks for the same four games if
Sherman is also disciplined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
