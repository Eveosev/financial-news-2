Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  and
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  are planning to relax terms
on emergency loans to chipmaker  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , three
bank officials with knowledge of the matter said.  The banks will decide as early as this week to extend
repayment periods and cut interest rates, the people said,
asking not to be named because talks are confidential. Lenders
are considering extending the five-year repayment period to
seven years and reducing rates to below 1.5 percent from about
1.8 percent, one of the people said.  Renesas, a  supplier  to Apple Inc. and Nintendo Co., is
cutting jobs and considering closing or selling factories to
recover from losses as demand for its microchips declines.
State-backed  Innovation Network Corp. of Japan  is close to a
reaching an agreement with Renesas shareholders to take a two-
thirds stake in the chipmaker to help restructure the company, a
person with knowledge of the talks said Nov. 26.  Yuji Okumura, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Mitsubishi UFJ,
and Masako Shiono, a spokeswoman for Mizuho, declined to comment
on the term negotiations. Makie Uehara, a spokeswoman for
Renesas, declined to comment.  Kawasaki, Japan-based Renesas rose 1 percent to 292 yen as
of 2:35 p.m. in Tokyo trading. The shares have slumped 38
percent this year, compared with the benchmark Topix Index’s 8.2
percent gain.  Mitsubishi UFJ rose 1.3 percent and Mizuho shares climbed
1.5 percent.  Emergency Loans  Renesas said Sept. 28 it clinched loan contracts for about
200 billion yen ($2.4 billion) with its lenders, which include
 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309)   INCJ, which may announce an investment of more than 180
billion yen in Renesas, has been negotiating with the banks to
ease loan terms for the company, a person with knowledge of the
talks said Nov. 30.  Renesas has lost 177.6 billion yen since its formation in
2010 by the merger of money-losing chipmakers Renesas Technology
Corp., a venture between  Hitachi (6501)  and  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) ,
and NEC Electronics Corp. Renesas’s net loss may widen to 150
billion yen for the year ending March 31 from 62.6 billion yen a
year earlier, the company predicted Oct. 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
