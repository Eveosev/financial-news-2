Libya’s Economic and Social
Development Fund is withdrawing investments from French banks
including  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  as it shifts
attention to its home market.  The state-held fund, which has $12 billion in assets, had
about $10 billion invested outside the oil-rich nation, fund
chairman Mahmoud Badi said in a speech at a conference in Dubai
today.  The capital was “mainly with”  Societe Generale  and BNP,
Badi said. “But right now most of these portfolios are
liquidating and we are rethinking our investment outside because
there are ample chances to invest inside.”  Badi didn’t provide more information about the assets Libya
was selling. Nathalie Boschat, Societe Generale spokeswoman,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg today. BNP
Paribas spokeswoman Julia Boyce didn’t immediately respond to a
phone call and e-mail seeking comment.  Libya, which ousted dictator  Muammar Qaddafi  last year, is
working to rebuild its depleted infrastructure after years of
decline. The country, which has Africa’s largest oil reserves,
is returning to its pre-civil war oil output levels faster than
expected, the International Monetary Fund said on Nov. 11. Libya
has 2.9 percent of reserves globally, according to the BP
Statistical review published in June.  BNP rose 0.9 percent to 43.5 euros a share at 1:46 p.m. in
Paris, valuing the company at 54.5 billion euros ($71 billion).
Societe Generale gained 0.8 percent to 28.75 euros. The main
 Stoxx 600 Banks (SX7P)  index climbed 0.8 percent to 161.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
