Ethanol strengthened relative to
gasoline as corn gained on speculation that bad weather in  South
America  will reduce crops.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline was 21.08
cents a gallon based on front-month futures, versus 26.5 cents
yesterday. The spread has averaged 62.35 cents this year.  Corn, the primary feedstock in manufacturing ethanol in the
U.S., climbed on concern that too much rain in  Argentina  will
cut yield prospects, boosting demand for U.S. supply. Prices for
the grain have gained 17 percent this year, squeezing profits at
ethanol distilleries and prompting the industry to limit output.  “It’s break-even for the efficient guy,” said Wallace
Tyner, an agricultural economist at  Purdue University  in  West
Lafayette ,  Indiana . “It’s break-even for some and for some
that’s losing money.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery advanced 0.3 cent
to $2.427 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The contract
expired today. Futures have gained 10 percent this year. The
more actively traded January contract rose 0.1 cent to $2.421.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 3
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.495 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive climbed 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.44, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Spot Prices  Ethanol on the West Coast added 0.5 cent to $2.575 a gallon
and in  New York  the biofuel was unchanged at $2.53.  Gasoline for January delivery slid 5.12 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.6378. The contract covers reformulated
gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Corn for March delivery added 5.75 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $7.5775 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 31 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 29
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  Tyner said the industry is producing too much of the
biofuel to raise prices enough to capture a profit.  Output rose 4 percent to 835,000 barrels a day in the week
ended Nov. 30 from the previous week, the highest level since
June 29 while down 10 percent from a year earlier, Energy
Department data show.  Stockpiles at 19.3 million barrels are at the highest level
since July 27 and 7.8 percent above the year-earlier level, the
agency said today.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 87 percent of total U.S.
gasoline pool in the week ended Nov. 30, according to department
data, the lowest since Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
