Delays in selling about 30 million
carbon permits that were scheduled to be sold this year could
push back an anticipated decline in prices, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The Czech Republic,  Poland , Ireland,  Estonia  and  Belgium 
all failed to complete preparations in time to participate in
auctions that run through Dec. 18, according to a  schedule of
sales  published by the European Energy Exchange AG on Dec. 3.
They may still not be ready to start selling when the third
phase of the bloc’s carbon market begins next month, analysts
including James Cooper at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in  London 
said yesterday in an e-mailed report.  The delay in auctioning all of the permits earmarked for
the so-called early Phase 3 sales means that the unsold portion
will be added to regular auctions taking place from 2013. The
European Union is considering a plan to withhold 900 million
permits in the three years to 2015 to reduce a glut that helped
push prices for December to a record low of 5.68 euros ($7.45) a
ton yesterday.  “The volume from the five currently non-participating
countries is also at risk for the start of full auctions,”
Cooper said. “For example, the  Czech Republic  may not be ready
until February.”  The 30 million tons of permits represents a little more
than a week’s worth of auction supply in the third phase, Cooper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
