The  International Olympic Committee ’s
executive board voted to suspend  India ’s association because of
“government interference” in the local group’s election
process.  The IOC had warned the Indian Olympic Association about
following government rules, instead of IOC policies, for an
upcoming election before the ban, which was announced yesterday.
The IOC won’t recognize any elections until the issues are
resolved, it said in a statement on its website.  With the decision, Indian athletes and officials can’t
participate in Olympic activities or meetings and the country
will lose any IOC financial support until the suspension is
lifted by the executive board.    The executive board lifted the suspension of the Kuwaiti
Olympic body after receiving promises of its autonomy.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
