Indian (SENSEX)  stocks gained for a second day
amid optimism the government will succeed in pushing through its
plan to allow foreign investment in the nation’s retail industry
before lawmakers vote on the issue today.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, added 0.3 percent
to 19,408.40, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, holding at a 19-month high.  Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd. (STLT) , the top copper producer, rallied 5.8 percent as
the metal jumped to its highest level in more than six weeks in
London.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest producer of the metal,
climbed 2.3 percent.  Lawmakers will vote today on whether to back a government
decision to allow overseas retail chains to enter India, with
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  seeking a victory that may enable
him to silence criticism of the biggest embrace of overseas
investment in a decade. Offshore investors were net buyers of
local stocks for a 13th day on Dec. 3, taking net purchases in
2012 to $20.2 billion, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked
by Bloomberg, excluding China, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
