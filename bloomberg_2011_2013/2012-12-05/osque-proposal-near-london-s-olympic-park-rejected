The plan to turn a former chemical
site about a mile from London’s Olympic Park into a mosque more
than three times the size of St. Paul’s Cathedral was rejected
by the local government.  The Newham Borough Council  denied  permission for the 6.2-
hectare (15-acre) development called the Riverine Centre in the
city’s West Ham neighborhood at a meeting of council members
yesterday. The borough’s planners had recommended that the
proposal by Anjuman-E-Islahul-Muslimeen of (London) U.K. Trust
be rejected.  Approval was sought for a mosque that would hold more than
9,000 visitors, a library and a 2,000-person capacity dining
hall. The council earmarked the land for housing and businesses.  Chemicals had been made on the former Rio Tinto Zinc site
for about 100 years through the 1980s, contaminating the land,
according to documents circulated to councilors before the vote.
The site was bought by the trustees in 1996. The contamination
can’t be fully mitigated for the purpose of the proposed
development, according to the documents.  About a quarter of Newham’s residents are Muslim compared
with about 8.5 percent in all of  London , according to a document
submitted by the center’s trustees. More than 25,000 people told
the council that they supported the project and about 3,000
objected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
