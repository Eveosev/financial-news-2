Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer,
approved contracts for feasibility studies for two new double
carriage railways, Transport Minister Idris Umar said.  The plan includes a “detailed survey and alignment” of a
673-kilometer (418-mile) east-west coastal line and a 280-
kilometer line connecting central Kogi State to Abuja, the
capital. The lines will be built under a public-private
partnership, Umar told reporters in Abuja today.  “We’re going to partner with the private sector to ensure
the development of these lines,” Umar said.  Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160 million
people is increasing infrastructure spending to spur business.
Nigeria is reviewing laws guiding the operation of railways,
ports and harbors to allow private investors to participate and
help reduce  government spending , the Abuja-based Bureau of
Public Enterprises, the country’s privatization agency, said in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
