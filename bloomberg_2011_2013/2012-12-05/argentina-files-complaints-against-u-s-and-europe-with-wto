Argentina filed complaints with the
 World Trade Organization  against the U.S. for blocking imports
of beef and lemons and against the European Union for
restricting biodiesel imports.  Argentina is considering an additional complaint against
 Europe ’s agriculture subsidies as they are affecting the
country’s exports and output, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman
told reporters today in Buenos Aires.  “The measures against Argentine exports that led to this
demand have generated a lot of damage to Argentine producers and
thousands of job losses,” Timerman said. “The time has come
for Argentina to be recognized by the WTO as a victim of the
actions by the U.S. and the European Union.”  Argentina also urged the U.S. to declare the Patagonian
region as free of foot-and-mouth disease, Timerman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
