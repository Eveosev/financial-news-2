Kuwait posted a preliminary  budget
surplus  of 12.6 billion dinars ($45 billion) in the first half
of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013,  National Bank of
Kuwait SAK  said, citing official data.  “This surplus is equivalent to 26 percent of annual 2012
GDP and is 3.8 billion dinars higher than the comparable period
in the previous fiscal year,” Kuwait’s biggest bank said in an
e-mailed report today.  Revenue was 16 billion dinars, including oil revenue of
15.4 billion dinars, which was 15 percent higher than revenue in
the same period of the last fiscal year, NBK said. Spending in
the six months to Sept. 30 was 3.4 billion dinars and “remains
low for this time of the year, at just 16 percent of planned
full-year expenditures,” the bank said. NBK projects a budget
surplus this year of 12 billion dinars.  Government spending 
“typically accelerates in the second half,” the bank said.  Kuwait posted a record budget surplus of 13.2 billion
dinars in the 2011-2012 fiscal year as  oil prices  and output
rose. Government revenue was 30.2 billion dinars, of which 10
percent was saved in the  Reserve Fund  for Future Generations.  The 2012-2013 budget has projected spending of 21.2 billion
dinars and revenue of 13.9 billion dinars. The government said
it will raise revenue allocations to its Future Generations Fund
this fiscal year to 25 percent from 10 percent to “encourage
saving.”  Kuwait is the fourth-biggest producer in the Organization
of Exporting Countries and pumped 2.8 million barrels of oil a
day in November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
