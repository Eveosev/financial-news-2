U.K. two-year gilts rose for a second
day as the Debt Management Office said it will sell 15 billion
pounds ($24.2 billion) fewer bills this fiscal year than earlier
forecast and cut gilt auctions by 200 million pounds.  Ten-year bonds advanced after Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne revised down the government’s economic growth
forecasts and said the budget deficit will take longer to tame
than originally planned. The pound earlier dropped to a six-week
low versus the euro as a report showed Britain’s  services 
expanded at the slowest pace in almost two years. Gilt sales
will be decreased by reducing the mini-tender program to 6.3
billion pounds. Twenty- and 30-year bonds declined.  “The cuts would have helped the two-year price go up,”
said Jason Simpson, an interest-rates strategist at  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  in London. “All the mini-tenders have been in the
short-end of the curve this year. The easiest shock absorber is
to run down bills.”  The two-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.30 percent at 5 p.m. London time. The 5
percent gilt due in September 2014 rose 0.01, or 10 pence per
1,000-pound face amount, to 108.2.  The yield on the 10-year gilt was three basis points lower
at 1.78 percent after rising seven basis points, the most since
Nov. 20. U.K. 30-year gilts declined as the chancellor announced
plans to allow companies to reduce their pension deficit.  Pension Plans  “Anything that increases the discount rate reduces the
deficit measure and reduces urgency to buy long-dated fixed
income,” said Sam Hill, an interest-rate strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in  London .  U.K. 30-year yields rose seven basis points to 3.13
percent, after climbing as much as 10 basis points, the steepest
increase since Sept. 14.  The yield on the U.K. inflation-linked security maturing in
March 2062 rose 10 basis points to 0.23 percent, the highest
since Nov. 12, based on closing prices.  The pound was 0.1 percent stronger at 81.26 pence per euro
after depreciating to 81.48 pence, the weakest level since Oct.
24. Sterling was little changed at $1.6102. It rose to $1.6131
yesterday, the strongest since Nov. 2.  Sterling has gained 1.2 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.7 percent and
the dollar fell 2.7 percent.  Growth Forecast  Forecasts from the  Office for Budget Responsibility  show
the economy will shrink 0.1 percent this year instead of the 0.8
percent growth predicted in March, and expand 1.2 percent next
year instead of 2 percent, Osborne told lawmakers. He extended
his austerity program by one year to 2018 and said he will miss
by a year his target to start cutting debt as a percentage of
gross domestic product in 2015.  The DMO plans to end the fiscal year with a stock of 53.5
billion pounds of bills outstanding. The agency projected in
April the stock would be 68.5 billion pounds.  A gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
services industry was 50.2 last month from 50.6 in October,
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply said. That’s the lowest outcome since December 2010. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Bank of England policy makers will tomorrow maintain their
asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds, according to all 36
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gilts returned 3.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.7 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
