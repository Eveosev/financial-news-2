Jockey Frankie Dettori got a global
six-month ban from horseracing after a positive test for a
banned substance at Longchamp in September.  Dettori is suspended from riding competitively on race
courses all over the world from Dec. 19 until May 19, France
Galop, the country’s racing authority, said in an e-mailed
statement today. It didn’t disclose the banned substance.  Dettori’s lawyer Christopher Stewart-Moore said last month
it was “not a performance-enhancing drug.”  Italian-born and U.K.-based Dettori is a three-time
champion jockey in Britain. In September, he lost his role as a
contracted jockey for Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s Godolphin training set-up. He’d been with the stable
for 18 years and rode nine English classic winners for it before
falling out of favor this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
