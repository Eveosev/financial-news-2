Indonesia ’s two-year government bonds
gained for a seventh day, the longest winning streak since
February, after investors bid for nine times the amount offered
at the latest auction. The rupiah was little changed.  The yield fell to the lowest level in almost seven months
after the government canceled a Nov. 27 offer and raised 1.2
trillion rupiah ($125 million) at its final sale of the year on
Dec. 3, with investors submitting 9.2 trillion rupiah of bids,
according to an e-mailed statement from the debt management
office. Foreign funds pumped the most money on record into
Indonesian sovereign debt last month, finance ministry data show.  “Demand for bonds from overseas investors is still strong,
so they may rally further,” said Artanavaro Gasali, the head of
global markets at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia in Jakarta. “We have
seen a greater supply of dollars from foreign banks, possibly
due to capital inflows, so the rupiah will be under less
pressure.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent notes due October
2014 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.66
percent as of 4:12 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. That’s the lowest level since May 8.
Gasali forecasts the yield on the 10-year securities will reach
5.2 percent by year-end from the current 5.37 percent.  Overseas investors held a record 269.85 trillion rupiah of
local-currency  sovereign bonds  on Nov. 30, after boosting their
holdings by 19.5 trillion rupiah in November, the biggest
monthly inflow in finance ministry data going back to 2003.  The rupiah traded at 9,600 per dollar, after closing at
9,598 yesterday, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. Foreign funds pulled $56 million from local stocks
yesterday, exchange data show.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, climbed 10 basis points
to 4.75 percent today, the highest since Nov. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
