The zloty advanced after the Polish
central bank cut  interest rates  by quarter of a percentage point
in a sign policy makers will move gradually to reduce borrowing
costs.  The zloty added 0.3 percent to 4.1204 per euro as of 1:37
p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on five-year notes stayed two basis
points higher at 3.60 percent following the decision.  The central bank cut  borrowing costs  for a second month to
spur growth in the European Union’s biggest eastern economy,
which faces the risk of its first recession in two decades. The
decision matched the forecasts of 33 of the 35 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Two predicted a 50 basis-point increase.
Policy makers will explain the decision at a news conference at
4 p.m. in Warsaw.  “Predictably the zloty strengthened as this was pretty
much priced in,” Timothy Ash, head of emerging-market research
at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in an e-mailed comment. “It
leaves scope for more rate cuts and portfolio inflows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
