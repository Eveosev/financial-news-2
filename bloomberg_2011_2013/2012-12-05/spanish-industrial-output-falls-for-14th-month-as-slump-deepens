Industrial production  in  Spain , the
euro-area’s fourth largest economy, dropped for the 14th
straight month in October, fueling job cuts that have already
left over  a quarter  of the workforce unemployed.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 3.3 percent from a year earlier,
after declining a revised 7.5 percent in September, the National
Statistics Institute in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economists forecast a drop of 6.4 percent, according to
the median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .  Spanish unemployment will rise to 27 percent next year amid
a deepening recession, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said last week. The  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Commission have ruled out more budget cuts for
now as Spain struggles to rein in the second-largest deficit in
the 17-nation euro region.  Amper SA (AMP) , the Spanish manufacturer of telecommunications
and electronic equipment, said on Nov. 26 it plans to cut 210
jobs in the country.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the world’s second-
largest mobile-phone company, last month said that a 5.9
billion-pound ($9.5 billion) writedown in Spain and  Italy  caused
a first-half net loss.  In unadjusted terms, industrial production rose 0.6 percent
in October from a year earlier after a revised 12.1 percent drop
in September.  The statistics institute originally reported a drop in
adjusted production in September of 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
