Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, eclipsed $10 a share for the first
time since July 2011, cementing its status as this year’s best
performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Bank of America climbed 5.7 percent to $10.46 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York, bringing its gain for 2012 to 88 percent. The Dow
Jones benchmark has risen 6.7 percent this year, with Home Depot
Inc. in second place showing a 52 percent advance. Bank stocks
rallied today as  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest U.S. lender,
announced plans to cut more than 11,000  jobs  and pull back in
some markets, saving more than $1.1 billion annually.  Brian T. Moynihan , Bank of America’s chief executive
officer, has boosted capital, sold more than $60 billion in
assets and set a target of $8 billion a year in expense cuts.
Last year, speculation that Bank of America didn’t have an
adequate cushion against losses prompted a $5 billion investment
from billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and
the lender’s stock dipped below $5 in December.  Bank of America said capital under the latest guidelines
increased to almost 9 percent as of September, which exceeds
requirements under coming international rules. Moynihan said
yesterday he’s confident the company will pass new U.S. stress
tests. Chances for a dividend increase in 2013 are “much
better,” Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy &
Investment Group Inc., wrote in an October note.  The quarterly  dividend  has been at 1 cent a share since
early 2009 after Bank of America took $45 billion in federal
bailouts. The U.S. was repaid at the end of that year. JPMorgan
Chase & Co., the biggest bank by assets, and Wells Fargo & Co.,
the biggest home lender, offer dividends of more than 2.6
percent annually.  Boosting the dividend “will be on the table” after the
Federal Reserve stress tests in March, Moynihan told employees
in October. Regulators run the tests to see how well banks can
withstand recessions and economic shocks, and the results help
determine whether banks get permission for dividend increases
and stock buybacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
