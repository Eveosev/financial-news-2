Crude options volatility fell as the
underlying oil futures remained within a two-week trading range
of about $5.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.18 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:20 p.m., down from 27.49 yesterday.  “There wasn’t really much of a move in volatility,” said
Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New
York . “Some people come in and just buy some straddles on whim
because at some point, at least by the end of the year, we could
break out of this range.”  January-delivery crude oil fell 62 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $87.88 a barrel on the Nymex. Since Nov. 19, crude
has traded in an intraday range between $85.36 and $90.33.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $85 puts, which rose 4 cents to 57 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,761 lots at 3:28 p.m. February $79 puts were the
second-most active, with 3,031 lots exchanged as they advanced 8
cents to 64 cents.  Bets that prices would decline, or puts, accounted for 52
percent of trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 52 percent of
the 91,909 contracts traded.  January $85 puts were the most active options yesterday
with 3,921 contracts. They rose 8 cents to 53 cents a barrel.
December 2015 $150 calls fell 1 cent to $1.48 on 2,850 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,783 contracts. Next were January $60 puts, at 34,922 lots,
and January $110 calls, with 31,399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
