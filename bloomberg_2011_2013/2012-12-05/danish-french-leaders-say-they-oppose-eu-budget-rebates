French President  Francois Hollande 
and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said they both
oppose “in principle”  European Union members  receiving rebates
from the 27-country bloc’s budget.  EU budget talks collapsed last month, partly over disputes
about the rebate Britain receives.  Denmark  gets a rebate on its
payments toward the U.K., leaving France and Italy as the
largest contributors to Britain’s refund.  “I am opposed to all rebates, but as long as Britain
receives one, Denmark is entitled to ask for one,” Hollande
told reporters in Paris today after meeting Thorning-Schmidt.
“I don’t think it’s a good way to organize a budget.”  Thorning-Schmidt said that in a “perfect world” there
would be no rebates, “but it’s not fair that for every four
euros spent by our taxpayers, citizens of another rich country
pay only three.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
