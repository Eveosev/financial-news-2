Turkey ’s bond yields dropped for a
fifth day to a record as the central bank reiterated yesterday
it may cut interest rates after the  inflation  rate slumped to
the lowest in 14 months.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.7 percent at 11:51 a.m. in
Istanbul, the lowest since at least 2005. The lira strengthened
for a third day, gaining less than 0.1 percent to 1.7839 per
dollar.  “A measured cut” may be considered in its policy rate of
5.75 percent and overnight borrowing rate of 5 percent “in the
forthcoming period,” the  central bank  said to economists from
Turkish banks in a presentation published on its website in
Ankara yesterday. The  inflation  rate slid to 6.4 percent in
November, the lowest level since September 2011, the statistics
agency in Ankara said on Dec. 3. Benchmark yields have slumped
38 basis points in their five-day losing streak.  The central bank “again hinted at an interest-rate cut
this week,” Ercan Erguzel, an economist at  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “The latest inflation data
is the most important reason behind the steep fall in yields
over the past five days.”  Two-year lira note yields have plunged 531 basis points
this year, the biggest drop worldwide among  emerging markets .
Turkey’s Treasury sold $1 billion of January 2041 dollar notes
at a yield of 158 basis points over U.S. Treasuries due August
2042, pre-financing next year’s funding, according to a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
