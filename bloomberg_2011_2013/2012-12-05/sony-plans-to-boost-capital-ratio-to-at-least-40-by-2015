Sony Corp. (6758) , whose credit was
downgraded to junk by Fitch Ratings last month, plans to boost
its capital ratio to at least 40 percent by reviving its
business and converting bonds to equity.  The ratio for the electronics maker, excluding its
financial-services unit, may rise to 40 percent or higher in the
year ending March 2015 from 27.1 percent as of Sept. 30, said
 George Boyd , a spokesman for Tokyo-based Sony. Boyd confirmed
comments by Chief Financial Officer Masaru Kato reported in the
Nikkei newspaper earlier today.  Japan’s biggest TV maker is cutting jobs and selling assets
as Chief Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  tries to end a streak of
four straight full-year losses amid a strong yen, falling demand
and competition from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Sony raised 150
billion yen ($1.8 billion) selling convertible bonds last month
in its first offering of similar securities since 2003.  Sony  fell  0.8 percent to 787 yen as of 10:59 a.m. in Tokyo
trading, extending its decline to 43 percent this year.  The company will consider all possible measures, including
selling assets, to secure a profit for the fiscal year ending
March 31, Boyd said, confirming comments by Kato in the Nikkei
report. Sony, which posted a net loss of 15.5 billion yen for
the quarter ended Sept. 30, has  forecast  full-year net income of
20 billion yen.  Fitch cut  Sony’s long-term rating  by three levels to BB-,
three steps below investment grade, on Nov. 22, citing the TV
maker’s loss of technology leadership in key products, high
competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets and
the strong Japanese currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
