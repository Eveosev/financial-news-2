Uruguay’s government sees inflation
slowing to less than 8.5 percent by the end of this year, Andres Masoller, head of the  Economy Ministry ’s macroeconomic
department, said today.  While November’s 0.35 percent rise in consumer prices,
which took the year-on-year rate to 9.03 percent, was higher
than expected, the government expects to close the year with
inflation “closer to 8 percent than to 9 percent,” Masoller
said at a business forum in Montevideo.  In October, Uruguay’s government reached an accord with
retailers to reduce the price of a basket of 200 goods by 10
percent and freeze those of other items.  “There is a delay in seeing the effects,” Masoller said.
“We believe the country is moving toward slower inflation in
coming months.”  The Economy Ministry doesn’t rule out further measures to
rein in price increases, Masoller added.  On Sept. 28, the central bank increased its benchmark
 interest rate  as solid domestic demand and rising global
commodity prices convinced policy makers that inflation could
quicken.  The bank’s five-member policy committee is due to meet
again by the end of this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
