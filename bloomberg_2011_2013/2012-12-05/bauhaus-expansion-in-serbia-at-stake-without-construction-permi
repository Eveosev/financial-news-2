Bauhaus AG , the owner of do-it-
yourself chain of stores, has canceled its plans to open outlets
in  Serbia  as its local partner has not obtained construction
permits.  “Because Delta was not able to deliver the converted plot
in a reasonable time, the primary precondition of the contract
has not been fulfilled and the contract was terminated” as of
the end of last week, Helmut Diewald, the international
expansion manager for Bauhaus, said in an updated version of an
e-mailed statement sent earlier today.  Delta Real Estate, part of Serbia’s  Delta Holding , said
there were delays in converting the  land use  by October, holding
up building permissions, according to a statement e-mailed today
by the Belgrade-based company owned by Serbian billionaire
Miroslav Miskovic.  Miskovic was questioned this week by the police and the
Prosecutor’s Office for Organized Crime about his land-buying
business, which includes the site for the first Bauhaus store.  To contact the reporter on this story:
