Japanese  stocks  rose on optimism
 China  will encourage domestic demand and spend more to expand
cities. Shares fell earlier after U.S. President Barack Obama
held firm on calling for higher taxes on top earners in budget
negotiations to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  Fanuc Corp., a maker of robotics used in Chinese factories,
advanced 0.7 percent. Fast Retailing Co., Asia’s biggest apparel
seller, advanced 3 percent after domestic sales at its Uniqlo
chain jumped.  Sharp (6753)  Corp. advanced 4 percent after the
television maker said it plans to raise 9.9 billion yen ($121
million) selling shares to Qualcomm Inc.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  fell
0.7 percent after sales in China declined last month.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbed 0.4 percent to
9,468.84 at the 3 p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo  after falling
as much as 0.6 percent. The equity gauge capped the biggest
monthly gain since February last month on speculation Japan’s
opposition will win the Dec. 16 election and call for more
stimulus. The broader Topix Index was little changed at 781.86,
without about three stocks rising for every two that fell.  China has been showing that “we can expect a bottoming out
of the economy and a recovery,” said Shintaro Shinohara, who
helps oversee about 11 trillion yen as the head of equity
investment at Prudential Investment Management  Japan  Co. “The
U.S. fiscal cliff is an important problem but it’s not shocking.
They will probably compromise during their talks. However right
now, the negotiations have stalled and some investors feel they
can’t be positive about the outlook.”  Stock Valuations  The Topix traded at 0.9 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Shares linked to China rose on a Xinhua News Agency report
yesterday that the nation will expand domestic demand and
actively promote urbanization to encourage more people to move
to cities. The government will also focus on simplifying
property taxes, the report said, according to a China National
Radio yesterday citing Liu Heng, a scholar with the Central
University of Finance and Economics.  Fanuc rose 0.7 percent to 13,990 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , which
gets 14 percent of its sales from China, gained 0.7 percent to
1,856 yen.  Fast Retailing, Sharp  Among other shares that rose, Fast Retailing advanced 3
percent to 19,250 yen. Same-store sales at its Uniqlo stores in
Japan jumped 14 percent in November as colder weather drives
demand, the company said.  Sharp advanced 3.5 percent to 180 yen, its highest since
Oct. 4. The loss-making company said it will sell 30.12 million
shares at 164 yen each to San Diego-based Qualcomm this month
for a 2.6 percent stake, and may sell an additional 4.94 billion
yen of stock if certain conditions are met.  Futures on the S&P 500 climbed 0.5 percent today. The index
lost 0.2 percent yesterday as President  Barack Obama  said in a
Bloomberg Television interview that the Republican offer on
resolving the fiscal cliff won’t raise the revenue needed to
shrink the deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade.  The president said he’s willing to make further cuts in
entitlements while insisting Republicans accept higher tax rates
for top earners if the U.S. is to avoid $600 billion of
automatic spending cuts and tax increases at the start of 2013.  ‘About Politics’  “It’s all about politics,” said Masahiko Ejiri, a Tokyo-
based fund manager for Mizuho Asset Management Co. “Investors
are adjusting their positions after stocks rose a bit too much
recently. With the U.S. fiscal cliff issue, investors are having
to buy and sell without really knowing how it’s going to pan
out.”  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 0.8
percent to 17.47 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 5 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Automakers declined. Honda lost 0.7 percent to 2,705 yen
after its China auto sales slumped about 30 percent last month.
Toyota Motor Corp. fell 0.3 percent to 3,500 yen on a report one
of its Scion coupes crashed into a road barrier on a highway to
 Shanghai  last month after the cruise control failed to
disengage, according to a Dragon Television.  To contact the reporters on this story:
