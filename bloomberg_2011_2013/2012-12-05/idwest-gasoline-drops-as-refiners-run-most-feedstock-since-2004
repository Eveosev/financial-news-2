Gasoline weakened in the Midwest as
U.S. refineries processed the most oil for this time of year
 since 2004  amid a glut of supply and strong margins.  Refiners increased inputs and other feedstocks by 2.2
percent to 15.4 million barrels a day in the seven days ended
Nov. 30, the fourth consecutive weekly advance, the Energy
Department reported. Stockpiles of motor gasoline in the
Midwest, known as PADD 2, gained 2.21 million barrels to 47.2
million, the biggest increase since January 2010, the data show.  U.S. refiners are processing more crude oil to take
advantage of  higher profit  margins as domestic oil production
has jumped to the highest level since 1994 and crude prices have
fallen 11 percent this year.  Conventional gasoline in the Midcontinent, or Group 3
market, fell 1.75 cents to 14.63 cents a gallon below futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:35 p.m. Conventional
gasoline for ethanol blending, or CBOB, in  Chicago  slipped 1
cent to a 12-cent premium to futures.  “There’s a lot more gasoline pouring into PADD 2,” said
Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
 Kansas City ,  Missouri . “Refiners are enjoying a real windfall
of margins because they’re able to access the domestic crudes.”  The 5-3-2 crack spread, a measure of refining
profitability, for Midwest gasoline and diesel over West Texas
Intermediate was $36.86 a barrel at 2:57 p.m., down from $41.64
yesterday. That’s still the highest for this time of year since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2006 and almost triple a
year ago.  “They have every incentive to run as hard as they can,”
Adam said in a phone interview today.  Distillate Supplies  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Group 3, which stretches from
 Oklahoma  to  Minnesota , gained 0.25 cent to 1.13 cents a barrel
over heating oil futures on Nymex, while the fuel retreated 1.25
cents to a premium of 10.50 cents in the Chicago region.  Supplies of  distillate fuel , including heating oil and
diesel, rose 871,000 barrels to 25.2 million in the Midwest, the
first gain in four weeks. Even with the increase, stockpiles are
hovering at the lowest  seasonal level  since 2006.  Midwest refineries have the capacity to process as much as
3.71 million barrels a day, according to Energy Department data
compiled by Bloomberg. BP Plc’s  Whiting refinery , the largest
plant in the region, continues to operate without its biggest
crude unit as work is under way.  To contact the reporter on this story:
