Nouriel Roubini , co-founder of
Roubini Global Economics LLC, said the fiscal compact will
deepen the euro area recession next year, even as countries such
 Germany  and Austria will be obliged to cut deficits.  “Next year we are also going to have austerity in the core
of the euro area because the newly agreed fiscal compact says
that even Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Finland and Austria
have to cut their deficits,” Roubini told reporters at a
conference today in Berlin organized by  IG Metall , Germany’s
biggest trade union. “With austerity in the U.S and in  Japan ,
the risk is that this is going to push the global economy in
another downturn.”  The recession in the 17-nation euro bloc isn’t going to
bottom out this year and will continue “for at least another
year” Roubini said in a speech at the conference. Further
impairing the recovery in the euro area’s peripheral countries
is the  European Central Bank ’s inability to weaken the currency,
making Germany at the same time “ueber-competitive,” Roubini
said.  Referring to France, Roubini said economic data suggests
the country will enter into a recession next year, while
Germany’s economy will slow down with falling demand from euro-
area partners and export growth slowing to Asia.  Even though the risk of a euro area break-up has decreased
since the ECB announcement of an unlimited bond-buying program,
Roubini said European leaders need to make  job creation  and
growth a priority.  “People know that they have to make sacrifices, but after
four to five years of recession you need to see light at the end
of the tunnel,” Roubini said in the speech. “If there is no
economic growth, eventually the social backlash against
austerity is going to become too big.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
