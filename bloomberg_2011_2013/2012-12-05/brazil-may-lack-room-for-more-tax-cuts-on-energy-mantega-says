Brazil  may not be able to reduce
federal taxes on electricity by enough to to reach its goal of
lowering power bills by 20 percent next year, Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  said today.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government offered compensation
for companies that cut prices now in exchange for renewing
contracts set to expire through 2017.  Cia Energetica de Sao
Paulo ,  Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais ,  Cia Paranaense de Energia 
and Centrais Eletricas de  Santa Catarina (CLSC4)  missed the deadline to
sign concession renewals.  “We are still studying how to get to 20 percent,” Mantega
told reporters today. “The government has a limit of tax
reductions, but we will find a solution.”  Nelson Hubner, head of the electricity regulator, told
reporters today that 20 percent is still the target and that any
help in terms of lower state taxes “would be welcome.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
