Kevin Durant  had 32 points and
 Russell Westbrook  added 25 points and nine assists as the
Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the host Brooklyn Nets 117-111.  The Thunder (15-4) hit 61 percent of their shots at the
Barclays Center for their sixth straight win in the National
Basketball Association.  Deron Williams  had 33 points to lead the
Nets (11-6), who had a six-game home winning streak snapped.  The Nets played without leading scorer Brook Lopez, their
starting center, who is sidelined with a sprained right foot.
Brooklyn fell 1 1/2 games behind the New York Knicks in the
Eastern Conference’s Atlantic division.  Oklahoma City has a 5 1/2 game lead atop the Western
Conference’s Northwest division.  The  Washington Wizards  won their second game of the season,
105-101 against the defending champion Miami Heat (12-4), who
got a triple-double from LeBron James -- 26 points, 13 rebounds
and 11 assists. Jordan Crawford had 22 points off the bench for
the Wizards (2-13).  The Knicks, who play tonight at Charlotte, travel to Miami
tomorrow to face a Heat team that is undefeated in eight home
games so far this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
