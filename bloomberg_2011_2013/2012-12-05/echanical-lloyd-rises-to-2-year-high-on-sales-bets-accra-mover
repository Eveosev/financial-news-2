Mechanical Lloyd Co. (MLC) , a distributer
and repairer of vehicles and farm machines, rose to the highest
in more than two years as investors bet revenue growth will
accelerate for the full year.  The stock gained 15 percent to close at 15 pesewas in the
capital, Accra, the highest since Sept. 16, 2010. One hundred
and fifty thousand shares changed hands, almost six times the
three-month daily average.  “We expect full-year revenue growth of 20 percent, higher
than the nine-month growth rate,” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi, a
stock trader at  Merban Stockbrokers Ltd.  in Accra, said by phone
today. “The company benefited from the purchase of 4 by 4
vehicles by political parties.”  Revenue climbed 17 percent during the nine months through
September to 30.7 million cedis ($16 million), the company said
on Oct. 25. Net income increased 29 percent to 2.2 million
cedis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
