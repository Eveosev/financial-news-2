European Union carbon permits for
December were stable after reaching a record low as nations in
the bloc prepare to decide whether to support a plan by the
regulator to temporarily withhold supply to help mend a glut.  The benchmark futures contract dropped as much as 1.9
percent to 5.61 euros ($7.36) a metric ton on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the lowest since the contract first
traded in April 2005, and was up 1 cent at 5.73 euros at 8:13
a.m.  Carbon dropped 26 percent in the past year as recession
reduced demand and supply of United Nations offsets surged. The
bloc has already started selling allowances for next year, with
about 20 million tons a week of supply expected starting next
month, at least until nations agree the glut plan, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Under the European Commission’s plan, 900 million tons of
allowances would be removed from the market in the three years
through 2015 and returned near the end of the decade.  The Brussels regulator on Nov. 30 called for nations in the
bloc to reveal their positions on the proposal, which would
reduce supply by the equivalent of almost a half a year’s full
supply. Still, a Dec. 13 Climate Change Committee meeting of
national representatives won’t ask countries to adopt a formal
opinion or vote, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
