Agricultural land represents an $8.4
trillion market, of which institutional investors own about $30
billion to $40 billion, according to Macquarie Agricultural
Funds Management.  Farmland has attracted “very little” institutional
capital, said Sydney-based Tim Hornibrook, an executive director
and co-head of the fund that manages 3.6 million hectares (8.89
million acres) of farmland. Agricultural land for investment is
valued at $1 trillion, according to the fund, which has more
than A$1 billion ($1.05 billion) in the industry.  “There is a perception that there are billions of dollars
going into the asset class, but that’s not the case,”
Hornibrook said in an interview in  London  yesterday.  Investors are looking for low political risks in farm
investments as they need to get used to agriculture risks first,
Hornibrook said. This narrows attractive farmland to a “small
universe,” he said.  Macquarie Agricultural Funds Management has farms in
Australia and  Brazil  producing goods ranging from grains to
sheep to wool and almonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
