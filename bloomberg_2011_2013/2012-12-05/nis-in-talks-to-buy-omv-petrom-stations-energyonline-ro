Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , is
in talks to buy 60 gas stations from Romania’s  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,
 energyonline.ro  reported, citing unidentified industry people.  The companies are very close to reaching a deal on the sale
of the gas stations in Romania and a final decision is expected
from  OMV AG (OMV) , Petrom’s majority owner, according to the
unidentified people cited by energyonline.ro news website.
Petrom, which also tried to sell its gas stations in Moldova,
didn’t receive any offers for them, energyonline.ro said.  OMV, which signed an agreement to sell its unit in Bosnia-
Herzegovina to NIS and is selling its retail and commercial
business in Croatia, hasn’t made further decisions to sell
refining and marketing assets, Petrom said in an e-mailed
response to  Bloomberg News  today.  “As a general rule, we do not comment on rumors,” the
company said in the statement. “In view of a very tough
business environment, OMV has decided to look at how the
refining and marketing portfolio could be optimized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
