Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS)  hasn’t
sold Colombia’s Caracol Radio, the company’s head of investor
relations Pilar Gil said in response to an e-mailed question.  Former Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos said in a
telephone interview yesterday that Prisa sold the broadcaster to
 Luis Carlos Sarmiento  Angulo, Colombia’s richest man. Santos, a
former news director for RCN Radio, declined to say how he
obtained the information.  Sarmiento Angulo, chairman of  Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores 
SA, is the world’s 43rd richest individual with a fortune of
$16.6 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .
Earlier this year, Sarmiento bought a 55 percent stake in
Colombian media group Casa Editorial El Tiempo SA to increase
his stake in El Tiempo to 88.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
