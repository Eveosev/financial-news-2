Logum Logistica SA, a joint venture
building a 1,300-kilometer (808-mile) ethanol pipeline in
 Brazil , fired Chief Executive Officer Alberto da Fonseca
Guimaraes last month, O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper  reported 
today without saying where it got the information.  Guimaraes’s dismissal came after an Oct. 26 interview with
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper in which he said Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company that owns 20
percent of Logum, won’t provide financial support for the
project next year. The news prompted concern that the project
may be delayed or scaled back.  Guimaraes was replaced by Roberto Goncalves, another Logum
employee, according to the article, which didn’t give his
previous title. A Logum spokeswoman didn’t reply to telephone
calls or e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
