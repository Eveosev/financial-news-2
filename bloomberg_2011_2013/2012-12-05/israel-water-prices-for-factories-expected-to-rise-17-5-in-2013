The Israel Water Authority is
expected to raise the price of water supplied to factories by
17.5 percent starting Jan. 1, the Manufacturers Association
said, calling on the government to halt the planned price rise.  The manufacturers said today in an e-mailed statement that
such a jump in the industrial water bill would boost consumer
prices, including food and toiletry costs. The association said
the increase would raise manufacturersâ€™ water costs in 2013 by
100 million shekels ($26.3 million) to 700 million shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
