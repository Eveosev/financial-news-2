A shareholder of  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) ,  the
third-largest Asia-based insurer, is selling a $360 million
stake in the company, according to a term sheet obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Mount Swettenham Investments is offering 92.4 million
shares at HK$29.84 to HK$30.20 apiece, the document shows. AIA
shares, which have surged more than 15 percent in the past three
months, closed at HK$30.20 in Hong Kong yesterday.  The seller is a unit of Malaysian state investment company
Khazanah Nasional Bhd, IFR  reported , citing a term sheet.  The share sale precedes the lifting of a restriction
preventing  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  from selling its
remaining 13.7 percent stake in AIA. AIG, currently AIAâ€™s
largest shareholder, will be free to sell its stake after Dec.
10, the company said on Sept. 6.  AIG, recipient of a U.S. bailout in 2008, sold $2 billion
AIA Group shares in September. New York-based AIG held a 33
percent stake in AIA after selling the rest in an October 2010
initial public offering which raised $20.5 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
