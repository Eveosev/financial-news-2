Taiwan ’s government bonds gained,
pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to a one-week low, as
inflation slowed for a third month. The local dollar climbed
after foreign funds pumped money into the island’s stocks.  Consumer prices rose 1.59 percent in November from a year
earlier, the least since April, according to an official report
released today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 2.04 percent increase. The central bank has held its
 benchmark interest rate  at 1.875 percent since June 2011 and
will review policy again on Dec. 19.  “Inflation fell below the benchmark rate for the first
time in quite a while,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader
at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “The central bank will
probably keep interest rates unchanged next month.”  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was 1.132 percent, compared with 1.134 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the
lowest level for the benchmark 10-year rate since Nov. 28.  Global funds bought $59 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold yesterday, taking net purchases in the last four days
to $1.2 billion, according to exchange data.  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.079 against its
U.S. counterpart, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, advanced eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 3.30 percent.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
