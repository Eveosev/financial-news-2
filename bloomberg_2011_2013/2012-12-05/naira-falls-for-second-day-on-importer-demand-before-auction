Nigeria ’s naira depreciated for a
second day as importers demanded dollars before the central bank
auctions the U.S. currency today.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent to 157.225 a dollar as of 10:25 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has appreciated 3.2 percent this
year, the second-best performer tracked by Bloomberg in Africa.  “Dollar demand is rising for the festive season and is
exceeding supply at the interbank market due to a shortfall in
supply,” Sewa Wusu, analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital
Ltd., said by phone.  Demand for gasoline and consumer goods rises during
religious festivities in Nigeria, a nation of more than 160
million people with a population almost evenly split between
Muslims and Christians. The country relies on imports to meet 70
percent of its fuel needs because of inadequate refining
capacity, according to the Petroleum Ministry.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sells dollars to lenders at
auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to help keep the naira within
a 3 percent band around 155 per dollar. The regulator sold
$164.3 million at its auction on Dec. 3, the lowest since the
Nov. 14 sale.  The Abuja-based bank held its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record high 12 percent this year to ease inflation pressures and
stabilize the naira. Inflation, which accelerated for the first
time in four months to 11.7 percent in October, remains above
the bank’s target of less than 10 percent.  The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022 fell
two basis points to 12.18 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices on the website of the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs on the nation’s
$500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell three basis
points to 4.184 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8875 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  Editors: Peter Branton, Bryson Hull  To contact the reporter on this story:
