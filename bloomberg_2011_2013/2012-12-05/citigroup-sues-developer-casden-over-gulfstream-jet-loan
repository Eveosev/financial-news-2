Citigroup Inc. (C)  sued Alan Casden, a
Beverly Hills, California, real-estate developer, for
$43.4 million, claiming his company defaulted on the financing
of a Gulfstream 550 corporate jet.  A unit of Casden Co. took out a $37.5 million loan in 2005
to finance the aircraft, engines and related equipment,
Citigroup said in a complaint filed today in  Manhattan  federal
court. The loan was later increased to $45.9 million and was
guaranteed by Casden personally and by Casden Co., according to
the New York-based bank.  Citigroup said it declared the loan in default and demanded
full payment in a letter Dec. 3.  The developer’s Casden Properties LLC has built more than
$10 billion in residential real-estate projects over 45 years,
according to its  website .  A phone message seeking comment from Casden Co. on the
lawsuit wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is Citicorp USA v. Casden, 12-CV-8820, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
