Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, raised most of its January official
selling prices for customers in  Asia  and widened discounts to
European buyers.  The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , boosted
premiums for Arab Light and Arab Medium grades by 35 cents to
$3.30 and 90 cents a barrel more than the average of Oman and
Dubai grades, the benchmark used in Asia. It kept premiums for
its Arab Super Light and Arab Extra Light blends unchanged at
$8.05 a barrel and $5.65, respectively.  Aramco widened the discount of Arab Light grade for
northwest Europe to $1.20 a barrel versus the Brent weighted
average, or BWAVE. That compares with minus 20 cents in
December. The crude was set at a $1.05 discount in the
Mediterranean, compared with 55 cents less than BWAVE the
previous month.  Persian Gulf producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most of
their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of the
region’s state oil companies price their crude at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
