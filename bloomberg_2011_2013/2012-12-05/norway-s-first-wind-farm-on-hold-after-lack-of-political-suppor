Norway  put development of its first
planned offshore wind farm on hold until further notice, with
the company involved citing a lack of political support, a
setback in European efforts to boost renewable energy
production.  “The necessary support for offshore wind from political
leaders is absent,” causing wind power developer Vestavind
Offshore AS to halt the construction of a 350-megawatt wind farm
until further notice, Wenche Teigland, chairman of the board,
said today on the company  website .  Norway has some of  Europe ’s best conditions for wind power
production, with strong winds distributed across large areas and
the potential to install as much as 30,000 megawatts of offshore
turbine capacity, according to the country’s  energy and water
directorate .  Norway could increase annual electricity output from wind
power and hydro sources by 13.2 terawatt-hours over the next
eight years, and boosting the amount of renewable energy as a
proportion of total energy use by 7.5 percentage points from
2005 levels to 67.5 percent, according to a  study  commissioned
by the Norwegian power industry association.  In 2009, Vestavind Offshore obtained a license from
Norway’s ministry of petroleum and energy to build the country’s
first full-scale offshore wind farm, Havsul-1, in the central
region. The showcase farm was intended to produce 1 terawatt-
hours annually, enough to supply 50,000 households, and pave the
way for further projects.  “Either political priorities need to change, or we must
wait for technological developments to make offshore wind power
competitive,” Teigland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
