Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index closing at its highest level since August 2011,
after China’s government allowed insurers to invest more in
banks and after the nation’s new leaders pledged to maintain
growth and promote “urbanization.”  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. rose 4.9 percent as  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said it agreed to sell its stake in China’s second-
biggest insurer. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the
world’s largest lender by market value, climbed 2.5 percent.
 China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer, gained
2.5 percent.  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23) , Hong Kong’s largest family-
run lender, advanced 2.2 percent after agreeing to sell new
stock to Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 2.2 percent to 22,270.91, its
highest close since Aug. 2, 2011. All companies in the 49-member
gauge advanced, with trading volume 77 percent above the 30-day
average for the time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies climbed 2.9 percent to 10,830.04, the biggest gain
since September 14.  “There’s a lot of talk about potential policy support for
China’s economy,” said Tim Leung, a  fund manager  who helps
manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. “While
urbanization is not new, people will probably be focusing on
that trend. There’s a lot of positive benefit from urbanization,
like infrastructure spending.”  Relative Value  Hong Kong’s benchmark index advanced 20 percent through
yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added
stimulus and China and the U.S. showed signs of economic
recovery. Shares on the measure  traded  at 11.4 times average
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 13.5 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Hang Seng Index may surpass the key resistance level
of 22,200 from capital inflow into Hong Kong and the likely
bottoming out of  China’s economy ,” said Patrick Yiu, associate
director at Cash Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It’s
giving a clear and better picture for investors to invest in
Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index may have a chance to test a
higher resistance level.”  The Hong Kong-listed  iShares FTSE China A50 Index ETF ,
which tracks the 50 largest domestically listed Chinese
companies, gained 4.4 percent with volume more than double the
five-day average at the time of the day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The ETF rose the most since Jan. 17.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. The  S&P 500  lost 0.2 percent yesterday as President
 Barack Obama  said the Republican offer on resolving the so-
called fiscal cliff doesn’t go far enough and won’t raise the
revenue needed to shrink the U.S. deficit by $4 trillion over
the next decade.  Ping An jumped 4.9 percent to HK$60.50, the  biggest gain  in
the Hang Seng Index. HSBC, which rose 1.7 percent today, said it
will sell its entire stake for $9.4 billion at HK$59 a share to
 Thailand ’s Charoen Pokphand Group Co., removing investor
uncertainty. The sale price compares with yesterday’s closing
price of HK$57.65.  Other insurers rose. China Life Insurance Co., the
country’s biggest insurer, advanced 4.2 percent to HK$23.45,
while New China Life Insurance Co. surged 8.3 percent to

investment limits in commercial banks, according a statement
posted on the China Insurance Regulatory Commission’s website
yesterday.  Bank Shares Gain  ICBC gained 2.5 percent to HK$5.30, while China Minsheng
Banking Corp., a commercial bank, rose 5.1 percent to HK$7.99.  Bank of East Asia  increased 2.2 percent to HK$30.35. The
shares rose even after agreeing to sell new stock to Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking, raising HK$3.3 billion ($426 million) to bolster
its capital as it seeks to expand in mainland China.  Chinese developers and cement companies rose after Xinhua
News Agency yesterday said China will expand domestic demand and
actively promote urbanization to encourage more people to move
to cities. Separately, China National Radio reported yesterday
China will focus on simplifying taxes on property transactions.
That may lead to cheaper property transaction taxes, the report
said, citing comments by Liu Heng, a scholar with the Central
University of Finance and Economics.  “Lately the government had been relaying messages about
improving the economy, in particular its plans for
urbanization,” said Mao Sheng, an analyst for Huaxi Securities
Co. in Chengdu, China “We can see construction, cement,
property companies leading stock gains as we see a clearer
direction and roadmap for government reforms.”  Developers Rise  China Resources Land, a state-controlled developer, climbed
2.5 percent to HK$20.70 after Macquarie Group Ltd. said it may
record higher sales.  Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , a
builder that gets all its revenue from China, jumped 8.9 percent
