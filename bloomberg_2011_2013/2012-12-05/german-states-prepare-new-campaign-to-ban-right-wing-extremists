Germany ’s states renewed a campaign
to outlaw the anti-immigrant National Democratic Party almost a
decade after the country’s top court quashed a previous attempt
because of tainted evidence.  Interior ministers from the 16 states voted unanimously to
recommend the ban to state premiers, the government of
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania said  on its website . The ministers
cited risks to the legal prospects while expressing confidence
that more than 1,000 pages of evidence collected since April
will lead to a successful ban.  “The NPD’s goal is to eliminate our free, democratic
social order using aggressive methods,” Lorenz Caffier, the
state’s interior minister, said in the statement. “We can prove
the NPD’s unconstitutionality and brutal aggression.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has yet to support a
renewed attempt to ban the party, which has ties to neo-Nazi
groups. The chancellor has “serious concerns” about the
success of outlawing the NPD, government spokesman Georg
Streiter said, while the federal interior minister,  Hans-Peter
Friedrich , said the new evidence provides a “good basis.”  Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court rejected an attempt
by the state to ban the NPD in March 2003 because much of the
evidence had been given by government informants. New material
has been collected since April 1, when contacts with current
informants were cut, according to the ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
