Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a third
day, the longest losing streak in a month, on increased dollar
demand from oil importers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy declined less
than 0.1 percent to 86.07 a dollar and traded at 86.05 a dollar
as of 1:06 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at this level
will be the longest losing streak since Nov. 5, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling, which had support from dollar inflows from
the tea sector, has slightly weakened due to demand for dollars
from the energy sector,” Chris Muiga a senior dealer at
Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said by telephone.
“With demand for dollar picking up due to the festive season,
it’s expected to be on the back-foot going forward.”  Businesses usually import more products as they prepare for
increased sales during the Christmas and year-end period.
Christians account for 87 percent of Kenya’s 38 million
population, according to the CIA World Factbook.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya offered to sell 2 billion
shillings ($23 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements , a
bank official, who asked not to be identified in line with
policy, said by phone.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.4 percent to 2,690.5 a
dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling depreciated 0.1 percent to
1,604 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
