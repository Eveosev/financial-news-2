Philippine 25-year sovereign bonds
rose for a sixth day and the peso climbed to near a four-year
high after inflation eased to the slowest pace since June.  Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier last
month after increasing 3.1 percent in October, the  National
Statistics Office  said today. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 3 percent gain. The central
bank’s benchmark interest rate is at a record low following four
cuts this year and borrowing costs will next be reviewed on Dec.
13. There’s less need to stimulate the economy using monetary
policy, Governor Amando Tetangco said Dec. 3.  “Yields will still be down,” said Radhika Rao, an
economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “Inflation risks are
very much contained” and there is little need for borrowing
costs to be raised, she said.  The yield on the 6.125 percent notes due October 2037
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.55
percent as of 4:19 p.m. in  Manila , according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. That was the lowest level since
the notes were issued in October.  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 40.852 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 40.840 on
Nov. 29, the strongest level since March 2008. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, was unchanged at 4.40 percent.  The central bank lowered the overnight borrowing rate to
3.5 percent in October, saying the cut would help address
capital flows. The peso has rallied 7.3 percent against the
dollar this year, the second-best performance among  Asia ’s 11
most-used currencies. Gross domestic product rose 7.1 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier, the most in two years,
official data showed last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
