A  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliner jet flown
by  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  made an emergency landing
after a mechanical issue with the twin-engine jet.  Flight 1146 from Houston to  New Jersey ’s  Newark  Liberty
International Airport was diverted to  New Orleans  at about 9:30
a.m. local time today, Christen David, a United spokeswoman,
said by telephone. She couldn’t elaborate on the reasons and
said the plane was still in New Orleans being inspected.  The Dreamliner, the world’s first jetliner built chiefly of
composite materials, landed safely after pilots declared an
emergency, she said. The jet carried 174 passengers and 10 crew
members, who were put on another aircraft to Newark.  “United will work with Boeing to review the diversion and
determine the cause,” David said.  The Seattle Times, citing recorded air-traffic control
transmissions, said the pilot reported an “electrical
malfunction.” According to the newspaper, a person at Boeing
with knowledge of the incident said electrical panels in the
plane’s electronics bays showed no sign of fire or arcing.  United took delivery of its first Dreamliner in September
and has three of the planes in service.  Lori Gunter, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, said
the planemaker is aware of the United incident and will work
with the carrier to “further understand the event.”  The Houston Chronicle reported the incident earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
