The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development lent 30 million euros ($39.2 million) to the
Serbian unit of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  for financing of small and
medium-sized enterprises.  The five-year  credit line  will support lending by Banca
Intesa AD Beograd, the biggest commercial lender in Serbia, to
private clients “in times of uncertain recovery,” the London-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement.  The businesses are seen as “the key driver of Serbia’s
economic recovery and the main vehicle of employment and export
growth,” the EBRD said. The economy is in its second recession
in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
