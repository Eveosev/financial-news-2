Global Investment House KSCC signed
formal agreements with all its creditors to restructure $1.7
billion of debt after the Kuwaiti investment bank won a U.K.
court’s approval and its shareholders agreed to delist stock.  The company’s core business will comprise about $3.5
billion of assets under management, investment banking and
brokerage businesses, Global said in a statement distributed via
the Regulatory News Service today. The majority of non-core
investment and real-estate assets will be transferred to a
special purpose entity, it said.  Global is among Kuwaiti investment companies that are
restructuring debt after the value of their assets collapsed and
frozen debt markets prevented them from raising new loans
following the global financial crisis. The company said Dec. 3
the  High Court  of Justice of England and  Wales  sanctioned a so-
called “scheme of arrangement” after three creditors declined
to approve the debt restructuring.  The restructuring “brings a comprehensive permanent
solution to the company’s capital structure,” Global said
today.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) ,  Commercial International
Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) ,  Gulf Bank KSC (GBK) ,  Kuwait Finance House (KFIN) ,  Standard
Bank  and Standard Chartered Bank comprised the coordinating
committee of creditors.  Global’s holders on Dec. 2 approved delisting the shares
from the Kuwait Stock Exchange to help it restructure the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
