Outfielder Jason Bay agreed on a
contract with the Seattle Mariners, less than a month after the
 New York Mets  bought out the final season of his four-year, $66
million contract, the  New York Daily News said .  Bay, 34, needs to pass a physical before his deal with the
Mariners is completed, the Daily News reported without saying
where it got the information. In Seattle, he would join an
outfield that includes  Michael Saunders , Franklin Gutierrez,
Casper Wells and Eric Thames.  Bay signed with the Mets after an All-Star 2009 season with
the  Boston Red Sox  and never regained that form in New York. He
had 26 home runs in three years with the Mets, a total he either
equaled or surpassed in five of his six Major League Baseball
seasons prior to joining the team.  The Mets and Bay agreed last month to buy out the final
season of his contract, making him a free agent. Bay played
college baseball at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington,
and resides in Kirkland, Washington, about 12 miles east of
Seattle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
