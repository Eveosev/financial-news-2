  Manchester United  has agreed in
principle to sign Everton midfielder Jack Rodwell for 25 million
pounds ($40 million), the Sun reported.  United manager  Alex Ferguson  tried to sign the 20-year-old
in January, but was told to come back after the season, the Sun
said. United was also told its initial 15 million-pound offer
was not enough, the newspaper said.  United has also committed another 15 million pounds to land
Aston Villaâ€™s Ashley Young and Ciaran Clark, while Ferguson
wants on-loan Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverly back permanently,
the Sun said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
