The Italian government may try to
convince a group of national investors to try to thwart an
alliance of foreign shareholders from gaining management control
of  Parmalat SpA (PLT) , newspaper la Repubblica newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The government is trying to convince another Italian dairy
company Granarolo SpA, Parmalat shareholder  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
and possibly a fund controlled by former Fiat SpA Chairman Luca
Cordero di Montezemolo to build a big enough stake to be able to
propose its own management list before a March 18 deadline, the
newspaper said.  Yesterday Mackenzie Financial Corp., Skagen AS and Zenit
Asset Management AB., which own 15.3 percent of Parmalat,
announced their candidates to run Parmalat in a list that
doesn’t include current Chief Executive Officer Enrico Bondi,
who helped the company return to the stock market after  Italy ’s
biggest bankruptcy in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
