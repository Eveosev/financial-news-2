Producers of “ Spider-Man:
Turn Off the Dark ,” said last night that the $70 million
show will officially open on June 14.  In order to put in major changes and allow more time
for rehearsals, the show has canceled three weeks of
previews, beginning April 19. Performances will resume
after May 11, the producers, Michael Cohl and Jeremiah
Harris, said in the announcement.  Previously announced opening nights were Feb. 18,
2010; Dec. 21, 2010; and Jan. 11, Feb. 7, and March 15 of
this year. The show has already been panned by many
critics, and four actors have been injured since rehearsals
began. Bono and The Edge of U2, who wrote the music, have
promised to write new songs for the show.  Earlier this week, the producers replaced the show’s
director and co-author,  Julie Taymor . If the production adheres
to this schedule, it will play six-and-a-half months of previews
and open two days after the Tony Awards.  The new date threatens to overshadow Broadway’s
highest-profile awards, the symbolic end of the season.  By delaying its opening, “Spider-Man” has taken itself
out of the running for this year’s Tonys, which are expected to
offer stiff competition from other new musicals set to open this
spring, including “The Book of Mormon,” “Catch Me If You
Can” and “Sister Act.”  To contact the writer on this story:
