Ukraine’s government will raise the
price of natural gas for households by 30 percent this year as
the country seeks to qualify for an  International Monetary Fund 
bailout loan, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  The increase will help cut the  budget deficit  of state-run
energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy to 8.5 billion hryvnia
($1.07 billion), Azarov said yesterday in remarks broadcast by
private TV channel Inter. Naftogaz’s budget will be balanced
next year, Azarov said.  The country first turned to the IMF in 2008 after the
global recession cut demand for its exports and the budget
deficit swelled. The nation received $10.6 billion before
payments were frozen when the government declined to cut
spending before presidential elections at the start of 2010. The
IMF approved a second lending program in July after Ukraine
agreed to trim the shortfall and raise gas prices.  Ukraine raised the price of natural gas for households by
50 percent on Aug. 1, and said it would increase it more,
according to the agreement.  Households now pay an average of 725 hryvnia per 1,000
cubic meters, compared with an average of $264 the country paid
for imported Russian gas in the first quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
