  Natixis (KN)  SA’s dividend policy will
be “lasting” if earnings allow it, French weekly newspaper
 Investir  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon.  The Paris-based company said Feb. 23 it would resume paying
a dividend after not paying one for the previous two years.
Natixis, the investment-banking unit of  France ’s second-largest
bank by branches, recorded the biggest net losses of any French
bank from the financial crisis. It will pay a dividend of 23
euro cents a share for 2010, the company said last month.  Natixis is “in no hurry” to exit its Coface SA credit-
insurance unit, Mignon also told Investir in an interview
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
