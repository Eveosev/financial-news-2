HSH Nordbank AG will resume paying
staff bonuses after the German regional lender returned to
profit last year,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing Stefan
Bruegmann, head of the bankâ€™s human resources.  Workers will get bonuses of between one and one-and-half
times their monthly salary on average while managers will get a
larger amount, the newspaper cited Bruegmann as saying. The
management bonuses will be paid over four years, Bruegmann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
