  Princeton University  defeated
Harvard University 63-62 at the buzzer in a playoff, returning
to the men’s national college basketball tournament after a six-
year absence.  Harvard, which claimed a share of its first Ivy League
title this season, was trying to reach the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament for the first time since 1946.  The Tigers (25-6) clinched the Ivy League’s automatic berth
in the 68-team NCAA tournament at Yale University’s Lee
Amphitheater in New Haven,  Connecticut . Harvard (23-6) and
Princeton tied for the Ivy League title with 12-2 conference
records.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
