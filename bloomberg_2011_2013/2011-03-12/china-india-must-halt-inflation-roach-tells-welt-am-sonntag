  Stephen Roach , non-executive
chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd., said China and India must
do more to halt inflation before it “gets out of control” with
“devastating consequences,”  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing
an interview.  If the central banks in the two countries wait too long to
halt inflation, they may be forced to raise  interest rates 
faster and steeper than if they move now, which could lead to a
“hard landing,” Roach said, according to an e-mailed article
that will be published in the German newspaper tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
