Soybean prices may rise this year
because U.S. farmers plant less and demand for  animal feed  and
cooking oils made from the oilseed will increase, said   Richard Feltes , vice president of research for R.J. O’Brien & Associates
LLC.  Farmers can make more money growing corn and cotton than
soybeans, Feltes said at a client conference in Chicago. Soybean
consumption will continue to expand from record levels in China,
the biggest global importer of the oilseed, because of increased
demand for animal feed, he said. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture is scheduled to report on farmers’ planting
intentions in a report on March 31.  “You want to be long soybeans before the USDA report,”
Feltes told brokers today. Speculative long positions are bets
prices will rise.  Soybean futures for November delivery, after the harvest,
fell 4.5 percent last week on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
contract has risen 39 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
