An estimated 4,000 people are
stranded in evacuation centers in the northern Japan city of
Sendai without food, water or heat as they await rescue by
helicopter, according to a city official.  The buildings are surrounded by a one-meter high heap of
rubble and dirt, said Makoto Nagai, 55, who is leading the
city’s crisis management team.  “People need help,” Nagai said.  Temperatures in Sendai ranged from minus 2.5 degrees
celsius (27.5 degrees Farenheit) to 6.2 degrees yesterday,
according to data provided by Weather Service Co.  “When the earthquake began, I was at my desk, and the
rocking never stopped,” Nagai said. “As the alert buzzer
brayed in the hall, cups and other things fell from my desk. An
even bigger quake followed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
