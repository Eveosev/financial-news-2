Czech Airlines had a net income of
120 million koruna ($6.9 million) last year, compared with a
loss of 3.76 billion koruna in 2009, after it sold a part of its
fleet,  Mlada Fronta Dnes  reported, citing unaudited data.  The state-run carrier based in  Prague , also known as Ceske
Aerolinie AS, cut its operating loss to 1.13 billion koruna from
3.22 billion by selling some aircraft, ending some services and
cutting hundreds of jobs, the Czech-language newspaper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
