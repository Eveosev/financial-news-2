The European Union will hold a
meeting with atomic safety authorities “early next week” to
determine what action needs to be taken following an explosion
at a nuclear power station north of Tokyo.  “If required, pro-active actions will be taken to address
to situation in the EU,” the  European Commission  said in an e-
mailed statement.  Next week’s meeting, which will also involve nuclear plant
constructors and operators, will “assess the consequences of
the accident as well as the lessons that can be drawn from the
events in Japan,” the Brussels-based commission said.  Japanese officials said the No. 1 reactor at the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear power station may melt down as a result of the
explosion, which followed yesterday’s record earthquake. The
 International Atomic Energy Agency  has said authorities in Japan
are making preparations to distribute iodine to residents in the
area of the plant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
