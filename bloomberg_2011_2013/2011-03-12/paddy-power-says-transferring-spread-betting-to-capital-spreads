  Paddy Power Plc (PWL) , Ireland’s biggest
bookmaker, said it is withdrawing from spread betting and
contract for difference trading, which allows customers to bet
on asset movements, such as stock indexes, without owning them.  Capital Spreads will take over the running of the business
and continue to operate the spread betting and CFD trading for
Paddy Power customers who wish to continue their accounts, Paddy
Power said in a statement on its web site.  The Dublin-based bookmaker said it made the decision after
a “strategic review” of its services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
