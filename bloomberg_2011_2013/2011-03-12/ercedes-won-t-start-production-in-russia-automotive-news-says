  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz unit has
decided not to start production in  Russia  as its sales volumes
in the country are still too low,  Automotive News  reported
today, citing Joachim Schmidt, head of sales at Mercedes-Benz.  While the company sold 19,700 vehicles in Russia last year
and expects growth this year, local production would only be
justified if Mercedes-Benz sells some 100,000 cars every year in
the country, Schmidt said, according to Automotive News.  Schimdt also told the newspaper that the company may add
more variations to its future A and B class model lines, such as
a three-door version of the A class and a convertible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
