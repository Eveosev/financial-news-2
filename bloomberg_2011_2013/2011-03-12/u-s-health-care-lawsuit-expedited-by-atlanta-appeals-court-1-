A U.S. appeals court in Atlanta put
on an expedited schedule the federal government’s appeal of a
judge’s decision throwing out the Obama administration’s health-
care law.  The court today granted a U.S. Justice Department request
to speed consideration of the administration’s bid to reverse
U.S. District Judge C. Roger Vinson’s Jan. 31 ruling in the
lawsuit, which was brought by 26 states.  Vinson, based in  Pensacola , Florida, decided that a
provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
requiring almost every American to have some form of medical
insurance starting in 2014 was unconstitutional. Deeming that
mandate inseparable from the legislation, he declared the entire
measure invalid.  Twenty five states joined in the lawsuit filed a year ago
by then-Florida Attorney General  Bill McCollum . The states have
told the court they will challenge rulings by Vinson narrowing
the issues in the case.  Briefs in the case have a May 25 deadline, the appeals
court’s chief judge Joel F. Dubina said in his order.  The court hasn’t ruled yet on a request by five of the
states to argue the case before the entire active roster of
judges rather than a three-judge panel.  The appellate case is  Florida  v.  U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, 11-11021 and 11-11067, U.S. 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals (Atlanta).  -- Editor: Fred Strasser, Peter Blumberg  To contact the reporter on this story:
