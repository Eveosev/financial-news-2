The government of  Muammar Qaddafi 
will punish Italy for “betraying” Libya by criticizing efforts
to crush a popular uprising and will consider turning to China
or Russia to replace Italy as the nation’s biggest trading
partner, Qaddafi’s son, Saif, told Italian media.  “The message for Italy is very simple,” Saif said in an
interview with media including newspaper  Corriere della Sera .
“The Libyan people are united and soon we will win the battle
with the terrorists and then we will settle our scores. It will
be very easy to replace Italy with China or Russia, you know.”  Saif Qaddafi said that almost 90 percent of the country was
back under the government’s control and that all oil and gas
facilities would soon be in the government’s hands.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Davis  in Rome at
