greater danger to insurers and pension funds than to German
banks,  Berliner Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with
Andreas Schmitz, chairman of the management board at HSBC
Trinkaus.  “The exposure of German banks in  Greece , Portugal and
Ireland is limited,” the newspaper quoted Schmitz as saying in
a preview of an interview to be published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
