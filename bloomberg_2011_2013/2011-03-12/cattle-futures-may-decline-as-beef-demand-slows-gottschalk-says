August live cattle futures may fall
as much as 7.4 percent by June as export demand slows and retail
beef prices at a record prompt U.S. consumers to buy more lower-
cost chicken and pork, said Andy Gottschalk, a vice president
for R.J. O’Brien & Associates LLC in Denver.  Higher retail meat costs and rising gasoline prices will
encourage consumers to spend less on beef, Gottschalk said today
during a R.J. O’Brien client conference in  Chicago . August
cattle futures, which closed at $1.18025 a pound on March 11,
may decline to as low as $1.09 by May or June, he said. Futures
rose 8.3 percent this year.  “There is a high probability the cattle price this quarter
will be the highest” of the year as consumers buy less beef,
Gottschalk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
