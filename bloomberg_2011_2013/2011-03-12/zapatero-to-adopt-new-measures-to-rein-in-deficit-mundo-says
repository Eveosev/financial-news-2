Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero may announce new reforms to ensure that  Spain 
complies with the European competitiveness pact and reins in its
deficit,  El Mundo  reported.  The objective of reforms that the government is studying
and will consult other Spanish political parties on is to
“strengthen the strict pledge to fulfill deficit targets,” the
newspaper cited the newspaper as saying.  Zapatero spoke during a press conference in the early hours
of the morning after meeting with Euro-area leaders yesterday,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
