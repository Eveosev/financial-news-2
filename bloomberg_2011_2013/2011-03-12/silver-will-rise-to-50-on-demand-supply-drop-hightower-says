Silver prices will rise to $50 an
ounce before the end of this year on increased global demand and
declining inventories of the metal, said David Hightower,
president of the Hightower Report in  Chicago .  Record gold prices will shift consumer demand to jewelry
made from the cheaper silver, especially in  India , Hightower
said today at a R.J. O’Brien & Associates LLC client conference
in Chicago. Investors also will boost purchases of silver to
hedge against inflation, he said.  May silver in  New York  has more than doubled in the past
year to $35.935 an ounce yesterday. Silver inventories held in
warehouses for delivery against New York futures fell last week
to the lowest since August 2006.  “We should see silver demand increase and we will reach my
$50 objective this year,” Hightower said. “Silver production
is not keeping up with demand.”  Hightower also said natural  gas prices  may double by the
end of the 2011 and could triple by the middle of 2012 on
reduced production. Natural gas prices are just above the cost
of production, and producers will reduce output as the discount
to crude oil boosts demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
