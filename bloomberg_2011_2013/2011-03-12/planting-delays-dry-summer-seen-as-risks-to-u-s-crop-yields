U.S. wheat, corn and soybean yields
may be threatened by wet, cool weather delaying planting and
heat and dryness beginning in July and intensifying in August,
said Joel Widenor at the Commodity Weather Group.  Snow depths of as much as three feet (91 centimeters) above 
normal from  Wisconsin  to Montana and north to the Canadian Prairies 
and a cool, wet forecast into early May will “significantly delay
timely planting” of crops, threatening yields this year,
Widenor, director of agricultural services at the Bethesda,
Maryland-based forecaster. Above-normal rains from Arkansas to  Ohio  will stall sowing this year, Widenor said.  Delays may be seen in “about a third of the Midwest and
northern Great Plains,” Widenor said at a client conference
sponsored by R.J. O’Brien & Associates LLC in  Chicago . “A dry,
warm pattern in April and May will aid planting in the rest of
the Midwest.”   Rain and warm temperatures in May and June will aid early
corn, soybeans and cotton crop development, Widenor said.
Warmer, drier weather will begin to build in July and peak in
August from  Louisiana  to  Iowa .  “Soybeans are the crop at the most risk this year,”
Widenor said. “Rains in May will probably come too late to aid
the winter wheat crop,” which is suffering after the 11th-driest
September to February period in 116 years, Widenor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
