The University of Louisville
defeated the University of  Notre Dame  83-77 in overtime to gain
a spot against the  University of Connecticut  in the final of the
Big East menâ€™s college basketball tournament.  The Cardinals and Huskies meet tonight for the title and an
automatic berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
championship tournament. If Connecticut wins the Big East, it
will become the first school to win five games in five days to
take the conference title.  Preston Knowles had 20 points to lead Louisville (25-8, 12-
6 Big East) past the Fighting Irish at Madison Square Garden in  New York  last night. The Cardinals outscored Notre Dame 11-5 in
overtime.  Scott Martin had 21 points, one of five starters to score
in double digits for Notre Dame (26-6, 14-4 Big East).  Kemba Walker had 33 points to lead  Connecticut  (25-9, 9-9
Big East) to a 76-71 overtime win over Syracuse. The last time
the schools met in the Big East tournament, in 2009, it took six
overtimes for Syracuse to win, 127-117.  The Huskies will be seeking their seventh title in 10 trips
to the conference final, which would tie Georgetown for the most
championships.  Scoop Jardine and Kris Joseph had 20 points each for the
Orange (26-7, 12-6 Big East).  To contact the reporter on this story:
