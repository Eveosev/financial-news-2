  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ’s controlling
shareholders will appoint Franco Bernabe, its chief executive
officer, as executive chairman and name two other executives to
help run the company, Messaggero reported, citing no one.  Marco Patuano will be named as CEO and answer to the board
of directors rather than to Bernabe, the newspaper said. Luca Luciani will be appointed as director general responsible for
South American businesses and will be under Bernabe’s direction,
the newspaper said.  The reshuffle comes amid a dispute among the company’s
biggest shareholders -- Telefonica SpA,  Mediobanca SpA (MB) ,  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  -- over whether to
limit Bernabe’s powers, the paper said. The four investors own
22.4 percent of Telecom Italia through Telco holding company.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Davis  in Rome at
