The  Southern Sudanese  army repelled
an attack today by a rebel militia on the capital of Upper Nile
state, according to army spokesman Philip Aguer.  “They are not in the town anymore, but gun shots are still
being heard near the airport,” he said by phone today from Juba,
the capital of Southern  Sudan .  The militia attack took place at 4 a.m. in Malakal, Aguer
said. No details have been received on whether there were
casualties in the clashes, he said.  Almost 99 percent of Southern Sudanese voters chose
independence from Sudan in a referendum that was the centerpiece
of a peace agreement ending a two-decade civil war with the
north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
