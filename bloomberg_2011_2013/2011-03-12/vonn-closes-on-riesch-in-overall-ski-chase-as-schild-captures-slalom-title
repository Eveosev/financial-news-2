Austria’s Mariles Schild captured
her third  World Cup  slalom title by winning today’s race in
Spindleruv Mlyn, Czech Republic.  Schild finished in 1 minute, 43.85 seconds over two runs to
beat compatriot Kathrin Zettel by 0.93 seconds, with Slovenia’s
Tina Maze 1.16 seconds back in third.  The victory moved Schild, who also won the title in 2008
and 2007, 111 points ahead of Finland’s Tanja Poutiainen in the
series standings with one race, worth 100 points to the winner,
remaining in the season. Poutiainen finished ninth today.  Germany’s Maria Riesch saw her lead over  Lindsey Vonn  of
the U.S. in the overall standings trimmed to 23 points heading
to next week’s World Cup finals in Switzerland. Riesch crashed
on her second run today as Vonn, seeking her fourth straight
overall title, finished 16th.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
