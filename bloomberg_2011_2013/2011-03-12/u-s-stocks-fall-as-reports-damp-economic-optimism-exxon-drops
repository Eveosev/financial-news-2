U.S. stocks fell this week, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the lowest level since Jan.
31, after American and Chinese reports damped optimism about the
global economy.  Equities pared their weekly decline yesterday as fuel,
metal and industrial companies helped the market overcome a
global slump that followed Japan’s worst earthquake on record.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  lost 3.5 percent since March 4, leading the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lower, as oil fell 3.1 percent.  Finisar Corp. (FNSR)  plunged 46 percent, driving down networking
companies such as  JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) , after its profit forecast
trailed analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 slipped 1.3 percent to 1,304.28 after closing
at an almost six-week low of 1,295.11 on March 10. It surged 28
percent between Aug. 26 and Feb. 18 before slumping 2.9 percent.
The Dow retreated 125.48 points, or 1 percent, to 12,044.40 this
week after U.S. jobless claims increased more than forecast, the
American trade deficit widened and China’s export growth slowed.  "We’ve had a long run of the market going up," said  Giri Cherukuri , a money manager and head trader at Oakbrook
Investments LLC in Lisle,  Illinois , which oversees $2.7 billion.
"It was more the trade deficit number that affected the market -
- the idea that the economy is not growing as much."  The  S&P 500  pared its 2011 gain to 3.7 percent this week as
the  bull market  began its third year. The benchmark measure of
U.S. equities has rallied 93 percent since sinking to a 12-year
low on March 9, 2009, amid government stimulus measures and
corporate profits that beat analysts’ estimates for eight
straight quarters.  Jobless Claims  The Labor Department on March 10 said applications for
first-time  unemployment benefits  rose by 26,000 to 397,000 in
the week ended March 5. Economists forecast claims would climb
to 376,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The Commerce Department said on March 10 the trade
deficit in goods and services rose 15 percent to $46.3 billion
in January as a surge in imports led by costlier oil
overshadowed record exports.    China ’s unexpected $7.3 billion trade deficit on March 10
was the biggest in seven years, buttressing the government’s
case against U.S. arguments for faster gains in the yuan.  Oil slumped 1.5 percent to $101.16 a barrel yesterday after
falling 3.6 percent intraday for its biggest drop since
November, as the earthquake in Japan shut refineries in the
world’s third-largest oil-consuming nation. Oil had risen to a
29-month peak on March 7.  ‘Fairly Resilient’  “There’s Japan, combined with continued challenges in
emerging markets and the bigger issue of what happens in the
Middle East,” said Bill McVail, a money manager at Berwyn,
Pennsylvania-based Turner Investments with $18 billion in
assets. “But the market is fairly resilient and able to process
a lot of negative macro data points in an orderly fashion, it
doesn’t feel like we have sellers out of control.”  Falling oil prices drove declines in fuel companies, with
the  S&P 500 Energy Index (S5ENRS)  losing 4 percent. Exxon Mobil, the
world’s biggest company by market value, dropped 3.5 percent to
$82.12.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. oil company, fell
3.7 percent to $99.93 for the biggest loss in the Dow.  Finisar, the U.S. maker of fiber-optic transmission gear,
tumbled the most since its initial public offering in 1999. It
said earnings per share excluding one-time items will probably
be 31 cents to 35 cents this quarter. Analysts predicted 48
cents a share, according to the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Finisar lost 46 percent to $23.21. JDS Uniphase slumped 22
percent to $21.26.  Semiconductors Fall  A gauge of semiconductor stocks fell 5.7 percent, the most
among 24 groups in the S&P 500, after Wells Fargo cut its
industry rating to “market weight” from “overweight,” citing
the 125 percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index
over the last two years. The downgrade “is more an indication
of a more moderate though still optimistic view of the sector
rather than any active concern about the chip stocks as a
group.”  The stock market’s drop doesn’t seem to have “significant
downside implications,” said Craig Peskin, co-head of technical
analysis at MF Global Inc. “Some indicators are getting to
minor oversold conditions. It’s not the start of a significant
decline, more like an interruption in the uptrend of the bull
market.”    Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S. wireless
provider, advanced 15 percent to $5 for the biggest gain in the
S&P 500. Deutsche Telekom AG has held talks to sell its T-Mobile
USA unit to Sprint Nextel Corp. in exchange for a major stake in
the combined entity, said people with knowledge of the matter.    AT&T Inc. (T) , the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, led gains in
the Dow with a 1.9 percent increase to $28.46.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) , the biggest U.S. lender by assets, posted the second-
biggest gain in the Dow, advancing 1.8 percent to $14.38.  To contact the reporters on this story:
