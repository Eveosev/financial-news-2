Paper maker  Sequana (SEQ)  SA expects a
“higher operating performance” this year compared with 2010,
Investir reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Pascal Lebard.  Even if the economic climate remains tough, Sequana will be
benefiting from the selling price increases it applied last
year, Lebard told the French financial weekly newspaper in an
interview. The cost of raw materials remains high and Sequana
plans to further increase prices in April and probably again in
June, Lebard was quoted as telling Investir. The company will
continue to adjust production capacity based on demand, he also
told Investir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
