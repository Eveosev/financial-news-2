The U.K. government may allow
businesses with 10 or less employees to exempt themselves from a
range of employment, maternity and paternity rights in its March
23  budget ,  Ed Balls , Treasury spokesman for the opposition  Labour Party , said in an  interview with the Guardian .  “It is ideological claptrap,” Balls said, according to
the Guardian. “They are going to say in the budget that in
order to get growth we have to dismantle the fair labor market
that makes it possible to balance work and family life.”  Unions shouldn’t stage strikes so that Prime Minister  David Cameron  “can blame a difficult year, or even longer, on the
trade unions and Labour taking Britain back to the 1980s,”
Balls said, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
