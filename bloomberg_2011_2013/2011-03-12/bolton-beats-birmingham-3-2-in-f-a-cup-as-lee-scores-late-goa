Lee Chung-Yong’s goal in the 90th
minute gave Bolton a 3-2 win over Birmingham in the
quarterfinals of English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  Lee, who came on as a substitute in the second half, scored
with a header at  St. Andrews  in Birmingham to send Bolton to the
semifinals for the first time in 11 years.  “As captain of this club, I just wanted it so badly,”  Kevin Davies , who scored the second Bolton goal with a penalty
kick, told ESPN. “It’s brilliant and we’ll celebrate tonight.”    Johan Elmander  gave Bolton the lead after 21 minutes, but
Cameron Jerome answered for Birmingham seven minutes before
halftime.  Lee cleared a ball off the line moments after coming on
before Davies, who earlier had a goal disallowed for offside,
scored from the spot after being taken down by Curtis Davies.  Kevin Phillips drew Birmingham even in the 80th minute when
he turned and looped a shot from outside the area over
goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. With time winding down, Bolton
sent a long ball into the area which Davies headed into the
center for Lee to nod past  Ben Foster .  Bolton last played in the semifinals in 2000 when it lost
to  Aston Villa  on penalty kicks. Birmingham, which last month
won the Carling Cup, was trying to reach the final four for the
first time since 1975.  Manchester United and Arsenal meet later in today’s other
quarterfinal match, while Stoke hosts West Ham and Reading
visits Manchester City tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
