  Hunter Mahan  held a one-stroke lead
after two rounds of golf’s Cadillac Championship in Doral,  Florida .  Mahan carded a 1-under 71 yesterday in the second round for
a 9-under 135 total, to stay one stroke ahead of the world No. 1
Martin Kaymer and Francesco Molinari as the players enter the
third round today at the TPC Blue Monster.  “Half the tournament is already over,” said Mahan, who
finished the first round yesterday morning with a 64. “There’s
a long way to go. It’s just weird how sometimes you have good
starts and poor finishes, and poor starts and good finishes.”    Tiger Woods , who has fallen to No. 5 in the world, finished
his first round yesterday morning at two-under 70 and shot a 74
in the second round to tally an even-par 144.  Sixth-ranked  Phil Mickelson  finished his first round at 1-
over 73 and shot a 1-under 71 in the second round to tie Woods
at 144.  The first round was suspended by darkness after a storm
ripped through the area, delaying play by three hours on
Thursday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
