Denmark must decide whether it
wants to commit to a euro area pact for greater economic
cooperation by a March 24 European Union summit,  Boersen 
reported today, citing EU documents.  Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said yesterday that
the pact was “attractive”, according to the newspaper.  Leaders of the 17 euro nations backed the plan late last
night. Denmark rejected joining the common currency in a 2000
referendum. The krone is pegged to the euro in a 2.25 percent
band.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
