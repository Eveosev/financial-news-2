Moody’s Investors Service may lower
its ratings on Spanish lenders and savings banks in coming days
after it downgraded  Spain ’s sovereign rating earlier this week,
Expansion reported, citing Moody’s analyst Kathrin Muehlbronner.  “Now that Spain’s sovereign rating has been resolved we
will publish our conclusion about the banking industry,”
Expansion cited Muehlbronner as saying.  Moody’s put 30 banks under watch on Dec. 20 and set a
three-month time limit to make a decision on their ratings, the
newspaper added. Moody’s downgraded Spain’s sovereign rating one
level on March 10 to Aa2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
