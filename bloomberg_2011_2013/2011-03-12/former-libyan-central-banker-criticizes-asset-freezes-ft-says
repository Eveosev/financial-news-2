Farhat Omer Bengdara, the former
governor of the Central Bank of  Libya , said freezing the
regime’s assets abroad would cause price inflation on the foods
the country imports, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Bengdara.  “If banks can’t make payments for imports of goods,
inflation will rise and you will have a black market,” Bengdara
said, the newspaper reported.  Bengdara was dismissed from his post this week by the
secretary of the Libyan general people’s congress, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
