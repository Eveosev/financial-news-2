Thomas Middelhoff, the former chief
executive officer of Arcandor AG, said any complaints made
against him regarding the bankruptcy of the company are
“completely groundless and absurd,” Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung reported, citing an interview with Middelhoff.  Under Middelhoff’s management, there would not have been a
bankruptcy, the German  newspaper  reported in an article that
will be published tomorrow, citing Middelhoff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
