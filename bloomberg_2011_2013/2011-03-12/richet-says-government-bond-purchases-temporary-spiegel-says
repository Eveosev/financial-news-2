The  European Central Bank ’s
purchase of government bonds is a temporary measure,  Spiegel 
magazine said, citing President  Jean-Claude Trichet .  “We won’t do this forever,” Trichet said, according to an
article that will be published in Spiegel tomorrow. “This
measure is, like all our extraordinary measures, temporary.”  The Spiegel article profiled Trichet in the run up to
yesterday’s summit of euro region leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
