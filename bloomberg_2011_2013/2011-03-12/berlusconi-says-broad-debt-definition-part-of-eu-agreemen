The European Union will include
private debt in gauging total government borrowing levels as
part of a package of measures aimed to improve the public
finances and stop the spread of the region’s deficit crisis,
Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  told Italian media,
including Ansa news agency.  Italy, which has  Europe ’s second-highest debt at almost 120
percent of GDP, has been pushing for a broader definition of
borrowing in new rules that will determine mandatory debt-
reduction goals. “Mission accomplished,” Berlusconi told
reporters this morning after a meeting of summit leaders in
Brussels to advance the agreement, which is due to be completed
at another summit later this month  To contact the reporter on this story:
