Japan ’s largest lenders are shifting
their debt portfolios to longer-maturity sovereign notes,
seeking to squeeze out higher returns and betting that central
bank buying will shield them from potential losses.  So-called city banks including the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. and Mizuho Bank Ltd. boosted holdings of Japanese
government bonds maturing in 10 years for a record fifth-straight month in September, while selling notes due in two to
five years,  data  released yesterday from the Japan Securities
Dealers Association showed. Five-year JGBs yielded 0.205 percent
today, while the 10-year rate was 0.62 percent, versus 2.61
percent for U.S. Treasuries due in 2023.  Longer-term JGBs have outperformed shorter notes since May,
a month after  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda more than
doubled the average maturity of debt the central bank buys as
part of its stimulus. Bank of America Corp. said the BOJ stands
ready to increase stimulus should the economic recovery falter,
a backstop it and other banks have called the Kuroda Put.  “JGB investors feel the urge to stay in the market as the
BOJ stuffs its face with bonds,” said Makoto Noji, a Tokyo-based senior debt strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., one
of the 23 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales. Because of their low yields “it’s no use for banks to
buy medium-term notes,” he said.  The BOJ introduced an unprecedented bond-buying program on
April 4 under which it buys more than 7 trillion yen ($71
billion) of  government bonds  with an average maturity of about
seven years. About half the purchases will be allocated to debt
maturing in five years or less, the BOJ  said  in May.  Note Sales  The city banks scooped up a net 1.24 trillion yen of 10-year notes in September, bringing total purchases since the end
of April to 3.17 trillion yen, the JSDA figures showed. They
last month bought 110.4 billion yen of JGBs maturing in 20 years
or longer, the most since July 2012.  In contrast, the nation’s biggest lenders remained net
sellers of two- to five-year notes from February to September,
offloading 11.3 trillion yen during the period, the JSDA report
showed.  JGBs maturing in more than 10 years have  returned  3.4
percent since the end of May, compared with a 1.1 percent  gain 
in one- to 10-year securities, according to data gathered by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  Consumer Prices  Government data will probably show on Oct. 25 that
nationwide  consumer prices  excluding fresh food rose 0.7 percent
last month from a year earlier, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The rate, the BOJ’s
favored measure of inflation, advanced to 0.8 percent in August,
the fastest pace since November 2008.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 1.2 trillion yen in 20-year debt today. The last offering of 2033 securities on Sept.
18 drew bids valued at 3.21 times the amount available, in line
with the average of the prior 10 sales.  The nation resumed offering 10-year inflation-linked
securities on Oct. 8 after a five-year hiatus. The difference in
yield between 10-year nominal debt and linkers, which  signals 
investor expectations of future inflation, was 0.992 percentage
point yesterday.  “We have to take into account the possibility of faster
inflation over the long term,” said Tadashi Matsukawa, the head
of fixed-income investment in Tokyo at PineBridge Investments
Japan Co., which manages about $1.1 billion in bonds. “ Baby
boomers  are continuing to retire. The decreasing number of
workers means a lack of labor, which makes wages more likely to
rise.”  More Stimulus  More than 70 percent of economists in a Bloomberg poll
forecast that Kuroda will add to stimulus in the first half of
next year. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration
will compile a 5 trillion yen economic package in December to
offset damage from an increase in the  sales tax  in April to 8
percent from 5 percent. The consumption levy is scheduled to
increase further to 10 percent in 2015.  “The Bank of Japan has already made a commitment to take
action should the fears of the tax hike’s damage to the economy
be borne out,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists Shogo Fujita and Shuichi Ohsaki wrote in a report this month. “It
seems safe to assume that such action would be along the lines
of the ‘Kuroda put.’”  Outstanding  bank loans  in Japan climbed in September to the
highest since April 2009, BOJ data showed. Demand among
companies to borrow rose in October, according to a central bank
survey released today.  Even so, growth in  customer deposits  has outpaced lending,
staying near a record high last month and giving the financial
firms excess funds to invest in government debt.  “Since there is limited scope for growth in lending, banks
have no other choice but to buy JGBs, even if yields are low,”
said Toru Yamamoto, the chief strategist at Daiwa Securities
Co., a primary dealer. “Banks have to go up the yield curve in
search for higher returns.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
