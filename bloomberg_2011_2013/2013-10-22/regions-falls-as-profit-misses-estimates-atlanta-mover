Regions Financial Corp. (RF) ,  Alabama ’s
biggest bank, fell the most in a year after reporting a drop in
quarterly profit as expenses held steady and mortgage
refinancings declined.  The stock was the second-worst performer among 81 firms in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index, sliding 4.9 percent
to $9.55 at 1:21 p.m. in  New York , the most on an intraday basis
since Oct. 23, 2012.  Third-quarter  net income  fell 5.3 percent to $285 million,
or 20 cents a share, from $301 million, or 21 cents, a year
earlier, Birmingham-based Regions said today in a statement.
That was 1 cent less than the average  estimate  of 27 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “While its net interest margin came in higher than
expected and loan balances increased, the company was unable to
reduce expenses in the face of lower fee income,”  Jason Goldberg , a Barclays Plc analyst, said in a research note.  Regions, led by Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, said
the lender is more focused on increasing revenue through its new
wealth-management business and has hired more than 100 people at
the unit.  “We need to grow our revenue, which is why we’ve made the
investments that we have,” Hall, 56, said in a conference call
with analysts. “Our goal is to generate positive operating
leverage.”  NIM Improvement  Net interest margin, the difference between what a bank
pays for deposits and charges for loans, expanded to 3.24
percent in the third quarter from 3.16 percent in the preceding
three-month period and 3.08 percent a year earlier, according to
the statement.  Mortgage income declined $17 million from the second
quarter and non-interest expenses totaled $884 million,
unchanged from the previous quarter. Refinancings slumped after
rates on 30-year loans jumped from historical lows of less than
3.5 percent earlier this year to an average of 4.32 percent at
the end of September, data compiled by Freddie Mac show.  Zions Bancorp was today’s worst performer in the S&P 500
Financials Index, plunging as much as 8.4 percent after the Salt
Lake City-based lender said yesterday that its third-quarter net
interest margin narrowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
