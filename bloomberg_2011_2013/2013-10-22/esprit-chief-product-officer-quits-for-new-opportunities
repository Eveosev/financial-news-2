Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the apparel
seller whose two top executives quit last year, said Chief
Product and Design Officer Melody Harris-Jensbach will leave the
company on Oct. 31, after two years in the position.  Harris-Jensbach is leaving for “new and broader”
opportunities, and will be a consultant to Esprit on several
projects next year, the company said in a Hong Kong exchange
filing yesterday. Esprit, based in the city, said it expects to
name a replacement “in the very short term.”  “The board regrets this decision but understands the
professional motivations behind it,” Esprit said. Harris-Jensbach restructured product divisions and overhauled product
development operations during her tenure, it said.  Esprit, which gets more than 78 percent of its sales from
 Europe , last month reported its first annual loss since its 1993
listing, due to sales declines, store closures and a drop in the
value of goodwill. The clothier has invested in advertising and
store upgrades as it faces competition from companies including
 Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Fast Retailing Co. and  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara.  The company lost two executives in June last year. Former
Chairman Hans Joachim Koerber resigned a day after then-Chief
Executive Officer Ronald Van der Vis quit. The departures fueled
doubt over the company’s ability to see a transformation plan
through. Van der Vis was replaced by Jose Manuel Martinez Gutierrez, a former Inditex manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
