Canada approved the development of
the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in Northwest Territories, a joint
venture between De Beers and  Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. (MPV)   Development was approved by Bernard Valcourt, minister of
aboriginal affairs and northern development, Toronto-based
Mountain Province said today in a statement. The move allows the
Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board to start processing
applications for water and land-use permits, the company said.  Located 280 kilometers (174 miles) northeast of
Yellowknife, the capital of Northwest Territories, Gahcho Kue is
49 percent owned by Mountain Province and 51 percent owned by De
Beers, a unit of London-based  Anglo American Plc. (AAL)   “Gahcho Kue remains one of the best undeveloped diamond
projects worldwide,” Edward Sterck, a London-based analyst for
Bank of Montreal, wrote in a Sept. 9 note to clients. De Beers
may buy Mountain Province to increase its ownership, he said.  Mountain Province rose 0.6 percent to C$5.05 in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
