Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index retreating from a five-month high, as investors
awaited delayed U.S. payrolls data to gauge when the Federal
Reserve will starting trimming record stimulus.  China Mobile Ltd., the world’s largest phone company,
dropped 3.4 percent in  Hong Kong  after posting its biggest
profit decline since 1999. Shinhan Financial Group Co. fell 2.9
percent after BNP Paribas SA was said to be selling shares of
South Korea’s biggest bank at a discount.  BHP Billiton  Ltd., the
world’s No. 1 mining company, gained 2.4 percent in Sydney after
increasing its forecast for iron-ore production.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell less than 0.1 percent to
143.62 as of 7:45 p.m. in  Tokyo , with seven of the 10 industry
groups on the measure retreating. The gauge closed yesterday at
its highest since May 21 as investors shifted their focus from
the resolution of the U.S. fiscal showdown to the timeline for
the Fed reducing bond buying.  “There’s a lack of catalysts,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a
senior market analyst at Monex Securities Inc. “Investors may
be on the sidelines to see the U.S. jobs data.”  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 0.8 percent.  Home
prices  in China’s four major cities jumped the most since
January 2011, heightening concerns a bubble is forming as the
government refrains from introducing more property curbs that
could hinder economic growth.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.5 percent. Japan’s Topix
index gained 0.2 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi index added
0.2 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex was little changed, and  Singapore ’s
Straits Times Index rose 0.5 percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  added 0.4 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
advanced 0.6 percent to extend a record high.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 3.7 percent this month
after the U.S. lawmakers ended the government shutdown and
raised the debt ceiling, while investors speculated the Fed will
delay trimming stimulus. The gauge traded at 13.8 times
estimated earnings compared with 15.8 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 14.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  S&P 500  futures  were little changed today. The U.S. equity
gauge rose less than 1 point in  New York  yesterday as investors
watched corporate earnings to assess the strength of the economy
before today’s employment data.  The Labor Department report will probably show employers
added 180,000 workers in September, the most since April, after
a 169,000 gain in August, according to the median estimate of 93
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report, originally due
Oct. 4, was delayed by the Oct. 1-Oct. 17 partial government
shutdown.  Fed Stimulus  The  Federal Reserve  won’t taper bond purchases until March
because the shutdown probably slowed fourth-quarter U.S. growth
and also interrupted the flow of data, according to a Bloomberg
survey. The monthly pace of asset buying will be pared to $70
billion from $85 billion at the Fed’s March 18-19 meeting, the
median of 40 economist estimates shows.  “It’s a good environment for equities because tapering
expectations have been pushed out to next year,” Sean Fenton, a
Sydney-based  fund manager , who helps oversee about $1 billion at
Tribeca Investment Partners Ltd., said by telephone. “We still
see markets trending higher and there’s nothing particular out
there that’s worrying us in the short term. Growth in the U.S.
is steady without being spectacular, so the support remains from
the Fed, with very easy monetary conditions.”  China Mobile sank 3.4 percent to HK$82.15, the lowest close
since Aug. 7. Net income fell 8.8 percent to 28.4 billion  yuan 
($4.7 billion) in the third quarter, according to figures
derived from nine-month results released by the Beijing-based
company yesterday. The profit missed the 31.1 billion-yuan
average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese Developers  Chinese real estate companies declined as surging home
prices spurred speculation the government may introduce
additional property curbs. China Resources Land Ltd., the
second-largest mainland developer traded in Hong Kong, lost 1
percent to HK$22.45. Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. slipped 1.8
percent to HK$13.28.  “The housing price data add policy risks to the market and
investors anticipate the government will probably tighten
controls over the real estate industry,” said Wu Kan, a
Shanghai-based  money manager  at Dragon Life Insurance Co., which
oversees $3.3 billion.  Shinhan Financial (055550)  fell 2.9 percent to 47,250 won in  Seoul .
BNP Paribas, which owns 6.35 percent stake in Shinhan Financial,
plans to sell part of its stake in a block sale, according to a
term sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News . The price likely to be
set between 47,000 won to 48,650 won per share.  BHP Billiton gained 2.4 percent to A$37.05. The miner
raised its full-year iron-ore production forecast to 212 million
tons from 207 million tons after output for the industrial
material jumped 23 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
