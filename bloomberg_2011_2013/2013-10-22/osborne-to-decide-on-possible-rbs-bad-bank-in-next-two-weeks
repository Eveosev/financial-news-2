U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said he’ll take a decision on whether  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  should be broken up and its toxic assets
spun off into a “bad bank” in the next couple of weeks.  “It’s the next big decision in my in-tray,” Osborne said
at a Reuters event in  London  today. “A lot of people out there
said we should look at the case for a bad bank. It’s clear to me
that we do need to address some of the problems at RBS.”  Osborne was speaking shortly after one of his deputies,
Treasury minister Sajid Javid, said at the Bloomberg  Dealmakers
Summit  in London that the government has yet to decide on the
timing and format of the sale of the remaining stakes in another
state-controlled lender,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)   RBS, which received the biggest bailout of any bank in the
world during the financial crisis, is still too weighted with
poor assets to be sold, Osborne has previously said. The U.K.
made a profit of about 60 million pounds ($97 million) on the
first sale last month of its shares in Lloyds, which the
government took on as part of its 20 billion-pound bailout of
Britain’s biggest mortgage lender in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
