West Texas Intermediate crude fell
below $98 a barrel on speculation that the government will
report U.S. supplies rose to a three-month high. The grade’s
discount to Brent was the steepest since April.  Futures dropped 1.4 percent. Inventories climbed a fifth
week, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts before the
Energy Information Administration data tomorrow. Stockpiles
gained 4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 11, the agency
said in a delayed report yesterday. Brent oil traded in  London 
rose 0.3 percent on concern that a labor dispute at a Scottish
refinery may curb the flow of North Sea crude.  “It looks like tomorrow’s report will show another big
build in supply, which would keep the pressure on the crude
market,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research at
IAF Advisors in Houston. “The market could be trading in the
low $90s before long.”  WTI crude for November delivery, which expired today,
decreased $1.42 to $97.80 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement since June 28. The more-active
December contract dropped $1.38, or 1.4 percent, to settle at
$98.30. The volume of all futures traded was 27 percent higher
than the 100-day average at 4:37 p.m.  The price decline accelerated after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported inventories rose 3 million barrels last week.
The December contract fell $1.50, or 1.5 percent, to $98.18
barrel in electronic trading at 4:36 p.m. It was at $98.21
before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent Futures  Brent oil for December settlement rose 33 cents to end the
session at $109.97 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe Exchange. Volume was 5 percent lower than the 100-day
average. The European benchmark traded at an $11.67 premium to
WTI for the same month at today’s settle, the widest spread on a
closing basis since April 15.  “The surging WTI-Brent spread seems to have put downward
pressure on WTI prices,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the
Schork Group Inc., an energy advisory company in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania .  Crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels, or 0.8
percent, to 377.5 million in the week ended Oct. 18, based on
the median of 10 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey. An
advance of that size would leave stockpiles at the highest level
since June 28.  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, will
release its report covering last week at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington . The EIA postponed the release of its Weekly
Petroleum Status Report scheduled for Oct. 17 after a 16-day
government shutdown led to the agency temporarily closing.  Market Fundamentals  “The fundamentals of the market aren’t that supportive,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’re looking for another
sizable build in tomorrow’s report, adding to what are already
ample supplies. We should see the builds continue for the next
several weeks.”  Scotland  is searching for buyers for the Grangemouth
refinery as the site remained shut for almost a week. The
refinery is supplying power and steam to  BP Plc’s (BP/)  neighboring
Kinneil processing plant, according Ineos Group Holdings SA, a
Swiss-based company operating Grangemouth. Kinneil handles crude
from the  Forties Pipeline System , gathered from more than 80
offshore fields. The FPS pumps about 45 percent of the U.K.’s
oil output.  “Brent is moving higher which is widening the spread with
WTI,” Armstrong said. “There are fears that the issues at the
Grangemouth refinery in Scotland could slash North Sea output.”  U.S. Payrolls  Futures climbed as much as 0.6 percent earlier as U.S.
Labor Department figures showed employers added 148,000 workers
in September. The median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for September payrolls to advance by 180,000.
The data was delayed by the government shutdown that also
spurred economists to push out expectations for the Fed to delay
trimming of its quantitative-easing program.  The dollar fell as much as 0.8 percent to $1.3792 against
the euro, the lowest level since November 2011. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 0.5 percent.  “Equities have been reassured by the end of the government
shutdown and the prospect of continuing quantitative easing, but
that’s not been the case with oil,” Cooper said. “The market
is under considerable technical pressure after taking out
technical support in the $102-$103 area yesterday. WTI then
broke through $100, which was psychologically important.”  Extending Decline  WTI may extend its slide below $100 a barrel through the
end of the year as U.S. supplies surge, tensions over Iran ease
and political wrangling in Washington continues, a Bloomberg
survey on prices showed.  “We broke below $100 a barrel yesterday and now that’s
going to be tough upside resistance,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “Given inventory gains, the market has a
strong bearish bias.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 20.7 percent, up from 19.8 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 716,860
contracts as of 4:38 p.m. It totaled 665,434 contracts
yesterday, 14 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.79 million contracts, the least since July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
