India will begin an eight-team Super
League in January to tap growing interest in soccer in the
nation of 1.2 billion people, organizers said.  Mumbai-based  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the
world’s biggest refinery complex; broadcaster Star India Pvt.
Ltd., a unit of Rupert Murdoch’s New York-based  21st Century Fox
Inc. (NWSA) ; and sports agency  IMG Worldwide Inc.  own equal stakes in
the venture, IMG said in an e-mailed news release.  The competition is scheduled to begin Jan. 18 and will run
through March with another phase of games planned for later in
2014. Each city’s team will have a marquee player, with a roster
made up of talent from India and other countries. The aim is to
help India, which is currently  154th  in FIFA’s world rankings,
qualify for the 2026 World Cup, according to the statement.  “Our objective is nothing short of creating a movement
around football in  India ,” Uday Shankar, Star India’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement. “We want to put India
on the global map.”  The model is similar to cricket’s Indian Premier League,
which began in 2008 and attracted the world’s best players to
compete in a six-week Twenty20 tournament. The Mumbai Indians
won this year’s final in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
