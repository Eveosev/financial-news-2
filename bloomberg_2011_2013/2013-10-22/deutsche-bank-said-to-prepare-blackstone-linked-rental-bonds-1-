Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is preparing to
market almost $500 million of bonds linked to rental payments
from homes owned by Blackstone Group LP, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  The securities are expected to include a portion with an
investment-grade ranking from at least one ratings firm, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because terms arenâ€™t
public.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit-Suisse Group AG also are
marketing the securities, the first of their kind backed by
rental payments from single-family homes.  Reuters earlier today reported details of the transaction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
