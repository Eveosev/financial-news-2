Canadian  stocks  rose for a sixth
day, the longest streak since April, as gold and silver prices
surged after U.S. payrolls climbed less than projected.  Detour Gold Corp. (DGC)  and B2Gold Corp. rallied at least 5.6
percent as the price of gold rallied to a three-week high.
Endeavour Silver Corp. surged 7.8 percent to pace gains among
raw-materials producers. Pretium Resources Inc. plunged 29
percent after an independent consultant that withdrew from the
company’s Valley of the Kings project said there are “no valid
gold mineral resources” at the site.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 99.33
points, or 0.8 percent, to 13,285.86 at 10:13 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark Canadian equity gauge has rallied 3 percent in the
past six days, extending a two-year high.  The U.S. added 148,000 workers in September, following a
revised 193,000 rise in August that was larger than initially
estimated. The median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 180,000 advance. The  unemployment rate 
fell to 7.2 percent, the lowest since November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
