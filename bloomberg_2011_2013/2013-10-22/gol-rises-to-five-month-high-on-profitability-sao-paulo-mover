Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazil’s second-biggest air carrier, advanced to a five-month
high after profitability rose last month.  The shares  climbed  6.5 percent to 11.96 reais at the close
of trading in  Sao Paulo , the highest since May 14. It was the
second biggest gainer on the Ibovespa stock gauge, which added
0.7 percent.  Net passenger income per available seat-kilometer, a
measure of profitability known as Prask, rose 23 percent in
September from a year earlier, the 18th consecutive increase,
Gol said in a regulatory filing yesterday after the market
closed. Domestic flights dropped 8.5 percent from a year ago as
the carrier seeks to better align capacity with demand.  The “rationalization strategy” is bolstering results,
Renato Mimica, Felipe Nussli and Samuel Alves, analysts at  Grupo
BTG Pactual (BBTG11) , wrote in a note to clients today. Sao Paulo-based
Gol is cutting costs, reducing its workforce as of June by 13
percent from a year earlier.  The shares have tumbled 7.3 percent this year as a falling
Brazilian real drove up costs for dollar-denominated expenses
such as fuel, plane leases and debt payments. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  is
down 7.4 percent and the currency has weakened 5.5 percent.  TAM Linhas Aereas SA, the Brazilian unit of Latam Airlines
Group SA, is Brazil’s largest air carrier by market share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
