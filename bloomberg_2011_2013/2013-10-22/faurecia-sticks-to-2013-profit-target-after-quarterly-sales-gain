Faurecia SA (EO) ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of car interiors, stuck to its 2013 profit target after third-quarter sales rose as growth in  Asia  and  South America  offset
weaker demand in its home region.  Backed by cost-cutting in Europe, Faurecia plans to improve
on last year’s operating profit of 514 million euros ($709
million), the Nanterre, France-based company said late yesterday
in an e-mailed statement, reiterating comments from July.  The manufacturer forecast 2013 revenue to rise to between
17.8 billion euros and 18 billion euros from 17.4 billion euros
last year. Sales in the third quarter advanced to 4.12 billion
euros in the third quarter from 4.09 billion euros a year ago.  Faurecia, 57 percent owned by  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , is
expanding in Asia and North America as car demand in Europe
slides to a two-decade low. The company, which also supplies
Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, said that conditions in Europe
were starting to pick up with auto production in the region
likely to rise 1.5 percent to 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  “The pattern is improving” in Europe, even though a
recovery to peak 2007 levels isn’t in sight, Chief Financial
Officer Michel Favre said yesterday on a conference call.
“Clearly, we will continue to be at a low level.”  With little boost expected from consumer demand in Europe,
the parts-maker is looking to boost profit by implementing
measures to cut costs in Europe by 50 million euros in 2013 and
100 million euros next year. The moves will lead to 90 million
euros in charges this year, including 39 million euros booked in
the first half.  Faurecia targets growth of 6 percent to 7 percent annually
over the next five years. The French company also has a goal of
becoming one of the top five industry suppliers in  North America 
with $7 billion in yearly sales there by 2016.  The Faurecia holding is the largest remaining asset that
cash-strapped Peugeot could easily dispose of. Favre said that
Faurecia’s management continues to run the company in a way the
ensures its independence. Peugeot has repeatedly said in the
past that the Faurecia stake is not for sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
