U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline tumbled to
a  three-month low  as refineries prepared to finish seasonal
maintenance and boost output at a time when supplies of the fuel
are at a seasonal high.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  in the Gulf weakened 2.5
cents to 19.5 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:01 p.m., the lowest level since July
19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The conventional
 CBOB grade fell  3 cents to 21 cents below futures.  Differentials weakened as the peak period for fall
maintenance neared an end, signaling that an increase in
production may soon add to supplies in the region. Refineries
including  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Lake Charles, Louisiana, plant and  Delek
US Holding Inc. (DK) ’s Tyler,  Texas , site are winding up work that
included a fluid catalytic cracker and an alkylation unit.  Stockpiles of gasoline  in the region, referred to as PADD
3, dropped 2.1 million barrels to  76.4 million in the week  ended
Oct. 11, according to Energy Information Administration data.
That’s the  highest level   for the time of year  in data going back
to 1990.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slid 27 cents to $11.14 a
barrel. The  same spread  based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil, the
Gulf Coast benchmark, dropped 67 cents to $8.74 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf was unchanged at a
discount of 5.63 cents to ULSD futures. The same fuel slipped
0.15 cent to a premium of 0.1 cent in the  New York  Harbor.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the Harbor
slid for a fifth day, dropping 0.95 cent to 0.25 cent a gallon
above futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
