Two-time Olympian  Ryan Hall  withdrew
from the Nov. 3  New York  City Marathon due to a hip injury, race
officials said.  Hall, 31, has battled injuries for the past two years. He
also withdrew from this year’s Boston Marathon and last year’s
race in New York, which was later canceled in the aftermath of
 Hurricane Sandy .  “In my zealous efforts to have redemption, I overstepped
the first and most important rule -- making it to the line
healthy,” Hall said in a  statement .  Hall, who finished fourth in the 2009 New York race, ran
the fastest marathon by an American two years ago when he
covered 26.2 miles in Boston in 2 hours, 4 minutes, 58 seconds.
Because of that course’s downhill terrain, his time doesn’t
count as a U.S. record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
