Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s second-biggest water company, won contracts to improve supplies and
reduce leak losses in southern and western India.  Suez and Indian partner  SPML Infra Ltd. (SPML)  will help cut water
leaks across a 26.5 square kilometer (10.2 square mile) area of
Bangalore, the utility said today in an e-mail. It’s planning
infrastructure works to curb unaccounted-for-water losses in the
high-tech city to 16 percent from 42 percent over the next five
to eight years, the French company said.  The utility was also awarded a contract in Pimpri-Chinchwad
near Pune in western India to detect and repair leaks in area
water-distribution systems. The contracts are worth 20 million
euros ($27.5 million), Suez said.  “India is one of the priority countries in emerging
markets and we plan to bid for more city-based water projects in
the future,” Shyam Bhan, Suez’s chief executive officer in
India, said by phone from Gurgaon, near  New Delhi .  Rapid urbanization has boosted demand for water in Indian
cities where Suez, Veolia Environnement SA, both from Paris, and
 Va Tech Wabag Ltd. (VATW)  are competing for contracts. India is
 spending  589 billion rupees ($9.6 billion) to improve area water
supplies and treatment systems, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
