U.K. stocks  gained for a ninth day
as  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rallied
after posting quarterly results, while a report showed that the
 U.S. economy  created fewer jobs last month.  Reckitt Benckiser jumped the most in more than 4 1/2 years
after third-quarter comparable sales grew faster than analysts
had predicted. BHP climbed the most since July after the world’s
biggest mining company reported quarterly iron-ore output that
beat forecasts and increased its full-year production estimate.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 41.46 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,695.66 at the close in London, its highest level since May 28.
The gauge has gained 3.6 percent this month as U.S. lawmakers
agreed to extend the government’s borrowing authority until
early 2014. The broader FTSE All-Share Index added 0.5 percent
to a five-month high today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated
0.3 percent.  “ BHP (BLT)  and Reckitt both provided decent results as emerging-market plays,” said Guy Foster, head of portfolio strategy at
Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd., which manages 28 billion pounds
($45 billion). “Either could have disappointed, given the
uncertainties surrounding the pace of the Chinese slowdown. The
numbers and improved guidance have therefore been greeted well
by investors.”  Reckitt Benckiser earned 24 percent of its sales from  Latin
America  and Asia Pacific in 2012, while BHP generated 51 percent
of its revenue from Asian countries excluding  Japan  last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Employment  U.S. payrolls dropped to 148,000 in September, falling
short of the 180,000 median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Employers hired a net additional 193,000
workers in August. The  unemployment rate  slipped to 7.2 percent
last month. Economists had projected joblessness would remain at
7.3 percent. The government shutdown delayed the Labor
Department data originally due on Oct. 4.  The  Federal Reserve  will maintain its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases until March, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed on Oct. 17-18. A previous poll
had indicated the central bank would start the cuts at last
month’s meeting. The  Federal Open Market Committee  next meets on
Oct. 29-30. The 16-day closure of the U.S. government slowed
economic growth and disrupted the gathering of data.  “It would be borderline reckless for the Fed to tighten at
the end of October after a period in which the data has been so
patchy and confidence may have been shaken by a dysfunctional
Washington,” Brewin Dolphin’s Foster said.  Reckitt Revenue  Reckitt Benckiser climbed 5.2 percent to 4,734 pence. The
company said comparable sales, excluding the contribution from
its pharmaceuticals unit, rose 5 percent, exceeding the 4.7
percent gain estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The maker of Dettol antiseptic liquid and Strepsils throat
lozenges said it will start a strategic review of its
pharmaceuticals unit, which it does not count as a core
business. Analysts such as Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s  Andrew Wood  have advocated selling it.  BHP gained 4.1 percent to 1,950.5 pence after posting iron-ore output of 48.8 million metric tons in the quarter ended
Sept. 30. That beat the 47.8 million-ton median projection of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The commodity producer also
raised its full-year iron-ore production forecast to 212 million
tons from 207 million tons.  GKN Plc (GKN)  advanced 1.7 percent to 368.8 pence after the
aircraft-parts supplier posted third-quarter sales of 1.87
billion pounds. That exceeded the 1.83 billion-pound projection
of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  International Consolidated Airlines Group Plc lost 1.5
percent to 359 pence as Cantor Fitzgerald LP downgraded the
parent of British Airways to hold from buy, saying the shares
may decline after its quarterly results, following a recent
rally. IAG  surged  27 percent from an Aug. 30 low through
yesterday’s close. It reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 8.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the FTSE 100 was 10 percent lower than the average of the past
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
