Copper for delivery in three months
rose as high as $7,350 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange. That was the highest price since Sept. 20, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The metal advanced even after
government data showed employers in the U.S. hired fewer workers
last month than estimated by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
