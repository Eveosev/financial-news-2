Gasoline futures rose on speculation
a rally in  Brent crude  along with the shutdown of the only
refinery in  Scotland  will increase the cost of fuel imports.  November futures gained as much as 1 percent and diesel
advanced as Brent, the benchmark for crude used in European and
U.S. East Coast refineries, jumped the most in almost two weeks.
East Coast gasoline imports increased 5.3 percent to 576,000
barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 11, the Energy Information
Administration said yesterday. The 210,000-barrel-a-day
Grangemouth  plant  remained shut as employees weighed a wage
proposal from Ineos Group Holdings SA.  “The products are actually being boosted by Brent prices,
rather than WTI,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “We’re seeing some support in
products over in  Europe  due to the shutdown of the Grangemouth
refinery, which is now going on a week.”  Gasoline for November delivery gained 1.15 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.6653 a gallon at 10:15 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 15 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI rose 13 cents to
$12.37 a barrel. The spread has more than doubled since sliding
to $5.68 on Oct. 4, the smallest margin since November 2010. The
 premium  to Brent fell 39 cents to 85 cents a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to $3.344 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 32.1 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery rose 3.03
cents, or 1 percent, to $3.0409 a gallon on the Nymex, on volume
that was 2.5 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI widened 89 cents to $28.12 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent increased 24 cents to
$16.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
