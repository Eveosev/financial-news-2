Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.09 percent to 0.11
percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $1.25 billion to $1.75
billion of Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to August
2043. The purchases, which are permanent open market operations,
are the part of the Fed’s quantitative easing program aimed at
keeping long-term rates low.  The Fed may also conduct a test of an overnight fixed-rate
reverse repo facility. The temporary open-market operations will
use Treasuries as collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
