(Corrects role of Coller in BlackBerry bidding starting in
first paragraph.)  Coller Capital , the private-equity
firm founded by British financier Jeremy Coller, isn’t in talks
with bidders about making an offer for  BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) ,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  Coller isn’t seeking to acquire 10 percent of BlackBerry’s
patents or providing financing to potential bidders, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
private. Shira Goldman, a spokeswoman for Coller in New York,
didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Lisette Kwong, a spokeswoman for BlackBerry, declined to comment.  BlackBerry, which announced in August that it was
entertaining bids, has drawn a number of interested parties
though little in the way of concrete offers.  Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd. (FFH) ,  BlackBerry’s largest investor , signed a tentative
agreement to acquire the smartphone maker for $4.7 billion last
month -- without naming its buyout partners or showing that it
has lined up financing. Cerberus Capital Management LP is
looking at BlackBerry’s books, while  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  has also
expressed interest in a BlackBerry deal, according to people
familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
