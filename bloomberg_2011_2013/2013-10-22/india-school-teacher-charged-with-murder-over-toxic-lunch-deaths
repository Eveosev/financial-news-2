The principal of the school in
 India ’s eastern Bihar state where 23 children died after
consuming pesticide-laden food in July has been charged with
murder, a police official said.  Meena Devi and her husband Arjun Rai also face charges of
criminal conspiracy and attempted murder, said Barun Kumar
Sinha, Superintendent of Police in Saran, the  district  where the
school is located.  “The case has been filed with the Chief Judicial
Magistrate and the cognizance of the offence has been noted,”
Sinha said in a telephone interview. “The trial may begin in
the next one week.”  The children died after having lunch at a state-run primary
school in July. The tragedy was allegedly caused by the presence
of monocrotophos, a highly toxic organophosphate insecticide,
Abhijit Sinha, an official in the local administration, had said
then.  The school-meal plan, part of a web of polices aimed at
easing the malnourishment that afflicts almost half the
country’s children, has been criticized by the Supreme Court and
the comptroller and auditor general for corruption and
inefficiencies.  Bihar, one of India’s  poorest  states, has been admonished
by the nation’s top court for its management of the program. In
2010, the latest data available, the central government set
aside $80 million for food and $73 million to pay for cooking
materials, including the construction of hygienic sheds and
water supplies. The state government managed to spend only $30
million of that, the planning commission report found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
