America Movil SAB (AMXL)  had its outlook
improved to stable by Standard & Poor’s, which said the Latin
American wireless carrier avoided a potential downgrade by
withdrawing a $9.9 billion offer for Royal KPN NV.  America Movil ’s plans to expand in Europe were thwarted
last week when the company, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , failed to persuade the Dutch phone operator to accept its
offer of 2.40 ($3.31) euros a share. Dropping the bid allows
America Movil to generate cash and keep its A- rating, four
levels above junk status, S&P said today.  “We will continue to monitor the company’s potential
future acquisitions in Europe,” Marcela Duenas, an S&P credit
analyst, said in a statement. Other possible takeovers and an
increase in regulatory pressures in Mexico or other America
Movil markets could trigger a downgrade in the future, S&P said.  America Movil, based in Mexico City, will maintain its
rating as long as its ratio of fully adjusted debt to earnings
is less than 2 times, S&P said.  Moody’s Investors Service said last week it continued to
review America Movil for a possible downgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
