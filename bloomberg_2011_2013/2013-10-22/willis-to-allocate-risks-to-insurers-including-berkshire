Willis Group Holdings Plc (WSH) , the
third-largest insurance broker by market value, agreed to
allocate as much as 25 percent of premiums from the London
corporate specialist market to pre-selected insurers.  Underwriters in the group include  Warren Buffett ’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , People’s Insurance Company (Group) of
China Ltd. and Hiscox Ltd., said Colleen McCarthy, a spokeswoman
for the London-based broker. She said Willis plans to make an
announcement tomorrow about the program, reported earlier by the
Financial Times.  Brokers have signed agreements with underwriters in recent
years to ensure capacity for clients. In return, insurers get
access to premiums from risks that meet their criteria while
avoiding costs typically associated with underwriting.  Aon Plc, the second-largest broker, announced a similar
 deal  with Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in March to shoulder
risks from the Lloyd’s of London market. Berkshire agreed to
provide Willis’s clients additional coverage for oil drilling
following BP Plc’s 2010 spill in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Willis climbed 1.5 percent to $45.89 at 3:10 p.m. in New
York. Marsh & McLennan Cos. is the largest insurance broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
