Hong Kong  stocks  slid, with the
benchmark index falling from a four-week high, as investors
awaited U.S. jobs data to gauge when the Federal Reserve will
trim stimulus.  China Mobile (941)  Ltd. plunged after posting its
largest drop in profit since 1999.  The  Hang Seng Index  lost 0.5 percent to 23,311.95 as of
9:33 in Hong Kong, with three shares dropping for each that
gained. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the
H-share index, slipped 0.3 percent to 10,634.71.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1
percent. The equity gauge rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday
to extend a record high as investors watched earnings to assess
the strength of the economy before today’s employment report.  The Labor Department will release September jobs data,
which was pushed back from Oct. 4 because of the 16-day partial
federal shutdown that ended last week. The report will probably
show employers added the most workers since April, according to
the median estimate of 93 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Delayed economic data and slower fourth-quarter growth due to
the shutdown will prevent Fed policy makers from paring record
bond purchases until March, according a Bloomberg survey last
week.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 18 percent from this year’s low
in June through yesterday as data showed China’s economic
expansion is stabilizing after a two-quarter slowdown. Hong
Kong’s equity benchmark traded at 11.2 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 15.8 for the S&P 500.  Economic Goals  China can meet major economic goals this year and the
economy is stabilizing and improving, Premier  Li Keqiang  said
yesterday at a meeting organized by the All China Federation of
Trade Unions,  China Central Television  reported. Economic growth
and consumer prices are in “reasonable ranges,” and domestic
demand has huge potential, the report cited Li as saying. The
nation’s official target is for 7.5 percent growth this year.  China Mobile lost 3.4 percent to HK$82.15. the world’s
largest phone company’s profit plunged as costs to build its new
network rose and users switched to third-party messaging apps.
Net income fell 8.8 percent to 28.4 billion  yuan  ($4.7 billion)
in the third quarter, missing the 31.1 billion-yuan expected by
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
