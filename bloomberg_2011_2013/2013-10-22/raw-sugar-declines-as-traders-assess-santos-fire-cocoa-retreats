Sugar declined a second day in  New
York , after rising to the highest level in almost a year on Oct.
18, as traders assessed the consequence of a fire at  Brazil ’s
main port. Cocoa fell on Ivorian bean arrivals.  A fire that broke out at Copersucar SA’s terminal in Santos
on Oct. 18 left six warehouses “totally compromised” and
destroyed 180,000 metric tons of the sweetener, according to the
Sao Paulo-based company. Sugar waiting to be loaded onto ships
at Brazil’s main ports totaled 1.03 million tons yesterday, less
than the 1.295 million tons expected a year earlier, data from
Santos-based SA Commodities on Bloomberg showed.  “Vessel line-ups are below previous seasons, and physical
flows should be able to handle this disruption,”  Kona Haque , a
London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a report
e-mailed today, referring to the fire. There may be “some
delays in sugar port logistics over the next few weeks.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March declined 0.5 percent to
19.32 cents a pound by 5:55 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Prices fell 0.4 percent yesterday. Refined, or white,
sugar for December delivery was little changed at $512.10 a ton
on NYSE Liffe in London.  Futures rallied as much as 6.1 percent to 20.16 cents a
pound on Oct. 18, the highest in almost a year, as traders and
some speculators sought to close out bets on lower prices on
news of the fire, according to Lausanne, Switzerland-based
researcher Kingsman SA. Sugar is this month’s best performer in
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials.  Rebuilding Operations  Rebuilding Copersucar’s operations may take eight to 12
months, Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at Archer Consulting in
 Sao Paulo , said in an Oct. 19 report. Millers may have to make
more ethanol next year if sugar can’t be exported, according to
futures and options broker Marex Spectron Group in London.  Cocoa for delivery in December lost 0.3 percent to $2,721 a
ton in New York. In London, beans for delivery in the same month
were little changed at 1,734 pounds ($2,798) a ton.  Bean deliveries to ports in  Ivory Coast , the world’s
leading producer, more than doubled Oct. 1-20, according to data
on the website of KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk
Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . Arrivals were 106,000
metric tons compared with 47,000 tons a year earlier.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December was little changed
at $1.1275 a pound on ICE. Robusta for delivery in January fell
0.4 percent to $1,578 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
