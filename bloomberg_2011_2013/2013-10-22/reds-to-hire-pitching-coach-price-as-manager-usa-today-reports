The  Cincinnati Reds  named pitching
coach Bryan Price as manager to succeed  Dusty Baker , who was
fired after the team failed to advance in the Major League
Baseball playoffs for the third time in four years.  Price, 51, has been the Reds’ pitching coach since 2010. He
held the same role with the  Seattle Mariners  and Arizona
Diamondbacks from 2000 through 2009 and has never managed a team
at any level. Price, who agreed on a three-year contract,
interviewed for the Miami Marlins’ managerial job last year.  “I have spent a lot of time with Bryan since the season
ended, and I was convinced after the first meeting he is the
right person to help us move this organization forward,” Reds
General Manager Walt Jocketty said on the team’s website.
“We’ve all seen his work here with our pitching staff. He has
proven himself to be an excellent communicator and leader and
clearly is one of the most respected people not only in our
clubhouse but in baseball in general.”  Baker was fired on Oct. 4 after compiling a 509-463 record
over six years with the Reds. Cincinnati had a 90-72 record this
season before losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-2 in the
National League wild-card game.  The Reds’ pitching staff under Price led the NL in
strikeouts this season and finished with the fourth-best earned-run average in the major leagues.  Price is the third former pitching coach among current
managers, joining John Farrell of the  Boston Red Sox  and Bud Black of the San Diego Padres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
