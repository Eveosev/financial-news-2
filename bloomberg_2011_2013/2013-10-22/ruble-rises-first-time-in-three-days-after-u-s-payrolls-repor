 The ruble strengthened and Russian
 government bonds  gained after U.S. payrolls climbed less than
forecast in September, fueling demand for riskier assets amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus.  The ruble climbed 0.4 percent to 37.1104 against Bank
Rossii’s target basket of dollars and euros by 6 p.m. in Moscow.
The yield on government bonds due February 2027 fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.54 percent, the lowest
level in more than a month.  U.S. employers added 148,000 workers to payrolls in
September, the Labor Department reported today, less than the
180,000 projected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The data
comes after Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President  Charles
Evans  said yesterday the central bank will probably delay
cutting monthly asset purchases until the U.S. economy and labor
market show sustained improvement.  “Risk-on mood on the global markets got a strong support
from the U.S. payrolls numbers and the ruble is no exception,”
Vladimir Miklashevsky, a trading desk strategist at  Danske Bank
A/S (DANSKE)  in Helsinki, said in e-mailed comments.  The ruble advanced 0.6 percent against the dollar to
31.7455 and strengthened 0.1 percent against the euro to
43.6700. Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, was little
changed at $109.73 a barrel in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
