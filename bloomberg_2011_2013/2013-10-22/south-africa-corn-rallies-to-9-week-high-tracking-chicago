Yellow-corn futures traded in  South
Africa  reached a seven-week high after prices increased in the
U.S. market.  The grain for delivery in December rose 0.1 percent to
2,194 rand ($222) a metric ton by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. That was the highest
settlement since Sept. 3 for a most-active contract and the
seventh advance in a row, the longest streak since June 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn for the same delivery month added 0.6 percent to $4.44
a bushel by the close yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Warm conditions in the next two weeks in parts of the former
 Soviet Union  will help farmers finish sowing in the southern
region and boost crops in the north before winter,  Commodity
Weather Group LLC  in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a report.  “Corn futures gained slightly, mainly tracking the U.S.
prices, which increased because of the better weather
conditions,” Brink van Wyk a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone from South Africa’s North West province.  White corn for delivery in December settled unchanged at
2,381 rand a ton. South Africa is the continent’s biggest corn
producer. A meal made from white corn is a staple food in the
nation and the yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December slumped 0.5 percent to 3,482
rand a ton. Soybeans for the same delivery month fell 0.3
percent to 5,630 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
