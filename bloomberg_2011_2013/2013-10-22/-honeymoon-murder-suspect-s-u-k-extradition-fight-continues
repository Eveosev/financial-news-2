Shrien Dewani’s lawyers began their
latest attempt to block his extradition to  South Africa  to face
charges he murdered his wife during their honeymoon in 2010.  Dewani’s lawyers reiterated arguments that his mental
health wasn’t sufficient to stand trial as they asked a U.K.
court at a hearing today to overturn an earlier ruling that
would allow his extradition.  South Africa wants to try Dewani for the murder of his wife
Anni in  Cape Town  in November 2010. Anni Dewani was killed after
a taxi she and her husband were traveling in was carjacked in
Gugulethu, near the city. South African prosecutors allege her
husband arranged the murder.  “In the end, extradition is there to deal with crime and
criminals and not those who are mentally ill,”  Clare Montgomery , Dewani’s lawyer, said today.  In July, a  London  judge rejected arguments that Dewani’s
mental health wouldn’t allow him to stand trial and said that
there was no guarantee he would recover more quickly in London.
Dewani has been treated at a U.K. hospital for post-traumatic
stress disorder and depression since his wife’s death.  The case is Dewani v. Government of The Republic of South
Africa, CO/9406/2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
