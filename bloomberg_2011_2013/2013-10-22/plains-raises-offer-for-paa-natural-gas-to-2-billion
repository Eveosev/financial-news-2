Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA) 
agreed to buy all the shares of  PAA Natural Gas Storage LP (PNG)  it
didn’t previously own after raising its offer 1.5 percent, in a
deal that values the company at $2 billion.  PAA Natural Gas holders will receive 0.445 common units of
Plains All American for each unit they own, the Houston-based
gas-storage company said in a statement today. The agreement
amounts to $23.07 a unit, a 4-cent premium for PAA Natural Gas
investors, based on yesterday’s closing prices.  Plains, also based in Houston, is the largest holder of PAA
Natural Gas with 46 percent of outstanding common units. The
company controls the partnership, which began trading publicly
in 2010, through ownership of its general partner. Plains
offered to buy PAA Natural Gas in August, with holders receiving
0.435 units, or $22.74 a unit, a 7.9 percent premium at the
time.  PAA Natural Gas, the owner and operator of three gas
storage facilities in Louisiana,  Mississippi  and  Michigan , has
been in a “defensive posture” due to shrinking profit margins
caused by seasonal differences in gas prices, President Dean Liollio said on an Aug. 6 conference call. Plains Chief
Executive Officer Greg Armstrong said in August the next several
years would be “challenging” for PAA Natural Gas if it
remained on its own.  PAA Natural Gas, which reached a 52-week high of $23.59
last month, gained 0.8 percent to $23.21 at 10:25 a.m. in New
York. Plains rose 0.9 percent to $52.32.  Roy I. Lamoreaux, a spokesman for Plains, declined to
comment on the transaction.  Plains will issue about 14.7 million additional common
units for the transaction, which the companies expect to close
in the fourth quarter.  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  advised on the
deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
