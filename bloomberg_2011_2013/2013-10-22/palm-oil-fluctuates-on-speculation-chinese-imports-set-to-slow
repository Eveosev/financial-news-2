Palm oil swung between gains and
losses on concern that imports by China, the second-biggest
buyer, may expand at the slowest pace in three years.  The contract for delivery in January fell and rose at least
0.2 percent and was at 2,438 ringgit ($766) a metric ton on the
Bursa Malaysia Derivatives at 12:10 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .
Futures closed yesterday at 2,437 ringgit, the highest price for
most-active futures since Sept. 6. Palm for physical delivery in
November was at 2,420 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  China’s inbound shipments in the 12 months that began Oct.
1 are likely to remain about the same as the 6.6 million tons
bought last year, according to a Bloomberg survey. Rising
purchases of soybeans that are crushed to produce feed meal are
also boosting the nation’s vegetable oil output at the expense
of palm from exporters including Indonesia and Malaysia, Leon Xia, an analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., said yesterday.  “Malaysian palm oil is quite dependent on exports to
China,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst with Alliance Investment
Bank Bhd. “If there is any slowing of exports, that could mean
a build-up of supplies in Malaysia.”  Malaysia  exported  17.6 million tons of  palm oil  last year,
about 20 percent of which went to China, data from the Malaysian
Palm Oil Board shows. World output will advance 5 percent to
58.1 million tons, boosting  stockpiles  by 17 percent to an all-time high of 9.2 million tons, according to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture.  Refined palm oil for May delivery declined 0.4 percent to
6,132  yuan  ($1,006) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
 soybean oil  retreated 0.7 percent to 7,208 yuan.  Soybeans for delivery in January lost 0.3 percent to $12.97
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for
December fell 0.2 percent to 41.57 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
