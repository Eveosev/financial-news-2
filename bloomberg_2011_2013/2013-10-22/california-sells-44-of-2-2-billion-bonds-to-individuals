Individual investors placed orders
for 44 percent of $2.2 billion in general-obligation bonds that
 California  is selling as an economic rebound has squeezed the
state’s yield premium to the lowest level in five years.  The most-indebted state is offering $2.06 billion in tax-exempt debt, rated A, sixth highest, by Standard & Poor’s, for
projects such as schools and earthquake protection, and about
$186 million in federally taxable bonds. The sale ends today
with orders from institutional buyers, such as mutual funds.  California offered investors preliminary yields of 1.48
percent for maturities of five years, 3.15 percent for 10 years,
and 4.92 percent for 30-year debt, Bill Ainsworth, a spokesman
for state Treasurer Bill Lockyer, said yesterday by e-mail.  California’s largest general-obligation sale since April
came as the extra yield investors demand to own 10-year bonds
narrowed to  0.3 percentage point  yesterday compared with top-rated debt with similar maturities, the lowest spread since
2008. The value had peaked at  1.7 percentage points  in July
2009, when an impasse over how to close a budget deficit led the
state to issue IOUs to cover spending, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat who took office in January
2011, has championed higher sales and income taxes and took
 measures  to reduce the state’s short- and long-term debt. These
steps have included reducing dental services in the state’s
health-insurance program and cutting back on deferred payments
to schools and community colleges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
