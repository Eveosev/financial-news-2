LEG Immobilien AG (LEG)  fell the most in a
month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Perry Capital LLC sold
7 million shares in the residential landlord.  LEG dropped  3 percent to 42.28 euros, the biggest decline
since Sept. 23. Goldman’s Whitehall Street Real Estate money
manager and Perry Capital, which took LEG public in February,
raised 289 million euros selling the shares to institutional
investors for 41.25 euros each.  LEG,  Germany ’s second-largest property company by market
value, had the biggest initial public offering of a German real
estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in the deal,
which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares and Perry
with a 9 percent stake. During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were
sold at 44 euros each.  The shares have dropped about 3.9 percent since the IPO,
while the  EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German property stocks  has
declined by 2.2 percent.  LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state. The stock
sale today was managed by Goldman and represents about 13.2
percent of the company’s share capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
