More efficient drilling methods and
more prolific wells are driving the recent U.S. oil and natural
gas boom, the Energy Information Administration said in the
first edition of its Drilling Productivity Report.  The Bakken and  Eagle Ford  shale formation increased U.S.
crude production by almost 700,000 barrels a day over the past
year, the EIA said. That accounted for 75 percent of the crude
output growth across six regions the agency will track in the
new report.  The EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department,
plans to issue the reports on a monthly basis. They’ll measure
rig activity and analyze production rates and well flows over
time, the agency said in a press release.  “The metrics presented in the Drilling Productivity Report
are intended to be more informative than traditional indicators
of future oil and gas production,” EIA Administrator  Adam Sieminski  said in a statement. “The report provides a new
approach that takes into account changes in the application of
technologies that have led to rapid increases in U.S. oil and
gas production.”  The report focuses on six plays -- the Permian, Eagle Ford
and Haynesville in Texas, the Bakken in  North Dakota , the
Niobrara in  Colorado  and Wyoming and the Marcellus in  West
Virginia  and Pennsylvania. The regions combined to account for
90 percent of U.S. oil production growth and almost all the
natural gas production growth in 2011 and 2012.  The Marcellus accounted for 75 percent of natural gas
production growth in the six regions, the EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
