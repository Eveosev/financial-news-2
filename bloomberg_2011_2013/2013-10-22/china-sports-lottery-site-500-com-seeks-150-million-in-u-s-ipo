500.com Ltd., an online sports-lottery operator in China, filed for a $150 million initial
public offering in the U.S.  The company didn’t say how many American depositary shares
it will offer or at what price in a regulatory filing today. The
offering size is a placeholder used to calculate registration
fees and may change.  500.com announced its IPO plans as two other China-based
Internet businesses, 58.com Inc. and Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd.,
plan to complete their own initial offerings by the end of this
month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Those two offerings, if
completed, will raise the number of U.S. IPOs by Chinese
companies this year to five, compared with only two during all
of 2012.  Shenzhen-based 500.com offers betting services through the
Web and mobile applications and had more than doubled its users
to 18.4 million by the end of September, from 8.8 million at the
end of 2010, the regulatory filing shows. 500.com plans to use
the proceeds for technology upgrades and marketing.  Net income at 500.com almost doubled to 20.6 million  yuan 
($3.4 million) from a year earlier in the nine months through
September, as sales increased 25 percent to 163.4 million yuan,
the company said.  500.com has applied to list on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol WBAI. Deutsche Bank AG is managing the
offering.  Sungy Mobile Ltd., a Guangzhou-based provider of mobile
applications, also filed today to raise $80 million in a U.S.
IPO. That amount is also a placeholder that may change. The
company offers a software platform used for managing
applications on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android mobile operating system,
it said in a filing.  Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading
Sungy Mobile’s offering. The company has applied to list on the
NYSE under the symbol GOMO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
