Gold futures rose to a three-week
high after payrolls in the U.S. climbed less than projected in
September, increasing speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain monetary stimulus to boost the economy.  The addition of 148,000 workers followed a revised 193,000
rise in August, Labor Department figures showed today. The
median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
an increase of 180,000. The report, delayed by the 16-day
government shutdown that ended Oct. 17, was slated for Oct. 4.  “The payrolls data is pushing gold higher as investors
think the economy needs more support to gain momentum,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 2 percent to
settle at $1,342.60 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after reaching $1,344.70, the highest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 30.  Fed policy makers will delay reducing $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases until March, according to the median
estimate of 40 economists in a Bloomberg survey last week.  This year, gold has dropped 20 percent, heading for the
first annual decline since 2000. Some investors lost faith in
the metal amid a rally in U.S. equities and low inflation.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 2.3 percent to
$22.79 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $22.83, the highest
since Sept. 20.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery increased 0.8 percent to $1,450.70 an ounce.
The price climbed for the fifth straight session, the longest
rally since December. Earlier, the commodity reached $1,452.80,
the highest since Sept. 20.  Palladium futures for December delivery climbed 0.4 percent
to $752.90 an ounce. The metal advanced for the fifth straight
session, the longest rally since July. Earlier, the price
reached $754.35, the highest since Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
