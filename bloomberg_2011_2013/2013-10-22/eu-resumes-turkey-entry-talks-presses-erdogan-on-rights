European Union governments agreed to
restart entry talks with  Turkey  after a three-year pause, using
potential membership as an incentive for Prime Minister  Recep
Tayyip Erdogan  to strengthen civil liberties.  EU affairs ministers at a meeting today in Luxembourg set
Nov. 5 for the renewed negotiations, according to a European
Commission statement. The meeting was postponed in June after
Erdogan’s crackdown on protesters in Istanbul.  While membership is far off, each step has a “positive
influence” on life in Turkey, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean
Asselborn told reporters. “Breaking it off would rob the people
in Turkey of all hope as to the European Union’s promotion of
basic freedoms for Turkish citizens.”  Eight years after starting down the EU path, Turkey has
made it only 1/35th of the way through a checklist of
legislative and policy moves required for membership. The
stalemate reflects the economically beleaguered EU’s waning
appetite to take in new countries and Turkey’s renewed focus on
the  Middle East .  The next phase of talks will align Turkey’s regional-aid
policies with EU norms. The European Commission is also pressing
for negotiations on Turkey’s civil rights and justice system, a
topic left for the end of the process in prior EU enlargements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
