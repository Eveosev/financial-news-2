Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc., which took
 LEG Immobilien AG (LEG)  public in February, may raise as much as 294
million euros ($402 million) by selling 7 million shares of the
German landlord, a person with knowledge of the transaction said
yesterday. LEG fell as much as 5.2 percent.  Goldman offered the shares at 41 euros to 42 euros each,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. The shares were owned by Whitehall
Street Real Estate, a Goldman Sachs money manager, and Perry
Capital. Goldman is also managing the share sale, the person
said.  LEG, Germany’s second-largest property company by market
value, was sold in the biggest initial public offering of a
German real estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in
that deal, which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares
and Perry with a 9 percent stake.  LEG fell 4.1 percent to 41.80 euros at 9:20 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The shares have dropped about 5.6 percent
since the IPO, while the EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German
property stocks has slid 1.3 percent.  During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were sold at 44 euros
each. Before the offering, Whitehall held 95 percent of the
company.  LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
North Rhine-Westphalia,  Germany ’s most populous state.  To contact the reporters on this story:
