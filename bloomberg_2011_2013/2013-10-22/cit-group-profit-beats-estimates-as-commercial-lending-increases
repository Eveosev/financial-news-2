CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the once-bankrupt
business lender run by John Thain, reported a third-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as commercial loans
increased.  Net income was $199.6 million, or 99 cents a share,
compared with a $299.2 million loss, or $1.49, a year earlier,
the New York-based company said today in a statement. The
average  estimate  of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 95
cents a share.  “Our third-quarter results reflect our progress in
prudently growing assets, expanding CIT Bank, and returning
capital to our shareholders,” Thain, 58, said in the statement.  Thain, the former Merrill Lynch & Co. chief executive
officer hired in 2010 to turn around CIT, cut assets and
expenses to help CIT recover from a bankruptcy that wiped out
$2.3 billion in government bailout funds. The Federal Reserve
ended its post-crisis oversight in May after the lender’s
finances stabilized.  CIT gained 32 percent this year through yesterday,
outpacing the 27 percent advance for the 81-company Standard &
Poor’s 500 Financials Index.  The company reinstated a dividend yesterday. The quarterly
payment of 10 cents a share is payable on Nov. 29 to
shareholders of record as of Nov. 15, according to a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
