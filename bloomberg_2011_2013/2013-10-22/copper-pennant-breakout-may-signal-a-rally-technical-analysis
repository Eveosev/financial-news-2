Copper futures broke through a so-called pennant formation and may signal a rally to the highest
price since February, according to  technical analysis  by Frank Cholly, a senior commodity broker at RJO Futures.  The attached chart shows a trading range since Oct. 8 that
formed a “pennant flag” when the upper and lower trend lines
met to form a triangle, before prices broke through yesterday.
With the lower band at $3.215 a pound and the upper at $3.329, a
few closes above the 200-day moving average of $3.3493 would
confirm the bullish move and may send copper to $3.60, the
highest since Feb. 28, Cholly said.  “If we can get a couple closes above the 200-day average,
the market can start to muscle through and break out of the
range we’ve been in,” Cholly said in a telephone interview from
 Chicago . “I like the way the chart is shaping up, and higher
seems to be the path of least resistance right now.’  Copper futures for December delivery closed yesterday
$3.3355 on the Comex in  New York , after touching $3.355, the
highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 20. Prices will
need to close above a range of $3.35 to $3.37 for a few days to
confirm the breakout, and may meet ‘‘resistance,’’ or an
increase in sell orders, at about $3.40, Cholly said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
