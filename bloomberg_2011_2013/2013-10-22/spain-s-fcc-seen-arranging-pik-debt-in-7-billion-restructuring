Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA  is in talks with creditor banks to convert part of
the Spanish infrastructure company’s loans into payment-in-kind
debt, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The higher-yielding PIKs, which allow borrowers to roll up
interest so that it's paid when the debt comes due, will total
about 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion), said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private.
The Barcelona-based company is currently seeking to refinance
about 5 billion euros of loans, they said.  A spokesman for FCC in  Madrid , who asked not to be
identified citing company policy, declined to comment on the
negotiations. The company reported a first-half net loss of
607.6 million euros in August, compared with a profit of 53.4
million euros a year earlier.  Promotora de Informaciones SA , the biggest Spanish media
company, is also in talks with creditor banks to convert part of
its debt into PIK notes, people familiar with that matter said
Oct. 4.  One or more entities linked to  Bill Gates , the world’s
richest man according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,
bought a 6 percent stake in FCC for 113.5 million euros,
according to an FCC statement yesterday. The entities bought
7.64 million shares that the company held as treasury stock at
14.865 euros apiece.  To contact the reporters on this story:
