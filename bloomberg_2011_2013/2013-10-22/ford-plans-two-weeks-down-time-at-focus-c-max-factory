Ford Motor Co. (F)  scheduled two weeks
of down time at its factory that assembles the Focus compact and
C-Max hybrid cars to trim inventory after the first drop in U.S.
auto sales in 27 months.  Ford’s  Michigan  Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, near
Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn, will shut the weeks of Oct. 28
and Dec. 16, Kristina Adamski, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. Days supply of both models rose after industrywide U.S.
sales of cars and light trucks slipped 4.2 percent in September.  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s mantra to align
production with demand has led Ford to post record profit
margins in  North America  of more than 10 percent in an industry
where 5 percent is considered respectable. Ford is boosting
output of other models such as F-Series pickups and Fusion mid-size cars as the industry remains on track for its best year
since 2007.  “They don’t want to get ahead of themselves,” Alan Baum,
an independent auto analyst at Baum & Associates in West
Bloomfield, Michigan, said by telephone. “Ford has been focused
on keeping their pricing in check. Their operating margin is in
double digits. Nobody else is there and they’re obviously very
proud of that.”  Inventory Expands  Ford began this month with 122 days supply of the C-Max and
71 days of the Focus, according to the Automotive News Data
Center. Inventory of both models rose from 108 days and 58 days,
respectively, at the beginning of September. Automakers
generally try to carry about 60 days supply of inventory per
vehicle.  Focus deliveries in the U.S. rose 1.1 percent to 188,654
this year through September, according to a Ford statement
released Oct. 1. Sales of the C-Max, which Ford introduced as a
new model in late 2012, climbed to 28,254 from 969 in the year-earlier period.  Ford rose 1 percent to $17.67 at 9:52 a.m. in  New York . The
shares surged 35 percent this year through yesterday, compared
with a 22 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
