Mexico’s peso rose for the first
time in three days as a smaller-than-forecast increase in U.S.
payrolls eased concern the  Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus
that has buoyed demand for the Latin American country’s assets.  The currency gained 0.9 percent to 12.8769 per dollar at
9:37 a.m. in Mexico City, rising with most emerging-market peers
as traders boosted bets that U.S. policy makers will continue
buying $85 billion of bonds each month to bolster growth in the
world’s largest economy. The Fed will pare the monthly pace of
purchases to $70 billion at its March 18-19 meeting, according
to the median of 40 responses in a Bloomberg survey last week.  “The market relaxed a lot when the employment data came
out,” Roberto Galvan, a trader at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA,
said by phone from  Mexico  City. “A good piece of data would
have added to the possibility for the removal of stimulus.”  The addition of 148,000 workers last month in the U.S.
followed a revised 193,000 increase in August that was larger
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 180,000 advance.  Today’s advance trimmed the Mexican currency’s losses this
year to 0.1 percent. Yields on peso bonds due in December 2024
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, today to 5.72
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
