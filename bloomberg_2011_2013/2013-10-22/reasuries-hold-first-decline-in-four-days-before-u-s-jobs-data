Treasuries were little changed
before the U.S. government releases a delayed labor-market
report that economists predict will show employers added the
most jobs since April.  Benchmark  10-year yields  climbed from the lowest level
since July yesterday before separate data this week forecast to
show durable goods orders increased in September. The numbers
have been delayed by a 16-day government shutdown that  Standard
& Poor’s  estimated will shave at least 0.6 percent off fourth-quarter growth. Fiscal strife in  Washington  will probably delay
the central bank from slowing monthly bond purchases, Federal
 Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans  said yesterday.  “Payrolls are very much in focus today,” said Niels From,
chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “If there is a
good number the market will be cautious to read too much into it
as it was before the shutdown. If we see some weakness in the
number in September, it confirms we could be in for some
economic softness after a run of good data. Our year-end
forecast for the 10-year yield is 2.55 percent.”  The  10-year yield  was at 2.60 percent at 7:04 a.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
2.5 percent note due in August 2023 was 99 1/8. The yield fell
to 2.54 percent on Oct. 18, the  lowest  since July 24. It rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, yesterday.  Additional Workers  Employers added 180,000 workers in September after hiring
169,000 in August, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the Bureau of Labor
Statistics releases the data. The report was originally
scheduled for Oct. 4 and will be released today at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington.  Durable goods  orders  rose 2.2 percent after gaining 0.1
percent in August, a separate Bloomberg survey showed before the
Oct. 25 report.  Economists predict the Fed will maintain bond purchases at
$85 billion a month until March, according to a Bloomberg survey
conducted Oct. 17-18. They forecast the government closure cut
growth by 0.3 percentage point this quarter.  Before the shutdown, most policy makers said the central
bank would probably reduce bond purchases this year. The Fed’s
next two policy meetings are Oct. 29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  An October decision to taper would be “a tough one” as
“we haven’t had a lot of data” since the September meeting,
Chicago Fed’s Evans said in a CNBC interview. “It’s very
difficult to feel confident in December given that we’re going
to repeat part of what just took place in Washington.”  Debt Ceiling  The shutdown, which took place as Republicans and Democrats
clashed over passing a budget and lifting the nation’s borrowing
limit, was resolved last week when President  Barack Obama  signed
legislation opening the government until Jan. 15 and suspending
the debt ceiling through Feb. 7.  The U.S is scheduled to sell $35 billion of one-month bills
today. Investors submitted bids for 4.03 times the $35 billion
of three-month bills the Treasury auctioned yesterday, up from
3.13 times at the previous sale on Oct. 15. That’s below the
average bid-to-cover ratio of 4.64 at the 40 bill sales this
year before the Oct. 1 shutdown, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $210.6 billion
yesterday from $249.2 billion on Oct. 18. The average this year
is $316.3 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index was 71.47 basis points yesterday, after
falling to 70.09 on Oct. 17, the lowest level since May 24. It
climbed 114.19 on Sept. 5, the highest since July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
