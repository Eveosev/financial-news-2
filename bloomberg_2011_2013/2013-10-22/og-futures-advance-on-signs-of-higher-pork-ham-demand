Hog futures jumped the most in a
week on signs that U.S. pork demand is climbing. Cattle prices
advanced.  Through yesterday, the wholesale price of  ham  jumped 38
percent this year, and  pork  climbed 16 percent, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data showed. Both products headed for the biggest
annual gain since 2009.  “Demand for pork has been exceedingly good,” David Kruse,
the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in Royal,  Iowa , said
in a telephone interview.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1.5 percent to
88.8 cents a pound at 11:02 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would mark the biggest increase
for a most-active contract since Oct. 15.  Cattle futures for December delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$1.32675 a pound. Yesterday, the wholesale  price  of beef rose to
the highest since June 24.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement advanced 0.5
percent to $1.6725 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
