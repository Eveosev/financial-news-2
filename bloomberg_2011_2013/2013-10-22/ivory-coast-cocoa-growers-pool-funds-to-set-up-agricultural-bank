Cocoa growers in Ivory Coast, the
world’s biggest producer of the crop, plan to establish a bank
for small farmers and farmers’ cooperatives.  Members of 400 farmers cooperatives are paying a monthly
contribution of 2,500  CFA francs  ($5.24) to help set up next
year a microcredit facility, the Epargne Nationale des
Agriculteurs, Fulgence N’Guessan, head of the National Alliance
of Coffee & Cocoa Producers, said in an interview yesterday in
the commercial capital, Abidjan.  The bank will open once farmers make 9 billion CFA francs
in contributions, N’Guessan said. The credit facility is needed
“to organize ourselves because small farmers remain poor”
despite recent changes to the industry’s structure.  Ivory Coast in 2011 introduced an electronic auction
selling most of the cocoa crop before the harvest is gathered,
guaranteeing farmers receive at least 60 percent of the
international price for their beans. The changes were required
by the  World Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  as a
condition for Ivory Coast to qualify for debt relief.  The West  African Development Bank , known as BOAD, has
funded a feasibility study, said N’Guessan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
