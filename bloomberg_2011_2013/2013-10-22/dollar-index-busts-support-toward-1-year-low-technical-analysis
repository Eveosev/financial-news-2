The Dollar Index may decline to its
lowest level in more than 13 months after weaker-than-forecast
payroll data pushed the gauge below a key support level,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., citing technical indicators.  The benchmark  gauge  may depreciate to its weakest level
since Sept. 14, 2012, after breaking support in the area from
79.55 to 79.68, according to Niall O’Connor, a New York-based
technical analyst at JPMorgan. The Dollar Index will first test
support at 78.92, the gauge’s 2013 low, before testing last
year’s September low of 78.60, he said.  “The index is finally putting some distance from the big
area of support between 79.50 to 79.65,” O’Connor said in a
phone interview. “That suggests there’s more downside risk, and
we’re probably more likely to see a closer test of the February
low, and possibly down to the September low.”  The index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners,  decreased  0.5 percent to 79.266 at 12:01 p.m.
in  New York . The gauge fell earlier to 79.223, its weakest level
since Feb. 4.  The dollar slipped 0.7 percent to $1.3781 per euro after
falling to $1.3786, the lowest level since November 2011. The
greenback was little changed at 98.18 yen after earlier falling
as much as 0.3 percent.  “You’ve seen confirmation in a lot of dollar pairs,”
O’Connor said. “We’re set up for a broader-dollar-weakness
story that will continue to develop.”  Employers in the U.S. added 148,000 workers to payrolls in
September following a revised 193,000 gain in August, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 93 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
180,000 advance.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered. Support is an area where there may
be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
