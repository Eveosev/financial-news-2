Palm oil  imports by  China , the
second-biggest buyer, are poised for the slowest expansion in
three years, at a time when record production fuels a global
glut, a Bloomberg News survey shows. Prices fell.  Inbound shipments in the 12 months that began Oct. 1 are
likely to remain about the same as the 6.6 million metric tons
bought last year, according to the median seven estimates from
researchers and traders in China. Two forecast growth and one
projected a decline.  Rising  purchases  of soybeans that are crushed to produce
feed meal for China’s growing livestock herds are also boosting
the nation’s vegetable oil output, at the expense of palm from
exporters including  Indonesia  and  Malaysia , Leon Xia, an analyst
at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., said yesterday. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture forecasts inventories to reach a
record in 2013-2014.  “China’s demand for cooking oil has stabilized, even as
soybean imports continue to grow to satisfy the need for protein
feed for livestock,” Liu Xianwu, the general manager of
Beijing-based researcher China Cereals & Oils Business Net, said
yesterday. “There’s steady demand for the cheaper palm oil, but
fundamentally it’s not changing much.”  Palm oil for delivery in January fell for the first time in
three days on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, declining as much as
0.3 percent and traded at 2,434 ringgit ($766) at 1:29 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures, which closed at the highest price since
Sept. 6. yesterday, dropped 5.6 percent in the last 12 months as
output increased in Indonesia and Malaysia, the biggest
producers.  Indonesian Output  The USDA estimates Indonesia’s production at a record 31
million tons for 2013-2014. World output will advance 5 percent
to 58.1 million tons, boosting stockpiles by 17 percent to an
all-time high of 9.2 million tons, according to the agency.  “Malaysian palm oil is quite dependent on exports to
China,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst with Alliance Investment
Bank Bhd. “If there is any slowing of exports, that could mean
a build-up of supplies in Malaysia.”  Imports of soybeans by China in the 12 months that started
Oct. 1 will probably expand 8.3 percent to 65 million tons,
yielding an additional 1 million tons of oil, Liu said.  Refined palm oil for May delivery declined 0.5 percent to
6,124  yuan  ($1,005) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
 soybean oil  retreated 0.7 percent to 7,208 yuan.  Soybeans for delivery in January lost 0.4 percent to $12.96
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for
December fell 0.4 percent to 41.50 cents a pound.  China is the biggest importer of soybeans. It’s ranked No.
2 in palm oil purchases behind  India .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
