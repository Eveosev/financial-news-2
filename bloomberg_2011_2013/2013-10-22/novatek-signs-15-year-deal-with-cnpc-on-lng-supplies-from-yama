OAO Novatek (NVTK) ,  Russia ’s second-biggest
natural-gas producer, will supply the fuel in its liquefied form
to China National Petroleum Corp. for 15 years, according to a
preliminary accord signed today.  Novatek will sell at least 3 million metric tons of
liquefied natural gas a year to CNPC on delivered ex-ship terms,
with the price indexed to the Japanese Crude Cocktail, the
Tarko-Sale, Russia-based gas producer said today in a statement.
The agreement was signed during Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev ’s
visit to Beijing. The period of supplies can be extended,
according to the statement.  Novatek, which is leading the $20 billion LNG project in
the Russian Arctic region, is challenging state-run  OAO
Gazprom (GAZP) ’s monopoly on supplies of super-chilled fuel abroad to
benefit from the Asian nation’s rising energy demand. Russia
plans to allow Novatek, as well as oil producer  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , to
export LNG from next year.  CNPC agreed in June to buy a 20 percent stake in the Yamal
LNG project, joining Novatek and partner  Total SA. (FP)  The deal is
expected to be completed by Dec. 1.  Yamal LNG at full capacity will produce 16.5 million tons a
year of LNG starting from the end of 2016, according to Novatek.  To contact the reporters on this story:
