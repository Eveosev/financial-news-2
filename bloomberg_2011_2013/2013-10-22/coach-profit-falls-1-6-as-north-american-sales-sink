Coach Inc. (COH) , the largest U.S. luxury
handbag maker, said fiscal first-quarter profit fell 1.6 percent
as stiffer competition curtailed handbag sales in  North America .  Net income in the three months ended Sept. 28 dropped to
$217.9 million, or 77 cents a share, from $221.4 million, or 77
cents, a year earlier, New York-based Coach said today in a
statement. The average of 30 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg was 76 cents.  Coach Chief Executive Officer Lew Frankfort has been trying
to convert the company into a lifestyle brand that sells
everything from bags to shoes amid rising competition for wary
consumers. Coach’s sales at stores open at least a year in North
America sank 6.8 percent in the quarter as Michael Kors Holdings
Ltd., Fifth & Pacific Cos.’  Kate Spade  and Tory Burch LLC
increased distribution of their own products.  “Investors have been concerned that the brand has still
not seen signs of stabilization in North America,” Erinn Murphy, a Minneapolis-based analyst for Piper Jaffray Cos, said
today in a telephone interview. “What Coach is doing is the
right approach. It’s just going to take some time.”  Building a lifestyle brand will take a large investment in
marketing so results will continue to suffer, said Murphy, who
rates the shares neutral, the equivalent of a hold.  Coach fell 7.7 percent to $50 at 10:39 a.m. in  New York  and
earlier slid as much as 8.6 percent for the biggest intraday
decline since July 30. The shares dropped 2.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 22 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The North American same-store sales decline was worse than
the analysts’ average estimate for a 2.9 percent drop.  Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $1.15 billion, trailing
analysts’ $1.19 billion average estimate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
