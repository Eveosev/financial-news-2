California  raised yields on some
securities in the second and final day of a $2.28 billion sale
of general-obligation bonds, its biggest such issue since April.  The debt included 10-year bonds with a yield of 3.19
percent yesterday, up from 3.15 percent on Oct. 21. The yield
was about 0.39 percentage point higher than top-rated 10-year
munis, Bloomberg  data  show. In April, selling $2.7 billion in
securities, California priced 10-year bonds to yield 2.37
percent, or about 0.58 percentage point above the benchmark.  California’s economic rebound, which has squeezed the
state’s yield premium to an almost six-year low, boosted
confidence in its debt, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said yesterday.  “For taxpayers and for me, that’s a good thing,” Lockyer
said on Bloomberg Television’s “Bottom Line” with Mark Crumpton. “It’s still a good tax-free investment for people.
We’re finding that the demand is holding up.”  Bonds of the most-indebted state are rated A, sixth-highest, by  Standard & Poor’s . Proceeds will go toward projects
such as schools and earthquake protection.  The spread on the state’s 10-year bonds was about  0.31
percentage point  yesterday, near the lowest since November 2007,
according to a Bloomberg index. That’s down from  1.7 percentage
points  in July 2009, when an impasse over how to close a  budget
deficit  led the state to issue IOUs to cover spending, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Governor  Jerry Brown , a Democrat who took office in January
2011, has championed higher sales and income taxes while also
taking  measures  to reduce the state’s short- and long-term debt.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
