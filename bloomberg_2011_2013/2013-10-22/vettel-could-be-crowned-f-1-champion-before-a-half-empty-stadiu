Sebastian Vettel could be crowned
Formula One champion this weekend in front of a half-empty
stadium, according to projected attendance figures from the
organizer of the Indian Grand Prix.  Sameer Gaur, chief executive officer of promoter Jaypee
Sports International Ltd., said in a telephone interview last
week that he expects 50,000 to 52,000 people to attend the Oct.
27 race near  New Delhi , a figure that includes corporate guests.
 Jaypee ’s website says the Buddh International Circuit has a
capacity of around 100,000.  Gaur said Jaypee had sold 20,000 tickets to non-corporate
race fans as of Oct. 18, but that he expects a late surge in
demand to boost that number to between 40,000 and 45,000.  “We’re hoping sales will increase as the race nears,”
Gaur said. “Sales usually pick up towards the end. Things
should be OK.”  Last year 65,000 attended the Indian Grand Prix, down from
95,000 in 2011. Both races were won by Red Bull’s Vettel. F-1
Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  told the Indo-Asian
News Service in July that  India  will be dropped from the 2014
race calendar and return in early 2015.  Vettel needs a top-five finish from the Grand Prix to
guarantee a fourth-straight world championship, a feat achieved
only by fellow German  Michael Schumacher  and Juan Manuel Fangio
of  Argentina . The 26-year-old has won nine out of 15 races this
season, including the last five.  To contact the reporters on this story:
