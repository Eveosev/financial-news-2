Brazil ’s real declined to a two-week
low on speculation the central bank will limit the rollover of
currency swaps.  The currency slid 0.4 percent to 2.1837 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:04 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . Swap rates due January 2015 declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.54 percent.  The central bank announced yesterday it will auction as
much as $1 billion of foreign-exchange swaps today, according to
an e-mailed statement. It didn’t say whether it will roll over
the remaining $7.9 billion in swaps that also mature Nov. 1 in
potential auctions tomorrow and Oct. 24.  “The smaller size of the rollover signals the central
bank’s intention of not letting the dollar rise much beyond the
current level,” Paulo Petrassi, managing partner at Leme
Investimentos, said in a phone interview from Florianopolis,
Brazil. “The central bank needs to look at both ends due to
it’s need to control inflation, and on the other hand, it’s need
to improve the  trade balance .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
