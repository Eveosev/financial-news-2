Cardiovascular Systems Inc. (CSII)   soared 
the most in four years after U.S. regulators approved its
Diamondback 360 device used to clear calcium from clogged
arteries without review by an expert advisory panel.  The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  cleared the
Diamondback, the first coronary system for calcium removal known
as atherectomy in more than 20 years, for those with severely
calcified arteries. About 40 percent of patients getting artery-clearing procedures have significant calcium buildup, creating a
$1.5 billion annual market, CSI said in a statement.  The early approval strengthens  St. Paul , Minnesota-based
CSI’s potential as a takeover target, said Danielle Antalffy, an
analyst at Leerink Swann & Co. in New York, in a note to clients
today. While similar systems are approved for use in the
peripheral arteries, the Diamondback will compete only against
 Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) ’s Rotoblater in the heart, she said.  The approval “makes CSII a much more attractive
acquisition target given its best-in-class atherectomy device,
strong growth profile, and highly underpenetrated market
opportunity,” Antalffy said. “We believe the coronary
indication could expand CSII’s addressable market opportunity by
another $1.2 billion plus, versus the current $1.5 billion
atherectomy in peripheral arterial disease market,” she said.  Cardiovascular Systems rose 18 percent to $26.75 at the
close in  New York , its biggest one-day increase since November
2009. The shares have more than doubled far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
