Martin Strobel, chief executive
officer of  Baloise Holding AG (BALN) , said the Swiss insurer could
raise dividends in “small steps.”  “We work on the sustainable earnings power of Baloise,”
Strobel told analysts at the company’s investor day in Basel,
 Switzerland  today. “This makes me very confident that the
upside risk of the dividend is higher than the downside risk.”  Switzerland’s third-biggest insurer last increased its
dividend in 2008 to 4.50 Swiss francs ($4.98), and has kept it
there since. The company, which says it wants to give investors
an attractive and reliable payout, pays the dividend from
operating earnings, said Strobel, who became CEO in 2009.  “If we were to increase the dividend, please expect small
steps” to between 4.60 francs and 4.75 francs, Strobel said.
“Given our more sustainable thinking, it is not wise to take a
big step.”  Baloise reduced its return-on-equity goal this year as low
 interest rates  put pressure on investment returns. The 150-year-old insurer said it will also cut about 400 jobs by the end of
2017 as it targets annual savings of 40 million euros ($54.7
million) in  Germany  until 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
