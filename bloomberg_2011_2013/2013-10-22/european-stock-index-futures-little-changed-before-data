European stocks  rallied for a ninth
day, their longest winning streak since June 2010, as companies
from Novartis AG to  Reckitt Benckiser (RB/)  Group Plc raised forecasts
and the U.S.  unemployment rate  fell to an almost five-year low.  Novartis rose 2 percent, making the biggest contribution to
the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s gains. Reckitt Benckiser jumped the
most since February 2009. Tele2 AB tumbled to a four-year low
after  Sweden ’s second-largest phone company posted an unexpected
loss and lowered its 2015 forecast for sales and profit. Telekom
 Austria  AG slid 5.7 percent after buying frequency blocks at a
spectrum auction.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5 percent to 320.97, extending a
five-year high. The gauge has increased 3.4 percent so far this
month as U.S. lawmakers agreed to extend the government’s
borrowing powers until 2014 and ended a partial government
shutdown.  “The tapering debate will never go away,”  Manish Singh ,
who helps manage $2 billion as head of investments at
Crossbridge Capital in  London , said. “While the jobs data
didn’t move the needle dramatically and the revision was
positive, the rate of increase shows a slowdown, if anything.
This means investors see the Fed remaining accommodative for
longer, which is positive for equities.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 12 of the 18
western-European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 added 0.4
percent and  Germany ’s DAX climbed 0.9 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 advanced 0.6 percent.  Delayed Data  American payrolls climbed less than projected in September,
data released more than two weeks later than scheduled showed
today. The addition of 148,000 workers followed a revised
193,000 rise in August that was larger than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast of 93
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 180,000 advance.
The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.2 percent, the lowest level
since November 2008.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will hold a two-day
meeting beginning on Oct. 29. The Fed will delay the first
reduction in its monthly bond purchases until March because the
closure of federal agencies slowed fourth-quarter growth and
interrupted the gathering of data, economists said in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Novartis, Reckitt  Novartis AG (NOVN)  climbed 2 percent to 69.25 Swiss francs after
raising its full-year forecasts. Sales will increase at a low-to
mid-single-digit percentage rate in constant currencies, and
core operating income will match or exceed the previous year,
Europe’s biggest drugmaker said. In July, the company forecast a
low-single-digit percentage decline in earnings in 2013, with
sales rising at a similar rate.  Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Nurofen painkillers and
Durex condoms, jumped 5.2 percent to 4,734 pence. Full-year
revenue will grow at least 6 percent, including acquisitions and
divestments and excluding results from the pharmaceutical unit.
The company had expected non-pharmaceutical revenue growth at
the upper end of 5 percent to 6 percent in 2013, including
acquisitions and disposals, and stable operating-profit margins.  “European earnings are mixed, but expectations were low,”
said Jean-Paul Jeckelmann, who helps manage $1.4 billion as
chief investment officer at Banque Bonhote & Cie. in Neuchatel,
 Switzerland . “Guidances are that next year will be better and
investors are pleased with this idea.”  Special Dividend  Gjensidige Forsikring ASA rallied 8 percent to 109.40
kroner, its highest price since it sold shares to the public in
December 2010. Norway’s largest insurer said it will pay an
extraordinary dividend of 6 kroner a share ($1.01) and will
adopt a policy that targets a pay-out ratio of at least 70
percent of profit after tax from 2014.  Transocean Ltd. gained 4.8 percent to 43.96 francs, its
biggest increase since January. The dual-listed offshore-drilling contractor will replace Dell Inc. in the  S&P 500  after
the close of trading on Oct. 28, S&P said in a statement late
yesterday.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BLT)  rose 4.1 percent to 1,950.5 pence after
the world’s largest mining company upgraded its projection for
full-year iron-ore production to 212 million tons from its
earlier forecast of 207 million tons.  Tele2 slumped 12 percent to 75.65 kronor, leading a gauge
of European telecommunications shares to its first loss in nine
days. The company posted a third-quarter net loss of 171 million
kronor ($26.7 million), missing the 518 million-kronor profit
analysts had estimated. Tele2 also reduced its forecasts for
2015 sales to not more than 33.5 billion kronor and for earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that year
to a maximum of 7.3 billion kronor.  Spectrum Sale  Telekom Austria  plunged 5.7 percent to 5.92 euros, its
biggest drop since September 2012, after buying half of the 28
available frequency blocks in a spectrum auction in Austria for
1.03 billion euros ($1.41 billion). The prices paid by operators
in the sale exceeded expectations, Raiffeisen Centrobank analyst
Bernd Maurer said.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG declined 2.4 percent to 14.51 euros
after saying it expects an operating result of 600 million euros
to 700 million euros in 2014. That compares with 524 million
euros last year, according to a company statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
