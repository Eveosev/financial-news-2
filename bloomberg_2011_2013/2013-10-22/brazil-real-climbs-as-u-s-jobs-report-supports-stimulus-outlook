Brazil ’s real rose for the first
time in three days as the U.S. payrolls report added to
speculation that the Federal Reserve will maintain a stimulus
program that has supported emerging-market assets.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.1706 per U.S.
dollar at 1:05 p.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier today falling as
much as 0.7 percent. Swap rates on contracts maturing in January
2015 declined six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
10.51 percent.  “The U.S. employment data were bad, which puts the issue
of the Fed tapering stimulus on hold again,” boosting demand
for the real, Hideaki Iha, a currency trader at Fair Corretora
in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.  The real declined earlier today on speculation Brazil’s
policy makers will limit the rollover of foreign-exchange swaps
that have supported the world’s biggest currency rally. While
the central bank plans to auction today as much as $1 billion of
foreign-exchange swaps maturing Nov. 1, it didn’t say whether it
would roll over the remaining $7.9 billion in swaps.  The currency has gained 12 percent since Aug. 22, when
Brazil announced a $60 billion program of swaps and credit lines
to buoy the currency and curb import price increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
