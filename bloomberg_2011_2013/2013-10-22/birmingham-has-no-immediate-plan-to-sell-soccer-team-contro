Birmingham International Holdings
Ltd. (2309) , owner of the English soccer team Birmingham City, said it
has “no immediate plans” to sell a controlling stake in either
the club or its holding company.  “No written agreement has been reached or signed with any
party in relation to the disposal of all or parts of the
company’s equity interest in Birmingham City Plc and/or
Birmingham City Football Club” the company said in a Hong Kong
stock exchange filing yesterday.  Birmingham International said it was responding to media
articles on the possible sale of the team at the request of Hong
Kong’s stock exchange. It didn’t identify the publications.  The company said in February that it had been approached by
a sports management company representing a group of investors
interested in buying the team. Birmingham City was relegated
from the elite Premier League in May 2011, a month before its
largest shareholder,  Carson Yeung , was arrested in Hong Kong on
five counts of  money laundering . He’s now on trial.  Birmingham International said last month that it expects to
record a “significant” net loss for the year ended June 30,
2013. The company has delayed publication of the annual earnings
to no later than Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
