Discover Financial Services (DFS)  fell the
most in almost two months after reporting a third-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates as the lender set aside more
money to cover soured loans.  The stock was the third-worst performer among 81 companies
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index, sliding 2.3
percent to $52.48 at 9:52 a.m. in  New York , the biggest drop
since Aug. 27.  Net income  declined 6.9 percent to $593 million,
or $1.20 a share, from a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based firm said yesterday in a statement. That missed the $1.21
average  estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Discover, owner of the fourth-biggest U.S. payments
network, added $333 million to its reserve for soured loans, a
$197 million increase from the third quarter of 2012. The
“larger-than-expected loan-loss provision was the primary
source of the modest miss,” Jason Arnold, an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets , said in an e-mail. That “may lead shares to
give a little back.”  Chief Executive Officer David Nelms, 52, is seeking to
drive more transactions to Discover’s global network, in
addition to those from the lender’s traditional credit-card
clients. The firm said earlier this year that it will help
online processor PayPal extend its reach to 2 million brick-and-mortar merchant locations by the end of 2013.  Next Step  Discover is still in the process of signing and
implementation. “The next step will be the launch of these
various initiatives,” Nelms said in a phone interview.
“Profits should follow after that.”  The company sets loan-loss reserves on a forward-looking
basis. The recent government shutdown and debt-ceiling standoff
weren’t considered when setting the reserves.  “A bigger driver for loan losses is job losses,” Nelms
said in the interview. “If our forecast were showing higher job
losses we would take that into account.”  Total loans increased 5.2 percent to $62.7 billion from a
year earlier, helped by a 4 percent increase in credit-card
loans, according to the statement. Discover card sales rose 3.2
percent to $28 billion, and write-offs fell to 2.05 percent, the
company said.  “Card loan growth continues to exceed industry growth
while charge-offs achieved new record lows,” Nelms said in the
statement.  Revenue climbed 2.8 percent to $2.06 billion, matching the
average estimate of analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, said Oct. 16 that third-quarter profit rose 9.3
percent to $1.37 billion on higher worldwide card spending.
McLean, Virginia-based  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  said the next
day that net income slid 5.2 percent to $1.12 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
