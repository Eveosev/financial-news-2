Macquarie Capital and  Maeda Corp. (1824) 
plan to set up a joint venture by year end to develop clean
energy and transport infrastructure businesses.  The venture will first focus on large-scale solar projects
in Japan, Macquarie said in a statement. The partners intend to
expand it to include wind power generation and road and airport
concessions.  They are targeting 300 megawatts of generation capacity and
investment of 100 billion yen ($1 billion) in renewable energy
businesses in the first three years, according to the statement.
For each project, the partners will set up a special purpose
company and raise financing from lenders.  The companies are hoping to take advantage of Japan’s
renewable energy subsidies introduced in 2012, and
infrastructure projects related to rebuilding after the 2011
earthquake and tsunami and for the 2020 Tokyo  Olympic Games ,
according to the statement.  Maeda is a general contractor based in Tokyo that’s
developing wind and solar projects. Macquarie Capital is a unit
of the Sydney-based  Macquarie Group. (MQG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
