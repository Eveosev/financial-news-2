Baloise Holding AG (BALN) , Switzerland’s
third-biggest insurer, said it may reduce the level of its
outstanding senior bonds by 2020 to cut its financing costs.  “If interest rates rise, we have the choice to either
refinance expiring bonds or just reduce the leverage ratio,”
Chief Financial Officer German Egloff said today at the
company’s investor day in  Basel , Switzerland. “Since we assume
higher yield levels in the mid-term future, the leverage level
in say 2020 might be somewhat lower than today’s level.”  The insurer has 700 million francs ($782 million) in
outstanding senior debt that will expire between 2017 and 2020
and it will let some of those bonds run out rather than
refinance them, as financing costs are lower in the current
environment of low interest rates.  The money that Baloise saves by letting some of the senior
bonds expire could be used in various ways to increase its
“financial flexibility,” Egloff said. The company has no
target by how much it will reduce the level of outstanding
bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
