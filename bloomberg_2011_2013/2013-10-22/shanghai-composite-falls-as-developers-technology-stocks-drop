China ’s  stocks  fell, led by property
developers, on concern the government may introduce measures to
contain housing prices after they climbed in all but one city
the government tracks. Technology shares also dropped, while
 drugmakers  advanced.  The  Shanghai  Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to
2,222.41 at 9:49 a.m. local time, after jumping by the most in a
week yesterday. The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.4 percent to
2,461.94. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 0.6
percent.  New home prices climbed in 69 of the 70 cities the
government tracked in September from a year earlier, led by 20
percent increases in the southern business hubs of Shenzhen and
Guangzhou, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement. Prices in Beijing rose 16 percent and advanced 17
percent in Shanghai, the biggest gains since the government
changed its methodology for the home data in 2011.  China may release a plan for land reform at the third
plenum of the Communist Party’s central committee next month,
the China Securities Journal reported, citing an unidentified
person as saying.  Premier  Li Keqiang  has come up with no additional measures
to rein in property prices since his predecessor  Wen Jiabao 
stepped up a three-year campaign in March to cool the housing
market, ordering the central bank to raise down-payment
requirements for second mortgages in cities with excessive cost
gains.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
