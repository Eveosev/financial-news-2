United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  reported
third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates, driven by
sales of air conditioners and aircraft components.  Net income rose 1.2 percent to $1.43 billion, or $1.55 a
share, from $1.42 billion, or $1.37, a year earlier, the
Hartford, Connecticut-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected $1.54, the average of 20  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  United Technologies  also boosted the lower end of its full-year earnings per share forecast today to a range of $6.10 to
$6.15, up from $6 to $6.15, previously. Full-year sales will be
about $63 billion, down from a prior projection of $64 billion.  The “weakness in military aerospace markets and slow pace
of recovery in Europe” will damp annual revenue, Chief
Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  said today.  Chenevert is reshaping the company to focus on the
commercial-construction industries and aviation after completing
the $16.5 billion  acquisition  of Goodrich Corp., the largest
aerospace takeover in history.  Profit at the Aerospace Systems business, which includes
Goodrich, climbed 85 percent to $501 million. Climate Control &
Security profit climbed 10 percent to $696 million.  United Technologies  fell  less than 1 percent to $107.62
yesterday in New York. The stock had advanced 31 percent this
year, compared with a 22 percent gain for the  Standard & Poor’s 
500 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
