Telecom Egypt , the country’s
landline phone monopoly, surged to the highest since February
after  Vodafone Plc (VOD)  expressed interest in buying the shares it
doesn’t already own in the companies’ local joint venture.  Telecom  Egypt   surged  3.7 percent to 14.42 Egyptian pounds
at 1:04 p.m. in Cairo, poised for the strongest close since Feb.
24. The benchmark EGX 30 Index rose 2 percent.  The sale “could raise about $2 billion for Telecom Egypt,
which means that a generous special dividend might be on the
cards,” Cairo-based analysts Ahmed Adel and Allen Sandeep at
Naeem Brokerage wrote in a note to investors today. “The cash
would also provide Telecom Egypt the financial firepower to buy
a 4G license and roll out a network.”  Vodafone is ready to buy the 45 percent stake, an official
at the company said, declining to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to comment on the matter. Buying the share could end
a conflict of interest that has arisen after Telecom Egypt
applied for an integrated license, the person said. The Cairo-based company hasn’t received a formal offer, an official said,
declining to comment further.  The integrated license would allow Telecom Egypt,  80
percent owned by the government , to provide mobile services. The
company said in August it’s not obliged to sell the Vodafone
stake to acquire license.  Telecom Egypt shares have gained 1.9 percent this year
compared with a 14 percent advance for the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
