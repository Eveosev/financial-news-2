Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
Michael Vick said he’s not sure he’ll be healthy enough to start
against the  New York  Giants this weekend.  “I wish I could give you a definitive answer, but I can’t
right now,” Vick told reporters today, the team said on its
website.  Vick has missed the Eagles’ last two games after injuring
his hamstring in a 36-21 win at the Giants on Oct. 6. His
replacement, Nick Foles, suffered a concussion in the Eagles’
17-3 home loss to the Dallas Cowboys two days ago. Foles was
replaced at the end of the third quarter by Matt Barkley, who
threw interceptions in each of his three fourth-quarter
possessions.  The Eagles fell to 3-4 with the loss, while the Giants beat
the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 last night, their first win of the
season.  The Eagles and the Giants meet at Lincoln Financial Field
in Philadelphia on Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
