Saks Inc. (SKS)  said it reached an
agreement to settle lawsuits by investors seeking to block the
retailer’s $2.4 billion acquisition by Canadian department-store
chain Hudson’s Bay Co.  The agreement decreases the potential termination fee from
Saks to Hudson’s Bay if the deal fails, and shortens the period
in which the Canadian company can match any alternative offer,
Saks said today in a regulatory filing. The agreement will pave
the way for the dismissal of the lawsuits, the company said.  Hudson’s Bay, founded in the 17th century as a fur-trading
company, agreed in July to pay $16 a share in cash, a 30 percent
premium to New York-based Saks’s closing price on May 20, the
day before reports emerged that Saks was exploring alternatives.
Investors including Thomas Jennings and Samuel Cohen filed suits
against Saks, its directors and Hudson’s Bay. Jennings had said
the proposed deal undervalued Saks.  The transaction would bring together the Hudson’s Bay,
Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue brands, creating a company
with more than 300 stores and revenue of about $7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
