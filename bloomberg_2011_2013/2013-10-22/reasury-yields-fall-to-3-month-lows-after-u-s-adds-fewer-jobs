Treasury 10-year note yields fell to
a three-month low after a report showed payrolls climbed less
than projected in September, indicating the U.S. economy had
little momentum leading up to the federal government shutdown.  European, Canadian and emerging-markets debt also rallied
as the payrolls report added to speculation that the Federal
Reserve will maintain its U.S. bond-buying program into next
year, which has helped to keep borrowing costs low worldwide.
The Treasury’s auction of $35 billion of one-month bills
attracted demand at close to the pre-government shutdown average
seen for the securities this year as investor concern that the
U.S. may default ebbed. A measure of volatility in Treasuries
dropped to the lowest level since May.  “Yields aren’t headed higher, certainly, in the face of
this report,” said  Bill Gross , the co-chief investment officer
at Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co., in an interview on Bloomberg Radio with  Tom Keene . “We
will grudgingly go lower from this point. We probably won’t be
tapering anytime soon.”  The benchmark U.S.  10-year yield  fell nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 2.51 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed, the lowest since July 24. The
price of the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 rose 3/4, or
$7.50 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 28/32.  The yield touched 3.005 percent on Sept. 6, breaching 3
percent for the first time since July 2011, and up from a 2013
low of 1.61 percent on May 1. Its  10-year average  is 3.56
percent.  “The 10-year, at 2.50 percent, belongs where it is at the
moment,” Gross said.  Volatility, Volume  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index dropped to 63, the lowest level since
May. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest level in two
months. It touched a record low 49 on May 9.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose 61 percent to $338.5
billion, from $211 billion yesterday. The average this year is
$315.5 billion.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield fell five basis points to 1.80
percent after reaching 1.79 percent, the lowest since Oct. 9.
The 10-year gilt yield fell 10 basis points to 2.64 percent
after touching 2.63 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 27.
Italy’s 10-year yield fell nine basis points to 4.10 percent,
the lowest level since June 5.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government yield dropped seven
basis points to 2.48 percent and reached 2.47 percent, the
lowest level since Aug. 12. Yields on peso bonds due in December
2024 fell 10 basis points to 5.68 percent.  ‘A Disappointment’  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 34.7 today, down from 39 yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  “This number was clearly a disappointment,” said Paul Montaquila, fixed-income investment officer with BNP Paribas
SA’s Bank of the West, referring to the jobs report. “We’re not
going to get anything over the next two to three months that
will get the 10-year yield over 3 percent. We will continue to
see bond purchases well into 2014.”  Net Longs  The proportion of net longs among Treasuries investors
climbed to 8 percentage points in the week ending yesterday, up
from 6 percentage points in the week ending Oct. 15, according
to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The percent of outright longs, or bets the securities will
increase in value, rose to 23 percent, from 21 percent,
according to the survey. The percent of outright shorts was
unchanged at 15 percent. Investors cut neutral bets to 62
percent, from 64 percent.  “We’re going to test the downside now, move closer to the
2.5 threshold on 10-year yields,” said Richard Schlanger, who
helps invest $20 billion in fixed-income securities as vice
president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston . “Any tapering’s
been pushed back to December at the earliest. They’d like to see
firmer nonfarm payrolls.”  The $35 billion of four-week bills sold today  drew a rate 
of 0.03 percent, down from 0.35 percent on Oct. 8, which was the
highest since October 2008.  The  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges demand by comparing
the amount bid with the amount offered, was 4.31, compared with
4.33 at the last auction, and up from 2.75 on Oct. 8. The
average was 4.18 at the 10 auctions before the Oct. 1 shutdown.  ‘Much Weaker’  Payrolls grew by 148,000 in September versus the median
forecast for a 180,000 advance by 93 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The gain followed a revised 193,000 rise in August
that was larger than initially estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in  Washington . Unemployment fell to 7.2
percent, the lowest level since November 2008.  The reports, delayed by the 16-day shutdown that ended Oct.
17, were originally slated for Oct. 4.  “These were much weaker payrolls than expected -- there’s
really no bright spot in the data you can point to,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New York at primary
dealer Credit Suisse Group AG. “This makes their decision not
to taper look insightful, given the weakness in the numbers. We
will have to wait till the November data comes out in December
to get a clear picture of what’s going on in the economy.”  Jersey said “we could probably go down to 2.47 percent on
the 10-year.”  China Trims  Foreign investors were net sellers of U.S. long-term
portfolio assets in August, with the net long-term portfolio
investment  outflow  at $8.9 billion after a revised $31 billion
inflow in July, the Treasury Department said in a statement in
Washington.  China remained the biggest foreign owner of U.S. Treasuries
in August even as its holdings dropped for the second time in
three months, by $11.2 billion to $1.27 trillion.  Japan , the
second-largest holder, increased its share by $13.7 billion to
$1.15 trillion, the figures showed.  The Treasury data cover a period before the Fed opted
against reducing its monthly bond buying at its Sept. 17-18
meeting.  Economists predict the Fed will maintain its $85 billion of
monthly bond buying until March, according to a Bloomberg survey
conducted Oct. 17-18. They forecast the government closure cut
growth by 0.3 percentage point this quarter.  Before the shutdown, most policy makers said the central
bank would probably reduce bond purchases this year. The Fed’s
next two policy meetings are Oct. 29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  Rate Expectations  Traders are pricing in a 29.1 percent probability that the
Fed will raise its benchmark overnight rate by its January 2015
meeting, down from a 70.7 percent likelihood on Sept. 5, the day
before the August payroll data was released.  Standard & Poor’s estimates the shutdown, which ended Oct.
17, shaved at least 0.6 percent from fourth-quarter 2013 gross-domestic-product growth, taking $24 billion out of the economy.  The Fed purchased $1.56 billion of Treasuries maturing
between February 2036 and February 2043 today as part of the
program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
