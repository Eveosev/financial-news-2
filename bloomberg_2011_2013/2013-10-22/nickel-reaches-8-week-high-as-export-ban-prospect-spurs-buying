Nickel jumped to a nine-week high in
 London  as investors purchased the metal to close out bets on
mounting concern that ore exports will be halted next year from
 Indonesia , the world’s largest producer.  A government ban on shipments from Indonesia of ores
including bauxite, used to make aluminum, and nickel may take
effect next year to aid local processing. Nickel got a boost
from investors who bought the metal to liquidate bets on lower
prices, according to Citigroup Inc. Prices have tumbled 13
percent this year, the most among the six main metals traded on
the London Metal Exchange.  There is “growing nervousness about a potential export ban
on Indonesian ores that kicks in at the beginning of the new
year,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone in  New York ,
said in a report.  Nickel for delivery in three months climbed 3.4 percent to
settle at $14,850 a metric ton at 5:51 p.m. local time on the
LME. Prices reached $14,880, the highest since Aug. 19.  The metal slumped this year as stockpiles tracked by the
LME expanded to a record, reaching 231,480 tons today, according
to daily exchange data.  Open interest , or the number of futures
outstanding, fell 4.9 percent last week from a record on Oct.
11.  The fee to borrow nickel for a day on the LME reached $12 a
ton today, the highest since Nov. 30, 2011.  Citigroup said yesterday that prices may rally above
$17,000 in the first quarter.  Payrolls in the U.S. climbed less than projected in
September, a government report showed today, indicating the
economy had little momentum leading up to the federal government
shutdown that ended last week. Progress in reducing unemployment
is among criteria weighed by the  Federal Reserve  in deciding
whether to slow economic stimulus.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 1.2 percent to
$7,332 a ton ($3.33 a pound) in London. Aluminum, zinc, lead and
tin also advanced.  In New York, copper futures for delivery in December added
1 percent to close at $3.3355 a pound on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
