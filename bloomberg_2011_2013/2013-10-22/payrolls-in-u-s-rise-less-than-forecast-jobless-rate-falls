Employers in the U.S. added fewer workers to payrolls than projected in September, indicating the world’s largest economy had little momentum leading up to the federal government shutdown.  The addition of 148,000 workers followed a revised 193,000 gain in August that was larger than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 180,000 advance. Unemployment fell to 7.2 percent, the lowest level since November 2008.  Stocks and Treasuries climbed as the report supported expectations that the  Federal Reserve  won’t hurry to reduce the monthly bond purchases aimed at spurring growth and employment. Progress in the labor market depends on how quickly the economy can bounce back from the loss of business and confidence caused by the budget battles in Washington.  “It’s not like we’re falling off a cliff, but there’s a failure to get any spark in employment,” said  Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New York . “Had this report come in strong, there was some possibility of the Fed tapering in December, but that possibility seems to be very small now.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to 1,755.49 at 10:04 a.m. in New York. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.53 percent.  Federal Shutdown  The September payroll figure reflects the pay period that includes the 12th of the month, two weeks prior to the 16-day federal shutdown.  The  unemployment rate , derived from a separate Labor Department survey of households rather than employers, was forecast to remain at 7.3 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey median.  It will take some time to determine whether the shutdown and political brinkmanship in Washington led to a sharp pullback in activity this month, so the data may be discounted, some economists said.  “It’s hard to imagine that October payrolls will be any better than September, considering the additional effect of the shutdown,” said  Guy Lebas , chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.  Temporary Help  Employment climbed at temporary-help agencies, wholesalers, transportation and warehousing businesses and retailers. State and local government hiring also picked up.  Josh Lefebvre, 21, started a job as a legal assistant in Alexandria,  Virginia , on Oct. 7, having just graduated from Binghamton University in New York in May. He had applied for “maybe 10 or 15” jobs and worked with a staffing agency before finding his new position.  “I consider myself luckier than other people who are in my age, in that I found a job fairly quickly,” he said. “It’s been tough on a lot of people who didn’t take on internships beforehand, because it’s very competitive.”  Private employment, which excludes government agencies, rose 126,000 after a revised gain of 161,000. Private payrolls were also projected to rise by 180,000, the survey showed.  Full-time employment climbed by 691,000 in September while part-time hiring dropped by 594,000.  Employment at  factories  increased by 2,000 following a 13,000 gain in the previous month. Construction companies added 20,000 workers, the most since February, and retailers took on almost 21,000 employees.  Consumer Spending  Faster hiring that leads to bigger gains in wages would help to accelerate  consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Even as the debate on fiscal policy heated up last month, retailers began announcing plans to add workers for the  holiday shopping season .  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s largest retailer, is hiring 55,000 seasonal employees, a 10 percent rise from last year.  Target Corp. (TGT)  said it plans to take on about 70,000 workers.  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  will add about 53,000 workers for the holiday season, about the same as last year.  Through August, the U.S. had recovered 6.8 million of the 8.7 million jobs lost as a result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  President  Barack Obama  last week signed legislation that funds the government through mid-January and suspends the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt limit, for now ending the threat of default, which economists had warned could tip the U.S. back into a recession.  Hourly Earnings  Average hourly earnings climbed by 0.1 percent to $24.09 in September from the prior month, and increased 2.1 percent over the past 12 months. The average work week for all workers held at 34.5 hours in September.  Today’s report, delayed by the government shutdown that ended Oct. 17, was originally slated for Oct. 4. The report doesn’t include any late responses from employers, indicating the figures will be subject to revision as is typical each month.  Employment figures for October report will be pushed back to Nov. 8 from the originally scheduled Nov. 1, according to the Labor Department.  Fed policy makers, scheduled to gather Oct. 29-30, are trying to gauge the strength of the U.S. expansion without federal economic data that was suspended after the government closing.  The central bankers will pare the monthly pace of asset buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the median of 40 responses in a Bloomberg survey last week.  Bernanke’s View  “Conditions in the job market today are still far from what all of us would like to see,” Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said at a news conference following the Fed’s September meeting.  While the labor market has shown improvement, the political debate over the shutdown and the debt limit may have been a source of concern for employers.  San Francisco  based  URS Corp. (URS) , a provider of engineering and construction services, furloughed about 3,000 employees, saying the total includes employees idled by the closing of a government facility where they work as well as those directed by U.S. officials to halt operations or cut staffing.  Among other companies paring their workforce, San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, last week said it eliminated an additional 925 jobs in its home-loan unit and has cut more than 5,700 since midyear.
