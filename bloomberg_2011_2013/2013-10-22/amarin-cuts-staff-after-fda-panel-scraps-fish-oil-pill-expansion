Amarin Corp. (AMRN)  said it will fire about
half of its employees after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration
advisory panel failed to back expanded use of its fish-oil pill
Vascepa for those with high levels of fat in their blood.  The panel voted 9-2 on Oct. 16 that Amarin should complete
a study on the drug’s heart benefits before it is considered for
the 36 million Americans with high triglyceride levels. The
Dublin-based company said it is still evaluating its spending
priorities and will consider other cost-cutting measures,
including ongoing clinical trial expenses. It said it will give
more details when it reports earnings next month.  The pill is already approved for people with “severely”
high levels of the blood fat, a much smaller pool comprised of
about 4 million people, according to company data. Amarin, which
has cash and cash equivalents of about $226 million on hand,
said it will keep about half its highest performing sales force
to pursue further growth in prescription sales of Vascepa in
specific geographical locations.  “With this optimization and resulting target base
coverage, Amarin anticipates continued Vascepa revenue growth
over time,” the company said in a statement. “Given the
outcome of the advisory committee meeting, Amarin feels this
shift in staffing is the appropriate corporate action.”  The FDA, which isn’t obligated to follow the advisory
panel’s recommendation, is scheduled to decide whether to clear
the drug for wider use by Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
