Sojitz Corp. (2768) , a Japanese trader that
earns a third of its profit from consumer goods and services,
will invest in a Brazilian grain harvester and collector to tap
food demand in  Asia .  Sao Paulo-based Cantagalo General Grains SA farms 150,000
hectares and collects 2 million metric tons of grains a year,
Tokyo-based Sojitz said in a  statement . The investment will
include Cantagalo’s exporting unit CGG Trading SA, Sojitz said,
without disclosing the form or the amount.  With the world’s grain consumption more than doubling in
the last four decades, Japan’s trading companies are seeking to
secure supplies in the Americas and eastern Europe to feed
Asia’s growing population. Tokyo-based  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  this year
paid $2.7 billion for Gavilon Group LLC, the third-largest U.S.
grain merchandiser.  Tying up with Cantagalo, which plans to triple its grain
handling volumes by 2020, should help Sojitz boost its own
annual grain trade to 10 million tons in the same period, the
Japanese company said. It didn’t specify its grain volume.  To make the  Brazil  project a success, Sojitz and its local
partner will also help build the Itaqui port in northern Brazil,
the company said. Most of Brazil’s grain is exported from the
nation’s southern ports, which have become congested, Sojitz
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
