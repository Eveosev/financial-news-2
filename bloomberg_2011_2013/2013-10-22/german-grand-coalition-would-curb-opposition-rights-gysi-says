The grand coalition sought by
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Union bloc and the Social
Democrats would curb opposition rights and require legal
changes, parliament’s prospective opposition leader said.  Opposition rights in parliament are often tied to a minimum
share of 25 percent of the seats, Gregor Gysi, caucus chief of
the anti-capitalist Left Party,  said  today on ARD television. A
grand coalition would take 80 percent of the seats, leaving the
Left and Greens with insufficient representation for checks and
balances on the majority in parliament.  “There would be no parliamentary investigation committees,
there would be no constitutional court proceedings to examine
whether laws comply with the constitution,” Gysi said, adding
that Norbert Lammert, president of the parliament, had reacted
positively to his concerns.  The SPD approved starting coalition talks Oct. 20 after the
party set “essential” conditions for joining up with Merkel’s
Christian Democratic-led bloc, including a nationwide  minimum
wage . Leaders from both factions said the parties will probably
negotiate through November with the goal of swearing in a
coalition of the two largest parties by Christmas.  In parliamentary debates, members of the ruling coalition
would be given 48 minutes of every hour while the two opposition
parties would have to share the remaining 12 minutes, Gysi said.  The Left Party is the direct successor to former East
Germany’s ruling communists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
