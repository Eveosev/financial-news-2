Five men in  China ’s Hunan province
have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information
online in a blackmail scheme targeting government officials, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing local prosecutors.  The head of the group, Ge Qiwei, falsely claimed he was a
news reporter and “blackmailed cadres with negative news,”
Xinhua said. Ge confessed to the charges, which involved
millions of  yuan  as he spread the use of the system to cities
outside of the province, Xinhua reported, citing the Hengyang
city prosecutors.  The men were arrested under a measure introduced last month
aimed at stopping so-called online rumors that has also been
used in an ongoing crackdown against dissent on China’s social
media websites.  Wang Gongquan, a venture capitalist who had millions of
followers on his Sina Corp. microblog account and who supported
activists calling for greater disclosure of officials’ assets,
was formally arrested on charges of assembling a crowd, his
lawyer said yesterday. Police in China’s western Xinjiang region
arrested 110 people for spreading online what the Xinjiang Daily
said Oct. 8 was religious extremist ideology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
