The U.S. Energy Department will
award $60 million to local governments, universities and
companies to accelerate the development of solar power.  About $16 million in grants will be given to four projects
seeking to boost cell efficiency and $12 million will be spread
among 17 solar technology and service companies, according to an
Energy Department statement today.  About $8 million will be given to utilities to assist with
integrating renewable energy into the  power grid . Other
recipients are promoting education and job-training efforts, and
developing more reliable components.  “These awards will help lower the cost of solar
electricity, advance seamless grid integration and support a
growing U.S. solar workforce,” according to the statement. The
industry supports about 119,000 U.S. workers.  The funds, awarded as part of the  SunShot Initiative 
started in 2011, also will be used to reduce the costs of
permitting, installing and connecting solar systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
