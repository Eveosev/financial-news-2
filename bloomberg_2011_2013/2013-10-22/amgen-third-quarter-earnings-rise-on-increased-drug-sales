Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the biotechnology
company that completed its $10.4 billion acquisition of Onyx
Pharmaceuticals Inc. this month, boosted its 2013 forecast after
third-quarter earnings rose 24 percent on higher drug sales.  Net income climbed to $1.37 billion, or $1.79 a share, from
$1.11 billion, or $1.41, a year earlier, the  Thousand Oaks ,
California-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding one-time items were $1.94 a share, beating the $1.78
average of 16 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue in the third quarter increased 9.9 percent to $4.75
billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $4.58 billion.
Sales were boosted by a $155 million order from the U.S.
government of Neupogen, a drug that helps patients on
chemotherapy fight infection.  “If you back that out, it was an in-line quarter,”
 Michael Yee , an analyst with  RBC Capital Markets , said today in
a phone interview. “On the positives, all the revenue products
look generally fine and that keeps the momentum alive in the
sector.”  Amgen shares rose 2.3 percent to $116.21 at the close of
trading today. They are up 35 percent this year, trailing a 52
percent increase for the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index.  Revenue in 2013 will be $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion for
the year, while profit will be $7.35 to $7.45 a share, Amgen
said. Analysts had estimated revenue of $18.3 billion and
earnings of $7.36 a share, on average.  Krypolis’s Prospects  The company, the world’s largest biotechnology firm by
revenue, gained the cancer drug Kyprolis in its acquisition of
Onyx, for $9.7 billion after factoring in Onyx’s cash. The deal,
the industry’s largest this year, gives Amgen expected sales
growth as analysts estimate Kyprolis may draw more than $2
billion in revenue by 2018.  Kyprolis sales were $65 million in the quarter, missing the
$69 million estimate of Chris Raymond, an analyst with  Robert W.
Baird . The drug was approved in July 2012 for multiple myeloma,
a blood cancer.  “Kyprolis came in light of expectations and was
essentially flat quarter over quarter,”  Mark Schoenebaum , an
analyst with ISI Group, wrote in a note to clients today.
“While disappointing, the real potential for Kyprolis will not
be realized until its label is expanded to include earlier lines
of myeloma therapy.”  Trial data are expected in 2014, with marketing approval in
2015, Schoenebaum said.  Revenue was boosted by higher sales of drugs including
Amgen’s  top seller , Enbrel, for psoriasis and arthritis, which
saw an increase of 7 percent to $1.16 billion; and Prolia, for
osteoporosis, which increased 62 percent to $178 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
