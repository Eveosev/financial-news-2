Canola futures rose for the third
straight session, the longest rally since early August, on signs
that increasing demand is soaking up supplies from a record
Canadian harvest.  Exports from  Canada , the world’s largest grower, will climb
10 percent and domestic processing of canola will rise to a
record 7.2 million metric tons, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada
said on Oct. 16. Prices through yesterday were down 19 percent
in the past 12 months on signs that output this year will jump
16 percent to 16 million tons, topping the previous record of
14.6 million tons in 2011.  “Demand is good and firm and strong and is probably going
to continue to be so,” John Duvenaud, publisher of Wild Oats
Grain Market Advisory, said in a telephone interview from
Winnipeg. “We’ve got a big canola crush industry here now, and
it’s operating pretty close to capacity.”  Canola futures for January settlement increased 0.6 percent
to C$502.60 ($488.67) a ton at 11:10 a.m. on the ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching $502.80, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 13. The three-session rally is
the longest since Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
