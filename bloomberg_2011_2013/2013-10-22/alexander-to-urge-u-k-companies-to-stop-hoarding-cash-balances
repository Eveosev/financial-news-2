U.K. Chief Secretary to the Treasury
Danny Alexander will urge businesses to invest the cash balances
they built up during the crisis to help boost the recovery.  “We’ve done the emergency repairs,” Alexander will say in
a speech at the Confederation of British Businesses today,
according to extracts released by his office. The recovery
“won’t get into top gear until British business starts
investing some of the half trillion pounds worth of cash it’s
built up in reserve.”  Britain’s economy is strengthening as confidence returns
and the  housing market  picks up. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  has still pledged to stick to his austerity plan
and has cautioned that risks to growth remain.  Cash balances in non-financial businesses rose 14 billion
pounds ($23 billion) in the last quarter and increased 104
billion pounds, or 26 percent, since pre-crisis levels to more
than 500 billion pounds, according to the Treasury. Business
investment remains at 25 percent below its pre-recession peak.  Data this week will show U.K. economic expansion
accelerated to 0.8 percent in the third quarter after 0.7
percent growth in the three months through June, according to
the median forecast of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The number will be released by the  Office for National
Statistics  on Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
