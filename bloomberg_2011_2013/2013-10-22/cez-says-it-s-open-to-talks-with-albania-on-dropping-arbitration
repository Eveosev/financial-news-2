CEZ AS, the Czech power utility,
said it’s open to talks with Albania about possibly dropping an
international arbitration suit it filed after the Balkan state
revoked its license and seized its assets there this year.  CEZ is willing to consider avoiding arbitration if the two
sides agree on fair compensation, spokeswoman Barbora Pulpanova
said today in an e-mailed message. Earlier, Reuters cited
Albania’s energy minister as saying the country plans to ask CEZ
to drop the suit. The Prague-based company hasn’t received an
official note from Albania’s government, Pulpanova said.  Albanian authorities revoked CEZ’s license, seized its
assets and forced the company out of the country in January,
following almost a year of disputes over tariffs, taxes, and
unpaid electricity bills from local utilities.  CEZ is seeking compensation for damage to its investment in
power distributor CEZ Shperndarje, which it purchased in 2009
for 102 million euros ($139 million). It has invested 100
million euros in repairs and expansion and says the Albanian
regulator ordered it to pay state-owned power producers higher
tariffs without allowing the Czech utility to raise prices for
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
