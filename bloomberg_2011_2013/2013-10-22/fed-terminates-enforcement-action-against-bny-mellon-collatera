The  Federal Reserve  terminated an
enforcement action against  Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  enacted
last year after the world’s largest custody bank misstated
collateral pledged to a government lending program.  The action , which included a $6 million fine, was
terminated effective Oct. 16, the central bank said in a
statement issued today in Washington.  Some collateral the bank pledged to the Federal  Reserve
Bank  of Boston in 2008 was ineligible for the Asset-Backed
Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, a
program set up to help ease the credit squeeze during the
financial crisis, the Fed said in an April 2012  statement . As a
result, BNY Mellon received more in loans than it should have,
the Fed said.  As part of a “consent cease and desist order,” the bank
agreed to submit a plan to the Fed to improve its procedures and
to step up employee training, the Fed said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
