The Bank of  Israel ’s monetary policy
committee decided to increase the amount of the institution’s
foreign reserves invested in German equities at the expense of
its U.S. stocks portfolio.  The committee, in an Oct. 1 vote, approved the transfer of
0.5 percent of the central bank’s reserves, which stood at a
 record high  $79.9 billion at the end of September, to German
equities from U.S. stocks. Before the change, 4.7 percent of the
reserves were invested in the U.S., 0.24 percent each in Germany
and France, and 0.5 percent in the U.K., according to a
statement posted on the central bank’s  website .  “The market operations department believes that under the
current conditions in global  capital markets , shifting part of
the portfolio to investment in Germany conforms with the
department’s portfolio management objectives,” the bank said in
the statement. “The proposed change isn’t expected to affect
the reserves portfolio’s overall level of risk.”  Central banks around the world are looking for alternatives
to holding  government bonds  as yields remain low.  In the month
before the Bank of Israel decision, Germany’s benchmark  DAX
Index (DAX)  rose about 6 percent, double the gain of the S&P 500 Index
during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
