Spanish  government bonds  led gains
in European securities as a report showing U.S. payrolls climbed
last month less than economists predicted fueled speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain monetary stimulus.  Spain ’s two-year notes advanced for a fifth day as the
country sold 3.52 billion euros ($4.85 billion) of three- and
nine-month bills. Italy’s two- and 10-year yields fell to the
lowest levels since June and the rate on  Germany ’s 10-year bund
dropped to a two-week low. German 30-year securities rose for a
fourth day before the country auctions 2 billion euros of the
debt tomorrow.  “The periphery is simply benefiting from the idea that the
Fed and other central banks will be very careful,” said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank Nederland in the
Dutch city of Utrecht, referring to the euro area’s lower-rated
nations. “The scenario is where  interest rates  stabilize or
even fall a bit, and at the same time risky assets do well. As
long as the data is not too weak but not strong enough for the
Fed to start tapering, this is almost the ideal Goldilocks
scenario.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yield dropped six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 4.22 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time
after falling to 4.19 percent, the  lowest  since Oct. 7. The 4.4
percent security due in October 2023 rose 0.505, or 5.05 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.48. The nation’s two-year
note yield decreased nine basis points to 1.59 percent.  Italian Yields  Italy’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points to 4.12
percent after touching 4.10 percent, the  lowest  level since June
5. The  two-year note  yield dropped for a ninth day, declining as
much as eight basis points to 1.35 percent, also the lowest
since June 5.  The addition of 148,000 workers in the U.S. followed a
revised 193,000 increase in August that was larger than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 180,000 advance.  The U.S. unemployment  rate  fell to 7.2 percent, the lowest
level since November 2008. The report, delayed by the 16-day
partial government shutdown that ended Oct. 17, was originally
slated for Oct. 4.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell five basis points to 1.80
percent after reaching 1.79 percent, the lowest since Oct. 9.
Rates on U.S. Treasury notes with a similar maturity dropped
eight basis points today to 2.53 percent.  Germany last sold 30-year bonds on July 31 at an average
yield of 2.47 percent, compared with a rate of 2.16 percent at a
previous auction on April 24. Thirty-year bund yields fell five
basis points to 2.67 percent today.  Fed Survey  European  government securities  from Germany to  Portugal 
have been supported amid speculation the fiscal dispute that
closed down the U.S. government this month will derail the
economic recovery and delay a reduction in monthly bond
purchases by the Fed. The central bankers will pare the monthly
pace of asset buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their
March 18-19 meeting, according to the median of 40 responses in
a Bloomberg survey last week.  “The Fed is likely to sit on the sidelines in the next few
months,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at
broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “This bodes well
for risk markets and should keep Treasuries range bound.”  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of the Netherlands and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 9.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian
securities gained 6 percent, while Germany’s lost 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
