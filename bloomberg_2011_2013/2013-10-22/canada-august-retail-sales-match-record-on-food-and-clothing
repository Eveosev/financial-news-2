Canadian  retail sales  rose for a
second month in August, matching a record set three months
earlier, on gains in food and clothing.  Sales increased 0.2 percent to C$40.3 billion ($39.2
billion),  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
 surveyed  by  Bloomberg News  forecast a 0.3 percent gain, based on
the median of 20 projections.  Indebted consumers continue to lead the expansion as policy
makers say exports and business investment have disappointed.
Bank of  Canada  Governor Stephen Poloz will probably keep his key
policy  interest rate  at 1 percent tomorrow, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “ Consumer spending  we think can keep growing at a good
pace,” said Nathan Janzen, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada
in Toronto, citing industry figures showing automobile sales are
still on pace for an annual record this year.  Sales in August were 2.7 percent higher than  a year
earlier , Statistics Canada said. Consumer discretionary
companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange have generated a 34
percent  return  this year, second only to health care companies.  Food and beverage store receipts climbed 1.2 percent in
August to C$8.96 billion, while clothing and accessory sales
increased 1.9 percent to C$2.29 billion.  Canada’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to C$1.0293 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:50 a.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 97.15 U.S.
cents.  Car Sales  While  motor vehicle  and parts sales fell 0.5 percent to
C$9.37 billion, they have gained 7.2 percent over the last 12
months.  Purchases  excluding  the motor vehicle and parts category
rose 0.4 percent to C$31 billion. On that basis, economists had
forecast sales would gain 0.2 percent.  Sales advanced in six of 11 categories marking 56 percent
of total sales, Statistics Canada said.  The volume of sales rose 0.2 percent. That measure excludes
the effects of price changes and more closely reflects the
industry’s contribution to economic growth.  July’s retail sales advance was revised to 0.5 percent from
an earlier reading of 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
