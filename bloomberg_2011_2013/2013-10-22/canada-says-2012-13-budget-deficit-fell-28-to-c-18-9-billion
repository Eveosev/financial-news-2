Canada  said a final tally of last
year’s budget figures showed the deficit shrank by 28 percent
from the year earlier and was C$7.0 billion ($6.8 billion) less
than projected six months ago as the government’s operating
spending dropped.  The deficit fell to C$18.9 billion in the fiscal year that
ended March 31, down from C$26.3 billion in the previous year.
In March, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  had forecast a C$25.9
billion deficit for the year.  The smaller shortfall reflects an unexpected decline in
operating and capital spending, which represents about half of
total program spending. Flaherty has zeroed in on operating
spending in a bid to balance the budget by 2015.  “Our government’s continued efforts to ensure that every
tax dollar is spent as efficiently as possible and that wasteful
spending is eliminated are keeping Canada on track to balance
the budget in 2015,” Flaherty said in a  statement  today.  Total direct program expenses fell to C$117.7 billion in
the fiscal year that ended in March, down from C$119.1 billion a
year earlier. Flaherty had forecast an increase to C$122.1
billion.  Flaherty told reporters government spending is “under
control” and he’ll give a fall update “in a month or so.” The
minister said even though the deficit was smaller than
previously projected, he doesn’t anticipate returning to balance
by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
