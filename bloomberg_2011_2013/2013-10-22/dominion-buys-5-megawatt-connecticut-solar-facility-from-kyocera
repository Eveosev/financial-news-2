Dominion Resources (D)  Inc., the third-largest U.S. utility owner, bought a 5-megawatt solar farm in
Somers, Connecticut, from  Kyocera Corp (6971)  for an undisclosed sum.  The Somers Solar Center, which Kyocera jointly developed
with San Francisco-based CleanPath LLC, will begin producing
power in the fourth quarter, according to a statement today from
Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion.  Connecticut Light & Power Co. will buy electricity from the
solar plant under a 20-year contract.  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  and  Southern Co. (NSC)  are the largest U.S.
utility owners by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
