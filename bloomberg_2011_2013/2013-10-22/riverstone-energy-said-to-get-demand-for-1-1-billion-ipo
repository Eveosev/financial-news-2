Riverstone Holdings LLC received
demand from buyers for the minimum 670 million pounds ($1.1
billion) it seeks to raise in an initial public offering in
London of an energy-investment company, according to people
familiar with the situation.  The sale of shares in  Riverstone Energy Ltd. (0868612D)  closes for
investors tomorrow and the size of the sale could be increased,
said the people, who asked not to be named because the details
arenâ€™t public. Riverstone Energy has commitments of up to 550
million pounds from cornerstone investors, according to a
statement on Sept. 24.  Riverstone Holdings, which invests mainly in North American
energy assets, makes buyout and growth capital investments in
the exploration and production, midstream, oilfield services,
power and renewable segments of the energy industry. The funds
from the IPO will only be invested in exploration and production
and midstream, Robert Wilson, who will serve as chairman of
Riverstone Energy, said last month.  A representative for Riverstone declined to comment on the
demand for the IPO.  Five cornerstone investors who have promised to buy shares
along with the parent company Riverstone are AKRC, an affiliate
of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., KFI, a private investment
vehicle of hedge fund manager Louis Bacon, Hunt Oil Co., Casita
LP, and the McNair Group, the Sept. 24 statement said.  Banks including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Morgan Stanley are managing the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
