Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s
state-owned investment company, sold a stake in office landlord
 Keppel REIT (KREIT) , according to two people familiar with the
transaction.  Temasek sold about 103.9 million shares at an average price
of S$1.195 each, or a total of about S$124 million ($100
million), according to one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private.  Stephen Forshaw ,
a spokesman for Temasek in Singapore, didn’t immediately respond
to  Bloomberg News  queries on the sale. Keppel Corp., the parent
of the Singapore REIT, said in an e-mail it cannot immediately
comment.  Keppel Corp. in July announced an additional dividend in
the form of Keppel REIT units to its shareholders after
completing a similar distribution in May. The parent gave eight
Keppel REIT units for every 100 shares of its own stock held.
Temasek holds a 21 percent stake in Keppel Corp., while it held
3.74 percent of the REIT, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Keppel REIT shares, which have  declined  8.5 percent this
year, fell as much as 4.1 percent to S$1.18 and traded at
S$1.190 as of 12:59 p.m. in  Singapore  trading.  Temasek in July said assets rose to a record S$215 billion
in the fiscal year ended March 31 as surging stock markets drove
an almost sixfold increase in returns. Total shareholder return,
which includes dividends, widened to 8.9 percent from 1.5
percent in the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
