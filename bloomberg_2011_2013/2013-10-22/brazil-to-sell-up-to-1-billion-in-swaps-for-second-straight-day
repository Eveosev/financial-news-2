Brazil ’s central bank tomorrow will
auction as much as $1 billion in foreign exchange swaps to
extend maturities on contracts that expire next month, matching
a similar sale carried out today.  The central bank at 2:30 p.m. local time will auction as
much as 20,000 foreign exchange swaps, the central bank said in
a statement today e-mailed by its press office. The bank this
afternoon sold 20,000 swaps for $988 million in the first of
three potential auctions it can hold to roll over a total of
$8.9 billion in swaps that mature Nov. 1.  The bank said last week that it would study demand for
selling the swaps on Oct. 22, 23 and 24. The amount to be
offered tomorrow shows the central bank will probably offer the
same amount on Oct. 24 rather than auctioning all swaps that
mature, according to Pedro Tuesta, senior Latin America
economist at 4Cast Ltd.  “The market understands the central bank wants the
currency more or less where it is, going up and down between
2.15 and 2.20” per dollar, Tuesta said by phone. “It’s not
like the bank is refusing to offer any hedge, it’s just that the
bank is finding there’s not so much demand anymore.”  The real has appreciated 12 percent since Aug. 22 when the
central bank announced a separate, $60 billion program of
currency swaps and credit line auctions. The real rose 0.1
percent to 2.1723 per dollar today, after reaching 2.1523 per
dollar on Oct. 17, the highest level since June 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
