German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann, who alone among his European peers has secured
increased  government spending  on the arts in an era of
austerity, announced that he won’t serve a third term.  Neumann, who is 71, said that he informed  Chancellor Angela Merkel  immediately after Sept. 22 elections that he won’t take
part in her new government. In a  statement  sent by e-mail today,
he said that during his term culture policy “has gained much
weight and voice.”  Among Neumann’s achievements was an increase in state
spending on the arts by 240 million euros ($331 million) to 1.28
billion euros during his eight years in office. Projects his
office is contributing to include the renovation of Museum
Island, which he has termed “Berlin’s Louvre,” and the
rebuilding of Berlin’s royal palace.  He has also been a vocal advocate of the restitution of
Nazi-looted art, and  doubled  government support for provenance
research by German museums in April 2012.  Neumann’s post has only existed since 1998, and he is the
fourth person to hold it. Merkel’s party begins negotiations
tomorrow to form a coalition with the Social Democrats, the main
opposition party in the previous parliament.  To contact the reporter on the story:
