Saline Water Conversion Corp. 
increased desalinated-water output during the annual Hajj
pilgrimage,  Al-Jazirah  reported, citing Deputy Governor for
Operation and Maintenance Muhammad al-Ghamdi.  Supplies to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina and
nearby Jeddah and Taif increased 6.4 percent from a year earlier
to 66.8 million cubic meters, the newspaper said. Deliveries to
Mecca and the surrounding holy sites rose 14 percent.  More than 10 million people visit the Grand Mosque in
Mecca, western Saudi Arabia, every year and about 3 million
