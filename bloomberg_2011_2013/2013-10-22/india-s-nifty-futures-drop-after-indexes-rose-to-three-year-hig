Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped
after benchmark indexes gained to a three-year high yesterday.  SGX CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index futures for October delivery fell 0.5
percent to 6,204 at 10:07 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
Nifty Index rose 0.3 percent to 6,204.95 yesterday, its highest
level since Nov. 10, 2010. The S&P BSE Sensex added 0.1 percent.
The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded
shares climbed 0.5 percent.  Benchmark indexes increased yesterday as more companies
posted earnings that beat analysts’ forecasts. The Sensex is
 valued  at 14.1 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.8 times. The Indian gauge’s
14-day  relative strength index  climbed to 67.6 yesterday, near
the 70-level seen by some investors as a signal to sell.  “Some stocks have run up a lot in the recent rally,”
Suniil Pachisia, vice president at Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd., said
in a phone interview today. “We are advising clients to book
profits and wait for a better opportunity.”  Asian stocks fell today, with regional benchmark MSCI Asia
Pacific Index retreating from a five-month high as investors
await the release of delayed U.S. payrolls data.  Profits at all seven Sensex companies that have reported
earnings for the quarter through Sept. 30 so far have beaten or
matched estimates, compared with 47 percent that missed
forecasts in the three months ended June.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-largest software exporter, may report
today that its second-quarter profit expanded to 18.4 billion
rupees ($299 million), according the median estimate of 44
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Global investors bought a net $281 million of local stocks
on Oct. 18, the largest daily inflow in a month, data from the
regulator show. That brought this year’s purchases to $14.9
billion, the second-highest after  Japan  among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg. It’s still 17 percent less than in the
same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Sensex has risen 7.6 percent this year, compared with
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 1.6 percent loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
