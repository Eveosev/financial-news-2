The Swiss franc rose to its highest
in twenty months against the dollar after employment data in the
U.S. missed economist estimates.  The franc, which investors tend to buy at times of
heightened  risk aversion , hit its strongest since Feb. 29, 2012,
after the U.S. Labor Department said that U.S. payrolls climbed
by 148,000 in September. That missed the 180,000 median forecast
of 93 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and indicates that the
world’s biggest economy had little momentum leading up to the
shutdown of the federal government.  You-Na Park, foreign exchange analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said the big question for investors was when the U.S.
Federal Reserve would begin to reduce its bond buys.  “The weak numbers today support the view that the U.S.
central bank will push back the data when it begins the
tapering,” she said by telephone. “We’re seeing the dollar
dropping against most major currencies. It’s a risk off theme.”  The franc was up 0.3 percent against the greenback at 89.93
centimes at 3:08 p.m. in Zurich, having climbed as much 0.6
percent after the the data was published. Against the euro it
stood at 1.2347.  To lessen the impact of haven inflows, the  Swiss National
Bank (SNBN)  set a cap of 1.20 per euro on the franc in Sept. 2011. SNB
President Thomas Jordan said on Oct. 14 the franc was still
strong and that the currency ceiling remained essential to
protect the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
