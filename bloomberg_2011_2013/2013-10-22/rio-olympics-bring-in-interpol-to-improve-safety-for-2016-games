Interpol, the international police
body, will work with the organizers of the Olympics in  Brazil  to
improve safety for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janerio.  Interpol’s major events support team will be in Rio to help
local authorities police the event, the agency said today in an
e-mailed statement. Interpol will track stolen and lost travel
documents, provide DNA analysis and hunt for internationally
wanted suspects.  “The agreement establishes the support of the intelligence
service in the fight against all actions that could affect the
integrity of sports and its signing three years before the Games
allows it to start to be implemented for the test events,” Luiz
Fernando Corrêa, Rio 2016 security director, said in the
statement.  Interpol will also investigate illegal betting and match
fixing, as well as look for counterfit goods and tickets. The
agreement calls for the global security group to assist the
 International Olympic Committee  in the hunt for doping and
corruption.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
