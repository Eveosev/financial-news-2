Gold premiums in  India , the world’s
largest user, climbed to a record as jewelers rushed to secure
supplies to meet soaring demand during festivals and weddings
amid government curbs on imports.  The fees paid by jewelers to banks and other importers
climbed to as much as $120 an ounce over the London price this
week compared with a discount of $60 a month earlier, said
Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director at the All India Gems & Jewellery
Trade Federation. Premiums may surge to $150 to $200 if the
shortage persists, he said.  The raw material scarcity is worsening as imports slumped
after the government linked shipments to re-exports in July and
increased tax on overseas purchases for a third time this year
to curtail demand. Purchases of gold and silver tumbled to $800
million last month from $4.6 billion a year earlier, the
Commerce Ministry said Oct. 9.  “There is a shortage in the market and there will be panic
in the market with each passing day” if supplies don’t
increase, Bamalwa said. “The government is comfortable because
import of gold is reduced but it’s a problem for consumers. Gold
is in our culture and we can’t change that.”  The  Reserve Bank of India  on July 22 made it mandatory for
importers to set aside 20 percent for re-export as jewelry,
almost halting imports by traders and banks. Inbound shipments
may be less than 150 metric tons in the second half because of
higher tariffs and restrictions compared with 478 tons during
the same period a year earlier, Bamalwa said.  Gifting Gold  Premiums are increasing as jewelers prepare to meet
traditional household demand for ornaments during the peak
wedding season starting next month and festivals, said Vinod Hayagriv, managing director of C. Krishniah Chetty & Sons.  Buying and gifting gold in India is considered auspicious
during festivals and weddings. The festivals run from August to
November followed by the wedding season through early May.  Gold for immediate delivery in  London  fell 22 percent this
year to $1,312.88 an ounce today. Futures on the  Multi Commodity
Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)  traded at 29,692 rupees ($482) per 10
grams, 15 percent below the record 35,074 rupees on Aug. 28.  Imports probably totaled 5 tons so far this month compared
with an estimated demand of about 100 tons, Bamalwa said.
“Smuggling is rising as one kilogram of gold bar is equivalent
to the size of an i-phone and it gives a profit of 500,000
rupees,” he said.  Record Deficit  The government plans to keep imports to 800 tons in the
financial year ending March 31 from 845 tons a year earlier,
Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said on Oct. 1. Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  tightened curbs on imports after
increasing demand helped to widen the nation’s  current-account 
deficit to a record and pushed down the rupee.  The rupee tumbled to a record 68.845 against the dollar on
Aug. 28 and was at 61.6275 today. The deficit widened to $21.8
billion in April through June from $18.1 billion in the previous
quarter, the central bank said Sept. 30. The gap was a record
$87.8 billion in the year ended March 31.  Consumption in India, which ships in almost all the bullion
it uses, accounted for 20 percent of global demand in 2012,
according to the World Gold Council.  “We are very much short of authentic gold which is not
smuggled,” Hayagriv said. “You don’t know who are you going to
be forced to buy from. There is going to be a great shortage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
