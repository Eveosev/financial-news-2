Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  fell as much as
3.8 percent after the top U.S. auto regulator said the agency is
studying an Oct. 1 fire involving one of the plug-in electric
carmaker’s Model S sedans.  “We have our experts that are in contact with Tesla right
now,” National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator  David Strickland  told reporters today in Washington.  Tesla  shares  fell $1.06 to $171.54 at the close in New
York, after sinking as low as $166.11. The shares have risen
more than five-fold this year.  The agency didn’t initially investigate the fire because
most of its employees were on furlough during the partial U.S.
government shutdown. It previously investigated fires in two
other battery-powered vehicles,  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet
Volt and Fisker Automotive Inc.’s Karma.  NHTSA is “gathering data” on the Tesla accident and
hasn’t decided whether to open a formal investigation,
Strickland said.  Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean, a Tesla spokeswoman, wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  The battery in the Model S caught fire Oct. 1 after the
vehicle collided with a large metallic object on a road in Kent,
 Washington .  Regulators’ probe of a fire in a Volt, which broke out
weeks after the completion of government crash tests, led to
congressional hearings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
