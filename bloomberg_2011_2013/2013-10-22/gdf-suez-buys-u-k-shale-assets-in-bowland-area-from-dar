GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , France’s biggest
supplier of natural gas, became the second utility to buy into
U.K. shale with the purchase of assets from  Dart Energy Ltd. (DTE)   GDF will acquire a 25 percent interest in 13 licenses in
northern England’s Bowland basin, Dart said today in a
statement. GDF will hand over $12 million in cash and cover 75
percent of the Australian company’s costs up to $27 million to
fund a three-year exploration campaign, the statement shows.  The Bowland basin, potentially holding about 1,300 trillion
cubic feet of gas, has already lured U.K. utility  Centrica Plc (CNA) ,
which bought a stake in Cuadrilla Resources Ltd.’s acreage in
June. Paris-based GDF Suez faces a government ban on hydraulic
fracturing in its home country, while British Prime Minister
 David Cameron  has pledged tax breaks to shale drillers.  “We are very confident about the potential of shale gas in
the U.K. and its anticipated contributions to U.K. energy
security,” said Jean-Marie Dauger, head of GDF Suez’s gas
business. The investment “complements the large presence of the
group in the U.K.”  The deal will support the drilling of as many as 14
exploration wells -- four targeting shale gas and 10 coal-bed
methane, Dart said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
