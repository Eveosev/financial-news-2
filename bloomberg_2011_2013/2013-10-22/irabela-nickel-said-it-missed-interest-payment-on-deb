Mirabela Nickel Ltd. (MBN) , an Australian
producer, said a missed payment of interest due on its debt will
only cause a default should it continue for 30 days.  The company didn’t make a payment of interest on Oct. 15
relating to the about $395 million of 8.75 percent unsecured
notes maturing in 2018, Perth-based Mirabela Nickel said today
in a statement.  Mirabela Nickel, halted from trading in Sydney on Oct. 7,
has seen its market value plunge to A$14 million ($13.5
million), from A$421 million at the start of the year. The
company had its credit rating lowered to Caa3, from Caa1, by
Moody’s Investors Service Inc. this month, and cut to CCC+, from
B-, by Standard & Poor’s.  The nickel producer plans to give an update on the company
and operations by the end of the month, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
