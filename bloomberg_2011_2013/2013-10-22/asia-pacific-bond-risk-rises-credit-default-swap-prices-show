The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 2 basis points
to 106 basis points as of 11:01 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 96.1 to
149.5 this year, is headed for its third consecutive increase,
set to pare its decrease this month to 19.2 basis points,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index increased 1.5 basis points to
85.8 as of 9:03 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The measure, which closed at a four-week low yesterday,
is poised to drop 11.5 basis points this month, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 133.5 basis points
as of 8:50 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac prices show. The benchmark
is on track for its highest close since Oct. 16, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
