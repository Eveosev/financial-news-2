OAO Rosneft outlined a deal to
supply  China  Petrochemical Corp., or Sinopec, 100 million metric
tons of crude during 10 years as Russia’s largest oil producer
builds ties with buyers in the Asian market.  Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  valued the potential
supplies at $85 billion, speaking to reporters after a signing
ceremony today in China. The supplies may begin in 2014, with
prepayments and based on prices Rosneft receives in tenders,
according to a statement from the Moscow-based company.  Asia’s largest economy is set to become Russia’s largest
market for oil after Rosneft and China National Petroleum Corp.
signed a 25-year supply accord in June in  St. Petersburg . That
deal, for about 360 million tons of crude, has a value of $270
billion, according to the state-run Russian oil producer.  “The agreement will help Rosneft arrange additional
funding for exploration and production projects and construction
of the necessary infrastructure,” Rosneft Chief Executive
Officer  Igor Sechin  said in the statement.  Advance payments from CNPC and Sinopec will help Rosneft,
which spent $55 billion buying TNK-BP to become the world’s
largest traded oil producer by output, repay debts and fund
development. Rosneft, which estimated prepayment from CNPC at
$70 billion, didn’t disclose the expected advance payments from
Sinopec.  Under the agreement with Sinopec, Russia may partially
replace crude oil supplies with oil products, according to the
statement.  Rosneft and Sinopec are partners at the Udmurtneft crude
producer in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
