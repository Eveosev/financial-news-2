The dollar slid to its weakest level
in almost two years against the euro after lower-than-forecast
U.S. employment gains added to speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will delay reducing stimulus.  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index  fell to an eight-month low
after data showed employers added 148,000 workers in September,
fewer than forecast, indicating the  U.S. economy  had little
momentum leading up to the 16-day partial shutdown of the
federal government this month. The Swiss franc touched its
strongest level against the greenback since February 2012. The
yen lost the most against the euro in almost four years.  “The dollar is weak across the board,”  Richard Franulovich , the chief currency strategist for the northern
hemisphere at Westpac Banking Corp. in  New York , said in a phone
interview. “The jobs number was lackluster. It was just no
better or dramatically worse than recent months, which just
aren’t good enough for the Fed.”  The dollar depreciated 0.7 percent to $1.3781 per euro at 5
p.m. New York time, and touched $1.3792, the weakest level since
November 2011. The greenback was little changed at 98.14 yen,
while the Japanese currency lost 0.7 percent to 135.25 per euro
and reached 135.51, the weakest since November 2009. The Swiss
franc climbed as much as 0.9 percent to 89.40 centimes per
dollar before trading at 89.47.  Bloomberg’s dollar  gauge  fell 0.5 percent to 999.46 and
touched 998.93, the lowest intraday level since Feb. 6.  Supporting Risk  “A delay in QE tapering from the Fed and prolonging the
current pace of QE is supportive of risk and EM currencies,”
said Eric Viloria, a senior currency strategist at Gain Capital
Group LLC in New York, referring to Fed’s $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.
Emerging-market “currencies associated with improving current
account balances are more likely to benefit.”  A Bloomberg index tracking 20 emerging-market currencies
including the Brazilian real,  South Africa ’s rand, the  Thai baht 
and  Mexico ’s peso rose to 95.5, the highest since June.  Hungary’s forint and the rand were the two of the biggest
winners among the dollar’s 31 most-traded peers, rallying 1.3
percent and 1.1 percent. Poland’s zloty gained 1 percent.  A gauge of price swings among Group-of Seven nations’
currencies declined to a nine-month low. The JPMorgan G7
 Volatility Index  touched 7.6 percent, the lowest level since
January, after reaching 10.2 percent on Sept. 3. Smaller price
swings tend to boost the appeal of higher-yielding, riskier
assets such as emerging-market currencies.  Carry Trades  Deutsche Bank AG’s Group-of-10 FX Carry index was at 115.8
percent, almost the highest since Sept. 19. The measure jumped
2.9 percent last month, the biggest increase since June 2012. In
carry trades, investors sell the currency of a nation with low
borrowing costs and buy assets where returns are higher.  The U.S. jobs increase followed a revised gain of 193,000
in August that was larger than initially estimated, Labor
Department figures showed. A Bloomberg survey of economists
forecast a rise of 180,000 in September. The average monthly job
gain this year through August was 186,000. Today’s report,
originally scheduled for Oct. 4, was delayed by the government
shutdown, which began Oct. 1.  The Fed unexpectedly refrained at its September meeting
from slowing its monthly bond- buying , saying it wanted more
evidence of an economic recovery. The purchases, made to hold
borrowing costs down and support growth, tend to debase the U.S.
currency.  Until March  The central bank will maintain the level of purchases until
March, according to the median estimate of 40 economists in a
Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 17-18. A survey last month
forecast the first reduction would be in December.  The forecasters pushed out their projections following the
partial government shutdown, which they estimated reduced growth
by 0.3 percentage point this quarter.  “From the Fed’s standpoint, this morning’s report
reaffirms their position to hold monthly asset purchases
steady,”  Lindsey Piegza , chief economist at Sterne Agee & Lynch
Inc. in  Chicago , wrote in a report. Today’s employment data
“essentially takes tapering off the table for October and
likely December as well.”  The Fed’s next two policy meetings are scheduled for Oct.
29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  The government reopened on Oct. 17 after a last-minute deal
funded operations through Jan. 15 and extended the nation’s
borrowing authority to Feb. 7, from Oct. 17, averting a
potential default.  Currency Performance  The euro has risen 6.2 percent this year in a basket of 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, the best performance. The dollar has advanced
1.1 percent, while the yen has tumbled 12 percent in the biggest
loss, the indexes show.  The euro will trade at $1.33 at year-end and at $1.29 in
mid-2014, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of economists and analysts.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $57 billion, from $37 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $10.9 billion, the largest share
of trades at 19 percent. Options on the euro-dollar rate totaled
$9.9 billion, or 17 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 111 percent more than the
average for the past five Tuesdays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options trading was
209 percent above average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
