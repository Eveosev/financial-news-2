For many New Yorkers, who work long hours and then might catch up with family or friends at a restaurant or bar, cooking is a luxury. So it makes sense that New York is home to some of the most over-the-top kitchen supply stores around. With the likes of Sur la Table and Williams Sonoma proliferating, it takes dedication to find the highest-end esoteric cookware out there. Loot made a little project of it. Think your $450 steel  KitchenAid  is top of the line? Then may we introduce you to the  Hobart N50-604 , a commercial mixer that lists for $3,130 and, if that isn't obnoxious enough, will probably outlive you. It is sold at commercial kitchen supply stores;  Balter Sales  on Bowery is a registered dealer. Then there are the pots and pans. Le Creuset might be colorful and heavy and expensive, but it's also ubiquitous -- and a bargain compared to a $720 copper  pot  from MTC Kitchen, a store in midtown Manhattan specializing in high-end Japanese cookware. The literature says that copper pots are a leading choice for chefs, though the last time Loot checked, chefs didn't have that kind of money to char. But we've left out the best way to turn your kitchen into a museum of perfect objects you're not qualified to use: knives. Clearly there are people out there who can tell the difference between a run-of-the-mill Wusthof and a $7,250  sashimi slicer  from Korin in Tribeca; Loot isn't one of them, and guesses you're not either. Still, if you're going for the best and you've got the money to spend, you probably won't be disappointed. Or luxuriate in the peace and quiet of home for just $25. That's called  Mexican takeout .
