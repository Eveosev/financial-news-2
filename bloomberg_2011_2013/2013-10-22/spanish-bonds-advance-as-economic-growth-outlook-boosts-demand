Spanish bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields to a two-week low, before data that economists said will
show U.S. employers added jobs last month and euro-area
confidence improved, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  Spain ’s two-year notes advanced for a fifth day as the
country sold 3.52 billion euros ($4.81 billion) of three- and
nine-month bills. The rate on two-year Italian debt fell to a
four-month low. German  government securities , perceived to be
among the region’s safest assets, were little changed before the
nation auctions 2 billion euros of 30-year debt tomorrow.  “People don’t perceive any kind of acute, immediate risk
arising from the periphery so some investors are prepared to
move money into peripheral debt because of the yield pickup it
gives you,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank
of America Corp. in  London , referring to the euro area’s lower-rated nations. “There’s a little bit of a holding pattern into
the payrolls.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yields dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.24 percent at 12:12 p.m. London time
after reaching 4.21 percent, the  lowest  since Oct. 7. The 4.4
percent security due in October 2023 rose 0.345, or 3.45 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.32. The two-year note yield
decreased five basis points to 1.62 percent.  Italy’s 10-year yield fell two basis points to 4.18 percent
after dropping to 4.16 percent yesterday, the  lowest  level since
Aug. 13. The two-year note yield declined for a ninth-straight
day, reaching 1.40 percent, the least since June 6.  Payrolls Data  U.S. employers added 180,000 workers in September after
hiring 169,000 in August, according to the median estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The data was originally
scheduled for release on Oct. 4 and was postponed by a partial
government shutdown.  Data tomorrow will show  consumer confidence  in the euro
area improved in October, while a report on Thursday will show
manufacturing and services  expanded  for a fourth month,
according to the median estimates of economists in separate
Bloomberg surveys.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yielded 1.85 percent after the rate
dropped to 1.82 percent on Oct. 18, the lowest since Oct. 9. The
rate increased two basis points yesterday. U.S. Treasury notes
with a similar maturity yielded 2.60 percent.  Spanish Bills  Spain sold nine-month bills at an average yield of 0.68
percent, down from 0.98 percent last month, and attracting bids
equivalent to 2.11 times the amount allotted. It auctioned debt
maturing in three months at 0.29 percent.  The country has met 92.6 percent of its planned medium- and
long-term financing for 2013, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today. The average borrowing cost for debt
issued this year was at 2.58 percent on Sept. 31, compared with
3.01 percent at the end of 2012, it said.  Fixed-income assets were also supported amid speculation
that the fiscal dispute that closed down the U.S. government
this month will derail the economic recovery and prompt the
 Federal Reserve  to delay reducing its monetary stimulus.  “Risk markets are consolidating ahead of today’s key
delayed September U.S. employment report,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at broker RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The Fed is likely to sit on the
sidelines in the next few months. This bodes well for risk
markets and should keep Treasuries range bound.”  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of France and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 9.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian
securities gained 6 percent, while Germany’s lost 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
