Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) ’s profit increased
to the highest in five quarters as the operator of the nation’s
biggest oilfield on land benefitted from a drop in the rupee to
a record.  Group  net income  rose 46 percent to 33.9 billion rupees
($550 million), or 17.68 rupees a share, in the three months
ended Sept. 30 from 23.2 billion rupees, or 12.15 rupees, a year
earlier, according to a stock exchange filing today. That missed
the 34.1 billion-rupee median of 33 analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 4.7 percent to 46.5 billion rupees.  The rupee’s 5.2 percent decline during the quarter against
the dollar increased Cairn India’s earnings in the local
currency. The explorer, acquired by  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  for
$8.67 billion in 2011, plans to spend $3 billion in the next
three years to discover oil pools and boost production at its
biggest fields in Rajasthan state.  The  shares  rose 0.6 percent to 332.65 rupees in Mumbai.
They’ve increased 4.3 percent this year, compared with a 7.4
percent gain in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex. (SENSEX)  The earnings were
announced after trading closed.  Cairn India sells crude oil denominated in dollars. A drop
in the value of the rupee increases the company’s earnings when
converted to the local currency. The foreign-exchange gains in
the quarter were 4.3 billion rupees, compared with a 7.9
billion-rupee loss a year earlier, according to today’s
statement.  Rajasthan Production  Total output from Cairn  India ’s fields rose 3 percent to an
average 213,299 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to
the statement. Average production from the Rajasthan block was
175,478 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter.  The company sold oil and natural gas at an average $95.3 a
barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter, compared with $96.7 a
year earlier, according to the statement. The average price of
Brent traded in  London  was $109.65 a barrel in the quarter.  Cairn India sells crude at rates linked to Brent oil
prices, unlike state-owned  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , which is
required to bear part of the country’s fuel subsidy. It
discovered new oil in the Dharvi Dungar sands in Rajasthan’s
Barmer district and is evaluating the size of the reserves,
according to an April 9 stock exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
