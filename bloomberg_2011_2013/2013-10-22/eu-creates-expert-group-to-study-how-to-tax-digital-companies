European Union experts will study
how to tax “the digital economy” and recommend next steps for
making sure technology companies pay their fair share, the
European Commission said.  A high-level expert group will be assembled to identify
problems and recommend solutions. The Brussels-based commission
then will make proposals on how to implement the
recommendations.  “Currently corporate tax avoidance and aggressive tax
planning are particularly problematic in the digital economy,”
the commission said today. “This is due to the global and
intangible nature of these companies, and the fact that today’s
tax rules were not designed with e-commerce in mind.”  EU leaders meeting in Brussels this week will seek to
coordinate views on efforts to tackle tax avoidance and tax base
erosion. According to draft conclusions for the Oct. 24-25
summit, the EU is considering action on issues specific to the
digitial economy, like different tax rates for physical and
electronic products.  The commission said the expert panel will be comprised of
up to seven members, who will be “internationally renowned
experts” on taxes and on the technology and online sales
sectors. The group “will be chaired by a person of political
profile with relevant background,” the EU said.  “Today’s tax systems were conceived in a pre-computer
age,” EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said in a statement
today. “It is no surprise that they often clash with the
modern, digital economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
