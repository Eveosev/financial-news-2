German  government bonds  were little
changed before the delayed U.S. September labor-market report,
originally scheduled for Oct. 4, which economists said will show
employers added the most jobs since April.  The benchmark 10-year  bund  yield was about three basis
points from the lowest level in almost two weeks. U.S. employers
added 180,000 workers in September from 169,000 in August,
according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Spain  is scheduled to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros
($4.78 billion) of three and nine-month bills today.  Germany’s 10-year bund yielded 1.85 percent at 7:13 a.m.
London time after dropping to 1.82 percent on Oct. 18, the
lowest since Oct. 9. The price of the 2 percent security due in
August 2023 was 101.36. The rate on the nation’s two-year note
was 0.18 percent.  Data tomorrow will show  consumer confidence  in the euro
area improved in October, while a report on Thursday will show a
 composite  gauge of manufacturing and services expanded for a
fourth month, according to the median estimates of economists in
separate Bloomberg surveys.  German bonds lost 1.9 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish bonds
returned 9.6 percent and Italy’s gained 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
