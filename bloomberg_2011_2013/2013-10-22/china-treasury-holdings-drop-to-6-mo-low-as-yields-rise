China, the largest foreign lender to
the U.S., reduced its holdings of Treasuries as yields on the
debt rose for a fourth month amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  would reduce the pace of its bond purchases.  China’s  holdings  fell by $11.2 billion, or 0.9 percent, in
August to $1.268 trillion, the fewest since February. The
Chinese position has dropped by $29.2 billion since peaking this
year at $1.297 trillion in May. Treasury 10-year note yields
ended August at 2.78 percent, the highest monthly close since
July 2011, rising 1.11 percentage points after the end of April.
It was at 2.51 percent yesterday in New York.  Foreign holdings of Treasuries declined for a fifth month
for the first time since 2001 as the proportion of U.S.
government debt held abroad dropped to 48.2 percent from 50.4
percent at the end of last year, the smallest share since
November 2006. Overseas holdings have fallen by $133 billion
during that period.  “Central banks are like any other investor -- they’re
charged with preserving the value of the assets they hold,”
said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas in New
York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. While
 China ’s holdings have decreased “it’s not a wholesale
dumping,” Kohli said. “It’s a reduction because that asset
seems like it would underperform.”  Yearly Gain  For August,  foreign holdings  of Treasuries declined by $5.1
billion, or 0.1 percent, to $5.59 trillion, U.S. government data
show. That trimmed the increase in holdings by overseas
investors to 0.3 percent  this year , putting them on a pace for
the smallest annual gain at least since Bloomberg began
compiling full-year data in 2001.  Since May, when Fed officials began to discuss the
possibility that the central bank would cut the size of its $85
billion a month in bond purchases, U.S. borrowing costs have
climbed faster than the rest of the world.  Yields on Treasuries now average 1.40 percent, 0.16
percentage point less than non- U.S. government debt , according
to index data compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.
That compares with a 0.41 percentage point gap on May 21. During
the past five years, investors have demanded 0.36 percentage
point more to own government notes outside the U.S. instead of
Treasuries.  Japanese  holdings  of Treasuries rose $13.7 billion, or 1.2
percent, to a record $1.149 trillion. Since falling to a 15-month low in June,  Japan  has added $65.7 billion of U.S.
government securities, a 6.1 percent increase, the largest two-month jump since an $82.5 billion gain for October-November 2011
following Japanese currency interventions earlier that year.
Japan is the second largest foreign holder of Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
