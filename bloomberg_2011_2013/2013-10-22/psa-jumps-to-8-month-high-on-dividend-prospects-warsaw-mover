Telekomunikacja Polska SA surged to
an eight-month high on speculation  Poland ’s biggest phone
company may boost its dividend after reporting a profit that
beat analysts’ estimates.  TPSA, as the unit of  France ’s  Orange SA (ORA)  is known,  jumped  as
much as 5 percent and traded 3.5 percent higher at 9.11 zloty as
of 10:48 a.m. in Warsaw, climbing to the highest level since
Feb. 11. The benchmark WIG30 Index fell 0.1 percent today.  The Warsaw-based operator raised its goal for 2013 organic
 cash flow  25 percent to at least 1 billion zloty ($327 million)
after posting third-quarter net income of 239 million zloty. The
mean estimate in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts was for a
profit of  120 million zloty .  The new cash-flow target “suggests a possible upside” to
the current dividend of 0.5 zloty a share, Przemyslaw Sawala-Uryasz, an analyst at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Warsaw, said in a a note
today. The new guidance translates into a dividend of 0.76 zloty
a share providing a safety buffer of more than 50 percent safety
buffer to the current dividend, he said.  The shares have plunged 26 percent this year, making TPSA
the third-worst performing stock in Warsaw’s benchmark WIG30
Index, as falling mobile phone rates, rising competition and
economic slowdown hurt earnings and prompted management to
reduce the 2012  dividend  67 percent to 0.5 zloty a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
