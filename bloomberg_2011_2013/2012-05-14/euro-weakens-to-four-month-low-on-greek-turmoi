The euro fell to the lowest in almost
four months versus the dollar as talks to form a Greek
government failed, fueling concern the nation may leave the
shared currency and boosting investor demand for safety.  The Dollar Index rose for a 12th day in the longest winning
streak since its inception in 1973. Higher-yielding currencies,
led by Sweden’s krona, reversed earlier gains, while the dollar
advanced versus most major peers.  “The euro is coming under increased selling pressure as it
looks cemented now that we’ll see another election in  Greece ,”
said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington  at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “The
risk is the possibility of contagion to other key euro-zone
states.”  The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.2729 at 5 p.m. New York
time. It touched $1.2722, the lowest level since Jan. 17. The
shared currency slipped 0.3 percent to 102.07 yen after touching
102.05 yen, the weakest since Feb 16. The dollar appreciated 0.4
percent to 80.18 yen.  The Swedish krona slid for a 12th day against the dollar,
the longest losing streak in Bloomberg records dating to 1971.
The currency fell to 7.1855 to the greenback, the weakest since
September 2010, before trading at 7.1742, down 1.7 percent.  Strongest Since 2008  Sterling reached the strongest level against the euro since
November 2008 as investors sought an alternative to the 17-
nation currency. The pound gained 0.2 percent, erasing earlier
losses, to 79.53 pence per euro before trading at 79.59 pence.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, gained 0.8 percent to 81.251. It last declined
on April 27.  Greek President Karolos Papoulias’ meeting in  Athens  today
with political leaders failed to produce a government after an
inconclusive May 6 vote. He called for a meeting tomorrow to
form a caretaker government to lead the country until the vote.  A second election threatened to extend the country’s
political gridlock and reignited speculation Greece will renege
on its pledges to cut spending, required by the terms of its 240
billion euros ($306 billion) in bailouts. It added to bets
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen.  The Syriza party led by Alexis Tsipras, who favors
defaulting and an end to economic austerity, would be the winner
if fresh elections were held now, according to a poll sponsored
by a Greek newspaper.  ‘Nasty Outcome’  “If Tsipras wins and if he sticks to his platform, that
would mean making the bailout commitments null and void,” said
 Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in New York. “Everything’s falling into place to
make for a nasty outcome in June or July.”  The euro gained earlier after the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said gross domestic product in
the region stagnated in the first quarter compared with the
prior three months. The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for a 0.2 percent decline.  Germany ’s 0.5 percent  expansion  at five times the pace
economists had estimated helped offset weaker GDP in the euro
area’s peripheral economies.  The euro dropped 4 percent in the past six months versus
nine developed-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Sweden’s krona slid 3.6 percent.
The dollar rose 2.1 percent, and the yen lost 2.3 percent.  Canadian Dollar  Canada ’s dollar rose against most of its major peers as a
gauge of manufacturing in the  New York  region increased more
than forecast. The U.S. is the nation’s biggest trading partner.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index, known as the Empire State Index, increased to 17.1 this
month from 6.6 in April, topping a Bloomberg News survey’s
median estimate for a reading of 9. U.S. retail sales gained 0.1
percent in April, in line with economist estimates, a Commerce
Department report showed.  “We had pretty favorable data in the U.S. today,” said
 Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “Empire manufacturing was
much better than expected, so that supports the North American
currencies, the peso and the Canadian dollar.”  Canada’s currency gained as much as 0.5 percent to 99.90
cents to the dollar before trading at C$1.0072, down 0.4
percent. It rose 0.4 percent to C$1.2822 per euro. The peso
gained as much as 0.8 percent to 13.6237 per dollar before
erasing gains to trade at 13.8363.  The  Federal Reserve  will release tomorrow the minutes of
its April 25 meeting. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said after the
session he’s prepared to “do more” to boost the economic
recovery and ensure that inflation remains close to target.  Aussie Dollar  Australia ’s dollar rose from the lowest level since Dec. 20
against its U.S. counterpart, 99.22 cents. It advanced as much
as 0.6 percent to $1.0015 before erasing its gain and trading at
99.37 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent. The currency strengthened
0.2 percent to 79.67 yen.  The Aussie’s 14-day relative strength index against its
U.S. counterpart dipped to 28 yesterday, below the 30 level that
some traders see as signaling an asset may reverse direction. A
similar gauge versus the yen fell to 26 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
