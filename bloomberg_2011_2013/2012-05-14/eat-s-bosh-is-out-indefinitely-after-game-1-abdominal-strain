Miami Heat  forward  Chris Bosh  is out
indefinitely after tests found he strained an abdominal muscle
in yesterday’s 95-86 Game 1 playoff victory over the Indiana
Pacers.  The 28-year-old Bosh underwent an MRI exam and there is no
timetable for his return, the National Basketball Association
team said today on its Twitter account.  A seven-time All-Star, Bosh pulled the muscle on a dunk in
the second quarter of yesterday’s game, the first in Miami’s
best-of-seven second-round series with the Pacers. He was fouled
by Indiana center Roy Hibbert on the play and struggled to get
to his feet after landing awkwardly on his left leg.  Bosh scored 13 points with five rebounds in 16 minutes
before the injury. He was also Miami’s primary defender against
Hibbert, a 2012 All-Star selection.  The Heat were 4-5 without Bosh during the regular season.
Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is tomorrow night in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
