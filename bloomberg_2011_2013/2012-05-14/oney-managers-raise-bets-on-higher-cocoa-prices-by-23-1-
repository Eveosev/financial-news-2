Money managers increased bets on
higher London cocoa prices by 23 percent in the week ended May
8, according to NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE
Euronext.  Net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, came to
27,837 futures and options, according to the weekly commitment
of traders report published on the exchangeâ€™s website today.
That compares with 22,596 contracts a week earlier, the data
show. Cocoa climbed 0.3 percent in the period.  NYSE Liffe has recalculated data in the commitment of
traders reports after deciding some traders should be included
in the producer category, the exchange said on May 7.  In robusta coffee, money managers increased bets on higher
prices to 10,874 contracts, the data show. That compares to
8,210 futures and options a week earlier. The beans rose 3
percent in the period.  White, or refined, sugar money managers, reduced their net-
long positions by 42 percent to 2,624 futures and options,
according to the exchange. That compares with a net-long
position of 4,553 contracts a week earlier. White sugar declined
2.2 percent in the period.  Money managers held no positions in feed wheat, unchanged
from last week, according to the NYSE Liffe report. Feed wheat
fell 1.1 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
