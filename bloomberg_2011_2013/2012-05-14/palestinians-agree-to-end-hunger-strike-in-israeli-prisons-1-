Palestinian prisoners agreed to end a
hunger strike in which some inmates refused food for more than
two months after  Israel  committed to improve their conditions,
Palestinian and Israeli officials said.  The deal was worked out today through mediation by Egyptian
officials working with Israeli and Palestinian envoys in Cairo,
Issa Qaraqe, the  Palestinian Authority ’s minister of prisoner
affairs, said in a phone interview. Israel agreed to return
prisoners in solitary confinement to regular cells and allow
family visits that had been stopped, according to an e-mailed
statment from Israel’s Shin-Bet security agency.  Hanan Ashrawi , a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization’s Executive Committee, said in an e-mailed
statement from Ramallah that the hunger strikers “demonstrated
that non-violent resistance is an essential tool in our struggle
for freedom.”  The Palestinian Authority said that about 1,600 Palestinian
prisoners were refusing food in protest over conditions in
Israeli jails. The health situation of 40 of them has seriously
deteriorated, it said. Two men had gone without food since Feb.
27.  The Shin-Bet said the prisoners agreed to “stop terror
activity from inside Israeli jails.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
