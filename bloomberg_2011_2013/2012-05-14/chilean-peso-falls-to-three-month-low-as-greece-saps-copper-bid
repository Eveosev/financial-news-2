Chile’s peso traded at a three-month
low as copper, the country’s biggest export, slumped as  Greece 
moved closer to leaving the euro and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s party lost a state election.  The peso depreciated 1 percent to 491.49 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:35 a.m. in Santiago, the weakest level on a closing basis
since Jan. 31. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currencies
Index  fell  0.6 percent.  “The peso is still in the range we have held for two
months, which has an upper limit of 492 per dollar,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “Today, because of the conversations about Greece
leaving the euro, the elections in  Germany , the collapse of
Italian and Spanish bonds and falling copper and commodities,
we’re at the top of that range.”  Offshore investors in the forwards market had a net short
position of $7.9 billion on May 10, the biggest bet against the
peso since October 2009.  Copper dropped as much as 2.8 percent to a four-month low
in  New York  as European officials began to weigh the fallout of
a Greek withdrawal.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bonds rose 23 basis points, or
0.23 percentage point, to 5.71 percent, and the yield on Spain’s
10-year bonds increased 26 basis points to 6.22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
