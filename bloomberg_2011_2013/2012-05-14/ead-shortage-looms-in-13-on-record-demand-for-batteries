Lead is poised to rally after erasing
this year’s gains with the market returning to shortages
following a five-year glut as miners fail to keep pace with
record demand for batteries.  Stockpiles monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange dropped
7.6 percent from the all-time high reached in October. Demand
will exceed supply by 150,000 metric tons next year, equal to
about six months of U.S. mine production, Macquarie Group Ltd.
estimates. Prices will average $2,273 a ton in the fourth
quarter, 13 percent more than now, according to the median of 18
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumption is being driven by industrialization and new
technology, with lead usage in batteries for everything from
fork-lift trucks to mobile phone towers growing at more than
twice the speed of overall demand, BNP Paribas SA estimates.
Mine supply will expand at the slowest pace in three years in
2012 as producers fail to develop new deposits, Macquarie
predicts.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  will shut a Canadian mine next year after
a half-century of digging exhausted all profitable ores.  “If you’re adding demand you need new supply,” said
Duncan Hobbs, an analyst at Macquarie in London. “In the next
two, three years at least, on the supply side, there is no new
primary mine lead supply coming to the market anywhere in the
world outside China.”  First Quarter  Lead is down 1.3 percent this year at $2,008 a ton on
the LME, compared with a 1 percent gain in the LME Index of
six industrial metals. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities fell 1.4 percent since the start of January and
the MSCI All-Country World Index rose 3 percent. Treasuries
returned 1 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Mine output will advance 1.8 percent to 4.7 million tons
this year, compared with 9.8 percent growth in each of the
preceding two years, according to Morgan Stanley. Recycling will
add another 5.49 million tons, 2.8 percent less than in 2011,
the bank estimates. The supply glut will shrink to 13,000 tons,
from 156,000 tons in 2011, before flipping into a 154,000-ton
shortfall in 2013, Morgan Stanley predicts. Macquarie says next
year’s shortage would be the first since 2007.  Global lead consumption will reach 10.56 million tons this
year, valued at $22.2 billion based on the average price so far
this year, Morgan Stanley estimates.  Demand for lead from manufacturers of industrial batteries
will jump about 10 percent this year, compared with growth of
4.5 percent across all applications, BNP Paribas estimates. The
products now account for about 33 percent of all consumption,
twice as much value as in 2005, the Lisbon-based International
Lead and Zinc Study Group estimates.  Switching Stations  Industrial batteries contain 80 pounds (36 kilograms) to
140 pounds of lead, according to Thomas O’Neill, the treasurer
of  EnerSys (ENS) , the world’s largest manufacturer of the devices.
They are used as backup power for mobile-phone towers, at
switching stations for land-line phones and in data centers. The
Reading, Pennsylvania-based company buys 500 million pounds of
lead a year, O’Neill said.  Any gain in lead prices may be curbed by mounting investor
concern about the pace of economic recovery, with recessions re-
emerging across  Europe  and China expanding at the slowest pace
in almost three years. The metal advanced as much as 14 percent
through the end of January before reversing as a 12 percent jump
in LME stockpiles in two weeks suggested weakening demand. World
growth will slow to 3.5 percent this year, from 3.9 percent in
2011, the  International Monetary Fund  predicts.  United Nations  Batteries account for 85 percent of lead demand, compared
with 27 percent in 1960, according to the International Lead
Association in London, whose members include Xstrata and BHP
Billiton Ltd. Vehicles make up 60 percent of battery
consumption, according to the ILZSG, created by the  United
Nations  in 1959. Demand is also coming from sales of electric
bicycles, each of which requires 12 to 55 kilograms of lead, and
there are about 157 million of them on  China ’s roads.  China’s passenger-vehicle sales had their worst two-month
start to a year since 2005, according to the China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers. Growth may not even reach 5 percent
in 2012, compared with 33 percent in 2010, Gu Xianghua, a deputy
to the secretary general of the association, told a conference
in Qingdao on March 20. China will account for 45 percent of
lead demand this year, Barclays Plc estimates.  Demand for replacement batteries slowed over the northern
hemisphere’s winter because of milder temperatures, according to
Brook Hunt, a research unit of Wood Mackenzie Ltd. The average
temperature in Beijing in December through February was minus
1.9 degrees Celsius (28.6 degrees Fahrenheit), or 0.6 degrees
Celsius above normal, AccuWeather.com estimates. Temperatures
were also above normal in  New York City  and London.  Battery Scrap  That may boost prices later in the year as the availability
of used batteries for recycling slows, Morgan Stanley estimates.
Scrapped batteries are trading at more than 40 cents a pound,
compared with as little as 35 cents several months ago, Jose
Hansen, the vice president of sales and marketing at the Doe Run
Co. in  St. Louis , wrote in an e-mail. Doe Run is the world’s
third-largest lead-mine producer. Shortages of refined lead will
emerge as soon as the fourth quarter, Barclays says.  Xstrata, the second-biggest lead miner, will report net
income of $5.53 billion in 2012, its third-highest profit ever,
according to the mean of 11 analyst estimates. Zinc and lead
accounted for 11 percent of the Zug, Switzerland-based company’s
sales in 2011. Shares of Xstrata rose 3.6 percent to 1,013 pence
in London this year and will reach 1,358 pence in 12 months, the
average of 11 estimates shows.  Metal Content  Shares of Melbourne-based  BHP (BHP) , the biggest mine producer,
have dropped 2.2 percent to A$33.67 in Sydney trading this year
and will reach A$45.19 in 12 months, the average of 12 forecasts
shows. The company will report an 11 percent gain in profit to
$20.71 billion in its fiscal year beginning July 1, according to
the mean of 20 estimates.  An average ton of ore now contains about 2 percent lead,
compared with almost 3 percent in 2000, Macquarie data show.
Xstrata has said its Brunswick mine, which accounted for 1.3
percent of global supply last year, will close in March. Ivernia
Inc.’s Magellan mine in  Western Australia  was mothballed in
April last year after the Western Australian state government
ordered it to halt shipments in January 2011 because of health
concerns. Ivernia doesn’t have a schedule to restart Magellan,
Rob Scargill, vice president of operations, said last month.  New technology is accelerating demand, including the
introduction of a fourth-generation wireless standard. Its roll
out across the Europe,  Middle East  and Africa region will
require 8.5 million new batteries containing about 700 million
pounds of lead, according to EnerSys’s O’Neill. Another 2
million batteries will be needed in the U.S., he said.  Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the LME dropped 6.4
percent in the past six weeks to the lowest level since Jan. 30,
bourse data show. Orders to withdraw metal, or canceled
warrants, climbed to the highest level in at least 15 years.  “There has been genuine fundamental tightness in the lead
market,’ said Nicholas Snowdon, an analyst at Barclays in  New
York . “With a relatively tight market balance already in place
and solid improvements in the macro picture envisaged during the
second half of 2012, that should be supportive for prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
