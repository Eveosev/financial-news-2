Tam SA (TAMM4) ,  Brazil ’s biggest airline by
market share, posted a 22 percent drop in first-quarter net
income amid higher fuel costs and weak domestic demand.  Tam’s profit fell to 100.9 million reais ($51.3 million)
from 128.8 million reais a year earlier, according to a filing
sent to the website of Brazil’s securities regulator CVM on May
11. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and rent costs, or Ebitdar, fell 22 percent to 298.2 million
reais from a year earlier. The Ebitdar margin fell 3.3
percentage points to 9.2 percent.  “We anticipate weak results,” Banco Santander Brasil SA
analysts Alexandre Amson and Bruno Amorim wrote in an April 27
note to clients. “Weak domestic demand and an unfavorable macro
scenario drove this poor performance,” wrote the analysts, who
have a “buy” recommendation on Tam.  Demand measured by revenue per passenger per kilometer rose
1.7 percent in the quarter, while yield, or the profitability
per passenger per kilometer, fell 0.8 percent and occupancy
declined 2.3 percentage points to 68.1 percent, according to the
statement. Fuel costs rose 19.8 percent, to 1.27 billion reais.  Tam cut its 2012 guidance for demand increase to “ensure
profitability,” according to the statement. The airline now
expects seat availability to remain stable or fall as much as 2
percent this year and domestic demand to grow between 7 percent
and 9 percent.  Share Swap  Tam’s first-quarter report comes a day after  Lan Airlines
SA (LAN)  began a share-swap offer that will run through June 11 in
Brazil and the U.S. The transaction will result in a combined
company with market value of about $13 billion, making it the
world’s biggest airline by market value, overtaking Air China
Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. After completion of the share
swap, if the agreement requirements are met, Tam will be
delisted.  Tam shares  rose  29 percent to 46.05 reais this year.
Competitor  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  fell 17 percent in
the same period, while Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index rose 4.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
