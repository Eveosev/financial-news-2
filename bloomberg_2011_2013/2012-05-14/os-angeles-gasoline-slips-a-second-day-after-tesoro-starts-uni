California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  weakened for a second day against futures after  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO)  was said to start a hydrotreater at the Los Angeles
refinery that was shut for maintenance.  Tesoro’s 97,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery started
the hydrotreater, which removes sulfur and other impurities from
refined oil products, over the weekend after a week of planned
work, a person familiar with the plant’s operations said today.
Tina Barbee, a Tesoro spokeswoman at the company’s headquarters,
didn’t immediately return an e-mailed request for comment.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
dropped 1.5 cents to a premium of 53.5 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 5.68 cents to
$3.494 a gallon.  San Francisco  Carbob declined 2 cents against gasoline
futures to a premium of 56.5 cents a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , a
benchmark for the U.S. Northwest, fell 1.5 cents to a premium of
69.5 cents a gallon.  BP Plc (BP/)  plans to restore service to a crude unit at the
234,000-barrel-a-day Cherry Point refinery in Washington state
by early this week, two people familiar with the schedule said
May 10. Initial efforts to start the unit May 8 failed when an
upset forced the refinery to shut it again, the two people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
