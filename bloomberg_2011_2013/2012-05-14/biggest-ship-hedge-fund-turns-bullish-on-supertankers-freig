The biggest hedge fund in shipping is
turning bullish on the largest  oil tankers  for the first time in
four years as the U.S. push toward energy independence provides
China with a greater share of global crude supply.  The U.S. is importing the least in 13 years as China buys
more than ever, lengthening voyages for tankers and effectively
reducing the fleet’s capacity, government data show. Very large
crude carriers, each hauling 2 million barrels, will earn
$40,000 a day this year, 81 percent more than in 2011, said
Andreas Vergottis, the Hong Kong-based research director of
Tufton Oceanic Ltd., which manages about $1.3 billion of assets.  Chinese demand for tankers jumped 39 percent in the past
three years to fuel an economy expanding at more than three
times the pace of the U.S. The buying extends from Angola to
 Venezuela , changing trade patterns and boosting demand for the
largest vessels. The rate projected by Vergottis is almost twice
the $20,946 anticipated by forward freight agreements, traded by
brokers and used to bet on future costs.  “No one has yet woken up to this new regime,” he said.
“The reduction in U.S. oil imports is actually good, because
VLCCs will take that oil to Asia long-haul from the Atlantic.”  VLCC earnings climbed 31 percent to $41,295 this year,
according to data from London-based Clarkson Plc, the world’s
largest shipbroker. Rates are volatile, swinging from $49,104 to
$7,254 last year and averaging $22,137.  Frontline Ltd. (FRO) , the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based operator of 42 VLCCs, will narrow its
loss to $54.1 million this year from $529.6 million in 2011, the
mean of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Domestic Output  Investors may profit from the switch in trade by buying
stock in  operators  of VLCCs and selling shares of companies
owning smaller Suezmax and Aframax tankers, Vergottis said. He
declined to name specific companies.  The U.S. will import a net 1.4 million barrels a day of
crude and other fuels by 2020, Citigroup Inc. estimates. Daily
purchases averaged 8.9 million barrels in 2011, the least since
1999, Energy Department data show. Domestic output rose 2.7
percent to the highest since 2003. The last time the U.S.
achieved energy independence was in 1952, when exports of coal,
oil and gas exceeded its imports, according to Energy Department
data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. oil consumption is also being constrained by a surge
in domestic natural-gas supply to the most since at least 1936,
driving futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange down
82 percent in less than four years.  Chemical makers  are favoring
feedstocks from the fuel over oil after crude prices more than
doubled since the end of 2008. U.S. oil demand is contracting
for a second year, the International Energy Agency estimates.  Wen Jiabao  That contrasts with a predicted 4.1 percent advance in
Chinese consumption, taking the gain since 2009 to 23 percent,
according to the Paris-based IEA. The additional 1.8 million
barrels a day is equal to an extra 330 VLCC cargoes a year, or
59 percent of the existing global fleet of 558 vessels.  The rate of growth may slow in line with  China ’s gross
domestic product, which expanded 8.1 percent in the first
quarter, the slowest pace in almost three years. Premier  Wen
Jiabao  set an annual target of 7.5 percent in March, the lowest
since 2004. The nation’s crude demand advanced 1.5 percent in
2008 amid the global recession, the least in almost two decades,
data from London-based BP Plc show.  While VLCC rates are rising, they would still be below the
10-year average of $56,666, according to Clarkson. Rates
averaged $97,154 in 2008, spurring owners to order new ships
that created a glut just as the global economy contracted. The
fleet expanded 15 percent since the end of 2008, and outstanding
orders at ship yards are equal to 11 percent of existing
capacity, according to data from IHS Inc., a provider of
shipping research.  Commodity Carriers  Other types of commodity carriers are also mired in gluts.
The Baltic Dry Index, a reflection of the cost of hauling coal
and iron ore, declined 35 percent this year, data from the
London-based Baltic Exchange show. The Lloyd’s List-Bloomberg
Top 50 Shipping Index Value of the 50 largest companies
operating everything from oil tankers to  container ships 
declined 25 percent in the past year.  Shares of Frontline will reverse this year’s 21 percent
advance and  drop  19 percent in the next 12 months, according to
the average of 18 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. They
exceeded the analysts’ average price forecast in December.
Vergottis’s prediction of $40,000 a day is almost double the
$21,000 median of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Rates have yet to signal any slowdown in demand, averaging
$37,933 so far this year, according to Clarkson. That’s a
function of China going further to meet its demand. Shipments
from  Angola  and  Nigeria  are about 26 percent higher than a year
ago, compared with a 48 percent decline in cargoes to the U.S.
The journey from Nigeria’s Bonny terminal to Galveston in  Texas 
takes about 20 days, compared with 34 days to the port of
Qingdao in northeast China.  Ship Tracking  China will overtake the U.S. as the biggest customer for
all sizes of tankers in 2013, according to Arctic Securities
ASA, an Oslo-based investment bank. While China will account for
11 percent of global demand this year, it is using about 14
percent of the world’s VLCCs, ship-tracking data show. That’s
because it can only meet 43 percent of consumption from domestic
supply, IEA data show.  The change in VLCC trading patterns is hurting the smaller
tankers that traditionally hauled oil from West Africa,
Venezuela or the  North Sea  to the U.S., Vergottis said. More of
those cargoes are now going to  Asia  and buyers favor larger
vessels for such journeys because they are more economical.  The shift is drawing about 700,000 barrels a day of intra-
Atlantic trade onto the Asia-Atlantic route, Vergottis
estimated. Rates for Suezmaxes, carrying about 1 million
barrels, dropped 17 percent this year, Clarkson data show.  “Increasing self-sufficiency in U.S. energy diverts more
crude to China from the Atlantic just as long as China’s own use
keeps growing,” said Simon Newman, the head of tanker research
at ICAP Shipping International Ltd. in  London . “More Atlantic-
to-Asia business is definitely one of our factors in the market
recovery going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
