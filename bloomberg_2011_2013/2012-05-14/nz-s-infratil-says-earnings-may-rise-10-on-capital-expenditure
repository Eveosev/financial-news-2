Infratil Ltd. (IFT) , a New Zealand investor
in transport and energy utilities, said full-year earnings may
rise almost 10 percent, led by returns on  capital investment .  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization
and changes in the value of financial instruments will be NZ$530
million ($412 million) to NZ$560 million next year, compared
with NZ$510 million in the year through March, the Wellington-
based company said in a statement today. It rose 12 percent in
the reported period, the company said.  Infratil forecasts “consistent gains across all businesses
reflecting expected returns on recent capex investment and
ongoing improvement in operating margins,” the company said in
a separate presentation.  The result and forecast exclude losses at the company’s
European airports, which are being sold and were treated as
discontinued operations. Their value fell to NZ$70 million as of
March 31 from NZ$100.8 million a year earlier.  Infratil has been adding customers at its Lumo and Perth
Energy units in  Australia , which will underpin revenue and
profit growth, it said. The forecasts include Perth even as the
division’s ownership is under review.  Infratil shares were unchanged at NZ$2.03 as at the 5 p.m.
market close in Wellington. The NZX50 index fell 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
