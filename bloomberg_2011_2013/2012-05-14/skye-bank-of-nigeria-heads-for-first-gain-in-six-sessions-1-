Skye Bank Plc, (SKYEBANK)  a Nigerian lender,
rose for the time in six days after signing a loan agreement
with three foreign banks.  The stock rose 4.5 percent to 3.50 naira by the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, its first advance since May 4.  Skye Nigeria signed a $150 million five-year term-loan
facility with African Export-Import Bank, Citigroup Inc. and
Standard Bank Plc, who are the mandated lead arrangers and
bookrunners, according to a statement from Standard Bank, a unit
of Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group Ltd.  The loan is repaid and secured by “remittance flows”
generated by Skye Bank through  Western Union Co. (WU)  and is the
first such transaction on a public basis in  Nigeria , Standard
said.  Officials of Skye Bank weren’t immediately available for
comments when Bloomberg called their office in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
