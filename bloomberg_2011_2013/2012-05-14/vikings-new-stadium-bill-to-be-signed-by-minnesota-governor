The Minnesota Vikings’ $975 million
stadium bill will be signed into law by Governor  Mark Dayton 
during a ceremony today.  The plan passed the state House 71-60 and cleared the state
Senate 38-28 before going to Dayton, who said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement that he’d sign the bill.  “The bill will put thousands of Minnesotans back to work
building a multi-use facility that will benefit our state for
generations to come,” the governor’s office said.  The new stadium plan was driven by the threat that the
 National Football League ’s Vikings would leave Minnesota without
a new taxpayer-supported stadium to replace the Metrodome, where
the team is committed to play one more season.  The team will pay $477 million, $50 million more than it
had earlier agreed to -- and less than the $532 million the
House previously voted for. Under a prior Senate vote, the team
would have paid $452 million plus user fees.  The  team , which plans to move into the new fixed-roof
stadium in  Minneapolis  for the 2016 season, will borrow money
from the NFL, sell naming rights and possibly issue seat
licenses to cover its share of the costs.  The Vikings and the  University of Minnesota  last week
reached an agreement for the NFL team to use the school’s TCF
Bank Stadium during construction of the new facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
