A tropical depression in the eastern
 Pacific Ocean  off the coast of  Mexico  is gaining strength and
organization and may become the season’s first named storm by
tomorrow, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  The system had top winds of 35 miles (56 kilometers) per
hour and was about 655 miles south-southwest of Manzanillo,
Mexico, as of 5 p.m. East Coast time, according to the center in
Miami. It was moving west at about 8 mph, no threat to land.  “The depression is expected to become a tropical storm
tonight or on Tuesday,” the center said.  If it becomes a tropical storm, the system will be named
Aletta, according to the  hurricane center .  The eastern Pacific hurricane season officially starts
tomorrow, while the Atlantic storm period begins June 1. Both
seasons end on Nov. 30.  Earlier, the hurricane center was also tracking a system
near the Azores in the Atlantic. Forecasters now give that
weather front no chance of becoming a subtropical storm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
