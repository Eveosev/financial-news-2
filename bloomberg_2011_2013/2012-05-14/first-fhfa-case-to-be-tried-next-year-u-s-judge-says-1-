The first of 16 suits by the Federal
Housing Finance Agency against banks over mortgage-backed
securities will be tried in New York next year, with the rest to
follow in 2014, a federal judge said.  U.S. District Judge Denise Cote set out a proposed schedule
for the trials in a court conference with more than two dozen
lawyers in  Manhattan  today. Under Cote’s plan,  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest bank, would be first to defend claims it
misled  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  about the quality of  mortgage
loans  underlying securities bought by the two agencies.  The FHFA sued 17 banks including  Bank of America Corp. ,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
and  Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)  Most of the suits were filed in Manhattan
federal court in September or moved to the court later. The UBS
suit was filed in July. Sixteen cases have been assigned to
Judge Cote.  The judge proposed trying the UBS case first, as early as
September 2013, with the other 15 cases scheduled for 2014. Cote
set a court conference next month to finalize scheduling matters
in the cases.  The UBS case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. UBS
Americas Inc., 11-cv-5201, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
