Berlin’s new airport will not start
operations until the end of October at the earliest,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The supervisory board will meet on Wednesday to decide on a
new date for the opening, according to the newspaper. The
airport faces damages payments to carriers including  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and  Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  in the “high double-digit
millions” of euros, FTD said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
