Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) , the operator
of the Polish bourse, fell to a three-week low after proposing a
lower-than-predicted dividend.  The shares slumped 2.7 percent to 36.01 zloty, the weakest
level since April 25, at 12:41 p.m. in Warsaw trading.  “Investors expected the company to pay out about 75
percent of the last year’s net as a dividend,‘‘ Kamil Stolarski,
an analyst at Espirito Santo Investment SA, said by phone from
Warsaw today.  The operator will recommend paying 36.5 million zloty
($10.9 million), or 30.1 percent of its 2011 profit, as a
dividend, the company said in a regulatory statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
