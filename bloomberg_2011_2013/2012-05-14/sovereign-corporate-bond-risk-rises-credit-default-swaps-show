The cost of insuring against a
sovereign default in  Europe  surged as  Greece ’s political
deadlock and  Spain ’s bank capital crisis heightened speculation
the euro region may start to crumble.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments jumped 7.5 basis points to 293.5
at 3:15 p.m. in London, signaling deterioration in perceptions
of  credit quality . Contracts on Spain soared as much as 26 basis
points to a record 543, according to Bloomberg data.  European officials are starting to consider a Greek
abandonment of the euro as authorities in Athens struggle to
form a government that agrees to the austerity terms of the
nation’s bailout. Spain’s plan to force banks to increase
provisions by 30 billion euros ($39 billion) and inject less
than 15 billion euros of cash will worsen its debt burden and
may not be enough, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “The risk eventually is some kind of euro exit,” said
Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in London.
“There’s the rise of austerity rebels in other countries as
well, and Spain’s bank recapitalization plan isn’t going to be
sufficient to convince people.”  Swaps on Spain were trading at 539, while Italian debt
jumped 29 basis points to a four-month high of 487 and Ireland
climbed 28 to 621, Bloomberg data show.  The cost of insuring against default on European corporate
and financial debt rose to the highest levels since January,
according to BNP Paribas SA.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings soared 43 basis
points to 728. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings rose 13 to 171.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers jumped 21 basis points to 286.5 and the
subordinated index was up 32 at 467.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
