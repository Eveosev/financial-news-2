Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL) , a Turkish
gold miner, climbed after saying first-quarter profit was 216.7
million liras ($120 million) in a filing for tax purposes only
to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  Koza Altin rose 1.8 percent to 33.90 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the highest level since May 3.  Profit statements for tax purposes in Turkey are not
necessarily indicative of a companyâ€™s full earnings, which
comply with international accounting rules and are due to be
reported later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
