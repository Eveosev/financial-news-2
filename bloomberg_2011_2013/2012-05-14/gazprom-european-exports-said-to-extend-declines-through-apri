OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, reduced exports to  Europe  by more than 12
percent in January through April, extending its first-quarter
decline, according to two people with knowledge of the data.  Export volumes to Europe, not including former Soviet
republics, fell to more than 51 billion cubic meters from 58.4
billion cubic meters a year earlier, the people said, asking not
to be identified because the information is preliminary and
isn’t public yet.  Europe, which relies on  Russia  for about 25 percent of its
gas, bought less fuel because of warmer-than-usual weather at
the start of the year and as customers accelerated purchases in
2011 in anticipation of rising prices. Gazprom ties prices in
its long-term supply contracts to oil and refined products with
a time lag of as long as nine months.  A cold snap across Europe in February failed to boost
first-quarter sales from a year earlier. Customers in  Italy ,
 Germany ,  France  and other European markets complained they
weren’t receiving as much gas as requested during the freeze as
Russia prepared for March 4 presidential elections.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, reduced exports
to Europe 12 percent in the first quarter, two people with
knowledge of data said last month. Prices for European customers
jumped 19 percent to about $415 per 1,000 cubic meters in the
first quarter, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
