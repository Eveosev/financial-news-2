Exchange-traded funds and high-
frequency trading may pose systemic threats to markets and
warrant bans, said Consob Chairman  Giuseppe Vegas .  “Legislators and authorities need to ask themselves if
certain types of innovation are good or bad for savers,” Vegas
said in a speech at the Italian securities market regulator’s
annual meeting in Milan today. Legislators shouldn’t hold back
from “simply banning the spreading of dangerous practices and
products,” he said.  Vegas, who took over as Consob chairman last year, said
high-frequency trades need more rules to prevent market
distortions and to control volatility. ETFs, which banks have
used to raise funds as an alternative to deposits, should become
more transparent, he said.  Consob has been a proponent of banning so-called naked
credit-default swaps and backed the European Union’s move to
halt the contracts on sovereign debt.  “Financial innovation can be positive but legislators and
authorities must avoid that it becomes a mechanism that wipes
out families’ savings,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
