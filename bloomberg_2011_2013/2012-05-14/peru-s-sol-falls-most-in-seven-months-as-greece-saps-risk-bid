Peru’s sol dropped the most since
September as Greece’s political crisis fueled concern Europe’s
debt turmoil will intensify, curbing demand for higher-yielding
assets in emerging markets.  “When you start talking about a  credit event  like a Greek
default, foreigners sell everything, including the Peruvian
sol,” said  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP
Paribas Brasil in Sao Paulo.  The sol depreciated 0.6 percent to 2.6690 per U.S. dollar
today, the currency’s steepest decline since Sept. 21.  The currency also weakened as investors let forward
contracts expire and after the central bank’s May 1 increase in
reserve requirements reduced dollar sales, according to Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at Banco Santander in Lima.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 increased five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.18 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.39 centimo to 117.57
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
