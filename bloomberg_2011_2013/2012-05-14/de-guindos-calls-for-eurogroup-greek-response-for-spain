Spanish Economy MinisterLuis de Guindos said euro-area finance ministers meeting in Brussels
must deliver a  united response  on  Greece  to prevent the region’s
debt crisis from engulfing  Spain .  “ Europe  is going through a complicated moment, especially
in relation to Greece,” de Guindos told reporters in Brussels
before the finance ministers met today. “What we need is the
cooperation of the whole of the  euro zone ” and “we hope that
will be the case at the Eurogroup summit tonight.”  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  jumped 22 basis
points to 6.23 percent today amid concern over the nation’s
banks and as Greece moved closer to an exit from the euro area
following inconclusive elections on May 6.  De Guindos said Spain is being punished as markets react to
political instability that may prevent Greece from complying
with its bailout commitments. “This is the fundamental decision
we have to take in the coming hours in the Eurogroup and I hope
the Eurogroup will give a significant response,” he said.  The Spanish Treasury today offered the most since December
to sell investors 2.9 billion euros ($3.7 billion) of bills as
demand eased after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government
last week said it may inject public funds into struggling banks.  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo said
the increase in Spain’s borrowing costs was due to the situation
in Greece, not its banking sector.  “The problem with being so integrated in an economic and
monetary union is that you make absolutely all the efforts asked
of you, including efforts as painful as those made by this
government since its first day in power, and any outside event
can sterilize those efforts,” Margallo told reporters in
Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
