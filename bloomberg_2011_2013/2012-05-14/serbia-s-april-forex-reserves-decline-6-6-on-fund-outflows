Serbia’s foreign-currency reserves
contracted by 6.6 percent in April, dropping for the fourth
consecutive month, amid capital outflows and a decline in the
central bank’s euro-selling activity to curb the dinar.  Foreign-exchange reserves fell to 10.387 billion euros
($13.365 billion), the lowest since August 2011, from 11.07
billion euros in March, the central bank, Narodna Banka Srbije,
said in an e-mail today.  The decline mainly resulted from banks pulling out 469.8
million euros after changes in mandatory reserve rules, the
central bank said. The government repaid 66.6 million euros to
foreign creditors.  The central bank’s net reserves, excluding deposits by
commercial lenders and money from the  International Monetary
Fund , fell to 5.9 billion euros in April from 6.14 billion euros
in March. They equaled 421 percent of M1 money supply, down from
461 percent in the previous month, sufficient for “more than
seven months of imports,” the bank said.  The central bank spent 210 million euros in the foreign-
exchange market in April to slow the decline in the dinar, which
depreciated 6.5 percent against the euro in nominal terms
between January and April.  Interbank trading volumes of 816.6 million euros compared
with 1.01 billion euros in March, with four-month trading
volumes at 5.34 billion euros, the central said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
