Pendrell Corp. (PCO)  said the California
appeals court that reversed a $604 million jury award the
company’s ICO Global Communications Ltd. won against  Boeing Co. (BA) 
has denied its request for a new hearing.  “Given the significant due process issues resulting from
the late recusal of two appellate court justices from the case,
and other errors contained in the Court’s decision, ICO intends
to file a petition for review with the California Supreme Court
no later than May 23,” Kirkland, Washington-based Pendrell said
today in a statement.  A Los Angeles jury in 2008 found Chicago-based Boeing and
its Boeing Satellite Systems International unit liable for
breaking an agreement to build and launch 12 satellites for ICO.
The appeals court last month said the trial judge should have
granted Boeing’s request to set aside the jury’s verdict.  The case is Boeing Satellite Systems International v. ICO
Global Communications, B214649, California Court of Appeals,
Second Appellate District ( Los Angeles .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
