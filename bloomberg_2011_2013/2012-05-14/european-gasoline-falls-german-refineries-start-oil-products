Gasoline for immediate loading in
northwest  Europe  declined to the lowest in more than three
months as refineries in  Germany  resumed operations following
unplanned and scheduled halts.  Gasoil fell on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London as
 Brent crude  declined. The strong backwardation in the gasoil
market in Europe and the U.S. is “unsustainable” as increased
supplies from refineries cause inventories to grow, according to
Bank of America Corp.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded at $1,010 and $1,012 a metric ton, according to a survey
of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board.
That’s the lowest since Feb. 3 and compares with May 11 deals at
$1,013 to $1,022.  Litasco, OAO Lukoil’s trading arm, was the biggest buyer of
the Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added to make finished
fuel. Trafigura Beheer BV was the main seller. The trades are
typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to Brent, gained to $8.12 a
barrel as of 10:56 a.m. local time from $7.78 on May 11,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a refined-
products broker in  London .  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent narrowed to $9.44 a barrel from
$9.78 in the previous session, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for delivery in June dropped 1.9 percent to $933 a
ton as of 12:36 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The July
contract was at $931.25. That narrows the discount to front-
month futures, or backwardation, to $1.75 from $3.50 on May 10.  The August contract was at $929.75 a ton, according to ICE
data, making it attractive to buy, according to Bank of America.  “Selling gasoil in July and buying the August contract
looks like an appealing trade to us, as we believe the current
strong backwardation in the gasoil market will become
unsustainable once inventories start to build,” Sabine Schels,
a Bank of America analyst in London, said in a May 11 report.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, fell
to $14.63 a barrel from $14.94 on May 11, according to ICE data.
Brent decreased 1.3 percent to $110.79 a barrel.  Money managers cut net-long bets on ICE gasoil futures and
options to 59,457 in the week ended May 8 from 79,873 in the
previous week, ICE data show.  Refineries  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  completed maintenance at its Godorf
oil refinery in Germany yesterday, the company said today in an
e-mailed statement. The planned works began on May 5. The
refinery can process 186,000 barrels of crude a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  OMV AG (OMV)  expects processing rates to return to normal today
at its Burghausen refinery in Germany after an external  power
failure  on May 10 caused an “unscheduled disruption of
operations of major parts” of the facility, the company said in
an e-mail. The plant can process 72,000 barrels of crude daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
