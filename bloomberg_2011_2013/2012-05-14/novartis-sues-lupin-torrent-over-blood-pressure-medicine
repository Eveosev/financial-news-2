Novartis AG (NOVN)  sued  Lupin Ltd. (LPC)  and
 Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (TRP)  for infringing patents on its
Exforge HCT blood-pressure medicine.  Lupin, based in Mumbai, and Torrent, based in Ahmedabad,
India, are seeking to make generic versions of the drug before
the expiration of two patents. Novartis requested a court order
barring the companies from making, using or offering for sale
copies of the drugs until the patents have expired, according to
complaints filed today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, is counting on new
products, including Exforge, to help replace revenue lost when
the company’s best sellers, Diovan for hypertension and Gleevac
for leukemia, start to lose U.S. patent protection later this
year and in 2015, respectively. The two Exforge patents in
dispute expire in 2017 and 2023, according to U.S. Food and Drug
Administration records.  Dawn Chitty, vice president of regulatory affairs at
Torrent’s U.S. offices in Kalamazoo,  Michigan , said the company
doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Edith St-Hilaire, a
spokeswoman for Lupin, didn’t immediately return phone and e-
mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The cases are Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. v. Lupin Ltd,
12-00595; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. v. Torrent
Pharmaceuticals, 12-00596, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
