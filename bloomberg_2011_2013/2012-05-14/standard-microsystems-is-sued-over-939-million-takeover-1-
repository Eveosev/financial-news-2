Standard Microsystems Corp. (SMSC) , a maker
of semiconductors, was sued by an investor contending a $939
million buyout offer from memory product maker  Microchip
Technology Inc. (MCHP)  undervalues the shares.  Directors of Hauppauge, New York-based Standard
Microsystems are duty-bound to maximize the value of the shares,
common stockholder Vladimir Gusinsky Living Trust contends in a
complaint made public today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  “The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process” and deprives investors “of the ability to participate
in the company’s long-term prospects,” trust lawyers said in
the complaint.  Microchip Technology, based in Chandler,  Arizona , said May
2 it agreed to pay $37 a share for Standard Microsystems, a 41
percent premium at the time, to add chips used in computers,
consumer electronics and cars.  Standard Microsystems spokeswoman Carolynne Borders didn’t
immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the lawsuit.  Standard Microsystems fell 7 cents to $36.46 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 12:44 p.m. in  New York .  The case is Gusinsky Living Trust v. Standard Microsystems,
CA7522, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
