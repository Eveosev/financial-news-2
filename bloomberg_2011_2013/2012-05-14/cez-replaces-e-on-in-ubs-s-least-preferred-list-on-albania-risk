CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech electricity
producer, fell after two days of gains as  UBS AG (UBSN)  added the stock
to its list of least-preferred utilities, citing losses from the
company’s investments in Albania.  CEZ slid 0.4 percent to 714.9 koruna, taking its losses
this year to 9.1 percent. Power for next-year delivery in
Germany, where the company exports part of its output, dropped
0.7 percent to 49.40 euros per megawatt-hour.  First-quarter profit fell 16 percent from a year earlier,
more than analysts expected, after the Albanian regulator forced
CEZ’s local distribution unit to pay the state-owned electricity
producer higher tariffs without allowing it to pass on the extra
costs to customers, the company said last week.  “We added CEZ to least preferred as we see uncertainties
in Albanian business impacting financial targets,” UBS analysts
Per Lekander in Paris and Alberto Gandolfi in London wrote in a
report to clients today.  The Swiss bank removed  E.ON AG (EOAN)  from the list, citing the
German utility’s “good” first-quarter earnings and an expected
drop in the  tax rate  the company will have to pay this year,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
