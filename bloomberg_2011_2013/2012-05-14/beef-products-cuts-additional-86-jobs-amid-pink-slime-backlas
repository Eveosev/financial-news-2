Beef Products Inc., the maker of a
meat product dubbed “pink slime” by food activists, said it is
cutting another 86 jobs. Earlier this month, the company said
more than 650 positions will be eliminated with the closing of
three of its four plants.  The new job losses are “directly attributable to a
widespread campaign of misinformation” about the company’s
ammonia-treated beef, Dakota Dunes, South Dakota-based BPI said
today in an e-mailed statement. The cuts announced today include
corporate staff in  South Dakota  and reductions at the company’s
machine shop and assembly facility in South Sioux City,
Nebraska.  The company announced earlier this month that it is
shutting plants in Amarillo,  Texas ; Garden City, Kansas; and
Waterloo,  Iowa , with job cuts effective May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
