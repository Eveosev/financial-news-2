Exchanges around the globe appear to
be putting on hold plans to combine, NYSE Euronext Chief
Executive Officer  Duncan Niederauer , whose deal with  Deutsche
Boerse (DB1)  AG failed this year, said in an interview with CNBC.  “I still think ultimately the destiny for this industry is
to have fewer globally integrated exchanges,” he told CNBC
today. “That all appears to be on hold for the time being.”  New York-based NYSE Euronext’s plan to merge with Deutsche
Boerse of Frankfurt was blocked by European regulators in
February on grounds that it would have created a “near
monopoly” in European exchange-traded derivatives. The failure
came after plans for mergers between Toronto and London, and
Australia and Singapore also fell through.  “I don’t know if there’s a lot of cross-border merger
activity coming up soon, but I do think it’s inevitable,”
Niederauer said today. “I don’t know what role we’ll play in it
yet.”  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  is among bidders for the London Metal
Exchange, according to people with direct knowledge of the
matter. LME is the world’s biggest metal market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
