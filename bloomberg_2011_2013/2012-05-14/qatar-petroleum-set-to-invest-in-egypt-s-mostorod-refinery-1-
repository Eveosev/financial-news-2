Qatar is in “serious talks” about
investing in  Egypt ’s Mostorod oil refinery project, the head of
 Qatar Petroleum  International said.  “If we’re going to invest, we’re going to pay money,”
Nasser al-Jaidah, chief executive officer of the foreign
investment arm of the country’s state-run oil company, said
today in an interview. “I don’t know how much.”  Mohammed al-Sada, the country’s oil minister, said earlier
today that the country was investing in an Egyptian refinery,
without providing further details. Both Jaidah and Sada spoke at
a conference in the emirate’s capital Doha.  Qatar is spending gas and oil revenue on energy projects
abroad after finishing the last of 14 domestic gas liquefaction
plants last year as well as the world’s largest plant that turns
the fuel into diesel and kerosene. The world’s biggest exporter
of liquefied natural gas plans no further gas export projects
until a moratorium is lifted on further development of the North
Field reservoir.  The Persian Gulf nation is providing $400 million to
support the Mostorod refinery project, which has been stalled
since former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster in
February last year, MEED reported April 25, citing unidentified
people involved in the matter.  Qatar Petroleum is providing $300 million in equity and
Qatar National Bank, which counts the emirate’s government as
its biggest shareholder, is providing $100 million in loans,
MEED reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
