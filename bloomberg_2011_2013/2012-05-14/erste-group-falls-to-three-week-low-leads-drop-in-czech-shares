Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  fell to a three-
week low, leading a drop in Czech shares, as the euro regionâ€™s
financial crisis worsened with  Greece  struggling to form a new
government, driving investors from riskier assets.  The Austrian lender dropped as much as 2.2 percent to the
lowest intraday level since April 20, and traded at 398.2 koruna
by 10:37 a.m. in Prague. The  PX (PX)  equity index, in which Erste has
a 19 percent weighting, slipped 0.7 percent to 903.1 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
