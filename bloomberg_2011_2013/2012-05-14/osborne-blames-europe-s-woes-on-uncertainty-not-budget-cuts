U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said economies across  Europe  are being damaged by
uncertainty over the future of the euro region rather than
deficit cutting.  “The euro-zone crisis is having a real impact on growth
across the European continent, including Britain,” Osborne said
as he arrived in Brussels for talks with European Union finance
ministers, according to remarks released by his office. “The
British recovery has been damaged over the last two years not by
Britain getting a grip on its public finances, but by
uncertainty in the euro zone. It is that uncertainty, not
austerity, that is doing the real damage to the European
recovery, and indeed the British recovery.”  The possibility of  Greece  leaving the euro and readopting
the drachma as its currency moved to the center of the political
debate as European finance ministers gathered in Brussels for
talks. The crisis is rattling markets as authorities in Athens
struggle to form a government and leaders in Madrid battle to
convince investors they can clean up banks’ balance sheets and
curtail spending by regional governments.  In Britain, Osborne and Prime Minister  David Cameron  are
under growing pressure after the economy slipped back into
recession and an anti-austerity backlash gains ground in Europe,
where voters punished administrations in elections in France and
Greece.  Cameron’s coalition of Conservatives and  Liberal Democrats 
says there can be no compromise on its plans to eliminate the
bulk of a deficit of 8 percent of gross domestic product by
2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
