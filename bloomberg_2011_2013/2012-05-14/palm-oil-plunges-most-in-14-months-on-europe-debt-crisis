Palm oil  slumped the most in more
than 14 months on concerns that an escalating debt crisis in
 Europe  and a deepening economic slowdown in  China  may curb
demand for commodities.  July-delivery palm oil lost 3.8 percent, the most for the
most active contract since Feb. 23, 2011, to end at 3,150
ringgit ($1,022) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. That’s the lowest close since Feb. 10.  European officials began to weigh the fallout of a possible
withdrawal of  Greece  from the euro area even as authorities in
Athens struggled to form a government, strengthening the dollar
as a haven. China on May 12 said it would cut the amount lenders
must set aside as reserves for the third time since November,
underscoring the government’s determination to aid economic
growth that’s poised to slow for a sixth straight quarter.  “There is a widespread meltdown in commodities because of
a strong dollar and palm has not been spared,” Ryan Long, vice
president of futures and options at  OSK Holdings Bhd. (OSK) , said by
phone from Kuala Lumpur. “Exports from Malaysia in the first 10
days of May have also not been good.”  Shipments declined 6 percent to 450,269 tons from the same
period a month earlier, Intertek said May 10. Exports fell 14
percent to 419,364 tons in the same period, Societe Generale de
Surveillance estimated. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, a
gauge of 24 commodities, dropped for a ninth day, falling as
much as 1.8 percent to the lowest level since Dec. 20.  “Whenever there’s an economic slowdown, especially when we
talk about China, we’re more concerned about whether the
slowdown is going to dampen demand,” said Ker Chung Yang, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.,  Singapore .  Soybeans Drop  A decline in soybeans on speculation that U.S. farmers will
expand planting also weighed on palm oil, OSK’s Long said. The
pace of soybean planting in the U.S. has been encouraging and
the crop is expected to be higher, he said. Soybeans can be
crushed to make soybean oil, which competes with palm oil for
use in food and fuels.  Soybeans for July delivery fell 2 percent to $13.7775 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in the same month lost 2 percent to 51.21 cents a pound.  Palm oil for September delivery slid 1.8 percent to close
at 8,286  yuan  ($1,311) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
the lowest for the most-active contract since March 7. Soybean
oil for the same month fell 1.8 percent to close at 9,390 yuan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
