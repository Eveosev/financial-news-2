Kenya ’s shilling slumped for the
fifth day, headed for the lowest in more than three months.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 83.83 per dollar and traded 0.2
percent weaker at 83.70 at 1:16 p.m. A close at this level would
be the lowest since Feb 2.  Kenya’s central bank accepted all 7.02 billion shillings
($83.8 million) of bids received for seven-day  repurchase
agreements , said Godfrey Putunoi, a dealer at the bank’s money-
market department.  The weighted average rate for the repos was 16.522 percent,
he said by phone today from Nairobi. The bank had offered 12
billion shillings, he said.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 1,581.50 to the
dollar while the Ugandan shilling strengthened 0.1 percent to
2,468 to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
