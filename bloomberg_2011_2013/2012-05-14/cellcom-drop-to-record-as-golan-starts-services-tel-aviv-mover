Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) , Israel’s biggest
mobile-phone provider, declined to its lowest level on record
after Golan Telecom Ltd. and  Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) 
started their wireless services.  Shares of Netanya, Israel-based Cellcom retreated 3.3
percent to 41.67 shekels at 1:51 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the lowest
price since July 2007, when the shares were listed in Tel Aviv.
 Partner Communications Co. (PTNR) , the country’s second biggest
cellular company, headed for the lowest close since September
2003, dropping 3.5 percent to 25.66 shekels.  Golan Telecom, partly owned by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel, started services today offering unlimited voice and
messaging at 99 shekels ($25.85) a month and selling SIM cards
without handsets. Hot Telecom said today it is starting mobile
phone services, without disclosing details of the packages
offered.  “Golan’s is by far the cheapest package available,”  said
Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Excellence Nessuah Investment
House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan . “Cellcom and Partner will have to
emulate this business model, otherwise their cost structure will
be too high for this pricing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
