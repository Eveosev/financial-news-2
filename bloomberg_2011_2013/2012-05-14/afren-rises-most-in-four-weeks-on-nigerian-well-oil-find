Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil and gas
company focused on  Africa , climbed the most in almost four weeks
in London trading after saying it found oil at its Ebok North
Fault Block exploration well off southeast  Nigeria .  Afren jumped as much as 6.1 percent, the most since April
17, to 128.9 pence and traded 2.7 percent up at 124.8 pence at
8:39 a.m. in London. The stock has risen 45 percent this year,
valuing the company at 1.34 billion pounds ($2.2 billion).  Drilling found “excellent quality reservoir sands” at the
offshore well with 370 vertical feet of potentially produceable
oil, London-based Afren said in a statement today. The company,
in partnership with Oriental Energy Resources Ltd., began
drilling in April, reaching a total depth of 4,320 feet (1,316
meters). Exploration was targeting an area to the north of the
company’s main Ebok field, which is already producing oil.  “The proximity of Ebok North Fault Block to existing
infrastructure at the main Ebok field-production hub means that
we can quickly monetize these newly discovered volumes,” Chief
Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah said in the statement.  Data collected during the drilling suggest the well may
contain “in excess of 100 million  barrels of oil, toward the
upper end of Afren’s pre-drill expectations,” Afren said.
Drilling will be suspended while the partners determine
development plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
