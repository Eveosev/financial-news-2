The  yuan  dropped the most in four
weeks after the central bank set a weaker daily rate and cut
banks’ reserve requirements, reflecting concern over slowing
economic growth.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the  reference rate  by
0.14 percent to 6.3040 per dollar, the weakest level since April
20. The central bank cut  lenders’ reserve requirements  by 50
basis points on May 12, effective May 18, after data showed
April industrial production, exports, new loans and retail sales
increased less than forecast.  “This reserve-ratio cut came a bit late as the economy is
already slowing more than expected,” said Tommy Ong, senior
vice-president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank (Hong Kong)
Ltd. “The yuan will stay weak until investors see a clear trend
that  China  could deliver its 7.5 percent growth target.”  The yuan fell 0.17 percent, the most since April 16, to
close at 6.3215 per dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency is allowed to trade
as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing. The
yuan’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 1.85 percent.  Offshore Discounts  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.12
percent to 6.3208, the lowest level since March 30. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards slid 0.27 percent to 6.3770, a 0.9
percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The discount is the largest since Jan. 2  Industrial output  increased 9.3 percent in April, the least
since May 2009, according to the data last week. The reading
trailed the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
for a 12.2 percent increase.  Overseas sales  climbed 4.9 percent
from a year earlier, less than the 8.5 percent gain projected in
another Bloomberg survey.  Greek political leaders failed to reach agreement on
forming a coalition government last week following a May 6
election, raising the risk the nation will back out of a
European Union-led bailout agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
