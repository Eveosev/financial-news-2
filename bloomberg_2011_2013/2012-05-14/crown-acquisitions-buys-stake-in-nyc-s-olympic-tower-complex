Crown Acquisitions Inc. took a 49.9
percent stake in the Olympic Tower complex, a group of four
adjacent buildings on  Manhattan ’s Fifth Avenue, including a
skyscraper commissioned by the late  Aristotle Onassis .  The buildings, across East 51st Street from St. Patrick’s
Cathedral, are now owned by a partnership of New York-based
Crown and Olympic Tower Associates, according to a statement by
Colliers International, the brokerage that arranged the deal.
The transaction  values  the complex at about $1 billion, said a
person with knowledge of the terms, who asked not to be
identified because the negotiations were private.  The complex consists of the 51-story Olympic Tower, the
Cartier Building at 653 Fifth Ave., the Versace Building at 647
Fifth Ave., and 10 East 52nd St. The Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth
Ave., commissioned by Onassis and built in 1974, was the first
in  New York  to combine stores, commercial  office space  and
condominium apartments in a single building, the brokerage said.  Crown, whose president is Stanley Chera, specializes in
retail redevelopments, including the stores at Manhattan’s St.
Regis Hotel and 666 Fifth Ave., which is diagonally across the
intersection from the Olympic complex.  The deal was reported earlier today by the Wall Street
Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
