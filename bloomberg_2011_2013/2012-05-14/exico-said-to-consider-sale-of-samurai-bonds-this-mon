Mexico  may sell Samurai bonds without
guarantee this month, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter.  The notes wonâ€™t be guaranteed by the  Japan  Bank for
International Cooperation, as opposed to the last two sales of
yen-denominated securities by Mexico, the person said.  The government met with bond investors in Japan in August,
arranged by Citigroup Inc., Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc., the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
