Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  started a hydrotreater
at its Los Angeles refinery after maintenance, according to a
person familiar with plant operations.  The hydrotreater began a return to service this weekend,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the refinery, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail requesting comment.  A hydrotreater removes sulfur, metal and other impurities
from refined oil products, allowing them to burn more cleanly as
fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
