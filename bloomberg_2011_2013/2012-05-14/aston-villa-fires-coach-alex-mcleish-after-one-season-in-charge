Aston Villa fired coach  Alex McLeish 
following a year in the job after the Birmingham soccer club
finished two places above the relegation zone in England’s
Premier League.  “We need to be clear and candid with ourselves and with
supporters about what we have lacked in recent years,” Chairman
 Randy Lerner  said in a statement on Villa’s website.
“Compelling play and results that instil a sense of confidence
that Villa is on the right track have been plainly absent.”  The team hired McLeish in June after he resigned from
crosstown rival Birmingham, which had been relegated. He was
Villa’s third manager in nine months. Martin O’Neill quit five
days before the start of the season and  Gerard Houllier  stepped
down because of heart problems.  Villa finished in 16th place, two points and two places
above the teams that are sent down into the second-division
Championship.  Supporters of Villa called for Paul Lambert’s appointment
during a 2-0 loss to his Norwich team yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
