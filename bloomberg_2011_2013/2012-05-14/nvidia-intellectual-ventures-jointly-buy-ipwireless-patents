Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) , a maker of graphics
processors, has teamed up with Intellectual Ventures to jointly
acquire about 500 patents from IPWireless.  The portfolio covers patents for technology known as long-
term evolution, or LTE, as well as for 3G and 4G networks, Santa
Clara, California-based Nvidia and Intellectual Ventures, based
in Bellevue, Washington, said in a statement today. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  Nvidia is trying to branch out into microprocessors for
phones, lessening its reliance on personal computers. The
company gets most of its revenue from chips used to create high-
end graphics in desktop and notebook computers. Nvidia’s Tegra
processor for mobile devices is designed to compete with
products from  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  and  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)   “This acquisition complements our ownership of extensive
fundamental patents in graphics, visual and mobile computing,”
said David Shannon, executive vice president and general counsel
at Nvidia, in the statement.  Ownership of the patents was split between Nvidia and
 Intellectual Ventures , with Nvidia licensing rights to the
patents it didn’t acquire. IPWireless retains royalty-free
access to the patents.  Nvidia’s  shares  fell 1.7 percent to $12.99 at 9:41 a.m. in
New York. The stock had dropped 4.7 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
