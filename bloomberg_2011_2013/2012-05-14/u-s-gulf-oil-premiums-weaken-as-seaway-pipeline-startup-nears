U.S. Gulf Coast oils weakened with
the approach of the start of the planned Seaway pipeline
reversal, which will move crude from  Oklahoma  to refineries in
 Texas .  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and Enterprise Products Partners LP plan to
start shipments on the 150,000-barrel-a-day line about May 17,
according to a filing with regulators last month. The influx of
domestic oil supplies may weaken prices for Gulf Coast crudes
that typically compete with West African oil priced against
European benchmark Brent.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate lost 15 cents to $13.75 a barrel at 12:05
p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the grade’s smallest margin since Feb. 1. LLS’s premium
has dropped 43 percent from a high of $24 this year on March 23.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 10 cents to
$15.50. Mars Blend’s narrowed 30 cents to $10.50 a barrel and
Poseidon’s lost 40 cents to $9.50. Southern Green Canyon
decreased 35 cents to a premium of $9.50.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased $2.75
against WTI to a premium of $12.25.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed $1 to
$17.75 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium added 5 cents to $2.05.  Bakken oil’s discount to the U.S. benchmark widened 40
cents to $1.90 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
