Jordan’s government plans to more
than double fees imposed on phosphate mining to $5 from $2 a
metric ton to boost government revenue, starting in the second
quarter of next year, Al Arab Al Yawm reported.  The government received about 8.8 million dinars ($12.5
million) in mining fees from  Jordan Phosphate Mines Co. (JOPH)  last
year, the Amman-based newspaper reported, citing an unidentified
official. The increase is the first since the company was
privatized six years ago, it said.  Jordan Phosphate’s shareholders include Kamil Holdings
Ltd., owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, with 37 percent,
and the Jordanian government, with 26.2 percent, according to
the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
