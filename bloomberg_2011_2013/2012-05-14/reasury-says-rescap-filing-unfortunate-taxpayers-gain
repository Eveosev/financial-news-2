U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary for
Financial Stability Timothy G. Massad said today that while
Residential Capital LLC’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is
unfortunate, the “action puts taxpayers in a stronger position
to continue recovering their investment in  Ally Financial. (ALLY) ”  Massad, in a statement issued in Washington, said the
Treasury Department had consented to the filing. Massad said
Chapter 11 provides a single forum “for reviewing and
resolving” claims against ResCap, a residential mortgage
company owned by Ally Financial Inc.  The Treasury Department, defending the Obama
administration’s efforts to fight the 2008 financial crisis,
last month said programs to rescue companies such as Ally
Financial may earn a profit for taxpayers in the long term.  That assessment includes bailouts of banks and automakers
under the Troubled Asset Relief Program as well as Federal
Reserve crisis measures, such as large-scale asset purchases. It
excludes the $825 billion stimulus package passed in 2009.  ResCap’s Chapter 11 filing may become a presidential
campaign issue for presumptive Republican candidate  Mitt Romney ,
who supported aid for banks while opposing help for automakers.  Republicans in Congress have criticized the bailouts, which
began under President  George W. Bush  in 2008 and continued under
President  Barack Obama  starting in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
