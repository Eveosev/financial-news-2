Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) ,  Asia ’s
biggest international carrier, said economy fares have dropped
between 8 percent and 10 percent this year as economic
uncertainties sap travel demand.  “Fares are responding to the market,” Chief Executive
Officer John Slosar said in an interview in Hong Kong today.
“We certainly make our fares competitive at the moment.”  The Hong Kong-based carrier said last week that it expects
“disappointing” first-half earnings as it cuts fares amid
competition and contends with fuel prices that have jumped 40
percent in two years. In a bid to cut costs, the airline has
suspended hiring ground staff, offered cabin crew voluntary
unpaid leave and pared growth.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  also has cut freighter flights and
offered some pilots unpaid leave to cope with a demand slowdown.
The Singapore-based carrier reported a surprise loss for the
three months ended March.  Cathay Pacific has dropped 5 percent this year in  Hong Kong 
trading, trailing Singapore Air’s 1.2 percent gain in Singapore.
Cathay rose 1.1 percent to HK$12.66 on May 11.  The Hong Kong carrier is also working with cabin crew as it
introduces more late-night flights, Slosar said. Some flight
attendants marched on May 12 to protest work patterns that
require them to make outbound and return flights in one shift,
according to the  South China Morning Post .  To contact the reporter on this story:
