White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said today it’s “amazing” there are “still those who
are out there arguing that we should repeal Wall Street reform”
after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion trading loss.  “This is strong evidence that having these rules of the
road in place are essential to making sure that taxpayers don’t
get left holding the bag,” Carney told reporters on Air Force
One as President  Barack Obama  traveled to New York City, where
he will deliver the commencement speech at Barnard College and
attend two fundraisers. “We have to remain ever vigilant.”  JPMorgan’s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56,
announced the loss May 10 and has criticized his company’s
handling of trading in synthetic credit securities as “flawed,
complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly
monitored.”  JPMorgan today said Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew will
retire after the firm suffered the $2 billion trading
loss, marking the downfall of one of the highest-ranking women
on  Wall Street .  Matt Zames, the 41-year-old head of global fixed income in
the investment bank, will succeed Drew, New York-based JPMorgan
said in a statement. The entire London staff of the bank’s chief
investment office, where the loss occurred, is at risk of
dismissal, a person familiar with the situation said.  “It is amazing that there are still those who are out there
arguing we should repeal Wall Street reform, that we should let
Wall Street write their own rules again,” Carney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
