Safa Nicu Sepahan Co. , a privately
owned Iranian company, reached an agreement with  Syria ’s
government to renovate two hydroelectric power stations in
northern Syria, the state-run  Press TV  reported.  The company will refurbish the al-Furat dam at an estimated
cost of 14.8 million euros ($19 million) and the al-Baath plant
for 767,000 euros, according to a report published on the news
channel’s website. The al-Furat power station on the Euphrates
River has the potential to generate 800 megawatts of electricity
and the al-Baath 75 megawatts.  Iran will begin exporting 50 megawatts of electricity to
Lebanon and Syria next week as part of an agreement reached in
February, Abdolhamid Farzam, an official with the Iranian Energy
Ministry, said yesterday, Press TV said.  Iran  will initially
transfer 50 megawatts of electricity to the two countries and
will reach 200 megawatts at a further stage, Farzam said,
without giving a more detailed timeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
