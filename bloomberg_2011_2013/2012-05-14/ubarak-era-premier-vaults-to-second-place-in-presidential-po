Former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak ’s last prime minister pushed Islamist presidential
hopeful Abdel Moneim Aboul-Fotouh from second place in a voter
poll, with just over a week until the election is set to begin.  Ahmed Shafik, who served as premier in the waning days of
Mubarak’s administration, moved into second place, with 19.9
percent of the 1,200 people surveyed saying they supported him,
according to the weekly poll by the Al Ahram Center for
Political and Strategic Studies. Amre Moussa, the former Arab
League chief and foreign minister under Mubarak, retained his
lead in the race slated to begin May 23, with the backing of
40.8 percent of those surveyed, the state-run  Al-Ahram  daily
reported.  Shafik’s rise pushed Aboul-Fotouh into third place with
17.8 percent, while Mohamed Mursi, the head of the Muslim
Brotherhood’s political arm, won the backing of 9.4 percent of
those surveyed. That marked a more than 2 percentage point gain
for Mursi from the previous week.  The poll was held May 5-8, before Aboul-Fotouh and Moussa
faced off in the Arab world’s first presidential debate. The
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
