JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM)  Matt Zames,
newly appointed to lead the firm’s chief investment office after
it suffered a $2 billion loss, shook up the unit’s leadership
and announced a “renewed focus” on hedging risks.  Achilles Macris, who was hired in 2006 to oversee trading
in London where the losses occurred, will “transition” his CIO
responsibilities, Zames said today in an employee memo obtained
by Bloomberg News.  He named Rob O’Rahilly to lead the office in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, as Christopher Chan continues overseeing
Asia, according to the memo. Marie Nourie will become the global
group’s finance chief, and Chetan Bhargiri will join the unit as
chief risk officer, reporting to John Hogan, the memo shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
