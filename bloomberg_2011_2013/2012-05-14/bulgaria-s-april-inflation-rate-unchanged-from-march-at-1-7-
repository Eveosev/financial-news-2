Bulgaria’s inflation rate held steady
in April from the previous month as declining output triggered
by the euro area’s debt crisis kept a lid on demand and price
growth.  The headline rate was 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement
today, matching the  median estimate  of five economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Prices rose 0.2 percent from the previous month.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession in
2009 without an international bailout. Industrial output dropped
3.2 percent in March from a year earlier, the slowest in two
years, as the debt crisis damped demand for Bulgarian exports.  The country’s EU-harmonized inflation will ease to 2.6
percent on average in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013 according to
the EU forecast on May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
