Borrowing costs on  Nigeria ’s $500
million of dollar bonds climbed for a third day after oil fell
below $94 a barrel in  New York  for the first time since December
as Europe’s debt crisis worsened.  Yields on the Eurobonds of Africa’s biggest oil producer
due 2021 rose ten basis points, or 0.10 percent, to 5.471
percent as of 3:12 p.m. in London.  West Texas Intermediate crude dropped as much as 2.6
percent to $93.65 per barrel. Greece failed to agree on a unity
government and European Union officials considered the nation’s
possible exit from the euro.  Brent crude , trading at about $110
a barrel today, should drop to $100 as supply outweighs demand,
Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said yesterday in Adelaide,
Australia.  “Upside risk is growing,”  Charles Robertson , the London-
based global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, wrote in an
e-mailed note today. “The best hope for individual markets is
that local credit growth (Russia, Nigeria) and local structural
reform (Russia, Nigeria, Turkey, Poland, Kazakhstan) - offset
global anxieties - but that’s evidently not happening this
morning.”  Nigeria’s naira gained 0.1 percent to 157.765 per dollar on
the  interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, its
biggest gain since May 2. The West African country sold $150
million at an auction today, with the exchange rate appreciating
by less than 0.1 percent to 155.70 naira, the Abuja-based
Central Bank of Nigeria said in an e-mailed statement.  ‘Dollar Inflows’  “This week, we expect to see stability in the foreign
exchange market partly on account of anticipated dollar inflows
from foreign portfolio investors bidding for bonds,” analysts
at Lagos-based Cowry Asset Management Ltd., led by Edgar Ebinum,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Nigeria plans to sell 70 billion naira ($444 million) of
five- to 10-year bonds at an auction on May 16, the debt
management agency said on May 9.  Borrowing costs on domestic bonds due 2015 gained three
basis points to 14.99 percent as of May 11 data on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi fell 0.6 percent to 1.8930 per dollar, in the
capital Accra, the weakest since at least June 1993.  To contact the reporters on this story:
