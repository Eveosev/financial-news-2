Kazakhstanâ€™s  industrial output 
unexpectedly slowed last month as oil production shrank.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 2 percent in
April from a year earlier after growing 3.1 percent in March,
the state statistics agency said on its website today. The
median  estimate  of five economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was 3.7 percent.  Industrial production advanced 2.7 percent in the first
four months of 2012 on an annual basis, the agency said. Oil
output fell 1.4 percent to 26.6 million metric tons and
production of copper dropped 2.1 percent to 107,600 tons.  Rolled-steel output climbed 2.4 percent to 1.1 million tons
in the January to April period, while ferroalloys gained 0.2
percent to 600,000 tons, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
