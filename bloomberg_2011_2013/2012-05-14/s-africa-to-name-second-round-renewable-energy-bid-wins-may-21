South Africa  will announce the
winning bids in its second round of proposals for renewable-
energy power plants on May 21, the Department of Energy said.  The department, which received 79 proposals by the March 5
deadline, postponed the announcement from May 17 because of
Minister Dipuo Petersâ€™ budget speech, it said in an e-mailed
statement from Pretoria today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
