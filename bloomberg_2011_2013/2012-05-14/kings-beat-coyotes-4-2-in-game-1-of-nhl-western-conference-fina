The  Los Angeles Kings  defeated the
Phoenix Coyotes 4-2 in Game 1 of the National Hockey League’s
Western Conference finals, improving their record to 6-0 away
from home this postseason.  The Kings never trailed, held a 48-27 advantage in shots
and snapped a 2-2 tie on Dustin Brown’s goal 2:11 into the third
period last night at Jobing.com Arena in Phoenix.  “We had a lot of rest and, coming out of the gates, we
just wanted to make sure we pushed the pace,” said Kings center
Anze Kopitar, who scored 3:53 into the first period, when Los
Angeles outshot Phoenix 17-4. “It’s a little bit easier when
you score first.”  Dwight King added a pair of goals for  Los Angeles ,
including an empty-net score with 47.7 seconds left.  The Kings, the eighth seed in the West, had six days off
after completing a four-game sweep of the No. 2 St. Louis Blues
in the second round. They knocked off the top-seeded Vancouver
Canucks in the opening round of the playoffs.  Derek Morris and Mikkel Boedker had goals for the Coyotes,
who host Game 2 tomorrow.  “We weren’t close in that game, we got beat in every
facet,” Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. “Hopefully we take
some lessons from it and we can be better next time.”  The  New York Rangers  and  New Jersey Devils  are in the
Eastern Conference finals, with Game 1 scheduled for tonight at
Madison Square Garden in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
