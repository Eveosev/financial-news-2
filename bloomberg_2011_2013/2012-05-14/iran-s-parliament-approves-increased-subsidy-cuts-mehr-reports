Iran ’s parliament, which is reviewing
the budget for the current Iranian year, plans to reduce
government subsidies by $53.8 billion, the state-run  Mehr  news
agency reported.  Parliament’s move will allow Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s
government to increase energy prices and introduce the second
phase of a subsidies plan this year that started in Dec. 2010,
Mehr said. The government reduced subsidies by $44 billion in
the last Iranian year that ended March 19.  The government’s plans were put at risk earlier when
parliament’s Integration Committee rejected on May 5 the size of
the cuts sought by the president, Mehr said.  The parliament did not endorse the committee’s decision,
agreeing instead to increase the reductions though by less than
the $110 billion that had been requested by Ahmadinejad, Mehr
said in the report published late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
