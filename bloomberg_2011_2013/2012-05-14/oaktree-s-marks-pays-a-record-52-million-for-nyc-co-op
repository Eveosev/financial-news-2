Howard Marks , chairman and co-founder
of  Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) , paid $52.5 million for a duplex
apartment on New York’s Park Avenue, a record price for a
Manhattan co-op.  Marks acquired the eight-bedroom property at 740 Park Ave.
from Courtney Ross, the widow of former Time Warner Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Steven J. Ross, according to New York City
property records filed on May 11.  The Park Avenue tower, completed in 1930 and designed by
architects Rosario Candela and Arthur Loomis Harmon, has been
home to John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
according to property-listings website  StreetEasy.com . Its 31
units include duplexes, triplexes and penthouses with nine to 34
rooms.  The price is the highest paid for a  New York  City co-op,
according to  Jonathan Miller , president of appraiser Miller
Samuel Inc. The previous record was $48.8 million, set in July
2008, for an apartment on  1060 Fifth Ave ., Miller said.  Oaktree, based in Los Angeles, raised $380.2 million last
month in an initial public offering. Marks declined to comment
