InterOil Corp. (IOC)  fell the most in more
than seven months after it received a notice the Papua New
Guinea government will cancel a liquefied natural gas project in
the country.  InterOil fell 17 percent to $47.66 at 10:08 a.m. in trading
in  New York . The shares earlier fell 17.5 percent, the most
intraday since Oct. 4.  An agreement to build a $6 billion plant will be canceled,
according to a copy of a notice from the Department of Petroleum
and Energy given to InterOil through an “unofficial channel,”
according to a statement today. Cairns, Australia-based InterOil
will meet with the Papua New Guinea government this week to
discuss the LNG project, Chief Executive Officer Phil Mulacek
said on a conference call today.  The project is caught in a political “silly season,”
Mulacek said.  Papua New Guinea  will hold parliamentary elections
in late June.  “The prime minister’s office has not shown any intention
to cancel the project and we intend to fully abide by the terms
of the 2009 agreement,” Mulacek said.  The LNG plant is being built adjacent to InterOil’s
refinery and is expected to begin liquefaction by 2015. The
company has spent $81 million on its construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
