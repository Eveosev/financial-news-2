Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, said its first-quarter
profit fell 86 percent from a year earlier because of the gain
it had realized from the sale of its Tunisian unit.  Net income for the period that ended March 31 was $115.7
million compared with $812.7 million a year earlier, the Cairo-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. It had
recognized a gain of $754 million last year as a result of
selling its stake in Orascom Tunisia Holding, it said.  Orascom, which split its assets this year to facilitate a
$6.5 billion merger with Russia’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , said its
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
increased 5 percent in the quarter to $433.5 million. The
company’s Algerian unit Djezzy, its biggest revenue generator,
contributed $273.8 million of that sum, also a 5 percent gain
over last year, it said.  Orascom said last month it is filing for arbitration
against the Algerian government for “unlawful actions taken
since 2008” against Djezzy, including a $1.3 billion court-
ordered fine for violating foreign exchange regulations.
 Algeria ’s government is in talks with VimpelCom to buy Orascom’s
majority stake in Djezzy, after the unit was valued at $6.5
billion, Algerian Post and Communications Minister Moussa
Benhamadi said in April.  Shares of Orascom  fell 0.3 percent to 3.37 Egyptian pounds
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 17.7
billion pounds ($2.9 billion). The stock has surged 95 percent
this year, compared with a 40 percent increase for the benchmark
 EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
