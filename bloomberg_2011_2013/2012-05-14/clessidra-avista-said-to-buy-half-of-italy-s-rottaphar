Rottapharm Madaus, a family-owned
Italian drugmaker, agreed to sell a 50 percent stake to private
equity firms  Clessidra Capital Partners  and Avista Capital
Partners in a deal that values the company at about 1.7 billion
euros ($2.2 billion), people with knowledge of the sale said.  An agreement was reached in the past few days, said one
person, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
were private. The two firms, which bid jointly, will each own 25
percent of Rottapharm, the people said.  The sale ends a months-long effort by the Rovati family to
find an outside investor for the company, which is based in the
northern town of Monza. Rottapharm, founded in 1961, had sales
of about 600 million euros in 2010, according to its  website .
The company expanded abroad through deals including the purchase
of  Germany ’s Madaus Pharma in 2007 and now operates in more than
85 countries.  Spokeswomen for Rottapharm and Clessidra, based in  Italy ,
declined to comment. A representative of U.S. firm Avista was
not immediately available for comment.  Rottapharm sells Dona, a glucosamine product used to
promote healthy joints, nitroglycerine for heart patients and a
respiratory treatment, Mucoflux.  Private equity firms  Carlyle Group , Charterhouse Capital
Partners LLP and Advent International Corp. also submitted bids
for Rottapharm, four people familiar with the situation said in
December. One or two drugmakers also submitted an offer, one
person said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
