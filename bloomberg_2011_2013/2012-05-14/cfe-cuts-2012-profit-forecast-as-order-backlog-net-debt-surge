Cie. d’Entreprises CFE SA , the
construction company that owns half of Dredging Environmental &
Marine Engineering NV, cut its full-year profit forecast after
saying revenue will show “only moderate growth” this year.  First-quarter revenue increased to 417.5 million euros
($535.9 million) from 393.8 million euros, the Brussels-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. CFE said major
dredging orders will start generating revenue as of next year
and  net debt  increased to 405 million euros at the end of March
because of DEME’s fleet expansion.  “Full-year earnings are likely to  approach  those of
2011,” CFE said in the statement, cutting its Feb. 24 forecast
of an increase in profit. “The outlook for 2013 and 2014
remains very bright, supported by the dredging and real-estate
development businesses.”  CFE’s order backlog surged 23 percent in the quarter to
2.93 billion euros at the start of April and the construction
company said almost 60 percent of the backlog will translate
into revenue in 2013 and beyond. CFE’s backlog includes more
than 1.68 billion euros of orders that were awarded to DEME
including recent contract wins in Australia and Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
