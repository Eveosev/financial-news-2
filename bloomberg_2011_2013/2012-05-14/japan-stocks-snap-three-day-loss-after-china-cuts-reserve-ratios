     May 14 (Bloomberg) --　Most Japanese stocks fell, with the
Topix Index sliding for a fourth day, as European officials
began to weigh  Greece ’s possible exit from the monetary union.
Losses in stocks were limited after  China  moved to spur growth
by cutting the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) , an automaker that gets 27 percent
of its sales from  Europe , lost 3.6 percent. Sumitomo Electric
Industries Ltd. slumped 5.7 percent after the maker of electric
wires and cables forecast net income that missed estimates.
 Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of automation controls used in Chinese
factories, gained 1.8 percent.  The Topix lost 0.2 percent to 756.68 at the 3 p.m. close in
 Tokyo , with more than three stocks dropping for each that rose,
after advancing as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.2 percent to 8,973.84 after dropping 4.6
percent last week, the biggest weekly loss since August.  “Investors find it hard to make a move with uncertainty
over Europe, especially Greece,” said Takuya Yamada, a Tokyo-
based senior portfolio manager at ITC Investment Partners Corp.,
which manages about $750 million. “China’s reserve ratio cut is
a plus for investor mindsets, but the market isn’t reacting much
because its impact on the economy is limited.”  The Nikkei 225 has retreated 12.5 percent from this year’s
high on March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed and on
renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis. A Greek backlash at
the polls against austerity measures has led to speculation the
nation will become the first to exit the monetary union. Euro-
area finance ministers will meet in Brussels today while
Europe’s central bankers continue to discuss the possibility of
a Greek departure and how to handle the fallout.  Valuation Comparison  The decline has brought the  value  of stocks on the Topix to
0.9 times book value, compared with 2.14 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.39 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A
value less than one means investors can buy companies for less
than the value of their assets.  Companies that do business in Europe fell. Mitsubishi
Motors slid 3.6 percent to 80 yen.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , a
glassmaker that gets the highest percentage of revenue generated
in Europe on the Nikkei 225 Average, lost 3 percent to 96 yen.  Losses were limited after the People’s Bank of China said
on May 12 that it is cutting the amount of capital that banks
must set aside for the third time in six months to support
lending after a report showed inflation slowed last month.
Reserve ratios will fall 50 basis points effective May 18.  ‘Soon Take Action’  “China has relied on the reserve ratio to loosen policy,
but they may soon take action with  interest rates ,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd.,
which has $412 billion in assets. “Expectations for China’s
policy are causing a rebound.”  Fanuc advanced 1.8 percent to 13,600 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
construction machinery maker that generates 14 percent of its
sales in China, rose 0.1 percent to 2,054 yen after falling as
much as 0.5 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.3 percent today. The index
slid 0.3 percent in  New York  on May 11, declining for a second
week, on European political concern and after JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s $2 billion trading loss weighed on banking shares.  Among other stocks that fell, Sumitomo Electric slid 5.7
percent to 975 yen. The cable maker’s shares declined after it
forecast 70 billion yen in net income for the year ending March
31, lower than 80.8 billion yen estimated by analysts.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.,  Asia ’s leading drugmaker, lost
3.2 percent to 3,290 yen after reporting net income plunged 50
percent to 124.2 billion yen in the year ended March, missing
estimates of a 142.8 billion yen gain. Takeda cited costs
related to its acquisition of Nycomed for the result.  Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 was 12 percent above the
30-day average. The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 3.6 percent
to 21.90, indicating traders expect a swing of 6.3 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
