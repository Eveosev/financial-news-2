PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , Poland’s largest
lender, headed for a three-week low after saying its bad-loan
provisions soared in the first quarter and as European shares
declined because of concern that  Greece  will quit the euro.  The shares slid as much as 2.5 percent to 31.48 zloty, and
traded down 2.3 percent at 31.57 zloty, the lowest on a closing
basis since April 23, at 1:54 p.m. in Warsaw.  Provisions for bad loans surged 20 percent to 527.5 million
zloty ($158 million), driven by reserves for loans to
construction companies and to small and medium-sized companies
as Poland’s economic growth slows to 2.7 percent this year from
4.3 percent last year, according to European Commission
forecasts on May 11.  “The quality looks slightly weak,“ Tomasz Walkowicz, a
London-based analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a research note today.
“Economic recovery in  Poland  may be slower than we expect and
thus volume growth in the Polish banking sector, including PKO,
may be below expectations.”  Net income increased to 1 billion zloty from 871 million
zloty a year earlier, PKO said in a regulatory statement today.
That was in line with the 1.02 billion-zloty mean estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Stocks and commodities declined and the euro weakened to a
three-month low on concern that Greece will withdraw from the
single European currency as politicians in Athens struggle to
form a government after a parliamentary election on May 6.
Losses by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party in a regional
ballot yesterday added to the negative sentiment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
