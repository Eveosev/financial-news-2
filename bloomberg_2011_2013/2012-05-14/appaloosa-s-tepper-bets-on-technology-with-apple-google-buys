Appaloosa Management LP, the hedge
fund run by David Allan Tepper, bet on technology in the first
quarter with purchases of  Apple (AAPL)  Inc.,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and an
exchange-traded fund that mimics the Nasdaq 100 Index.  The hedge fund, based in Chatham, New Jersey, bought
503,000 shares of Apple valued at $337 million, 162,000 shares
of Google valued at $104 million and 18.9 million shares of the
PowerShares QQQ Trust, valued at $1.27 billion, according to a
filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Tepper also bought 6 million shares of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  with
a value of $223 million.  Technology stocks have declined 7.3 percent since March 31,
making them the third-worst performing group in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Financial stocks have declined 8.4 percent, the most of any of
the 10 groups in the index.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
equities must file a  Form 13F  within 45 days of the end of each
quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S.
exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt.  Hedge funds are lightly regulated pools of capital whose
managers can invest in any asset, and share in annual profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
