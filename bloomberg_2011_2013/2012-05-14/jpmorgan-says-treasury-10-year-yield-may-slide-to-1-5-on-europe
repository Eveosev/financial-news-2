JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve , said the
U.S.  10-year note  yield may drop to a record low 1.5 percent as
deteriorating conditions in  Europe  boost demand for safe assets.  “Treasuries have room to rally further if the situation in
Europe continues to deteriorate,” strategists led by Terry Belton, global head of fixed-income strategy for the firm in New
York, wrote in a client note dated May 11. Political turmoil in
 Greece  since voters revolted against austerity in May 6
elections raises “the risks of a Greek exit from the  euro zone 
following the new elections likely to take place June 17,” they
wrote.  Ten-year Treasury note yields tumbled to 1.67 percent on
Sept. 23, a record, as investors sought refuge in  U.S.
government debt  amid concern the global economy was on the brink
of another recession.  Yields on the benchmark security dropped as much as seven
basis points today, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.77 percent,
the lowest level since Oct. 4.  The yields may trade at about 1.7 percent if comparable-
maturity Spanish bonds’ yields increase to 6.5 percent, the
strategists wrote. U.S. 10-year yields may slide 20 to 25 basis
points for each 100 basis-point jump in Spanish and Italian
debt, they wrote. Spain’s 10-year note yields climbed as much as
35 basis points today to 6.36 percent, the highest level since
November, and yields on Italian 10-year debt rose 22 basis
points to 5.73 percent.  JPMorgan forecasts Treasury 10-year yields will fall to
1.70 percent by June 30 and rise to 2.50 percent by year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
