U.S. farmers accelerated corn, soybean
and wheat planting last week after drier weather firmed soils to
support heavy machinery used in fieldwork.  About 87 percent of the  corn  crop was seeded as of yesterday,
up from 71 percent a week earlier and 56 percent a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . The
average for the previous five years is 66 percent. An estimated 56
percent of the plants had emerged from the ground, compared with
16 percent a year earlier, the USDA said.  About 46 percent of the  soybean  crop was planted, compared
with 24 percent a week earlier and the previous five-year average
of 24 percent, the USDA said.  Planting of the spring-wheat  crop  rose to 94 completed as of
May 13, up from 84 percent a week earlier, the department said.
The average for the date for the previous five years is 64
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
