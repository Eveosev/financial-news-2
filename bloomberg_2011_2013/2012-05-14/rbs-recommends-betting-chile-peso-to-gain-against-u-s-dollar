The Chilean pesoâ€™s sell-off last week
means it is time to buy the currency, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  Investors should go long two-month Chilean peso non-
deliverable forwards with a target of 473.1 per  U.S. dollar ,
Flavia Cattan-Nasluasky and Felipe Hernandez, analysts based in
 Stamford , Connecticut, wrote today in a note to clients.
Investors should exit the trade if the forwards weaken to 494
per dollar, they said.  The peso fell 0.9 percent to 491.53 per dollar as of 8:42
a.m. in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
