German solar-power company Sovello
GmbH filed for insolvency and will attempt to restructure in the
process.  Sovello, based in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, cannot pay its debts
and has asked the Dessau insolvency court to be allowed to
restructure under its management, the company said in a
 statement  on its website today. Attorney Bernd Depping has been
appointed as preliminary administrator, the company said.  “We have checked alternative scenarios to regain
solvency,” Chief Executive Officer Reiner Beutel said in the
statement. “Even if our debts are low, in the current market
environment the company can be sustainably restructured with the
instruments of the insolvency code.”  German solar companies have struggled with reduced
government aid and competition from Chinese companies amid a
glut of solar panels. Q-Cells, once the biggest solar-cell
maker, along with  Solon SE (SOO1) ,  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and  Solarhybrid
AG (SHL)  all filed for insolvency since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
