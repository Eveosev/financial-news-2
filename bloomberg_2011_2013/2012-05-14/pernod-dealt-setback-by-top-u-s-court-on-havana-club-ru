The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
intervene in a clash over the rights to sell Havana Club rum in
the American market, dealing a setback to  Pernod Ricard SA (RI) ,
 France ’s biggest liquor maker.  The justices today left intact a U.S. government agency’s
rejection of a bid by Cuba’s state-owned Cubaexport to renew its
U.S. trademark on the Havana Club name. Pernod sells  Havana Club 
throughout the world, except in the U.S., under a 1993 agreement
with Cubaexport.  The case is part of a multipronged legal battle between
Pernod and Bacardi Ltd. over U.S. rights to the Havana Club
name. The two companies have been fighting since 1994, when
Bacardi applied for a U.S. trademark.  Paris-based Pernod is trying to position itself to sell rum
in the U.S. under the historic Havana Club name should the
American embargo on Cuban goods be lifted. Bacardi has been
selling its Havana Club rum in  Florida  since 2006.  The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control refused to renew Cubaexport’s trademark, relying on a
1998 law making marks confiscated by the Cuban government
unenforceable. A federal appeals court in Washington upheld the
decision. The law has been applied only to the Havana Club mark.  A different federal appeals court ruled against Pernod on a
separate issue in August. It said consumers wouldn’t be confused
into thinking Bacardi’s Havana Club rum was made in Cuba because
the label says it is made in  Puerto Rico . Bacardi is based in
Hamilton, Bermuda.  The Supreme Court case is Empresa Cubana v. Department of
the Treasury, 11-945.  To contact the reporter on this story:
