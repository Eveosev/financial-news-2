The global sugar surplus will be 15
percent bigger than initially estimated in the 2012-13 season
starting in October, according to  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   Sugar supplies will outpace demand by 7.8 million metric
tons in 2012-13, the bank said in a report e-mailed today. That
compares with a forecast for a surplus of 6.8 million tons on
May 6. That would be a third year in which production will be
bigger than consumption, with a surplus of 8.1 million tons in
the current 2011-12 season, according to the bank.  “With a pick-up in Indian exports and the start of the
center south Brazilian crush, we expect that the building global
trade surplus is likely to weigh on prices,” wrote  Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research at the bank in New York.  Sugar exporters from  India , the world’s second-biggest
producer, don’t need to get permits for shipping the sweetener,
the food ministry said in a notification dated May 11. The
2012-13 season in  Brazil ’s center south, the main growing region
of the biggest producer, has started and sugar-cane output is
forecast to recover to 509 million tons, up from 493.3 million
tons in 2011-12, according to industry group Unica.  Sugar prices may need to fall below 18 cents a pound for
millers in Brazil to favor ethanol output at the expense of
sugar, according to the report. Raw sugar for July delivery
retreated 0.3 percent to 20.17 cents a pound by 6:12 a.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
