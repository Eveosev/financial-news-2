Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index slumped
1.8 percent to 17,009.32 by the end of trading in Budapest, the
lowest close since Jan. 11.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, declined
2.5 percent to 3,629 forint. European stocks retreated after
Greek parties failed to form a government, increasing concern
that the region’s debt crisis will deepen.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, weakened 1.5
percent to 16,250 forint. Oil fell to the lowest price in almost
five months in New York as Saudi Arabia’s petroleum minister
said Brent crude should fall to about $100 a barrel.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL HB), the Hungarian unit of
Deutsche Telekom AG, fell 1.7 percent to 454 forint. Magyar
Telekom and  Hungary ’s two other mobile service providers today
called on the government to withdraw a draft bill on a new
telecommunications tax and asked for talks to formulate a new
version that is “sustainable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
