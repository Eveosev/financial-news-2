Mologen AG (MGN)  said an experimental drug
slowed the spread of colorectal cancer more than placebo in a
mid-stage clinical trial. The shares rose the most in more than
six years.  The drug, MGN1703, helped patients survive twice as long
without the disease worsening than those who received a placebo,
the Berlin-based company said in a statement today.  Mologen will consult with regulators in the U.S. and the
European Union on steps needed for approval, the company said.
It expects to reach a licensing deal for the drug within a year,
Peter Huebner, a spokesman, said by telephone. MGN1703 activates
the immune system to fight cancer cells and tumor-associated
antigens released by the cells, the company said.  “These excellent results have even surpassed our own
expectations,” Chief Executive Officer Matthias Schroff said in
the statement. “They confirm the enormous potential of
immunotherapeutic concepts for the treatment of cancer.”  The shares rose 20 percent, the most since March 2006, to
11.40 euros in  Frankfurt .  In the so-called Impact study, patients whose cancer had
spread were given MGN1703 as a maintenance therapy or placebo
after standard first-line treatment, the company said. The risk
of tumor progression was less than half for those treated with
the drug compared to the placebo group. Today’s statement is an
initial assessment of data from the trial, Mologen said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
