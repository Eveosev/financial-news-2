EON AG plans to close three natural
gas plants in southern  Germany  in 2013 and 2014 even though
power shortages are foreseeable,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Irsching 3 in Bavaria and Staudinger 4 in Hesse, which have
a combined capacity of 1037 megawatts, will be closed next year
and Franken 1 in in the city of Nuremberg with a capacity of 383
megawatts will shut down the year after that, the German
newspaper said. The Bavarian economy ministry confirmed plans to
close plants, while not commenting on individual generators,
according to FTD.  In a report to the Federal Network Agency, E.ON cited the
plants as not being economical and is thus seeking compensation
that would exceed revenue from selling the electricity, FTD
said. The generators would then be made available to run in
emergencies, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
