Corn gained after last week’s decline
to a seven-month low boosted the appeal of the U.S. grain to
importers and investors. Wheat increased.  July-delivery corn rose as much as 0.9 percent to $5.86 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from the May 11
low of $5.7225, which equaled the intraday low for the most-
active contract on Oct. 3. It traded at $5.8125 at 3:01 p.m.
Singapore time, snapping three days of losses. Futures fell 6.3
percent last week, the most since the five days ended Jan. 13.  Exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest grower, sold
300,000 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations, including
60,000 tons for delivery by Aug. 31, and the rest for shipment
in the following 12 months, the Department of Agriculture said
May 11. Futures tumbled last week after the agency said May 10
that U.S. reserves may total 851 million bushels before this
year’s harvest, 12 percent more than analysts had expected.  “The fall in corn was dramatic,”  Michael Creed , an
agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank Ltd., said by
phone from  Melbourne  today. “That pace of decline tends to
stoke demand.”  Wheat for delivery in July gained as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.01 a bushel, after posting a second weekly loss in the five
days ended May 11. It last traded at $5.99 a bushel.  Soybeans for July delivery lost as much as 1.5 percent to
$13.8525 a bushel, the lowest price for the most-active contract
since March 30. It traded at $13.8525 after declining 4.9
percent last week, the biggest weekly loss for the most-active
contract since the five days ended Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
