Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (SFER) , an Italian
maker of $895 sandals, said it expects “significant” revenue
growth in 2012 after reporting first-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization climbed 40 percent to 38.2 million euros ($49.1
million), the Florence, Italy-based company said today in a
statement after markets closed. The average of six analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 37.7 million euros. Sales
rose 23 percent to 259.6 million euros.  Demand for Ferragamo’s shoes and other items is increasing
even as  China’s economy  slows and Europe’s debt crisis weighs on
 consumer spending . Tourists, mainly from China and Russia, are
fuelling growth in Europe, while African and Latin American
shoppers are buying more luxury goods, Chief Executive Officer
Michele Norsa said in an interview last week with Bloomberg
Television.  The quarterly sales “justify expectations for significant
growth also throughout 2012, in the absence of severely
unfavourable market conditions,” Ferragamo said in today’s
statement.  Ferragamo shares fell 1 percent to 17.10 euros today in
Milan trading, giving the company a market value of 2.88 billion
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
