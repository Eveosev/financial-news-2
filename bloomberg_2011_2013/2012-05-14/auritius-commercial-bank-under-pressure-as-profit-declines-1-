(Corrects to reflect SEMDEX fell in last paragraph.)  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the island
nation’s largest lender by market value, said third-quarter
profit fell 28 percent on credit impairments, adding the
European debt crisis may continue to affect the company.  Net income declined to 1.02 billion rupees ($34.76 million)
in the three months through March from 1.41 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Port Louis-based lender said in statement e-
mailed by Cim Stockbrokers Ltd. today. Net interest income, the
money banks earn from charges on loans, grew 12 percent to 1.64
billion rupees, it said. Allowance for credit impairments rose
more than threefold to 173.6 million rupees.  “The performance of the group is likely to remain under
pressure in the near term,” MCB, as the lender is known, said
in the statement, citing weak euro-zone economies, a volatile
 exchange rate  and “sluggish” investment.  For the nine months, net interest income advanced 11
percent to 4.84 billion rupees, it said. Excluding non-recurrent
gains, profit for the period reached 3.03 billion rupees,
“virtually unchanged” from a year earlier.  The  stock  has gained 0.6 percent this year to 168 rupees
compared with a 4.4 percent decline for the 38-member  SEMDEX
index (SEMDEX) , in which the lender has a 24.6 percent weighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
