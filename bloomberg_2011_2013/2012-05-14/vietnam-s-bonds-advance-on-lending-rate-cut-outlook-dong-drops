Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for a
19th day, the longest winning streak since July 2006, on
speculation  interest rates  will be lowered. The dong weakened.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam was asked to “speed up”
lending-rate cuts after inflation slowed, the government said on
its website May 9. Consumer prices climbed 10.54 percent in
April from a year earlier, the least since October 2010,
official data show. The central bank lowered its refinancing,
discount and repurchase rates by one percentage point each in
April.  “Yields dropped because investors are expecting the
central bank to cut interest rates by another one or two
percentage points,” said Tran Thi Thanh Thao, a fixed-income
analyst at Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co. in Hanoi.  The  yield  on five-year bonds fell eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 9.56 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest
level since August 2009.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,850 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the currency’s reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
