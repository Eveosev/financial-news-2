South Korea  asked the European Union
to extend an exemption for certain insurance contracts on
tankers carrying Iranian crude after July 1, when sanctions
start to prohibit the coverage.  The governments of South Korea and  Japan  are in talks with
the EU on the insurance rules for transporting Iranian oil, the
 Korean Ministry  of  Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The 27-nation EU in March agreed on a three-
month exemption for third-party liability insurance and
environmental-liability insurance.  The EU has joined the U.S. in strengthening sanctions on
Iran in an effort to curb the Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear
program. Insurers of almost all the world’s tankers follow EU
law, meaning that the planned insurance restrictions will have
an impact beyond the bloc. South Korea may suffer as it imports
almost all of its crude and the embargo on Iranian oil might
boost global prices, the ministry said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
