OAO Gazprom and Mitsui & Co.,
partners at the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project off
eastern  Russia , may build a gas-chemicals facility to process
fuels trapped in the remote region’s hydrocarbon reserves.  Gazprom announced a tender for a financial feasibility
study, according to  documents  posted on the website of its OOO
Gazprom Mezhregiongaz subsidiary. The study is due to be
completed by June 2013.  The Russian company, based in Moscow, and  Japan ’s Mitsui
have been discussing joint gas-chemicals projects in eastern
Siberia that involve separating components such as helium from
the natural gas produced in the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
