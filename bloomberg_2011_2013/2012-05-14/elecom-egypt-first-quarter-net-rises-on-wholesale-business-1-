Telecom Egypt , the country’s monopoly
fixed-line phone company, said first-quarter profit advanced 1.7
percent helped by growth in its wholesale business.  Net income  for the period that ended March 31 was 912
million Egyptian pounds compared with 897 million pounds ($149
million) a year earlier, the Cairo-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The average of  two analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was for a profit of 654 million pounds.  The company’s wholesale business, or services provided to
other operators who use its infrastructure, generated 57 percent
of  Telecom Egypt ’s total revenue, or 1.52 billion pounds. That’s
an increase of 32 percent from last year.  “The diversified nature of Telecom  Egypt ’s business has
helped mitigate the recent difficult macro situation the country
has been facing,” Cairo-based Pharos Holdings, which recommends
holding the stock, said in a research note today.  In the retail business, average monthly revenue per user
rose 4.2 pounds to 56.6 pounds. Users at the end of March fell
by about 63,000 to 7.9 million, of which 1.9 million were
subscribers to voice and data services, up from 1.8 million at
the end of 2011, Chief Executive Officer Tarek Aboualam said in
a telephone interview today.  “Whatever we’re losing in terms of customers are low-
end,” said Aboualam, adding the company is benefiting from the
addition of “high-value” customers.  The country’s telecom regulator is studying the terms under
which a mobile virtual network operator’s license can be issued
and results are expected in “a few months,” Aboualalm said.
The company plans to bid for the license when it’s offered,
allowing it to offer mobile phone services by using the network
of existing operators.  Telecom Egypt shares  fell 0.6 percent to 12.92 pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 22.1
billion pounds. The stock is down 2.2 percent this year,
compared with a 40 percent increase in the benchmark  EGX30
Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
