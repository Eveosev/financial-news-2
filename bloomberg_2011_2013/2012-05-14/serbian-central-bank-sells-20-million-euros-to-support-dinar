Serbia ’s central bank sold euros to
support the dinar as the currency weakened 0.4 percent against
 Europe ’s common currency to record-low levels.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 20 million
euros ($25.7 million) to “ensure the smooth functioning” of
the market, it said in a statement on its website.  The central bank steered the dinar off its lowest intraday
level of 112.7280 to the euro at 2:02 p.m. in Belgrade today,
with the currency ending the day at 112.5580 at 4:00 p.m. in
Belgrade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The central bank, which left the two-week repurchase rate
at 9.5 percent for a fourth month on May 10, has spent a total
of 783.5 million euros since the start of 2012 to prop up the
dinar. The currency has weakened 10.98 percent against the euro
compared with the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
