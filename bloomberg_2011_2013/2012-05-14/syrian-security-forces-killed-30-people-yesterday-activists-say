Syria  security forces killed 30
people yesterday, including three women, a child and two
soldiers who had defected, the opposition’s Local Coordination
Committees said in an e-mailed statement.  Gunmen shot and killed Abbas El-Lahham, a Shiite cleric,
outside the Sayyida Ruqqayya Mosque in Damascus, the Observatory
for Human Rights in Syria said in a separate e-mailed statement.  The two groups said Syrian troops pounded Homs, Hama and
Daraa with mortars and shells, while heavy gunfire was reported
in the suburbs of Damascus and Deir Ezzor yesterday.  From the start of the uprising, President Bashar al-Assad’s
government has blamed the unrest on Islamic extremists with
foreign backing -- which has been disputed by the U.S. as a
false justification for the government to use military force
against civilians.  The  United Nations  estimates more than 9,000 people have
been killed since the uprising began. Violence persists even
after the UN sent a team of monitors to the country and pledged
to send more. The observers aim to calm the fighting so that
talks can begin on implementing a peace plan drafted by envoy
 Kofi Annan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
