The election victory of  Armenia ’s
ruling coalition is credit positive as it “will ensure a degree
of political stability and policy continuity,” according to
analysts at Moody’s Investors Service.  “Key challenges for the new Armenian government lie in
managing the geo-politically sensitive region of Nagorny
Karabakh, over which Armenia and Azerbaijan are in disagreement,
and of the closed border with its neighbor country,  Turkey ,”
Lucie Villa and Aukse Montvilaite wrote in Moody’s weekly credit
outlook published today. “Governmental continuity in light of
these sensitivities is positive.”  Armenia is rated Ba2 with a negative outlook at Moody’s,
the second best junk rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
