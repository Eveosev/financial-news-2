The agency overseeing the reuse of
 London ’s Olympic stadium will extend the bidding for eight weeks
to allow interested companies and teams to make offers to use
the facility after this year’s games.  Any group that declared an interest last year can make an
offer to use the site in east London after the Olympics end in
August. Sixteen parties expressed an interest, although only
four bid, the London Legacy Development Corp said.  “The fundamentals have not changed and it remains our
intention to sign construction contracts for converting the
stadium at the end of October, with the intention of re-opening
in 2014 as previously announced,” Andrew Altman, chief
executive office of the legacy group said today in an e-mailed
statement. “This is a significant public asset and a 99-year
lease, and it is right that we take the time now to get the best
possible outcome for the stadium.”  The new timetable comes because of “a number of
clarifications” made to the proposal that may have convinced
some businesses not to bid, the legacy corporation said.  London organizers recommended in February 2011 a bid from
the east London-based West Ham United soccer club and the
borough of Newham over a joint attempt by Tottenham Hotspur and
AEG, a U.S.-based entertainment facility operator.  In October, the agreement to award the occupancy to the
Hammers, who had promised to keep the running track, collapsed
following a series of legal challenges from Tottenham and east
London soccer club Leyton Orient. Spurs wanted to make it a
soccer-only stadium and pay to refurbish a running center in
south London, but has gotten support for a new stadium in
Haringey, north London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
