Billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s Basic
Element, bidding for the Russian state’s 50 percent stake in
United Grain Co., said the terms of the privatization are “non-
transparent” and treat potential investors unequally.  Since bidding in March, Basic Element has received no
information on the terms or qualification criteria from Troika
Dialog, the bank managing the sale, it said today in a statement
handed to reporters in Moscow. The sale, to be effected through
a share issue, is “breaching the principles of free competition
and putting investors into unequal conditions,” it said.  Companies including port operator Summa Group, agricultural
producer  Ros Agro Plc (AGRO)  and billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s  AFK
Sistema (SSA)  applied for the tender. United Grain said in a statement
on May 5 that Troika Dialog would hold talks with bidders and
recommend an investor to the board by the end of the month.  A “share issue with closed subscription was recommended to
us by our investment consultant Troika Dialog, which has
tremendous experience in the financial markets,” United Grain
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Troika Dialog couldn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
