The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
declined for a second day, closing down 1.8 percent to 893.2.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest electricity company,
dropped 1.1 percent to 710 koruna, snapping two days of gains.
UBS AG added the company to its list of least-preferred stocks
today, citing losses on the company’s investment in Albania.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of Austria slid 4.5 percent
to 389 koruna, its lowest close in four weeks. Lenders were
among the biggest stock decliners in  Europe  as the region’s
financial crisis worsened with  Greece  failing to form a new
government.  Orco Property Group SA (ORCO)   slumped to a record low on
concern a proposed conversion of debt into equity will dilute
the share value. The developer in central Europe retreated 5.7
percent to 67.88 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
