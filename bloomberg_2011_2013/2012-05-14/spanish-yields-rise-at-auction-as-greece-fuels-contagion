Spain ’s borrowing costs rose at a
bill auction and an Italian debt sale failed to assuage concern
that the escalation of the Greek crisis risks overwhelming its
Mediterranean neighbors.  Spain sold 2.9 billion euros ($3.7 billion) of bills, just
below its maximum target, and offered the most since December to
lure investors as demand eased.  Italy  auctioned 5.25 billion
euros of debt, including its first bond of more than 10 years in
seven months, as the Treasury reached the maximum set for the
sale amid stronger demand.  Spanish bond yields rose to the most since December after
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government said it may inject
public funds into struggling lenders and data showed banks’
borrowings from the European Central Bank surged to a record 264
billion euros. As  Greece  entered a second week of political
deadlock, expectations grew that the country may leave the euro,
adding to the risk of contagion for Italy and Spain.  “It’s turning into a perfect storm: a loss of confidence
in the Rajoy government’s ability to stop the rot and, perhaps
more worryingly, renewed fears of a disorderly Greek exit from
the  euro zone ,” said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy. “Differentiation between Italy and Spain is
becoming less pronounced as the Greek crisis escalates.”  AAA Auctions  Spanish 10-year bond yields rose to 6.29 percent after the
auction from 6.219 percent before the sale, an increase of 33
basis points from the previous close on May 11. Italy’s 10-year
yield jumped 28 basis points to 5.75 percent, the highest since
Feb. 16 even with demand rising at the bond sale.  Investors asked for 1.52 times the amount of three-year
bonds on offer today, up from 1.43 times last month. The bid to
cover on the Italian 10-year bond sold today was 2.27 times,
while investors asked for 1.93 times the 2025 bond, the first
time the Treasury sold the bond since October.  Spain sold 12-month bills at an average rate of 2.985
percent, compared with 2.623 percent on April 17, the Madrid-
based Bank of Spain said. By contrast, AAA-rated  Germany  sold
3.3 billion euros of six-month bills at a rate of 0.0371 percent
and  Finland , which also has the top rating that Spain lost in
2009, sold five-year bonds at 0.872 percent.  France  auctioned
7.26 billion euros of 13-week and 50-week bills, paying 0.185
percent to borrow for almost one year.  Spanish Banks  Shares in Spanish banks tumbled today after the government
demanded an additional 30 billion euros of provisioning on real
estate lending on May 11 and estimated it would have to inject
less than 15 billion euros into struggling lenders. Spanish
banks have been the main buyers of government debt this year,
more than doubling their  holdings  in the four months through
March, according to Treasury data.  Those lenders borrowed a record 264 billion euros from the
 European Central Bank  in April, Bank of Spain data showed today.
The amount compares with 228 billion euros in March, following
the Frankfurt-based central bank’s two tenders of three-year
loans in December and February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
