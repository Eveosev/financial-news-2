Argentina has “deep concern” about
Spain’s decision to restrict biodiesel imports after the South
American nation took control of the local unit of  Repsol YPF SA. (REP)   The move will affect 10 percent of its biodiesel exports to
the European Union, Argentina’s Foreign Ministry said in a press
release on its website today. Argentina said it sent a letter to
EU Director General for Trade Jean-Luc Demarty.  Spain revised an incentive program last month to exclude
biodiesel produced outside Europe from meeting government
requirements for using renewable fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
