Hulamin Ltd. (HLM)  closed the Camps Drift
hot finishing mill until about June 11 after a parts failure.  “It is estimated that approximately 23,000 tons of
production will be lost,” the Pietermaritzburg, South Africa-
based maker of aluminium products said in a statement today.  A planned shutdown was moved forward to coincide with the
repairs and Hulamin will submit an insurance claim once losses
are worked out, it said.  Hulamin is seeking to boost rolled-product sales to about
250,000 metric tons in 2014 from 208,000 tons last year, when
net income rose 8.8 percent to 79.7 million rand ($9.8 million).  The company declined 1.5 percent to 6.65 rand by the close
of trading in Johannesburg, the lowest since Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
