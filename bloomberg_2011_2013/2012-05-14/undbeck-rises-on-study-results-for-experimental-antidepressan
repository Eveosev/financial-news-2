H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN)  rose the most in six
months after saying an experimental antidepressant showed
statistically significant results in three late-stage studies
that will support regulatory filings in the U.S. and  Europe .  The shares gained 8.8 percent, the biggest gain since Nov.
11, to 118.60 kroner in Copenhagen, where the company is based.
The drugmaker is developing the product with Japanese partner
 Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)   Data from the three studies showed LU AA21004 reduced
depression symptoms in a dose range from 10 milligrams to 20
milligrams, compared with placebo, the company said in a
statement today. Lundbeck, the Nordic region’s second-largest
drugmaker, needs new products to replace lost revenue from
antidepressant Lexapro, which goes off-patent in Europe in
mid-2014. It  plans  to submit applications for approval of LU
AA21004 in the U.S. and Europe this year. Annual sales for the
drug may reach as much as $2 billion, the company has said.  Out of 10 large, placebo-controlled trials trials completed
in patients, eight have shown that the drug is effective for
depression, Lundbeck said. The most common side effects were
nausea, headache, diarrhea and vomiting. Further analysis of the
data is expected to be presented at upcoming medical
conferences, the company said.  (A conference call will be held tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Copenhagen time. Investors will be able to listen in via a link
