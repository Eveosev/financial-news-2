Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s biggest
closely held company, plans to make an offer for shares of
Slovenia’s  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., Poslovni Dnevnik
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Agrokor is interested in purchasing 75 percent of
Mercator’s stock, plus one share, the Zagreb-based business
newspaper said, the ninth attempt by Agrokor to acquire the
Balkans’ largest retail chain, according to Poslovni.  Agrokor withdrew a bid for Mercator in February, saying the
protracted process was harmful to both companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
