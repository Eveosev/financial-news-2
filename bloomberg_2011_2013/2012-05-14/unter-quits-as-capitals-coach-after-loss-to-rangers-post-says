Dale Hunter resigned as coach of the
 Washington Capitals , two days after the team was eliminated by
the  New York Rangers  in the second round of the National Hockey
League playoffs.  Hunter, who joined the team as coach in November from the
Ontario Hockey League’s London Knights, “wanted to return to
his family” in Ontario, Capitals spokesman Sergey Kocharov said
in an e-mail.  Hunter’s move “wasn’t unexpected,” Capitals General
Manager George McPhee told the Washington Post.  Hunter, who played for the Capitals from 1987 to 1999,
guided the team to a 37-23-7 record after replacing the fired
Bruce Boudreau. The team upset the Boston Bruins, last season’s
Stanley Cup champions, in the first round of the playoffs before
losing to  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
