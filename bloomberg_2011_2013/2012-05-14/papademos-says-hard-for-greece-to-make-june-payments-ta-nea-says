The Greek state will find it
difficult to cover its payment needs in June,  Ta Nea  said citing
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  in a letter given to Greek
President Karolos Papoulias.  The withholding of 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) from the
May loan tranche from the European Union, the European Central
Bank and the  International Monetary Fund  and May 6 elections
stalling the tax collection process are putting pressure on the
stateâ€™s coffers the Athens-based newspaper reported, without
saying how it obtained the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
