Vestel Elektronik Sanayi & Ticaret
AS (VESTL) , a Turkish consumer electronics and home appliances
manufacturer, gained after saying first-quarter profit was 90.7
million liras ($50 million) in a filing for tax purposes only.  Vestel Elektronik added 0.5 percent to 2.07 liras at the
close in Istanbul, trimming a gain of as much as 7.3 percent.  Profit statements for tax purposes in Turkey are not
necessarily indicative of a company’s full earnings, which
comply with international accounting rules and are due to be
reported later this month. Vestel didn’t provide a comparable
figure for the first quarter of 2011 in its filing with the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
