Soybeans fell to the lowest in more
than six weeks on speculation that  Europe ’s worsening debt
crisis and slowing Chinese economy will curb demand for food,
feed and fuel made from the oilseed. Corn rose.  The dollar climbed to a three-month high versus the euro,
increasing costs for overseas buyers of U.S. grains and reducing
investor demand for commodities as a hedge against inflation.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. cut Chinese growth
forecasts after government reports last week showed industrial
production grew at the slowest pace since 2009 in April.  “Soybeans are trading lower on forecasts for slowing
global growth,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst for Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. “Speculators are dumping long positions
in soybeans.”  Soybean futures for July delivery declined 1.4 percent to
close at $13.87 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the fifth drop in six sessions. Earlier, the most-active
contract touched $13.76, the lowest since March 30.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to $5.83 a
bushel in Chicago. On May 11, the grain touched $5.7225, the
lowest since Oct. 3. Prices have fallen 9.8 percent this year as
U.S. farmers told the government in March they intend to plant
the most acres since 1937.  The U.S. was the largest producer and exporter of both
crops last year. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
