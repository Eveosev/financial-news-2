Hungary’s financial transaction tax,
to be introduced in 2013, will exempt interbank transfers from
the levy, according to the text of the proposal posted on
parliament’s  website .  The tax, which the government expects to yield 130 billion
forint ($575 million) a year in revenue, will affect corporate
and household bank transfers and be levied at a rate of 0.1
percent, according to the draft. Cash transfers initiated
through postal services will also be taxed while transactions
with securities will be exempt.  Hungary approved taxes on banking, telecommunications,
energy and insurance companies last week to allay European Union
concern that its budget is unsustainable and to retain next year
EU grants that the bloc partly froze in March. The government is
shifting levies toward consumption after the EU said it relied
on one-time measures to mask its  budget gap .  The government may consult with banks in the coming weeks
about the financial levy, Antal Rogan, the ruling Fidesz party’s
next parliamentary leader, told TV2 today.  The tax contravenes an agreement struck with banks last
year and threatens economic  growth  as it makes credit more
expensive, the Bank Association said on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
