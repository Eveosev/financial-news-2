Troika Dialog, the brokerage arm of
Russian state-run lender OAO Sberbank, said it hired bankers
from  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Renaissance Capital and Arma Partners in a
bid to challenge bigger rival VTB Capital.  Troika Dialog, based in Moscow, hired Steve Kale, David Theys and Dmitry Zubatyuk, the company said in a statement
today. Kale, who previously led Citigroup’s equity capital
markets origination team for Russia, joins as head of equity
syndicate group. Theys, who worked at London-based corporate
finance firm Arma Partners, joins as head of telecommunications,
media and technology sector. Zubatyuk, formerly at RenCap, joins
as a director for the oil and gas sector, according to the firm.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref , a former
economy minister, is seeking to turn what was once the Soviet
Union’s savings bank into a full-service financial firm that can
compete at home and abroad in areas from bond underwriting to
 stock trading . Troika Dialog plans to increase its staff of
about 100 bankers by about 40 percent this year,  Todd Berman ,
head of  investment banking , said in a Nov. 29 interview.  Troika last month hired Erwin Parviz as deputy head of
structured products and Dmitry Sredin, formerly chairman of
Renaissance Advisors, as a senior banker for its corporate
investment unit.  VTB Capital, created from scratch three years ago by VTB
Group, Russia’s second-largest bank, was the biggest organizer
of Russian debt sales last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Troika was third and Sberbank ranked fourth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
