Slowing loan growth may have
contributed to the Turkish central bank’s surprise decision to
resume funding at its lowest rate today, EFG Istanbul Securities
chief economist  Haluk Burumcekci  said.  The lira weakened 1.3 percent to 1.8070 at 12:50 p.m. in
Istanbul, the most this year.  “The recent outlook suggests that there is no need for
further monetary tightening with regards to loan trends, and
this could be one of the reasons for the central bank’s switch
to normal funding conditions,” Burumcekci said in a note to
clients today. “Total loans grew only 3.1 percent year-to-date,
compared to 9.7 percent in the same period last year.”  Central bank governor Erdem Basci has been alternating
funding rates to banks daily between a high of 11.5 percent and
a low of 5.75 percent. The bank offered 4 billion liras ($2.2
billion) of funding at the lower rate today for the first time
since May 3, ending the longest streak of tightening since Jan.
