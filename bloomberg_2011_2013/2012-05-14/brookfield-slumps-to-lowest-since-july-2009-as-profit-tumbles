Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) ,  Brazil ’s
fourth-largest homebuilder by revenue, fell to the lowest level
in almost three years as first-quarter profit fell 94 percent on
higher building costs and contract cancellations.  Shares  dropped  9.4 percent to 4.45 reais at 10:43 a.m. in
Sao Paulo after touching 4.44 reais, the lowest intraday price
since July 2009. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 2.4 percent.  “Results were weak,” analysts Guilherme Rocha, Daniel
Gasparete and Vanessa Quiroga of Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in
a report today. “Despite recognizing management’s efforts to
put the company on the right track, we find that there is still
potential for further cost overrun.”  Net income dropped after an increase in the number of
potential buyers who pulled out of contracts at the same time
that building and operational costs increased, Brookfield said
in a statement. Earnings decreased to 4 million reais
($2.01 million), from 65.8 million reais a year earlier,
trailing the 61.1 million reais average estimate of six analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey. Revenue dropped 8 percent to 672
million reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
