Taiwan ’s government bonds gained,
sending benchmark five-year yields to a two-month low, as
concern Greece will exit the euro spurred investor demand for
the safest assets. The local dollar weakened.  Global funds sold $1.5 billion more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought last week, cutting net purchases for this year to
$2.3 billion, according to exchange data. Taiwan’s exports
declined 6.4 percent in April from a year earlier, after a 3.2
percent drop the previous month, official data showed last week.
Economic growth slowed to 0.36 percent last quarter, the least
since a contraction in 2009.  “I’m bullish on bonds short-to-medium term as markets will
be risk-averse on  Europe ,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Taiwan’s economic
outlook is also supporting bonds.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 fell two basis points to 0.961 percent, the lowest level
since March 13, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.514 percent on May
11, the highest level since 2008.  A withdrawal by  Greece  from the euro “is not necessarily
fatal, but it isn’t attractive,” European Central Bank
Governing Council member  Patrick Honohan  said on May 12.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.3 percent to NT$29.502 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders
use to price options, rose 22 basis points to 4.52 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
