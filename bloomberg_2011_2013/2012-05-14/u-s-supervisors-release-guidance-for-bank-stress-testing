U.S. bank regulators released
guidance for firms with more than $10 billion in assets for
self-testing their portfolios against adverse economic
scenarios, emphasizing the role of “strong internal governance.”  “The guidance highlights the importance of stress testing
at banking organizations as an ongoing risk management practice
that supports a banking organization’s forward-looking
assessment of its risks and better equips it to address a range
of adverse outcomes,” the  Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency said today in a release in Washington.  The release is the final version of guidance that banking
regulators first requested comment on in June of 2011, 11 months
before  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  reported a $2 billion trading loss
that focused renewed attention on risk management at banks.  The guidance is separate from stress-testing requirements
in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
and the annual capital planning stress tests performed by the
Fed. Those requirements have been, or are being, put in place
through separate proposals, the regulators said.  The Fed completed annual tests in March. The central bank
said 15 of the 19 largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  could maintain
adequate capital levels even in a recession scenario in which
they continue paying dividends and buy back stock.  Risk Management  The agencies today said the release builds upon previously
issued guidance on the uses and merits of stress testing in
specific areas of risk management. The release outlines general
principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework,
describes various stress testing approaches, and outlines how
stress testing should be used at various levels within a firm,
the regulators said.  The guidance also discusses the importance of stress
testing in capital and liquidity planning and of “strong
internal governance and controls as part of an effective stress-
testing framework,” according to the release.  The agencies specified the new rules do not apply to
community banks, defined as those institutions with less than
$10 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
