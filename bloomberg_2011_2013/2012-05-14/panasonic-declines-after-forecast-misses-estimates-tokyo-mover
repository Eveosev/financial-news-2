Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Japan ’s biggest
appliance maker, fell to the lowest level in 34 years in Tokyo
trading after forecasting full-year profit that lagged behind
analyst estimates amid a slump in television demand.  Panasonic  declined  as much as 4.7 percent to 543 yen, the
lowest in intraday trading since January 1978, and traded at 553
yen as of 9:40 a.m. The Osaka-based company expects net income
of 50 billion yen ($624 million) in the year ending March 31, it
said in a May 11 earnings statement. That compared with the 106
billion yen average of 18  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg as of May 11.  The maker of Viera TVs joined Sony Corp. in predicting
profit that lagged behind estimates as global TV demand falls
and Japanese companies lose market share to South Korean
competitors Samsung Electronics Co. and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) 
Panasonic expects to recover from a record 772 billion yen loss
last year as sales rise 3.2 percent, it said in the statement.  The company’s sales-growth targets are “slightly
bullish,” Shunsuke Tsuchiya, a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG, wrote in a note to clients today. “As long as
Panasonic lacks any competitive advantage, downside risks
remain.”  The company forecast a 60 billion yen operating profit at
the audio-visual unit and a 3 billion yen profit at the energy
unit in the year that started in April.  TV Sales  Panasonic’s TV sales this year will decline to 15.5 million
units from 17 million units last year, the company said May 11.
The company will lose money from selling TVs this year, Tetsuya
Yoshimoto, a group manager at its accounting unit, told
reporters.  Global TV shipments last year fell for the first time in
six years because of excessive inventory in the U.S. and  Europe ,
and the end of Japanese government subsidies for purchases,
according to DisplaySearch, part of NPD Group. Shipments fell
0.3 percent to 247.7 million units, the researcher said.  Sony (6758) , Japan’s biggest electronics exporter, on May 10
forecast net income of 30 billion yen this fiscal year, lagging
behind the 61.4 billion yen estimate of analysts.  Sony, which also had a record loss last year, fell 1
percent to 1,124 yen in Tokyo trading.  Panasonic is promoting Kazuhiro Tsuga, its 55-year-old
chief of audiovisual products, to replace President Fumio Ohtsubo, 66, as the company tries to speed up reforms. Sony and
Sharp Corp. are also replacing top management as they struggle
to revive earnings.  Solar Cells, Batteries  Panasonic, founded in 1918, is trying to transform itself
into a leader in solar panels and rechargeable batteries. The
company has expanded its renewable energy businesses, including
solar panels and power-storage systems, since it  acquired  Sanyo
Electric Co. in 2008. It also merged last year with Panasonic
Electric Works, which makes lighting systems and electrical-
wiring fittings.  Ohtsubo said last year Panasonic will eliminate almost
17,000 jobs over two years in his second round of job cuts as
part of an overhaul to revive the manufacturer, which makes
products ranging from car TV sets and digital cameras to rice
cookers and refrigerators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
