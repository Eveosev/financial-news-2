Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. (8830) ,
 Japan ’s third-biggest developer, said full-year net income rose
4.6 percent helped by profit improvements at its office leasing
and housing businesses.  Net income gained to 53.2 billion yen ($665 million) in the
12 months ended March 31 from 50.9 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today. Sales fell 7.5 percent to 688.7 billion yen.  Operating profit at the leasing business, which accounts
for more than half of the total, rose 1.6 percent to 89.6
billion yen after the developer’s vacancy rate fell from the
highest since at least 2005 during the period. The vacancy rate
of Sumitomo Realty’s building portfolio dropped to 7.8 percent
as of March 31 from 8.2 percent a year earlier.  Sumitomo Realty forecast net income for the year ending
March 31, 2013 will gain 8.9 percent to 58 billion yen. Sales
will rise 4.6 percent to 720 billion yen in the current fiscal
year, according to the statement.  Sumitomo Realty’s  shares  rose 0.8 percent to 1,750 yen at
the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has
advanced 30 percent this year.  Operating profit for the company’s home sales business rose
13 percent last fiscal year as demand and low  interest rates 
supported the condominium market, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
