Francesca’s Holdings Corp. (FRAN) , a
Houston-based retailer of apparel and accessories, fired Chief
Financial Officer Gene Morphis for “improperly” communicating
company information through social media.  The company began an investigation after discovering his
activity on May 11, Francesca’s said today in a statement. A
search for a new CFO is underway. Cynthia Thomassee, controller
since 2007 and vice president of accounting since 2010, will
serve as interim CFO, Francesca’s said.  Francesca’s, which had its initial public offering last
year, operates about 300 locations and sells clothing and
accessories in a boutique-like setting. In March, the company
announced plans to add 76 stores this year.  The company today reported preliminary results for the
fiscal first-quarter that exceeded its forecast, citing better-
than-expected same-store sales. Earnings per share totaled as
much as 18 cents in the quarter ended April 28, up from the
maximum of 15 cents previously predicted. Analysts projected 15
cents, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Francesca’s  rose  6.6 percent to $25.61 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 48 percent this year.  The company is scheduled to report full results on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
