Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s biggest lender by market value, headed for the highest
level in more than five months on investor bets that it will
post increased third-quarter profit.  The  stock  advanced 1 rupee, or 0.6 percent, to 168 rupees,
set for the highest price since Nov. 25, by 11:25 a.m., in  Port
Louis , the capital.  “Investors are anticipating that the lender’s third-
quarter through March results would show an improvement,”
Kishen Nadassen, a senior research analyst at the city-based Cim
Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone interview.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s “resilient” economy is
expected to grow 3.6 percent to 3.9 percent this year, Finance
Minister Xavier Luc Duval told reporters in the capital today,
citing analysts’ forecasts.  MCB, as the lender is known, has a 24.7 percent weight in
the 38-member  SEMDEX (SEMDEX)  index. Listed companies have until May 15
to publish their earnings report for the three months through
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
