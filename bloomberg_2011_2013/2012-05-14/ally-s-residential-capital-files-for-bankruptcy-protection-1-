Residential Capital LLC, the
unprofitable mortgage company whose parent  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) 
is trying to repay a U.S. government bailout, filed for
bankruptcy and plans to sell most of its assets to  Fortress
Investment Group LLC. (FIG)   ResCap listed assets of $15.7 billion and debt of
$15.3 billion in a petition filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in  Manhattan . ResCap’s Chapter 11 filing is the biggest so far
this year, based on liabilities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The action by ResCap will enable Ally to achieve a
permanent solution to its legacy mortgage risks and put these
issues behind us,” Ally Chief Executive Officer Michael A. Carpenter said today in a statement. Ally said it also may sell
its international auto-finance and insurance operations to help
repay a $17.2 billion U.S. bailout.  Ally, a Detroit-based bank that specializes in  car loans ,
is 74 percent-owned by the  U.S. Treasury  after receiving the
bailout. In 2010, the Treasury failed to find a buyer for
ResCap, which originates and services residential mortgages.
Carpenter had said an initial public offering for Ally wouldn’t
happen without progress on a resolution for ResCap.  Fortress Sale  ResCap’s board voted to declare bankruptcy and arrange a
sale to Fortress and Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. for about
$2.3 billion, ResCap Chairman and CEO Thomas Marano, 50, said in
an interview. Nationstar, which is majority-owned by Fortress,
will buy a portfolio of servicing assets, as well as a mortgage-
origination unit, and business will continue uninterrupted, he
said. Mortgage servicers handle billing, collection and
foreclosures.  While in bankruptcy, ResCap will continue to originate new
home loans and service its existing 2.4 million consumer
mortgages, the company said. ResCap said it will try to exit
bankruptcy by the fourth quarter.  Ally agreed to pay $750 million to ResCap to settle any
claims against the parent company, purchase as much as
$1.6 billion of securities if others don’t, and provide
$150 million to help finance ResCap’s operations during
bankruptcy, according to a statement.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  will provide
$1.45 billion in financing to ResCap while the company is under
court protection, Marano said.  Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas is listed as the top
unsecured creditor, representing investors who hold six series
of notes issued in dollars, pounds and euros. The total value of
the claims is about $956.3 million, based on the May 11 exchange
rate, ResCap said in its bankruptcy petition.  Securities Litigation  The next 32 biggest claims were all related to active or
potential securities litigation. ResCap didn’t give a value for
the claims and said it disputes all of them.  In the weeks leading up to the filing, ResCap negotiated
with  bondholders  in an effort to create a so-called prepackaged
bankruptcy. When a majority of creditors who hold about two-
thirds of the amount of a company’s debt vote to support a
reorganization plan, the bankruptcy is considered prepackaged
and can win court approval quicker than normal.  ResCap’s plan has support from 37 percent of junior secured
creditors, according to court papers, below the threshold needed
for a prepackaged bankruptcy. Under the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code ,
creditors holding more than one-third of any single class of
ResCap’s debt can block the company’s reorganization proposal by
voting against it.  Missed Payment  ResCap missed a $20 million, semi-annual interest payment
April 17 on about $473 million in 6.5 percent notes due in 2013,
Ally said in a regulatory filing. The firm had 30 days before a
default, according to the filing. Deutsche Bank is the trustee
for the notes, according to court papers.  Carpenter 65, and Ally’s board had resisted the U.S.
Treasury’s call to break up and sell ResCap, people familiar
with the matter said in March. Elliott Management Corp., which
owns 2.3 percent of Ally, also pressed for a sale, saying in a
letter to the board that a ResCap bankruptcy filing would lead
to “radical value destruction.”  Bankruptcy would last 12 to 18 months and trigger billions
of dollars in so-called put-back claims, where holders of
mortgage-backed securities issued by ResCap try to force the
company to buy back soured loans backing the bonds, Elliott said
in the letter.  Morrison & Foerster LLP  is the  law firm  handling the
bankruptcy case. Centerview Partners LLC and  FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN) 
are ResCap’s financial advisers.  ‘Stronger Position’  The bankruptcy puts taxpayers “in a stronger position to
continue recovering their investment in Ally,” U.S. Treasury
Department Assistant Secretary Timothy Massad said in a
statement after the filing. ResCap “has continued to struggle
with losses from its old loans,” while Ally also has a
profitable auto-financing business and a growing retail banking
arm, he said.  ResCap has a preliminary agreement with a bondholder group
represented by White & Case LLP and is negotiating with other
claimants, said Marano, who also has served as CEO of Ally’s
mortgage division. Between $1 billion and $1.2 billion in
government-insured loans will be left in the ResCap estate as
part of the reorganization, he said.  The bankruptcy plan received conditional approval from the
Treasury, an Obama administration official said in early May.
The U.S. concluded that addressing ResCap’s mortgage losses
would put taxpayers in a better position to recoup their
investment in Ally, according to the official.  Dwindling Assets  Assets at ResCap, once one of the largest subprime mortgage
originators, dwindled to $15.7 billion at the end of the first
quarter from more than $130 billion in 2006. ResCap was involved
in 22 securities lawsuits, Carpenter said in November.  That month, ResCap hired Centerview to identify concessions
that would be needed from lenders to put the company on a firmer
financial footing before Ally pursues an IPO, people familiar
with the matter said at the time.  Ally had decided in June to postpone its planned share
sale, which was intended to raise as much as $7 billion and
shrink the government’s stake.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
