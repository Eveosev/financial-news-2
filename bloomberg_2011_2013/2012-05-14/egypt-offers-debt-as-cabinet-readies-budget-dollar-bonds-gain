Egypt  will offer 3 billion Egyptian
pounds ($497 million) of treasury bonds after the government
formed a committee to audit the planned budget for the fiscal-
year starting in July. Dollar bonds rose.  The Arab country will seek bids for 2 billion pounds of
three-year notes and 1 billion pounds of seven-year securities,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The average yields
on similar-maturity notes were at 16.16 percent and 16.91
percent, respectively, at their last auction two weeks ago.  Spending in next year’s budget is forecast at 538 billion
pounds, while revenue is projected at 377 billion pounds, the
state-run  Al Ahram newspaper  reported today, citing an
unidentified ministerial official. Egypt is aiming for a budget
deficit of between 8.6 percent and 8.8 percent of economic
output for next year, Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed said
last month. This year’s gap is likely to reach 9.4 percent, he
said in February.  Egypt relies on sales of domestic bills and bonds to
finance its debt. Yields have surged to the highest levels since
Bloomberg started tracking the data in 2006 after foreign
investors dumped the securities following the revolution that
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  in 2011.  Holdings of foreigners 
have plunged 93 percent to 3.8 billion pounds as of January from
a year-earlier, according to central bank data.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020
retreated two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.88
percent at 11:40 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Egyptian pound, subject to a managed float, was little
changed at 6.0392 a dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards were unchanged at 7.5 a dollar, the highest level since
Bloomberg started tracking them in 2007. That reflects
expectations for the currency to weaken 19 percent over the life
of the contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
