Gasoline slid to a three-month low on
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen, curbing fuel use,
after Greece failed to form a new coalition government and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party lost a key election.  Futures sank 1.4 percent as Greece headed toward a possible
exit from the euro area. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union
lost a regional election to the main opposition  Social
Democratic Party . Industrial output slowed in Europe and  China .  “The global economy is slowing, even China,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in  New York . “The elections in Europe are causing a
big level of uncertainty and fear the austerity measures that
have been negotiated are starting to unravel. It’s all a mess.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 4.18 cents to $2.959 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . That’s the lowest
settlement since Feb. 7.  The dollar rose as much as 0.7 percent against the euro to
the highest level in almost four months. A stronger dollar curbs
the investment appeal of commodities. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX) 
Index dropped 0.8 percent at 2:57 p.m. in New York.  Gasoline has lost 13 percent since reaching a 2012 high of
$3.4166 on March 26. In that same period, futures pared their
year-to-date gain to 10 percent from 27 percent.  “The market is under pressure due to signs of a slowing
economy in China and European sovereign debt concerns, starting
with Greece,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Greece, Germany  Greek President Karolos Papoulias failed to secure
agreement on a unity government as Greece’s biggest anti-bailout
party, Syriza, defied overtures to join the government
yesterday.  Merkel’s party loss in Germany’s most populous state helped
the  Social Democrats  tighten their grip on the country’s
regional governments and raised concern about austerity measures
supported by Merkel.  Production in the 17-nation euro area slipped 0.3 percent
in March from February, when it advanced 0.8 percent, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had forecast a gain of 0.4 percent, the median of 34
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. In the first
quarter, industrial output fell 0.5 percent.  China, India  In China, factory  production  grew 9.3 percent in April, the
least since 2009. Indian  inflation  accelerated in April, with
the benchmark wholesale-price  index  rising 7.23 percent from a
year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a
statement in  New Delhi  today.  “There’s no clarity anywhere,” said  James Cordier ,
portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida. “The
Chinese and Indian numbers were really weak, the Greeks can’t
decide what they want to order for lunch and Germany is showing
cracks. The stock market is falling and the dollar is strong.”  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.1
cent to $3.727 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. That’s the
lowest level since Feb. 27. Prices are down 20.9 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4. Gasoline peaked in
2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  June-delivery heating oil declined 3.41 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.9295 a gallon on the exchange, the lowest
settlement since Dec. 29. Prices have lost 0.2 percent this
year, after gaining 13 percent through Feb. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
