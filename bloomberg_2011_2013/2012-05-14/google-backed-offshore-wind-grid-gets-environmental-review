A $5 billion transmission line backed
by  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  that will distribute power
from offshore wind farms planned for the Atlantic coast will
proceed with a U.S. Interior Department environmental review.  “The first-of-its-kind Atlantic Wind Connection is an
encouraging sign of significant industry interest in developing
the infrastructure to support offshore wind development,”
Deputy Secretary of Interior David J. Hayes said today in a
conference call with journalists.  The line, which may transport as much as 7,000 megawatts,
would take 10 years to build, according to an Interior
Department statement. Atlantic Grid Holdings LLC’s proposed
corridor will distribute power from offshore wind farms to be
built along the shores between New Jersey and Virginia.  Investment in offshore wind will increase 44 percent to
$8.5 billion this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance. By 2020, about $55 billion will be spent on offshore
wind farms, compared with $84.7 billion for onshore projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
