Romania ’s natural-gas grid operator
 Transgaz SA (TGN)  said its profit fell 11 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier on rising costs and lower revenue.  Net income dropped to 173.5 million lei ($50 million) from
194.9 million lei a year earlier, the Medias, Romania-based
company said today in an earnings release sent to the  Bucharest
Stock Exchange .  The state-owned company’s revenue fell 0.5 percent to 472.2
million lei as it transported lower volumes of natural gas in
the first quarter, while expenses rose 7.4 percent from January
through March to 260.2 million lei, according to the statement.  “Total revenue fell short of the level reported in the
first quarter of last year by 2.4 million lei, mainly because
the company transported about 92 million cubic meters of natural
gas less than it did in the same period of last year,” Transgaz
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
