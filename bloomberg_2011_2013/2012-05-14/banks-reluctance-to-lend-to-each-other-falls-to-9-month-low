A money-markets indicator is
signalling that banks will become increasingly reluctant to lend
to one another amid the deepening euro debt crisis.  Predictions in the forward market for the three-month euro
interbank offered rate relative to overnight indexed swaps,
known as the  FRA/OIS spread , widened six basis points to a
three-month high of 42.5 basis points at 1:45 p.m. in London
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure was 37 on May 11.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.689 percent from 0.690 percent.
The measure hasnâ€™t increased for 100 consecutive days. One-week
Euribor rose to 0.318 percent from 0.317 percent.  The  Euribor-OIS spread  was 37 basis points from 38 on May
11. The measure fell to the lowest level since Aug. 1.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars rose for the second day. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap  was 47 basis points below Euribor from minus 45 on
May 11. The one-year basis swap was 60 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 55. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  on May 11, placing 763 billion euros ($983
billion) with the bank from 703 billion euros the day before.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.466 percent from 0.467 percent. The
three-month dollar FRA/OIS spread was 47 basis points from 43 on
May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
