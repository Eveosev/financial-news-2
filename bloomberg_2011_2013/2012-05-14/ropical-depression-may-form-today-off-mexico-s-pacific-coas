Thunderstorm activity increased
overnight near the center of a low pressure area about 580 miles
south of  Mexico ’s Pacific coastal resort of Manzanillo, the
National Hurricane Center said today from Miami. If the
development intensifies, a tropical depression may form later in
the day as the storm moves slowly northwestward, the NHC said on
its website. It gave the system an 80 percent chance of becoming
a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.  The eastern Pacific hurricane season begins tomorrow while
the Atlantic season lasts from June 1 through November. The NHC
said storm activity associated with a non-tropical low west-
southwest of the Azores Islands has diminished with just a 20
percent change of it becoming a cyclone in the next two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
