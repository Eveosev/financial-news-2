Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the
Munich-based Ifo economic institute, said supplying southern
European countries with continued, cheap, public credit will
lead to a infirmity if not to a complete economic collapse in
Europe,  Handelsblatt  said.  When the euro region becomes the central administrator with
 investment management  carried out by the state, the system can’t
work because it prevents the  capital market  from being the
important economic driver, Sinn wrote in a guest commentary in
the German newspaper.  The European Central Bank is causing private capital to
flee countries such as Italy and Spain because it offers cheap
credit, Sinn wrote in Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
