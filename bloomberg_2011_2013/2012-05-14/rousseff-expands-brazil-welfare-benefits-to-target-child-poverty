Brazil  will increase benefits for the
Bolsa Familia social welfare program by boosting payments to
families with young children and expanding access to day care
and health care, President  Dilma Rousseff  said in a radio and
television address yesterday.  Each family below a certain income level will receive a
minimum stipend from the government of 70 reais ($35) per month
for each child aged 0 to 6, Rousseff said in a Mother Dayâ€™s
speech broadcast yesterday evening.  The government will also increase access to day care and
fight anemia, vitamin A deficiency and asthma by expanding
health insurance, she said.  The Bolsa Familia program today reaches about 13.4 million
families who receive benefits of 32 reais to 306 reais per
month, depending on their monthly income and number of children
up to age 17. Last year, the Rousseff government spent 17.3
billion reais on the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
