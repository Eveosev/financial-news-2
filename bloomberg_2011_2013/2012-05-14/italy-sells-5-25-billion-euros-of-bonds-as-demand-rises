Italy  sold 5.25 billion euros of
debt, including a bond with a maturity longer than 10 years for
the first time in seven months, as concern eased about Italy’s
ability to finance the region’s second-biggest debt.  The Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of its 3-
year benchmark bond to yield 3.91 percent, little changed from
the 3.89 percent on April 12 and matching the maximum amount set
for the auction.  Italy also sold 651 million euros of a 5 percent 2022 bond
at 5.66 percent and auctioned 557 million euros of bonds due in
2025, the longest-maturity debt sold since October, at 5.9
percent. The Treasury also auctioned 542 million euros of a 2020
bond at 5.33 percent, bringing the total for the sale to 5.25
billion euros, matching the maximum target.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is implementing 20 billion euros
in spending cuts and tax increases to erase the budget gap and
trim a 1.9 trillion-euro debt. The austerity coupled with the
 European Central Bank ’s unlimited three-year loans helped bring
down 10-year borrowing costs by more than 2 percentage points
between his appointment in November and early March. Bonds have
now given back some of those gains as mounting concern about
 Spain ’s ability to tame its deficit increased contagion.  Spain sold 2.9 billion euros of one-year and 18-month
bills, just below the maximum target for the sale, and its
borrowing costs rose at an auction today.  At the Italian sale, investors bid for 1.52 times the
amount of three-year bonds on offer, up from 1.43 times last
month. The bid to cover on the 10-year bond was 2.27 times,
while investors asked for 1.93 times the 2025 bond.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond was up 18 basis points to
5.69 percent after the auction at 11:30 a.m. in  Rome , pushing
the difference with similar-maturity German debt to 424 basis
points, the highest since Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
