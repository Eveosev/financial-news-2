Germany ’s financial regulator Bafin
wants to boost the number of Germans serving at European
regulatory agencies, Financial Times Deutschland reported,
citing an interview with Bafin chief Elke Koenig.  Bafin will try to place more of its own people at the
international regulatory authorities including the European
Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets
Authority, the newspaper cited Koenig as saying in a preview of
