Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the Persian
Gulf country’s second-biggest company by market value, raised
its targets for profit and revenue growth in a five-year plan.  The  producer  of petrochemicals, fertilizer and steel
forecasts net income to climb to 8.3 billion riyals ($2.3
billion) this year, 3.7 billion riyals more than predicted by
the company in December, Industries Qatar said in the e-mailed
report today.  Profit will climb to 9.7 billion riyals in 2013, 10.2
billion riyals in 2014, 11.1 billion riyals in 2015 and 11.3
billion riyals in 2016, the company said. Revenue will increase
to 23.7 billion riyals in 2016 from 18.3 billion riyals this
year. Industries Qatar forecasts the price of its feedstock
natural gas prices will rise more slowly than the prices for
some of its products, such as low-density polyethylene and urea,
according to the report.  Industries Qatar is utilizing the world’s third-largest
natural gas reserves to increase output and diversify the
Persian Gulf emirate’s economy away from raw petroleum exports.
The company said it has 5 billion riyals earmarked for capital
expenditure and plans to start a low-density polyethylene plant
in the second quarter of this year and a new fertilizer plant in
the third quarter.  The company’s assets will rise to 75 billion riyals by
2016, according to the report. Debt will fall with total loans
owed dropping to 3.9 billion riyals from 6.9 billion riyals last
year, according to the plan.  Industries Qatar’s net income fell to 1.9 billion riyals in
the first quarter from 2.1 billion riyals a year earlier, the
company said April 19.  The  company’s stock  fell 1.7 percent to 139.5 riyals on the
Qatar Exchange today. Shares have climbed 4.9 percent this year
compared with a 3.3 percent decline for the QE Index of Qatari
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
