Absa Group Ltd., (ASA)  the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , reversed its decision to cut
140 technology jobs by June, labor union Solidarity said.  “Absa’s announcement that the notices will be withdrawn is
a big step in the right direction,” Dirk Hermann, deputy
general secretary of Pretoria-based Solidarity, said in an e-
mailed statement today. “The withdrawal of the retrenchment
notices amounts to a tactical victory, but the final battle has
not been won yet.”  Absa said in March a reorganization to improve efficiency
may cause job losses. Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank by
assets, is seeking to reduce costs after net income fell 16
percent in 2011. Absa, which is integrating its technology with
the U.K. lender, said in February its full-year profit rose 19
percent to 9.67 billion rand ($1.18 billion) and reported a
cost-to-income ratio of 55.5 percent, the second-lowest of  South
Africa ’s four largest banks.  Solidarity represents about 350 of Absa’s estimated 30,000
employees. Sasbo, a separate union, has about 20,000 members at
the lender.  “Absa confirms it has temporarily withdrawn notices of
retrenchment to some impacted employees in its IT business
unit,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
