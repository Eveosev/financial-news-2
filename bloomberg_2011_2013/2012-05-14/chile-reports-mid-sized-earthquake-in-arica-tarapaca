Northern  Chile  suffered a medium-
sized earthquake in the regions of Arica and Tarapaca that
caused some power failures and evacuations along coastal areas,
the government reported.  The University of Chile’s seismology service reported the
magnitude at 6.4 and the U.S. Geological Survey said it was 6.2.
The quake hit at about 6 a.m. local time 1,084 miles north of
Santiago at a depth of 61.1 miles, the  USGS said  on its website.  The quake doesn’t pose a tsunami threat and residents of
Arica returned home after an evacuation, the government’s
emergency service known as Onemi said in a statement on its
website. While the temblor caused some power outages, other
basic services and infrastructure remain intact, Onemi said.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ’s Collahuasi copper mine
in northern Chile is operating normally, the mine’s
communications department said in an e-mailed response to
questions. State-owned copper company Codelco didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail and telephone call from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
