Shutterstock Inc., the online seller
of stock photos and images, filed to raise $115 million in a
U.S. initial public offering.  Shutterstock applied to list on the  New York  Stock Exchange
under the symbol SSTK, according to a regulatory filing today.
The New York-based company didn’t say how many shares it’s
offering or at what price. The $115 million is a placeholder
used to calculate registration fees and may change.  Shutterstock generated revenue from more than 550,000
active users in 2011 and has a library of more than 19 million
images for sale, the filing shows. The site collects pictures
from contributors, who receive fees when their material is
downloaded by paying customers.  The company, led by Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Oringer, posted $120.3 million in sales last year, a 45 percent
increase. Net income rose 15 percent to $21.9 million, its
filing shows.  Oringer is Shutterstock’s largest shareholder, and Insight
Venture Partners also has a stake, the filing shows, without
specifying percentages. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and
Jefferies Group Inc. are leading the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
