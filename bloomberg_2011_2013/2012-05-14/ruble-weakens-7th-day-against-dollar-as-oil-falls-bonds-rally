The cost of insuring Russian debt
against nonpayment over five years with credit default swaps
jumped the most this year and the ruble depreciated for a
seventh day as oil, the country’s main export, declined.  Five-year Russian default swaps climbed 17 basis points, or
0.17 percentage point, to 225 basis points, poised for the
biggest daily gain since Dec. 6. The ruble lost 0.6 percent to
30.4075 per dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest
since Jan. 30.  Brent crude  dropped 1.3 percent to $110.82 per barrel after
Saudi Arabia’s petroleum minister said the oil blend should
trade at about $100 a barrel.  Greece  failed to agree on a unity
government and officials in Europe considered the nation’s
possible exit from the euro, a sign demand for the commodity in
Europe may decline. The European Union is  Russia ’s largest
trading partner.  “There is ample room for a violent correction in the
period ahead, especially if the oil price continues to go
south,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-markets strategy at
Societe Generale SA in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note. “The
ruble has so far been relatively immune to the general sell-off
in  Europe , the Middle East and  Africa , but this will probably
not last long.”  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing it at 30.8638 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 30.6070 per dollar on May
11. The Russian currency was little changed at 39.055 per euro
and lost 0.3 percent to 34.2989 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due 2015 fell for a fifth
day, increasing the yield by two basis points to 2.216 percent.
Similar-maturity dollar-denominated bonds issued by OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded three basis points
more than on May 11 at 3.47 percent, while the yield on state
gas monopoly OAO Gazprom’s 2015 Eurobonds fell one basis point
to 3.513 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
