Turkey  is tightening rules for
mandatory earthquake insurance, making the government decree a
law and limiting services to homeowners without protection,
Hurriyet reported.  Beginning in August, it won’t be possible to sign up for
electricity, gas or water services without a disaster-insurance
policy, said Selamet Yazici, president of the  Turkish
Catastrophe Insurance Pool , according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper. The measure should help increase policy holders to 10
million from 3.8 million within five years, Yazici said.  Turkey will bar people without the insurance from getting
mortgages and rebuilding aid from the state if their homes are
damaged in an earthquake, Yazici said, Hurriyet reported. The
law, adopted 12 years after the government mandated the disaster
insurance with a decree following a 1999 earthquake that killed
tens of thousands of people, will also expand the TCIP’s areas
of responsibility to include other natural disasters, Yazici
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
