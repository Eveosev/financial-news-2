The shekel weakened to the lowest in
four months as demand for riskier assets waned on concern a
worsening fiscal crisis in Europe may slow  Israel ’s economic
growth.  The shekel dropped 0.4 percent to 3.8323 a dollar at 11:20
a.m. in Tel Aviv. It earlier fell to 3.8357, the lowest since
Jan. 17 and is down 1.8 percent this month, the second-best
performer among the 10 most-active currencies in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  Dollar Index (DXY)  gained for an 11th day as the European debt
crisis boosted demand for safer assets.  Greece ’s political deadlock looked set to continue as
President Karolos Papoulias prepared for another day of
discussions with political party leaders on forming a national
unity government. The standoff has reignited concern the country
will renege on pledges to cut spending and leave the euro area.
Israel exports almost 60 percent of its goods to the euro region
and the U.S.  “The shekel is losing its attractiveness on the back of a
slowing global economy and uncertainty about the European debt
crisis, which is affecting Israel’s export-driven economy,”
said Adiv Kabiri, senior currency dealer at Gift Asset
Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “In case the crisis in  Europe 
deteriorates the  Bank of Israel  may decide to lower  interest
rates  to boost growth.”  Exports Slow  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark bonds due January
2022 retreated for a second day, falling two basis point, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.51 percent. The Finance Ministry
plans to sell a combined 1.65 billion shekels ($431 million) of
debt at an auction today. It will offer 250 million shekels of
the 2022 bonds and 350 million shekels of inflation-linked bonds
due May 2017.  Exports fell in April to the lowest level since December
2010, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said
yesterday. The economy will expand an annualized 2.5 percent in
the first quarter, according to the median estimate of 11
economists  surveyed by Bloomberg . The data is due to be released
on May 16.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell two basis points to
2.45 percent. The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference
between inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds
of similar maturity, dropped four basis points to 282, implying
an average annual inflation rate of 2.82 percent.  The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds retreated less
than 0.1 percent to 265.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
