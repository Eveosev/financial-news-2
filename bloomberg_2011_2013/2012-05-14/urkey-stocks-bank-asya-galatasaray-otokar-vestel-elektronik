Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 1.7 percent to 57,853.86 at the close in Istanbul,
declining for the first time in three days.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB)  , an Islamic bank, slid
5.1 percent to 1.69 liras, its biggest loss since Nov. 21. The
bank is waiting for “the right market conditions” to issue
$300 million of sukuk bonds as “unfortunately things are not
good abroad,” Chief Executive Abdullah Celik said in an
interview today.  Otokar Otomotiv & Savunma Sanayi AS (OTKAR)  , a producer
of buses and military trucks, rose 1.4 percent to 30 liras after
saying it received a contract for armored vehicles worth about
39.5 million liras ($21.9 million).  Vestel Elektronik Sanayi & Ticaret AS (VESTL)  , a
consumer electronics and home appliances manufacturer, gained
0.5 percent to 2.07 liras, trimming a gain of as much as 7.3
percent in the day, after saying in a filing for tax purposes
only that its first-quarter profit was 90.7 million liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
