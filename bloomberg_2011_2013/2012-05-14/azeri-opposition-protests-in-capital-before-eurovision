Scores of opposition members
demonstrated in the Azeri capital of Baku, which hosts the
Eurovision song contest next week, against President  Ilham Aliyev  and for the release of imprisoned dissidents.  Law-enforcement officers clashed with the protesters,
preventing them from marching toward the city mayor’s office and
detaining 18 of theme, the Baku police said in an e-emailed
statement today.  Opposition parties are seeking to seize the media spotlight
before the Eurovision event, the world’s most-watched singing
contest. Azerbaijan, a Muslim nation of 9 million, is the third-
largest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union  after Russia and
Kazakhstan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
