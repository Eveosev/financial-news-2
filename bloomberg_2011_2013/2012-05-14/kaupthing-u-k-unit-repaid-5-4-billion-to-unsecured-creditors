Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, the
U.K. unit of Icelandic bank  Kaupthing Bank hf , has repaid 3.36
billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of the 4.6 billion pounds owed to
unsecured creditors.  The eighth payment, made on May 2, means creditors have
received 73 pence for every pound loaned to the bank, Singer &
Friedlander Asset Management, which was hired by administrators
Ernst & Young LLP to manage the bank’s assets, said in a
statement today.  Ernst & Young estimates unsecured creditors may recover
between 81 pence and 86 pence by the time the company is fully
wound up, it said in an  April report . Another payment may be
made in the final three months of the year, it said. Ernst &
Young’s Patrick Brazzill, Maggie Mills, Tom Burton and Alan Bloom were appointed to manage the firm in October 2008, after
the island’s biggest lenders defaulted on about $85 billion in
debt.  U.K. creditors include the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme, a government-backed, industry-funded program that pays
out when companies go bust; the U.K. Treasury and the charity
Cats Protection League, Singer & Friedlander said.  The Financial Times reported the story earlier today.  -- Editors: Jon Menon,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
