Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  climbed in
Zurich trading after Vontobel Holding AG upgraded the stock and
said recruitment at the Swiss private bank could lead to inflows
of client money.  “We believe the bank has increased its number of client
advisers materially since the beginning of the year,”  Teresa Nielsen , an analyst at Vontobel, said in an e-mailed note today.
Recruiting 40 to 50 relationship managers will bring in new
money and help offset outflows from European clients, she said.  Net new money should remain positive when the bank
publishes an interim statement tomorrow, said Nielsen, who
raised her rating on the stock to hold from reduce.  Julius Baer rose as much as 2.6 percent and was up 0.8
percent to 34.07 Swiss francs as of 4:27 p.m. in Zurich, making
the stock the best performer on  Switzerland ’s benchmark SMI
index, which fell 1.6 percent. The Swiss private bank also
posted second-biggest gain on the 43-company Bloomberg Europe
Banks and Financial Services Index, which slumped 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
