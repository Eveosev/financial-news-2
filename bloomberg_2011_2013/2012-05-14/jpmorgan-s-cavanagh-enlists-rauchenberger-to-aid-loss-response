JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  executive Mike
Cavanagh, appointed to oversee the firm’s response to a $2
billion trading loss, enlisted Lou Rauchenberger to help
coordinate the project.  “He’ll be the point person organizing the meetings,
structure and follow up,” Cavanagh, the chief executive officer
of the bank’s treasury and securities services group, wrote in a
memo to employees today. Rauchenberger works in that division
and is on the firm’s executive committee, according to the New
York-based bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
