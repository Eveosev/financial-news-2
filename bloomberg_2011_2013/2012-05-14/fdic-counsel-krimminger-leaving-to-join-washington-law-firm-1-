Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
General Counsel  Michael Krimminger , a senior adviser to former
Chairman  Sheila Bair  during the 2008 financial crisis, is
leaving the agency to become a partner in the law firm of Cleary
Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in Washington.  Krimminger, 54, worked in several roles at the FDIC since
1991, including as Bair’s deputy for policy before becoming the
top lawyer for the agency, which oversees depository
institutions. After he leaves on May 25, his deputy, Richard Osterman, will fill in as acting general counsel while the FDIC
decides on a replacement, the agency said in a statement today.  “Mike has been instrumental in developing major policy
initiatives during the most challenging time in the FDIC’s
history, including the FDIC’s new Orderly Liquidation Authority
under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act,” Acting Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said in a statement.  Cleary’s 191 equity partners earned an average $2.7 million
in 2011, according to estimates by the American Lawyer
newspaper. That’s about 10 times the highest salary at the FDIC.  Krimminger said in a statement that he looks forward to
working at Cleary “during this time of unprecedented regulatory
change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
