Dubai Creek, the waterway that
divides the emirate, is to be developed at a cost of 600 million
dirhams ($163 million), enabling almost 400 large dhows and
ships to anchor, The National reported, citing Hussain Lootah,
the municipalityâ€™s director general.  The waterway will be deepened, a three-kilometer wharf will
be built and the stalled Business Bay canal project will also be
revived, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
