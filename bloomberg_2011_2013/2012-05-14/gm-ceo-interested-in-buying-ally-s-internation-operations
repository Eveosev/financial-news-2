General Motors Co. (GM)  is interested in
acquiring  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) ’s international operations, the
chief executive officer of the world’s top-selling automaker
said.  “We’re interested in it, but we’re not going to bleed to
buy it,” GM CEO Dan Akerson said in an interview today at
Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “We’re the natural buyer.”  As part of Ally’s announcement today that it was putting
its ResCap mortgage subsidiaries in Chapter 11 reorganization,
the Detroit-based bank said it was also beginning the process of
exploring “strategic alternatives for its international
businesses.”  Ally is seeking to divest more than $30 billion of assets
in  Canada  and Mexico as well as in  Europe  and  South America ,
Ally CEO Michael Carpenter said in an interview. The sales may
allow Ally to repay two-thirds of the government rescue that
left the U.S. Treasury Department with a 74 percent stake, he
said.  GM had owned Ally’s predecessor, GMAC, until 2006, when GM
sold 51 percent of it to Cerberus Capital Management LP.  “They have not been as robust as we quite frankly wanted
internationally,” Akerson said. “But they have the
infrastructure there, and they have the distribution channels
there, which would facilitate our move into it reasonably
quickly.”  GM is “probably not” interested in Ally’s U.S. operations
because the automaker has already turned over lending to  Wells
Fargo & Co . in the western part of the U.S., Akerson said.
“That works fine,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
