Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) ,  Mexico ’s largest
construction company, fell the most in more than seven months
after Puebla’s state government voided a highway-building
contract for toll-road and airport operator  OHL Mexico SAB. (OHLMEX*)   OHL tumbled 6.7 percent to 17.40 pesos at the close today,
while Mexico City-based ICA dropped 7.7 percent to 22.14 pesos
for the largest decline since Sept. 22.  OHL disclosed the loss of the Puebla contract on May 10,
and its 14 percent plunge in the past two trading days was the
largest since the Mexico City-based company first sold shares in
November 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect this action to lead the market to reassess the
stock’s risk profile, which in our view is high,” Marcos Duran,
a Scotia Capital analyst in Mexico City, wrote in a May 11
report on OHL. Duran, who  rates  the shares as sector
underperform, said the Puebla contract to build and operate the
highway was the “company’s least-valuable” concession.  Luz Montemayor, a spokeswoman for ICA, attributed the
share-price decline to “market conditions” and said the
company was expecting “a very solid year.” ICA said May 2 that
it expects 2012 sales growth of 11 percent to 14 percent.  “Our portfolio of infrastructure operation and
construction contracts supports our expectation of maintaining a
dynamic of growth and profitability during 2012,” Montemayor
said.  A spokesman for OHL didn’t return a telephone message and
an e-mail message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
