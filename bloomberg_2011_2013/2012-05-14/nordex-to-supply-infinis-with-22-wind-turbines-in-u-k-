Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, won five contracts to supply projects in the U.K.,
including Scotland.  Nordex’s contracts came from Infinis Plc, an  investment
company  owned by Guy Hands’s Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
the Hamburg-based turbine maker said today in a website
 statement . Nordex is supplying Infinis with 22 turbines, 10 of
them to be installed at two projects in Scotland, and the rest
across three wind farms in England. Construction will commence
later this year, and the facilities should start working by
March, according to the statement.  The U.K. is targeting 15 percent of its energy to come from
renewable sources by 2020, with Scotland seeking all of its
energy from clean power by the same year.  Scotland  gets about 35
percent of its power now from clean energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
