LightSquared Inc. filed for
bankruptcy, saying it will seek to resolve the concerns of U.S.
regulators who thwarted the company’s plan to deliver high-speed
wireless to as many as 260 million people.  LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, listed assets of
$4.48 billion and debt of $2.29 billion as of Feb. 29 in a
Chapter 11 filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The filing followed intense negotiations with
creditors, who had requested that the company’s backer,  Philip Falcone , step aside. Falcone and the current management team
will remain with the company,  Terry Neal , a LightSquared
spokesman, said yesterday.  Bankruptcy “is intended to give LightSquared sufficient
breathing room to continue working through the regulatory
process that will allow us to build our 4G wireless network,”
Chief Financial Officer Marc Montagner said in a statement.
Reaching agreements with U.S. agencies may take as long as two
years, he said in court papers.  Harbinger Capital Partners, Falcone’s New York-based hedge
fund, had invested about $3 billion in LightSquared and owned
about 74 percent of it as of Jan. 27. Falcone also had served on
LightSquared’s board. Creditors asked for Falcone’s departure
when they gave the company a weeklong extension on April 30 to
stave off a default and keep trying to renegotiate its debt,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  LightSquared’s bankruptcy underscored tensions between the
Federal Communications Commission and the telecommunications
business, which is seeking more flexibility in how it uses
airwaves.  AT&T Inc. (T)  Chief Executive Officer  Randall Stephenson 
has blamed the FCC for not acting quickly enough to approve the
acquisition and use of spectrum, creating a logjam for the
industry.  ‘Quick Profit’  Yesterday’s bankruptcy filing wasn’t an “option the
company embraced quickly or easily, but it was necessary to
protect LightSquared against creditors who were looking for a
quick profit,” Falcone said in a statement. “We remain
committed to our original mission, and I remain steadfast in my
belief that a path forward exists that will satisfy and benefit
all constituencies.”  LightSquared last week received a second weeklong extension
from creditors, delaying a potential bankruptcy, a person with
knowledge of the matter said at the time. Bondholders, including
 Carl Icahn ,  Andrew Beal  and  David Tepper  earlier gave Falcone a
deadline of April 30 to revisit a waiver that avoided triggering
a technical default on its debt.  Icahn sold his $250 million in LightSquared debt holdings,
Reuters reported May 6. Icahn received about 60 cents on the
dollar for the holdings on May 3, after originally paying about
40 cents on the dollar months earlier, Reuters said, citing
unidentified sources.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  Chairman  Charlie Ergen ,
meanwhile, acquired $350 million of the debt, the  New York  Post
reported.  FCC Approval  Falcone’s plan for LightSquared depended on winning
FCC approval to convert airwaves originally designated for
satellite service to spectrum for land-based radio towers.
LightSquared invested $4 billion in airwaves and reached deals
with more than 30 partners, including  Best Buy Co. (BBY)   LightSquared hit a roadblock in February when the FCC said
it would withdraw preliminary approval for the company’s network
after government tests found that the signals would interfere
with global-positioning systems.  The decision followed a yearlong lobbying fight between
LightSquared and GPS users and providers. The Coalition to Save
Our GPS, a group formed to oppose LightSquared’s plans, included
package shippers  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ,
GPS-unit maker  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  and farm-gear maker  Deere & Co. (DE)   Falcone said April 4 that he was considering bankruptcy for
LightSquared, though he would rather get the government to swap
his spectrum for that controlled by the U.S. Defense Department.  ‘Continue Our Vision’  A voluntary filing would provide time to “continue with
our vision, build the network and protect the company from
creditors who are more interested in a quick flip,” Falcone
said in an April 5 statement.  The company’s Canadian and Bermudan affiliates also filed
for court protection yesterday. LightSquared employed 168 people
in the U.S. and Canada, according to court papers. The company
said its satellite business, with 300,000 users, generated
revenue of about $30 million a year.  LightSquared’s biggest unsecured creditors include Boeing
Satellite Systems Inc., owed $7.5 million, and Alcatel-Lucent,
owed $7.3 million.  Debt includes $322.3 million outstanding on a term loan
with U.S. Bank NA as agent and $1.7 billion outstanding under a
credit facility with  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Wilmington Trust FSB as agents.  Harbinger Investment  Harbinger’s main hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners
Master Fund I, had $1.07 billion invested in LightSquared’s debt
and equity as of Jan. 27, according to documents seen by
Bloomberg News. The documents detailed a $190 million loan
Harbinger took from securities firm Jefferies Group Inc. on Jan.
30 while it still awaited news from the FCC.  Harbinger’s $190 million loan, made at a 15 percent
interest rate, was almost triple what the riskiest corporate
borrowers pay. The loan would default if the FCC revoked its
license on a final basis, and the license was no longer subject
to review by the FCC or any court, according to the papers.  Trouble for the company began in December, when a draft
summary of test results showed that LightSquared signals
interfered with about 75 percent of GPS receivers. That same
month, billionaire Icahn, along with Beal and Tepper, bought
$300 million of the company’s debt sold by Farallon Capital
Management LLC, two people told Bloomberg News.  ‘No Mitigation’  The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration advised the FCC on LightSquared’s proposed
system. In February, NTIA’s administrator sent a letter to the
FCC chairman saying there were “no mitigation strategies that
both solve the interference issues and provide LightSquared with
an adequate commercial network deployment.”  The opinion to block the approval caused a cascade of
events for LightSquared. On March 16, Sprint ended an 11-year
agreement to build, operate and share the network and compete
with AT&T Inc. and  Verizon Wireless . LightSquared paid Sprint
$310 million in advance and Sprint said in a securities filing
Feb. 27 that it would return $65 million of the payments.  LightSquared had originally agreed to pay Overland Park,
Kansas-based Sprint $9 billion for the network duties and issue
an additional $4.5 billion in service credits. The deal hinged
on approval from the FCC.  On Feb. 28, Chief Executive Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  resigned
and the company appointed Falcone to the board as it began a
search for a new CEO. LightSquared also cut 45 percent of its
330-member staff to preserve cash.  Payment Skipped  Since then, LightSquared failed to pay a network partner
Inmarsat Plc $29.6 million due March 31. The company previously
skipped a payment of $56.3 million due in February. LightSquared
says it withheld payment because work specified in the contract
wasn’t completed.  Falcone began investing in LightSquared’s predecessor,
SkyTerra Communications Inc., in 2005. Harbinger wrote down the
value of its LightSquared position by 59 percent last year
because of concerns about winning regulatory approval.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-12080,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
