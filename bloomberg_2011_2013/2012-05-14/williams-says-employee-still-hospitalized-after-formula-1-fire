Williams Formula One team said one
employee remains in the hospital after suffering burns yesterday
in a garage fire following the  Spanish Grand Prix .  Two employees were released from facilities in  Spain  after
getting treatment for smoke inhalation, the team said today in
an e-mailed statement. The injured staff member will be
transfered to the U.K. in the next two days, Williams said.  Thirty-one people required medical attention after the fire
engulfed the team’s garage as staff celebrated Pastor
Maldonado’s breakthrough victory in Spain. The incident marred
what was Grove, England-based Williams’s first race victory
since Juan Pablo Montoya took the checkered flag at the
Brazilian Grand Prix in 2004.  “Everyone at  Williams F1 (WGF1)  is extremely relieved that this
event was contained as quickly as it was and the damage which
occurred was, relatively speaking, limited in its nature,” team
principal  Frank Williams  said in the statement. “While the
incident was unexpected and definitely most undesirable, it has
demonstrated the genuine cohesiveness, camaraderie and spirit of
co-operation that exists within the Formula One paddock.”  The blaze broke out an hour after yesterday’s race at the
Circuit de Catalunya in Montmelo. Seven people were transferred
to local hospitals. The cause is still under investigation, the
team said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
