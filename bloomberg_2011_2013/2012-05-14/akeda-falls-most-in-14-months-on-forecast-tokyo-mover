Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.,  Asia ’s
biggest drugmaker, fell the most in 14 months in Tokyo trading
after forecasting a 40 percent drop in operating profit because
of acquisition costs and higher research expenses.  Takeda  plunged  4.3 percent to 3,255 yen as of 11:01 a.m.,
the most since March 2011. The benchmark Topix Index advanced
0.3 percent.  Operating profit , or sales minus the cost of goods
sold and administrative expenses, will be 160 billion yen ($2
billion) in the year ending March 2013, the Osaka, Japan-based
company said after markets closed on May 11.  Operating profit was expected to reach 226 billion yen in
the current fiscal year, according to the average of 16  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg before Takeda’s announcement.  “The guidance was a major negative surprise,” said
Fumiyoshi Sakai and Toshiyuki Tateno, equities analysts at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo, in a report to clients today.
“We had never anticipated that operating profit would fall
through the 200 billion yen mark.”  Takeda announced $13 billion of acquisitions in the past
year, agreeing to buy Nycomed and URL Pharma Inc., to boost
sales in  emerging markets  and access new treatments to buffer a
decline in sales after its best-selling Actos medicine. The
diabetes treatment, which loses patent protection in three
months, posted a 24 percent drop in sales to 296.2 billion yen
in the year ended March 31, accounting for 20 percent of
Takeda’s total revenue.  Net income  for the current year will jump 25 percent to 155
billion yen, the company said. Profit will be helped by a tax
refund and government funds for an influenza drug plant. Takeda
plans to sell 100 billion yen of stock in other companies in the
next two years to raise cash, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
