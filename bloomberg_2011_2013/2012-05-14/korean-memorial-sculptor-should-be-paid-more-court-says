The U.S. Postal Service should pay
more than $5,000 to the sculptor of marching soldiers at the
 Korean War Veterans Memorial  in  Washington  for an image captured
on a 37-cent stamp, an appeals court ruled today.  Frank Gaylord , who designed the stainless-steel models
known as The Column, had won a copyright-infringement case
against the postal service for its use of the sculptures on a
stamp issued in 2002 marking the 50th anniversary of the
armistice. The service had paid $1,500 for rights to a
photograph of the soldiers covered in snow.  Gaylord appealed again after he was awarded $5,000 for the
use of his copyright. The appeals court  said  today the amount
didn’t consider how much Gaylord would have demanded in
negotiations before the image was used without his permission.  The sculptor sought a 10 percent royalty on about $30.2
million worth of stamps, saying that’s consistent with his other
licensing agreements. Instead, a judge with the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims awarded $5,000 based on the highest amount the
postal service said it had paid for an existing image.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit said
today that the lower court should consider the outcome of a
hypothetical negotiation over total sales, including to
collectors and commercial merchandise.  Gaylord was initially paid $775,000 for his work designing
the soldiers and supervising the steel casting.  The postal service said last week that it lost $3.2 billion
in the quarter ended March 31 and will temporarily run out of
cash in October.  The case is Gaylord v. U.S., 2009-5044, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
