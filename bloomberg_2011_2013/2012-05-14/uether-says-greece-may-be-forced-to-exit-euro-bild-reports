Michael Huether , the German economist
and head of the IW economic institute, said eurozone governments
may have to force Greece to exit the common currency unless the
country adheres to its austerity promises, Bild-Zeitung
reported.  Greece may shun such a step because of the “dramatic
consequences” for the country, the newspaper cited Huether as
saying in a preview of an interview in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
