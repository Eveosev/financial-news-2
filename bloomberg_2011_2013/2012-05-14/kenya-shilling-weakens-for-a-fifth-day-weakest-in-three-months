Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
fifth day, headed for the lowest in more than three months.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 84 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent weaker at 83.70 as of 5:58 p.m. in Nairobi, set for the
lowest since Feb. 2.  Kenya’s central bank accepted all 7.02 billion shillings
($83.8 million) of bids received for seven-day  repurchase
agreements , said Godfrey Putunoi, a dealer at the bank’s money-
market department.  The weighted average rate for the repos was 16.522 percent,
he said by phone today from Nairobi, the capital. The bank had
offered 12 billion shillings, he said.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 1,580 to the
dollar while the Ugandan shilling gained 0.1 percent to 2,467 to
the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
