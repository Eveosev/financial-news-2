A tax office in the Athens suburb of
Marousi was partly destroyed early today in a fire caused by two
explosive devices, the state-run Athens News Agency reported
today.  The devices were made up of 25 camper gas cannisters that
unknown perpetrators placed on two floors after breaking into
the building, the agency said.  The blaze, which broke out at 3.12 a.m., was extinguished
by 10 firefighters using four vehicles, according to an e-mailed
 statement  from the  Greek Fire Service .  To contact the reporter on this story:
