The Italian government may delay the
introduction of a new bill reducing premium tariffs and spending
targets for solar energy by three months, according to a
Deutsche Bank AG analyst.  It is “very likely” that the state and regional
authorities will postpone subsidy cuts by a few months when they
meet to debate the bill later this month, said  Vishal Shah ,
analyst at the bank, in a note to investors today. Three more
months at current rates would allow 1.5 to 2 gigawatts in extra
photovoltaic capacity to be added in  Italy , he said.  Italy, the world’s largest solar market last year, plans to
rein in a boom in solar installations spurred by feed-in
tariffs, or premium rates for clean energy. Ministers presented
a draft bill last month that would cut rates by as much as 36
percent and reduce the spending limit on the subsidies.  At a meeting last week, a government official said the
state would likely agree to move the cuts to Oct. 1 instead of
the current proposal for July 1, according to the analyst.  The decree is subject to modifications from the state-
regions meetings and the energy regulator before being voted
into law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
