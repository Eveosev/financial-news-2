Gubre Fabrikalari TAS (GUBRF) , a Turkish
fertilizer producer, climbed in Istanbul after saying first-
quarter profit was 192.2 million liras ($106 million) in a
filing for tax purposes only to the Istanbul bourse today.  Gubre Fabrikalari rose 1.2 percent to 12.45 liras at the
close in Istanbul, the highest level since April 26.  Profit statements for tax purposes in  Turkey  are not
necessarily indicative of a companyâ€™s full earnings, which
comply with international accounting rules and are due to be
reported later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
