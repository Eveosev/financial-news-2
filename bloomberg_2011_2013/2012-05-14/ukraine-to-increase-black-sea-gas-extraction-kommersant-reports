Ukraine’s state-owned energy company
NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy seeks to boost natural-gas extraction in
the  Black Sea  this year by using two new drilling platforms,
 Kommersant-Ukraine  reported.  Naftogaz unit DAT Chornomornaftohaz will extract as much as
3 billion cubic meters of gas annually by 2015 using a Petro
Hodovanets platform that arrived in the Crimea last week and a
rig that will arrive by year-end, the Kiev-based newspaper said,
citing Oleksandr Zeykan, the head of Naftogaz’s oil and gas
extraction department.  By early 2014, Petro Hodovanets will have extracted its
first billion cubic meters, Zeykan said, according to
Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
