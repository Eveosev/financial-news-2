New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the island
nation’s biggest leisure operator by market value, delayed a
dividend announcement, blaming the European debt crisis, even as
profits rose in the quarter through March.  The “lack of visibility” regarding “air access to
Mauritius prompted the board to exercise caution by postponing
to a later date the declaration of dividends,” New Mauritius
Hotels said in a  statement  published on the Stock Exchange of
Mauritius’s website today.  Air Mauritius, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s fourth-biggest airline,
suspended flights to  Europe  earlier than originally scheduled
citing “depressed market conditions.”  Arrivals in the Indian Ocean island nation declined  0.2
percent  in the three months through March, led by a 2.7 percent
contraction in the number of visitors from Europe, which
accounted for 66 percent of the total, according to Statistics
Mauritius.  Curepipe-based New Mauritius Hotels, which operates in the
upper segment of the leisure industry, said net income advanced
6 percent to 355.2 million rupees, while revenue jumped 12
percent to 2.36 billion rupees.  Earnings for the next two quarters, coinciding with the low
season in the Indian Ocean island nation, are expected to be
“similar to those of last year,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
