Plus Markets Group Plc (PMK) , which
operated the smallest U.K. stock exchange, will close after
running out of money and failing to find a buyer.  London-based Plus “will be wound down over a period of up
to six months in order to minimise market disruption,” it said
in a Regulatory News Service statement today. Companies listed
on the exchange’s markets will need to find an alternative
listing venue and Plus said it will sell its “remaining
assets.”  It considered various options including potential takeover
offers, a share placement, a capital injection and asset sales.
It also held talks with “a number of parties” including  stock
exchanges  and trading platforms, inter-dealer brokers,
technology providers and private equity and wealth funds, the
company said.  Set up by former London Stock Exchange Plc executives, Plus
sought to compete with the LSE, and was granted exchange status
in 2007. Still, it was unable to attract listings, unlike other
new entrants such as Bats Global Markets and Chi-X Europe Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
