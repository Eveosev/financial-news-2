The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only oil export pipe in  Russia  with foreign
shareholders, will boost daily crude exports for June from the
Black Sea by 2.5 percent from this month, according to a
preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 24 cargoes totaling
2.399 million metric tons, the schedule showed. That’s equal to
18.6 million barrels, or 621,341 barrels a day, compared with
606,311 barrels for May.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to the terminal close to
Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31
percent and Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO
Lukoil and a joint venture between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
