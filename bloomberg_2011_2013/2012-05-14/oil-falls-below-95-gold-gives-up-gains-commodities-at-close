24 commodities declined 1.5 percent to 633.09 at 4:46 p.m.

dropped 1.3 percent to 1,490.1149.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell below $95 a barrel in  New York  for the first time
since December as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened and  Saudi
Arabia ’s energy minister said prices should decline further.  Crude for June delivery fell as much as $1.40 to $94.73 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest intraday price since Dec. 20. It was at
$94.74 at 8:38 a.m. London time. Prices slid 95 cents to $96.13
on May 11 and are down 4.1 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fluctuated in New York amid forecasts
for mild weather that may limit cooling demand after a
government report last week showed a below-normal increase in
stockpiles.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha swaps for June rose $1.95, or 0.2 percent, to
$916.45 a metric ton at 11:04 a.m. Singapore time, according to

narrowed 3 percent last week, the most since March 23. Singapore
gasoil swaps for June fell 5 cents to $124.40.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold dropped to a four-month low in  London  as concern
Europe’s debt crisis is deepening strengthened the dollar and
cut gold’s appeal as an alternative asset. Other precious metals
declined.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.6 percent
to $1,569.32 an ounce, the lowest price since Jan. 3, and was at
$1,573.97 by 8:53 a.m. in London. June-delivery futures were 0.7
percent lower at $1,573.50 on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery fell as much as 1.6 percent

$593.25 an ounce, the lowest price since Nov. 30, and was last
at $595.75.  BASE METALS  Copper declined to a four-week low on concerns  China ’s bank
reserve requirement cut signaled a slowdown in the world’s
second-largest economy may be steeper than expected and amid
speculation  Greece  may exit from the euro area. Zinc, lead and
nickel also slid.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn gained after last week’s decline to a seven-month low
boosted the appeal of the U.S. grain to importers and investors.
Wheat increased.  July-delivery corn rose as much as 0.9 percent to $5.86 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from the May 11
low of $5.7225, which equaled the intraday low for the most-
active contract on Oct. 3. It traded at $5.8125 at 3:01 p.m.
Singapore time, snapping three days of losses. Futures fell 6.3
percent last week, the most since the five days ended Jan. 13.  Wheat for delivery in July gained as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.01 a bushel, after posting a second weekly loss in the five
days ended May 11. It last traded at $5.99 a bushel.  Soybeans for July delivery lost as much as 1.5 percent to
$13.8525 a bushel, the lowest price for the most-active contract
since March 30. It traded at $13.8525 after declining 4.9
percent last week, the biggest weekly loss for the most-active
contract since the five days ended Nov. 25.  Rubber for October delivery extended its decline, falling
as much as 2.2 percent to 277.30 yen a kilogram on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange before trading at 278 yen. That was the
lowest level for the most active contract since Jan. 16.  Palm oil  declined to the lowest level in almost three
months on concerns that an escalating debt crisis in Europe,
boosting the dollar, and a deepening economic slowdown in China
may curb demand for commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
