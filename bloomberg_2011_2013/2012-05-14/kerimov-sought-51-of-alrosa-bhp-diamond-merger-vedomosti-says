Russian billionaire Suleiman Kerimov
urged the government to offer 51 percent of diamond miner OAO
Alrosa under its asset sale program,  Vedomosti  said today,
citing unidentified government officials.  Kerimov aimed to buy the controlling stake in Alrosa, merge
it with  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s diamond assets and hold a public
offering of shares in the combined company, the Moscow-based
newspaper said.  Alrosa said March 16 its board recommended a gradual sale
of the state’s interest, starting with a 14 percent stake.  It makes sense for the government to sell 51 percent in
Alrosa as the price would include a premium for control, while
selling in smaller lots benefits company management, Anton
Averin, a spokesman for Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva investment
company, said by telephone today when called by Bloomberg News.
Nafta Moskva holds 1 percent of Alrosa, he said.  Alrosa’s press office in Moscow declined to comment, as did
 Ruban Yogarajah , a London-based BHP Billiton spokesman. BHP said
Nov. 29 that it’s studying the sale of some or all of its
diamond units, saying the operations may no longer fit with its
strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
