Egypt ’s public prosecutor referred a
corruption-related complaint against presidential candidate
Ahmed Shafik for investigation, the state-run news agency said
today.  Abdel Meguid Mahmoud asked that public funds prosecutors
investigate allegations that Shafik sold a plot of land below
market price to  Gamal Mubarak , the son of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , squandering state funds, the Middle East News Agency
reported. The complaint was lodged by lawmaker Essam Sultan.  Shafik, who served as premier in the waning days of
Mubarak’s administration, is one of 13 candidates contesting
presidential elections due to start on May 23. In a poll
published today in the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper, Shafik came
second with 19.9 percent of the 1,200 people surveyed.  A statement by Shafik’s campaign denied all the
accusations, and said the complaint was politically motivated
and an act of “blackmail” that will not obstruct his bid, MENA
reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
