Stocks fell, commodities slid to the
cheapest level this year and the euro weakened to a three-month
low amid growing concern Greece will exit the European currency.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  slid 1.6 percent at 4 p.m.
in  New York  and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank 1.1 percent
to 1,338.35, with both slipping to the lowest levels in more
than three months. The euro slid to less than $1.29 for the
first time since January. Yields on U.S. seven-year debt and 10-
year U.K. and German bonds fell to records, while costs to
insure against a Spanish default jumped to an all-time high. The
S&P GSCI gauge of commodities dropped 1.1 percent.  European finance ministers grappled with the costs of
keeping Greece in the euro area or letting it go, as a post-
election political feud prevents the nation from forming a new
government following the May 6 election. President Karolos
Papoulias told Greek political leaders that banks face the
threat of collapse if deposits continue to dwindle amid the
instability. In the U.S.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  fell for a second
day after reporting a $2 billion trading loss.  “The markets are going to play hard ball and the European
governments are going to play hard ball too,”  John Manley ,
chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in New
York, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $207
billion. “The odds of Greece leaving the euro are higher. It’s
an enormous game of chicken that they are playing with each
other. To the degree it does represent the democratic process in
Greece, it makes it more likely they default and the Europeans
have to do something.”  JPMorgan’s Loss  The S&P 500 fell for a second day as financial companies
and energy producers led losses among  all 10 of its main
industry groups . All but three of 30 stocks in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  retreated, sending the gauge down 125.25
points to 12,695.53, its lowest close since Jan. 31.  JPMorgan fell 3.2 percent and lost 12 percent since
disclosing the trading loss on May 10, marking its biggest two-
day slide in three years. Matt Zames, newly appointed to lead
the firm’s chief investment office after it suffered a $2
billion loss on  credit derivatives , shook up the unit’s
leadership and announced a “renewed focus” on hedging risks.
Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew will retire.  Fitch Ratings  on
May 11 cut the bank’s credit rating by one level to A+ from AA-,
saying the loss raises questions about its risk management.  Shares of Citigroup Inc. tumbled 4.1 percent and Bank of
New York Mellon Corp. lost 3.1 percent to help lead declines in
all 24 stocks in the  KBW Bank Index (BKX) , which slid to the lowest
level since March 7. The S&P 500 trimmed its year-to-date gain
to 6.4 percent, down from a rally of as much as 13 percent. The
index has tumbled 5.7 percent from an almost four-year high on
April 2.  Bearish Stock Bets Pared  As individuals bail out of U.S. stocks at the fastest rate
in three decades, professional speculators have cut bearish bets
by the most since 2008.  Money managers are net short 19,375 contracts on the S&P
500, down 82 percent from a four-year high in September even
after the figure jumped from 3,584 last week, data compiled by
Bloomberg and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
U.S. equity mutual funds recorded $18 billion of outflows in
April, the most since at least 1984, according to preliminary
data from the  Investment Company Institute .  Hedge funds  and other institutions are speculating the
index will extend its 23 percent rally since October after 69
percent of  S&P 500  companies  beat  first-quarter earnings
estimates and economists projected accelerating U.S. growth this
year. Bears say last week’s addition to bets on declines show
short sellers have completed almost all of the buying they are
likely to do, depleting demand for equities.  Bets Versus JPMorgan  Signs are emerging that traders are attempting to squeeze
JPMorgan’s positions in credit derivatives. The 10-year Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index Series 9 jumped the
most in almost eight months on May 11. The index is an older,
less-active benchmark for credit-default swaps created in 2007
in which JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil in London was said to have
amassed as much as a $100 billion position. Another index
contract that takes more concentrated risks on the same
companies recorded the biggest two-week surge in two years.  Bonds considered the safest investments rallied, sending
yields on some debt to record lows. The rate on seven-year U.S.
notes declined as much as six basis points to 1.17 percent,
while 10-year German bund yields decreased to as low as 1.43
percent and the U.K. gilt yield touched 1.86 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  sank 1.8 percent to a four-month
low as all 19 industry groups retreated. Opap SA, Europe’s
biggest listed gambling company, helped lead Greek stocks lower,
tumbling 12 percent for the biggest drop since October. Greece’s
benchmark ASE Index traded at the lowest level since November
1992 for a second day, tumbling 4.6 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35
Index lost 2.7 percent, extending this year’s retreat to more
than 20 percent.  ‘Dangerous Template’  The Greek political deadlock looked set to continue for a
second week as President Karolos Papoulias failed to secure
agreement on a unity government. Greece faces a 436 million-euro
($561 million) note coming due for repayment tomorrow. A Greek
exit from the euro “is not necessarily fatal, but it is not
attractive,” European Central Bank Governing Council member
Patrick Honohan said May 12.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Europe has
done the “utmost” to prop up the financially stricken country,
limiting any further room for leniency after about 240 billion
euros ($308 billion) of aid pledges. German Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s party was defeated in North Rhine-Westphalia two days
before data that will show whether the nation slipped into
recession.  The exit of Greece from the euro “would remain a dangerous
template if other economies continued to weaken,”  Jim Reid , a
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a report.
“Investors would surely fear that a similar outcome was
possible and would either shy away from investments or demand an
unsustainable  risk premium  for holding exposure.”  Euro Weakens  The euro depreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2846, and slipped
0.7 percent versus the yen. The Dollar Index, which tracks the
U.S. currency against those of six trading partners, advanced
0.4 percent to extend its longest rally since August 2008. The
Australian dollar fell below parity with the greenback for the
first time this year, with the Swedish krona weakening to 7 per
dollar for the first time since Jan. 16.  The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond rose 22 basis points
to 6.23 percent. The nation sold 2.9 billion euros of bills
maturing in 364 and 518 days, compared with a maximum target of
3 billion euros. Italy’s 10-year yield increased 19 basis points
to 5.70 percent as the government auctioned 5.25 billion euros
of securities due in 2015, 2020, 2022 and 2025. Germany sold 3.3
billion euros of six-month bills, with Finland and France also
auctioning debt today.  Credit-default swaps on Spain climbed 15 basis points to an
all-time high of 534.  Commodities Slip  The S&P GSCI fell to the lowest since December. Copper
futures slid 2.6 percent in New York and gold declined 1.5
percent to $1,561 an ounce, erasing its gain for the year. New
York oil futures dropped 1.4 percent to $94.78 a barrel, the
lowest front-month settlement since Dec. 19.  Brent crude  futures declined 0.8 percent to $111.40 a
barrel. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said yesterday
in Adelaide, Australia, that Brent crude, the benchmark price
for more than half the world’s oil, should trade at about $100
as crude supply outweighs demand.  Speculators cut bets on a rally in commodities by the most
since November. Money managers reduced net-long positions across
18 U.S. futures and options by 19 percent to 723,239 contracts
in the week ended May 8, the biggest decline since Nov. 22,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. The S&P GSCI
Spot Index of 24 raw materials dropped 6.5 percent in eight
sessions through May 11, the longest slide since December 2008.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  dropped 2.1 percent to its
lowest level on a closing basis since Jan. 11. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese stocks listed in  Hong Kong 
fell 1.5 percent, its eighth consecutive decline. The People’s
Bank of China said on May 12 it’s cutting the amount of cash
that banks must set aside as reserves for a third time since
November. Russia’s Micex plunged 3.5 percent and benchmark
gauges in Brazil and Poland fell at least 2 percent. India’s
Sensex dropped 0.5 percent after inflation unexpectedly
quickened in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
