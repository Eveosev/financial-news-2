Michael Klein  said buying the
controlling stake at Via Varejo SA now held by Cia. Brasileira
de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar is “out of the agenda,”
according to an e-mailed statement.  “This subject is out of the agenda and there is nothing
going on,” Klein said in an e-mail sent by his press officer,
answering Bloomberg’s questions.  Valor Economico earlier reported that the Klein family was
seeking to buy the stake, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Pao de Acucar said it didn’t get any proposal to negotiate
Via Varejo, according to a statement sent by e-mail by its press
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
