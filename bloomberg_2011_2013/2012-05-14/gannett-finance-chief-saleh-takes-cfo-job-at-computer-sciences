Gannett (GCI)  Co. Chief Financial Officer
Paul Saleh resigned to become finance chief at  Computer Sciences
Corp. (CSC) , a technology contractor for governments and businesses.  Saleh, 55, accepted a position at a “Fortune 200”
company, McLean, Virginia-based Gannett said today in a
statement, without specifying where he is going. Computer
Sciences said in a statement that it hired Saleh as CFO
effective May 23.  Gannett, the owner of 82 U.S. daily newspapers including
USA Today, has struggled to revive revenue growth as the
newspaper industry loses ad sales to websites such as those
of Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. The publisher reported a
25 percent drop in first-quarter net income to $68.2 million as
sales declined 2.6 percent to $1.22 billion.  Vice President  Michael Hart  will lead financial operations
while the company seeks a replacement for Saleh, Gannett said.
Saleh, a former chief financial officer for Sprint Nextel Corp.,
joined Gannett in November 2010. His total compensation for 2011
was $2.19 million, according to a March regulatory filing.  Computer Sciences, based in  Falls Church , Virginia, said
Saleh will replace Michael Mancuso, who announced his retirement
in February.  Gannett fell 0.5 percent to $13.30 at 9:36 a.m. in  New
York . The  shares  had gained 1.4 percent this year before today.
Computer Sciences dropped 2.3 percent to $26.50 and had
increased 14 percent this year through May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
