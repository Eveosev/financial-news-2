DBRS Ltd., the Canadian debt rating
company, said Daniel Curry will lead the firm and that former
President Huston Loke has left.  Under the reorganization, DBRS said Curry will have a
“global focus,” expanding its operations outside of  Canada . It
won’t change the legal structure of DBRS units in Canada, the
U.S. or  Europe , DBRS said in a statement.  The ratings company is also forming a Canadian board of
directors after being recognized as a designated rating
organization on April 30. The board will include DBRS’s Walter Schroeder and David Schroeder and independent directors Sir
George Mathewson and Juan Carlos Garcia Centeno, the firm said.  DBRS was the main rating company for asset-backed
commercial paper in Canada when the market for it froze in 2007.
Companies such as Coventree Inc. were unable to renew most of
their paper as investors shunned the debt. The Toronto-based
rating company was founded in 1976.  To contact the reporter on this story:
