Livestock Feed Ltd. (LFL) , a Mauritian
distributor of cattle and poultry food, advanced the most in
more than a month after saying that fiscal third-quarter profit
soared as sales improved.  The  shares  climbed as much as 6.3 percent, the biggest gain
since April 6, to 16.90 rupees, the highest in two months, and
traded at 16.80 rupees by 1:11 p.m. in Port Louis.  Net income attributable to equity holders climbed to 15
million rupees ($511,000) for the three months through March,
from 1.8 million rupees a year earlier, according to a statement
published on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius website today.  “This increase is due to higher sales volumes on the local
and exports markets and better sales mix,” the company said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
