Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa
will “remain strong” this year as demand for the region’s
resources helps offset global risks including financial turmoil
in  Europe  and a possible increase in oil prices, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  “One-off factors, including new resource production in
several countries, will help nudge the region’s output growth,”
Antoinette Monsio Sayeh, director of the IMF’s African
Department, said in a statement.  The IMF last month forecast growth in sub-Saharan Africa at
5.4 percent this year, and 5.3 percent in 2013, higher than the
respective world output of 3.5 percent and 4.1 percent.  Growth will be led by new natural resource production in
countries such as Angola, Niger, and  Sierra Leone  and a rebound
from drought in the Sahel region and parts of eastern Africa,
the IMF said in its regional  Economic Outlook for sub-Saharan
Africa  report today.  The “broadly favorable outlook is subject to clear
downside risks because of global uncertainties, including the
threat of renewed financial stresses in the euro area and the
possibility of a surge in  oil prices , triggered by geopolitical
uncertainties,” Monsio Sayeh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
