Spanish  10-year bond  yields rose
above 6.3 percent for the first time in more than five months as
 Greece  moved closer to a possible exit from the euro area and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party lost a state election.  German, Finnish and Dutch yields reached record lows as
investors favored the highest-rated countries. The cost of
insuring against a sovereign default by Spain rose to an all-
time high. Italian 10-year yields jumped by the most since
January as a report showed euro-area industrial production
unexpectedly contracted in March. Data tomorrow may show the
region’s economy shrank in the first quarter.  “The political deadlock in Greece continues to push risk
premiums higher and Spanish bonds continue to fall,” said
Achilleas Georgolopoulos, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds
Banking Group Plc in  London . “Everything plays into the hands
of risk-off.”  Spanish 10-year yields gained 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, to 6.23 percent at 4 p.m. London time. It
touched 6.36 percent, breaching the 6.3 percent level for the
first time since Nov. 30. The 5.85 percent security fell 1.56,
or 15.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,285) face amount, to 97.275.  The Italian 10-year yield was 20 basis points higher at
5.71 percent, after rising as much as 28 basis points, the
biggest intraday increase since Jan. 30. Two-year note  yields 
rose 32 basis points to 3.32 percent, after climbing as much as
42 basis points, the most since Jan. 16.  Political Deadlock  Credit-default swaps on  Spain  surged 24 basis points to a
record 541 basis points amid heightened concern over the
nation’s bank capital crisis. Spain’s plan to force banks to
increase provisions by 30 billion euros and inject less than 15
billion euros of cash will worsen its debt burden and may not be
enough, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Greece’s political deadlock entered a second week as
President Karolos Papoulias prepared to meet political leaders
after failing to win agreement on a unity government. Merkel’s
party was defeated in an election in the country’s most-populous
state.  “Merkel will remain focused on fiscal austerity and try to
convince the German public that she is right,” Georgolopoulos
said. Euro-area finance ministers were due meet in Brussels
today.  Greece’s 2 percent bond due February 2023 fell for a 10th
day, pushing the yield up 292 basis points to 27.67 percent. The
price dropped to 15.73 percent of face value.  Holding the Line  While a Greek withdrawal from the euro area “is not
necessarily fatal,” it is not attractive, European Central Bank
Governing Council member  Patrick Honohan  said in Tallinn,
 Estonia , on May 12. An exit was “technically” possible yet
would damage the euro, he said.  Volatility in Greek debt securities was the highest in the
euro area, followed by Ireland and  Italy , according to measures
of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-
default swaps compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on Irish bonds
due October 2020 increased 11 basis points to 7.03 percent.  Greece plans to sell 1 billion euros of three-month bills
tomorrow, while  Belgium  is scheduled to auction three- and 12-
month securities.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  reiterated in an
interview in  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  over the weekend that member
states seeking to hold the line on austerity for Greece could
not force the country to stay in the bloc.  German Records  German two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields fell to all-time
lows. The 30-year bond yields dropped as much as 13 basis points
to 2.072 percent. Ten-year rates slid to as low as 1.434 percent
and five-year yields slipped to 0.479 percent. Two-year yields
touched 0.055 percent.  The Dutch 10-year yield declined as much as eight basis
points to 1.95 percent, while  Finland ’s securities with a
similar maturity climbed for a third day, pushing the yield to
as low as 1.79 percent.  “The rally to new yield lows in bunds is not done” and
the 10-year yield may fall to 1.25 percent,  Andrew Roberts  and
 Harvinder Sian , strategists at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in London, wrote in a note today. The debate about the
possibility of a euro member exiting the monetary union “is now
finally in the open,” they wrote.  Rally ‘Not Done’  Production in the 17-nation euro area decreased 0.3 percent
from February when it rose a revised 0.8 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The median
prediction of 34 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
gain of 0.4 percent.  Economic  growth  in the euro-region contracted 0.2 percent
in the first quarter, according to the median estimate of 38
economists in a Bloomberg survey, after shrinking 0.3 percent in
the previous three months. The data is released tomorrow.  Longer-maturity German bonds outperformed shorter-dated
notes with the difference in yields between two- and 10-year
bunds shrinking to the narrowest in more than six months.  The  spread  narrowed five basis points to 138 basis points,
the least since Nov. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
based on closing prices. It may find resistance at the November
low of 133 basis points, and encounter support at the 200-day
moving average at 158 basis points, the data show.  Support refers to an area on a price graph where analysts
expect orders to buy the spread to be grouped. A resistance
level is an area where they anticipate sell orders will be
clustered.  German debt has returned 2.3 percent so far this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have
gained 10 percent, and Spanish securities have lost 2.1 percent,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
