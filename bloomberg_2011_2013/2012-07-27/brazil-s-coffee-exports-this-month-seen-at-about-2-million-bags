Coffee exports from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, will be “close” to 2 million bags
this month, according to Rio de Janeiro-based broker Flavour
Coffee.  That compares with 1.88 million bags in June and 2.06
million bags a year earlier, according to figures from the
country’s council of coffee exporters, known as Cecafe.  “The pace of July shipments is slightly above June at same
date,” Flavour Coffee said, adding that strikes including truck
drivers and customs officials were “already affecting pace of
coffee shipments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
