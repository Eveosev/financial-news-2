Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for the biggest gain in almost nine
months, after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
policy makers will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest lender, rose 2.6
percent in  Hong Kong . LG Display Co., which makes digital
products, gained 7.3 percent in Seoul on expectations earnings
will improve. China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd., which makes
aluminum used in rail carriages and airplanes, jumped 5.9
percent in Hong Kong after saying profit will increase. Hitachi
Chemical Co., a Japanese manufacturer of chemical products,
surged 8.9 percent after raising its profit forecast.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.1 percent to 116.16 as
of 7:45 p.m. in Tokyo with about six stocks advancing for each
that fell and paring its loss this week to 0.4 percent. The
measure is headed for the biggest daily increase since Dec. 1.  “There’s a fear things are getting out of control, and so
Draghi came out with a very strong statement in support of the
market that they are going to do everything necessary to support
the euro,” said Cameron Peacock, a Melbourne-based market
analyst at IG Markets, a provider of trading services for
stocks, bonds and currencies. “We are looking at a fairly
strong finish to the end of the week.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell about 12 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern  China’s
economy  is slowing and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
worsen. The regional benchmark index traded at 11.6 times
 estimated earnings  as of yesterday, compared with 13.2 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.9 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.5 percent as a
report showed consumer prices fell in June, raising prospects
for additional easing. South Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 2.6
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.5 percent, while New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index increased 0.5 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 2 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent. Singapore’s Straits
Times Index fell 0.2 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent today. The gauge
added 1.7 percent in  New York  yesterday, when U.S. reports on
durable goods and jobless claims eased concern that economic
growth is slowing. Global stocks rallied after Draghi suggested
policy makers may intervene in bond markets as yields surge in
Spain and Italy.  Companies that do business in Europe advanced. HSBC added
2.6 percent to HK$64.10.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a maker
of photographic film that gets 28 percent of its sales in
Europe, rose 3.8 percent to 520 yen in Tokyo.  Samsung Surges  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , a consumer electronics company
that depends on Europe for 19 percent of its sales, jumped 5.2
percent to 1.233 million won. Samsung topped Nokia as the
world’s biggest cellphone vendor in the second quarter,
according to  Strategy Analytics . The Korean company also
forecast higher demand for its panel displays and handsets.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a report today
will show the  U.S. economy  grew an annualized 1.4 percent in the
second quarter, compared with a 1.9 percent expansion in the
previous three months. The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets
next week and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week said policy
makers are studying options for further easing in case economic
growth remains too feeble to produce a lasting decline in
unemployment.  “Everyone wants to see the Fed embark on a third round of
quantitative easing,” Peacock said. “It’s going to provide a
temporary boost to the stock market, it’s going to push up
commodity prices and it’s going to lower the  U.S. dollar . It’s
going to make people feel a bit better, but it’s not going to
solve any structural problem.”  LG Display  Technology shares rose the most among the 10 groups on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. LG Display, owned by mobile phone maker
 LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , soared 7.3 percent to 23,500 in  Seoul  won
after Hyundai Securities Co. raised its price target by 25
percent to 35,000 won, saying earnings will improve from August.
LG Innotek Co., a mobile-phone component maker, climbed 8.7
percent to 84,100 won.  Investors also watched earnings reports. Earnings have
 missed  analyst estimates for 51 percent of the 125 firms listed
on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have reported quarterly results
and offered forecasts this month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  China Zhongwang added 5.9 percent to HK$2.86 after the
company said it expects its first-half profit will increase
“substantially.”  Hitachi Chemical jumped 8.9 percent to 1,195 yen after
raising its fiscal-year net income forecast 9.3 percent to 23.5
billion yen, more than an analyst estimate of 20.9 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
