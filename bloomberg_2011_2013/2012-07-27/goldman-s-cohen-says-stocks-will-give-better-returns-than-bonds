Abby Joseph Cohen, the senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities
will generate better returns than bonds for investors in the
medium-to-long term.  “If we were to look just at fair-value estimates over the
next year to three, we think that returns that are roughly 8 to
10 percent on the stock market are sensible,” she said in an
interview on Bloomberg Surveillance today with  Tom Keene . “It
is sensible as well for a long-term outlook, even though we
assume that economic growth will not be as robust as it was in
the years immediately prior to the financial crisis.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  has surged 25 percent from
its 2011 low in October as economic data beat forecasts and
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers
stand ready to act if more stimulus measures for the U.S.
economy are needed.  Since the financial crisis, many companies have repaired
their balance sheets, boosting returns for shareholders, said
Cohen, who is based in New York.  “The focus has been on margins, ROEs and returning capital
to shareholders,” she said, referring to so-called return on
equity. “We’ve seen dividends increase, we’ve also seen share
repurchases increase.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
