Swedish  retail sales  unexpectedly
declined in June as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighs on growth in the
largest Nordic economy.  Sales fell 0.4 percent from May, Stockholm-based  Statistics
Sweden  said today. They were estimated to grow 0.2 percent in
the month, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Annual
growth slowed to 0.9 percent from a 4.6 percent jump in May.  Sweden , which relies on sales abroad for about half of its
output, sends 70 percent of its  exports  to Europe. The Swedish
central bank held its main rate at 1.5 percent this month, after
two cuts since December, and signaled it may ease once again by
year-end.  The bank on July 4 raised its economic growth forecast for
this year to 0.6 percent from 0.4 percent, and lowered next
year’s estimate to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
