The measures the Irish government
used to persuade bondholders to take losses as it restructured
 Anglo Irish  Bank Corp. were unfair to the minority of investors
who didn’t want to take part, a U.K. court ruled.  Judge Michael Briggs today  called  the mechanism a
“negative inducement” to force bondholders to accept the
offer. The case was brought by Anglo Irish bondholder Assenagon
Asset Management SA.  The ruling focuses on the legality of so-called exit
consent measures under which the nationalized lender offered
holders of the bonds a choice between receiving a smaller amount
in exchange for their notes or being effectively wiped out.
Other countries, including  Greece , used similar methods to
restructure their debt.  The exchange offer was “fair, transparent” and all note
holders were provided with comprehensive notice in advance, the
Irish Bank Resolution Corp., the successor to Anglo Irish, said
in a statement today. “IBRC is firmly of the view that these
securities would have been valueless without the
recapitalization of the bank by the Irish State.”  The IBRC said it was given permission to appeal and is
“considering its options.”  The case is Assenagon Asset Management S.A. v. Anglo Irish
Bank Corp.,  High Court  of Justice Chancery Division, HC11C01320.  To contact the reporter on this story:
