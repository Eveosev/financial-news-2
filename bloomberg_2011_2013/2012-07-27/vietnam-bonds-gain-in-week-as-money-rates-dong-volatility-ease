Vietnam ’s five-year bonds had a
second weekly advance on speculation lower funding costs and
easing volatility in the dong will encourage investors. The
currency weakened.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  fell 1.82 percentage
points this week to 2.34 percent, the biggest slide since the
five days ended March 23, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A measure of the dong’s 60-day historical volatility
has fallen to 3.37 percent from this year’s high of 6.53 percent
in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vietnam’s monetary policy, which focuses on “gradually
reducing and stabilizing interest-rate levels and keeping the
exchange rate stable, will continue to be the main force
attracting” bond investors in the second half of 2012, analysts
at Hanoi-based BIDV Securities Co., a unit of Bank for
Investment & Development of Vietnam, wrote in a note today.
