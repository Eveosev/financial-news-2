Corn imports by  Japan , the world’s
largest buyer, will stay at the lowest level since 1986 as
record prices spur feed makers to increase purchases of cheaper
alternatives, a trade group said.  Shipments this year will be little changed from 15.3
million metric tons in 2011, said Mitsuyoshi Haruno,  executive
director  at the Japan Feed Trade Association. Feed makers,
ramping up output hurt by a record earthquake and tsunami last
year, will boost consumption of wheat, wheat bran and dried
distillers’ grains with solubles, or DDGS, he said.  Corn climbed to a record $8 a bushel on July 23, soaring 58
percent from the June 15 settlement, as drought scorched crops
in the U.S., the world’s top producer and exporter, triggering
concern that global food costs will gain. The U.S. government
declared almost 1,300 counties in 29 states are natural-disaster
areas because of the drought.  “A rally in global grains prices has prompted end-users to
search for the most-affordable supply,” said Charlie
Utsunomiya, director at the  Tokyo  office of U.S. Wheat
Associates. “For Japanese feed makers, U.S. white wheat shipped
from the Pacific coast is less expensive than corn exported from
the  Gulf of Mexico  as shipping costs are lower.”  Wheat futures in Chicago advanced to $9.4725 a bushel on
July 23, the highest level since August 2008, as droughts
threaten crops in countries from the U.S. to  Russia . Even so,
U.S. white wheat has been offered to Japanese feed makers at a
discount to Chicago futures as supply is abundant, Utsunomiya
said.  Australia  is also offering feed wheat to corn buyers at
competitive prices, he said.  Feed Wheat  Japan imported 334,349 tons of feed wheat in the first five
months of this year, surging from 62,415 tons in the same period
last year, according to data from the  finance ministry . The U.S.
was the top supplier with 198,699 tons or 59 percent of the
total shipments, followed by Australia with 127,807 tons.  Imports may exceed the plan set by the agriculture ministry
in March to purchase 764,000 tons of feed wheat this fiscal
year, Haruno said. The ministry, which controls overseas
purchases and domestic sales of wheat for supply stability,
bought 420,000 tons in the year ended March 31.  Japan imported 6.51 million tons of corn in the five months
ended May 31, 0.8 percent more than a year earlier, according to
the agriculture ministry. Of the total, grain for feed
production amounted to 4.36 million tons, declining 3.1 percent
from the same period last year. The remainder was used for food,
sweetener and industrial purposes.  Ukraine, Romania  The U.S. supplied 85 percent of Japanese corn imports in
the five months, with Ukraine representing 10 percent and
 Romania  1.2 percent. For the full year, the U.S. ratio may drop
below 80 percent, the lowest-ever level, as Japan will boost
purchases of cheaper South American grains, according to
Nobuyuki Chino, president of Continental Rice Corp. in Tokyo.  Corn represented 45 percent of Japanese livestock feed
produced in the year ended March 31, declining from 47 percent
in the previous fiscal year, said Haruno at Japan Feed Trade
Association. The ratio may drop further this fiscal year to
around 43 percent because of substitution, he said. Wheat’s
ratio may exceed 3 percent from 1.7 percent last fiscal year.  The December-delivery corn contract gained 0.2 percent to
$7.775 a bushel in  Chicago  at 6:14 p.m. Tokyo time today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
