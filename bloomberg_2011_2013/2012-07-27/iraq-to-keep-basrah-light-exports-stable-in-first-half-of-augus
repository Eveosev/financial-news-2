  Iraq  will keep its daily exports of
Basrah Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  little changed in the
first half of August compared with the previous two weeks, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The  nation  will ship 20 cargoes from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, compared with 24 in the first half of this month,
according to the plan. Exports will total 31.58 million barrels,
or 2.11 million barrels a day, compared with 2.10 million a day
two weeks earlier.  The program for the second half of July comprises 11
consignments of 2 million barrels each, six 1 million-barrel
shipments, and one lot each of 1.95 million, 930,000 and 700,000
barrels.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
