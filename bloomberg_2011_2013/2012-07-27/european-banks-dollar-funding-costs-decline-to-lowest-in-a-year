The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars dropped to the lowest in a year, according to
a money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 40 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:38 a.m. in
 London  from 41.5 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
cost is the cheapest since July 26, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 48.5 basis points, or 0.485
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 50 yesterday. Three-
month Euribor, the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in
euros, was set at a record low 0.422 percent yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight indexed
average, or Eonia, was set at a record low 11.2 basis points
yesterday from 11.4 the day before. An estimate of overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, the Eonia OIS swap,
fell to as low as 8.4 basis points from 9.3 at the close
yesterday.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank 
to the lowest since Dec. 21 yesterday, placing 321 billion euros
($394 billion) with the Frankfurt-based ECB from 337 billion
euros on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
