The euro region is ready to provide
Spain with additional assistance from the European Financial
Stability Mechanism following a decision Friday in Brussels to
use the  European Central Bank  to buy up Spanish  government bonds 
from private institutions and other investors,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported.  Preparations have already been made for the ECB to act in
the name of the ESFS as soon Spain submits a request, the
newspaper said in a preview of an article to appear today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
