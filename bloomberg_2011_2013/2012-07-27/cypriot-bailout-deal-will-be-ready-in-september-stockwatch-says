Cyprusâ€™s bailout agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund , the European Union and the  European
Central Bank  will be completed in September,  Stockwatch  said,
citing Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly.  While another two to three months are needed to determine
the amount Cypriot lenders need for a recapitalization, this
will not affect the funding guarantee, the Nicosia-based
financial website quoted Shiarly as saying in an interview.  Cyprus may borrow as much as 11 billion euros ($13.5
billion) from the troika, Stockwatch quoted Shiarly as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
