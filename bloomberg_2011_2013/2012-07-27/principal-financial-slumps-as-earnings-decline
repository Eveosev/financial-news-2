Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
provider of  life insurance  and retirement products, dropped the
most in eight weeks in  New York  trading after second-quarter
profit fell.  Principal  lost  3.2 percent to $24.80 at 9:58 a.m. in New
York trading, the only decline on the 22-company Standard &
Poor’s 500 Insurance Index. The shares have advanced less than 1
percent this year.  Profit fell in Principal’s Retirement and Investor Services
segment amid pressure on fee growth and as lower interest rates
cut into earnings from annuities, the Des Moines, Iowa-based
insurer said in a statement yesterday. The unit posted operating
earnings of $141.7 million in the second quarter, compared to
$154.7 million in the same period a year earlier, as Principal’s
net income available to common stockholder slid 20 percent to
$173.1 million.  “While the cash flow in the businesses was solid and the
asset base grew, all too often this did not translate at
Principal into like revenue growth and like earnings growth,”
 Eric Berg , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a
research note today. Principal “may be facing the margin
squeeze that we and it said wouldn’t happen.”  Editor: Dan Kraut  To contact the reporter on this story:
