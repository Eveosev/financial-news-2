University of Virginia  students
will explore the ouster and reinstatement of the school’s
president,  Teresa Sullivan , in an oral history class that aims
to capture the drama of the 17-day conflict.  Students in the course, which will be taught by two
professors and labeled “ Documenting U.Va.’s Future: Oral
History of the Ouster and Reinstatement ,” will collect
interviews to compile a record of the saga for UVA’s library
archive, according to a  statement  from the Charlottesville-based
university.  “It’s a teachable moment about higher-education policy
issues, about the relationship between democracy and education,
and about students’ roles in their own civic life,” Walter
Heinecke, an associate professor in the Curry School of
Education and one of the professors teaching the course, said in
the statement.  The university was plunged into turmoil on June 10th after
Sullivan was forced to resign without a full vote of the
school’s governing body. She was reinstated by unanimous vote
less than three weeks later following student and faculty
protests and a threat by Governor  Bob McDonnell  to fire the
entire board.  Virginia’s library is gathering items related to the period
of unrest, including student protestors’ signs. Archivist
Gretchen Gueguen has compiled 80,000 tweets, 263 online articles
and 123 blog posts, according to the statement.  The school’s library also plans to hold an exhibit on the
events for students returning in the fall, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
