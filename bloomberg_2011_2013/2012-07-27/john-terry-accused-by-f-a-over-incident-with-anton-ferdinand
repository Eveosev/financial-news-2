England’s Football Association
accused Chelsea captain  John Terry  of using abusive language and
referencing the ethnicity of Queens Park Rangers’ Anton Ferdinand in a game last season.  Terry, 31, was cleared in a  London  court earlier this month
of a criminal charge of racially abusing Ferdinand in an Oct. 23
Premier League match. The FA action relates to rules governing
soccer only, the federation said in a  statement  on its website.  “It is alleged that Terry used abusive and/or insulting
words and/or behavior towards Queens Park Rangers’ Anton
Ferdinand, contrary to FA rules,” the FA said. “It is further 
alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin 
and/or color and/or race of Anton Ferdinand.”  Terry denied the FA claim in a statement on Chelsea’s
website and said he will be “requesting the opportunity to
attend the commission for a personal hearing.”  He testified during that trial that he used the racist
words only to repeat something he thought Ferdinand had accused
him of saying. He had repeatedly denied racially abusing
Ferdinand.  The FA had originally opened a case against Terry after
the incident but placed it on hold when the defender was charged
by prosecutors. The organization stripped Terry of the England
captaincy on Feb. 3, leading to the resignation of national team
coach  Fabio Capello .  The FA said Terry had until Aug. 3 to answer the
allegations and that he remains available to play for the
England national team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
