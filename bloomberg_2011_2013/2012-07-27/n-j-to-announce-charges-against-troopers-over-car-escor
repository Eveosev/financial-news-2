New Jersey’s attorney general said
he will announce criminal charges and disciplinary measures
against troopers involved in “improper state police motor
vehicle escorts.”  Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa and the police
superintendent will also describe new procedures concerning
escorts today in Trenton, the state capital, according to a
statement.  The press conference comes a day after  Charles Sciarra , a
lawyer for a trooper sergeant, acknowledged that his client led
a caravan of Porsches, Lamborghinis and Ferraris on the Garden
State Parkway in March. Sciarra said his client, Nadir Nassry,
faced criminal charges.  According to the lawyer, Nassry led the convoy at the
request of  Brandon Jacobs , a player for the  National Football
League ’s  San Francisco 49ers . The lawyer called Nassry’s
participation “a one-time screw-up” and denied the trooper
engaged in criminal conduct.  Motorists reported two state-police cruisers on March 30
leading a pack of  sports cars  in a “Death Race” convoy at
speeds of 100 miles (160 kilometers) an hour toward Atlantic
City, according to complaints filed with the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority.  Chiesa’s announcement didn’t name the troopers to be
charged or specify the counts or allegations against them.  To contact the reporters on this story:
