Gold futures rose to a five-week
high on speculation that central banks in the U.S. and Europe
will add to stimulus programs in an effort to spur faltering
economies.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  will hold
talks with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann in the coming days
on measures including bond purchases, two central bank officials
said. Yesterday, Draghi said policy makers will do whatever is
needed to save the euro. The  U.S. economy  cooled in the second
quarter, government data showed today.  “It seems the ECB is pulling out at all stops to protect
the euro,”  William O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in
Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview.
“The GDP numbers  provided some support as expectations of some
form of easing remain alive.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,622.70 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,633.30, the highest for a
most-active contract since June 19. This week, the metal rose
2.5 percent, the most since June 1.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that U.S.
policy makers are “looking for ways to address the weakness in
the economy should more action be needed to promote a sustained
recovery in the labor market.”  Bullion surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$27.498 an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $1,408.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery increased 0.3 percent
to $571.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
