The U.S. Treasury Department said
today it expects proceeds of approximately $248.5 million from
the auction of stakes in 12 banks that received taxpayer funds
after the financial crisis.  The Treasury said it priced auctions of preferred stock and
debt positions in the banks in its effort to wind down its
crisis-era bailout programs. The banks include Marquette
National Corp. of Chicago, with about $1.7 billion in assets,
and Exchange Bank of  Santa Rosa ,  California , with about $1.6
billion.  The auctions are part of the Obama administration’s efforts
to get repaid for initiatives such as the Troubled Asset Relief
Program, which Congress approved in 2008 to prevent further
damage from the financial crisis.  “TARP’s bank investment programs were critical to
stabilizing an economy in freefall and have already realized a
nearly $20 billion positive return for taxpayers,” Treasury
Assistant Secretary Tim Massad said in a news release.  The other 10 banks whose Treasury stakes were offered are
CBS Banc-Corp. of Russellville, Alabama; Commonwealth Bancshares
Inc. of Louisville, Kentucky; Diamond Bancorp Inc. of
 Washington , Missouri; Fidelity Financial Corp. of Wichita,
Kansas; First Community Financial of Joliet, Illinois; First
Western Financial Inc. of Denver; Market Street Bancshares Inc.
of Mount Vernon, Illinois; Premier Financial Bancorp Inc. of
Huntington, West Virginia; Park Bancorporation of Madison,
Wisconsin; and Trinity Capital Corp. of Los Alamos,  New Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
