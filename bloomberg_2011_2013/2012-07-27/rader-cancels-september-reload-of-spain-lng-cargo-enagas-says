A cargo of liquefied natural gas due
to reload at an import terminal in  Spain  next week has been
canceled, said  Enagas SA (ENG) , the country’s gas-network manager.  A vessel was due to load 130,000 cubic meters of the
chilled fuel from  storage tanks  at the Huelva import terminal in
southwest Spain from Aug. 2, data published last month on the
Enagas website showed. An updated schedule issued today no
longer includes the loading. Enagas didn’t provide the name of
of the vessel or the charterer.  Two shipments of LNG are still due to be re-exported from
Spain in August. An unidentified vessel is due to load 135,000
cubic meters from Aug. 12 and another ship will take 89,000
cubic meters of the fuel from Aug. 24, according to  Enagas . A
third tanker is slated to load 140,000 cubic meters of LNG in
the nation in September.  The northeast Asian spot LNG price has fallen 24 percent
from a three-year high on May 28 to $13.90 a million British
thermal units this week, World Gas Intelligence said July 25.
That means there’s less incentive for traders to reload cargoes
and ship to markets in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
