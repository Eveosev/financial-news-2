Repower Systems SE said it completed
on time the installation of 30 wind turbines at C-Power NV’s
Thornton Bank project off the Belgian North Sea coast.  Repower, the Hamburg-based unit of  India ’s largest turbine
maker,  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , installed the final 6.15-megawatt
machine of the second construction phase yesterday, it said in a
statement e-mailed today.  Repower will begin installing an additional 18 turbines
next year to raise the farm’s capacity from the current 215
megawatts to 325 megawatts, enough to supply a city the size of
Glasgow, Repower said. C-Power’s shareholders include  RWE AG (RWE) ’s
renewable unit Innogy and EDF Energies Nouvelles SA.  C-Power obtained 869 million euros ($1.1 billion) of debt
to finance Thornton Bank, according to London-based researcher
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. It was the second biggest loan
agreement in the offshore wind industry to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
