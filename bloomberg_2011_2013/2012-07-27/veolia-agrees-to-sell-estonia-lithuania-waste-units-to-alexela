Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  agreed to
sell its waste services businesses in Estonia and Lithuania to
Tallinn-based AS Alexela Energia for an undisclosed sum.  Two companies in Estonia and one in Lithuania had revenue
of more than 30 million euros ($37 million) last year, according
to an e-mailed statement from Veolia and Alexela today. The
sale, which completes Veoliaâ€™s exit from Baltic waste services,
has to be approved by local competition authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
