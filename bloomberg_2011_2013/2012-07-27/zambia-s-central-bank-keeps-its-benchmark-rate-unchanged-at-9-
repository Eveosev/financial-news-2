Zambia’s central bank kept its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 9 percent for the fourth
straight month in July as inflation in Africa’s biggest copper
producer slowed to the lowest level since February.  The central bank “anticipates inflation pressures in
August to be subdued,” the Lusaka-based Bank of Zambia said in
an e-mailed statement today. The central bank introduced the
rate in March.  Inflation in the southern African nation slowed to 6.2
percent in July, the statistics agency said yesterday. Zambia’s
inflation will probably remain near 6 percent this year,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  The country’s economy will probably expand 7.7 percent this
year, reflecting strong growth in copper output and agriculture
other than corn, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
