A Syrian delegation on a visit to
Tehran has signed agreements with  Iran  in the fields of
electricity, health and water,  Syria ’s state-run Sana news
agency said.  The Iranian Energy Ministry and the Syrian Electricity
Ministry signed a memorandum of understanding on supplying Syria
with electricity, importing transmission and distribution
equipment, establishing generating plants and installing
automatic remote reading systems, Sana said.  Another agreement covered the establishment of waste-water
treatment plants and setting up a water resource management plan
in Syria, while officials also discussed sale of medical
equipment and medicine, according to the agency.  Syria has been under international sanctions since last
year because of the government’s crackdown on protests, and has
been seeking to compensate by boosting trade with allied
countries such as Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
