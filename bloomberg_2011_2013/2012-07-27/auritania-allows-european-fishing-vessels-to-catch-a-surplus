Mauritania signed a two-year
fisheries agreement with the European Union worth an annual 70
million euros ($86.5 million), days before a previous accord
expired, according to an EU statement.  A deal was reached late yesterday after “a very long
negotiation process,” the e-mailed statement cited Maria Damanaki, European commissioner for Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries, as saying.  The agreement allows European vessels to catch the
“available surplus” of shrimp, tuna and other pelagic
fisheries in return for financial compensation and jobs for
Mauritanian seamen, according to the statement.  The coastal waters of the impoverished northwest African
nation are among the richest fishing grounds in the world,
according to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s World
Factbook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
