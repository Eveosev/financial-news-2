Gree Inc. (3632)  led a drop among Japanese
operators of social-networking sites in Tokyo trading after
 Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s profit margins narrowed.  Gree,  Japan ’s second-largest social-network gaming site
operator, fell 7.6 percent to close at 1,214 yen, the lowest
since June 4 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  DeNA Co. (2432) , operator of
the Mobage network, plunged 9.7 percent,  Mixi Inc. (2121)  declined 2.5
percent and  Dwango Co. (3715)  dropped 1.6 percent.  Facebook fell in  New York  trading, bringing its decline to
about 29 percent since it went public in May, on concern the
social network’s sales and profit may grow more slowly than some
had expected.  Operating margin, excluding certain costs, was 43 percent
in the second quarter, a decline from 53 percent a year earlier,
amid a fourfold surge in expenses for sales and marketing,
Facebook said yesterday. Payments-related sales were $192
million, below the $199.3 million average prediction from
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  CyberAgent Inc. (4751) , the Tokyo-based operator of the Ameba blog
website, plunged after its fiscal third-quarter operating profit
missed analyst estimates. The stock fell 22 percent, the biggest
drop since April 2000, to 175,900 yen.  Operating profit in the three months ended June 30 rose 8.3
percent to 3.49 billion yen ($44.6 million), CyberAgent said
yesterday. That compared with the 5.2 billion-yen average of
seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
