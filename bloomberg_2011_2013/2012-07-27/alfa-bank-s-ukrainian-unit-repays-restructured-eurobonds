Alfa Bank’s Ukrainian unit repaid
$108.5 million as the eighth and final tranche on its Eurobonds
due 2012.  The Kiev-based PAO Alfa Bank Ukraine paid a coupon of $3.4
million and principal of $105.1 million yesterday, the lender
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Investors agreed in August 2009 to change Alfa Bank’s
Eurobonds maturing in 2009, 2010 and 2011 into new securities
due this year. The bank has repaid a total $841 million of new
Eurobonds, according to the statement.  Alfa Bank “doesn’t exclude” tapping the markets this year
should the “external environment become favorable,” Head of
Treasury Vladimir Lototskyi said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
