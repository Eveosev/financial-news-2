Citizens from Syria, Armenia,  North
Korea , Nigeria, Cuba and Yemen won’t be allowed to buy property
in Turkey even after the government eased restrictions on
foreigners’ property ownership,  Sabah  said.  The government will allow citizens of 129 nations to buy
property unconditionally while those from 52 others will have
limited access to the real estate market, the Istanbul-based
newspaper reported, citing a draft cabinet decree pending the
government’s approval. Easing the restrictions may bring in $300
billion of foreign capital in 10 years, the newspaper said.  The government in May abolished a so-called reciprocity
rule that barred Turkish property purchases by citizens of
countries where Turks can’t buy real estate. The cabinet decree
will enforce that law, Sabah said.  Citizens from China, Denmark,  East Timor , Fiji and Israel
will be able to buy one residential property and a Jordanian
citizen two residential properties or one commercial, Sabah
said. Citizens of countries bordering the  Black Sea  including
Russia and Ukraine may buy property in Turkey except on that
coastline, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
