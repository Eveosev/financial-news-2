U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  needs to come back from the summer break with a
new approach to deal with the continuing financial crisis,
 Richard Lambert  wrote in the Financial Times.  The government must demonstrate its commitment to bring the
deficit under control by “reinforcing a series of bold
structural reforms” in such areas as “pensions policy,
planning and benefits,” the chancellor of the University of
Warwick wrote.  The government has “to give business the confidence it
needs to make major investment, which means above all ending the
policy uncertainty in critically important areas such as
energy,” wrote Lambert, a former director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry.  Osborne’s policies must reflect the short-term requirements
of the economy and the long-term needs of the country through
“a series of one-off fiscal initiatives designed to boost
demand,” Lambert wrote.  The former Financial Times editor endorsed a suggestion of
the  International Monetary Fund  that called for temporary tax
cuts for lower-income households and he said that support for
the construction sector would be a “sensible” policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
