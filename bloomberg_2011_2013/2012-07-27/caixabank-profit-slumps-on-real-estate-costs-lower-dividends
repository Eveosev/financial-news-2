CaixaBank (CABK)  SA,  Spain ’s fourth-biggest
lender, said second-quarter profit fell 78 percent as the
company set aside more money for real estate losses and dividend
income from Telefonica SA declined.  Profit dropped to 118 million euros ($145 million) from 533
million euros a year earlier, the Barcelona-based lender said in
a filing to regulators today. Earnings exceeded the 94.7
million-euro average estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  of five
analysts.  CaixaBank is among Spanish lenders responding to two orders
this year from the government to recognize losses more quickly
on souring real estate assets that piled up on their balance
sheets as the country’s property boom turned to bust. CaixaBank
also said its revenue from dividend payments for stakes in
companies such as  Telefonica (TEF)  fell 41 percent.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending rose to 5.58
percent from 5.25 percent in March and 4.90 percent in December,
the lender said. Loans newly classified as in default jumped to
2.51 billion euros from 1.89 billion euros in the first quarter
and 1.80 billion euros a year ago.  CaixaBank said it took 300 million euros of the 2.1 billion
euros of provisions it needs to take under the government’s
second order in May to banks to clean up real estate and has
until next June to do the rest. It complied with the 2.44
billion euros provisioning requirement from the first real
estate decree in February during the first quarter.  Net interest income climbed 22 percent to 903 million
euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
