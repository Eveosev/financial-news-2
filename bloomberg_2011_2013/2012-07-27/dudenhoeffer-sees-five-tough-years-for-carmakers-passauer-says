Europe ’s car market faces five very
tough years,  Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer , director of the Center for
Automotive Research at the  University of Duisburg-Essen , told
the  Passauer Neue Presse  newspaper.  Carmakers with a strong focus on the European market will
have no choice but to cut jobs and close factories, the
newspaper cited Dudenhoeffer as saying in an advance copy of an
article.  German carmakers, with the exception of  General Motors (GM) ’
Opel unit, will get off lightly and strengthen their position in
Europe, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
