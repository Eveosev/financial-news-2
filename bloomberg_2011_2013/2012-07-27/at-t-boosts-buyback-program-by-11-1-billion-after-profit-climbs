AT&T Inc. (T) , the biggest U.S.
telephone company, said its board authorized a repurchase of as
much as $11.1 billion in stock, doubling a buyback program the
company announced in December 2010.  The effort will include as many as 300 million shares, or
about 5 percent of the stock outstanding, Dallas-based AT&T said
yesterday in a statement. The 2010 buyback plan also amounted to
as many as 300 million.  “This action allows us to continue returning cash to our
shareholders through dividends and buybacks while maintaining a
strong balance sheet and investing in the future of our
business,”  Randall Stephenson , the company’s chairman and chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  AT&T is increasing its shareholder rewards after posting a
net income gain of 8.7 percent last quarter. The company added
320,000 monthly contract customers in the period -- a smaller
number than a year earlier. While the decline hurt sales growth,
it meant AT&T doled out fewer dollars in mobile-phone subsidies
to customers, boosting profit.  AT&T climbed as much as 1.7 percent in extended trading
yesterday after the announcement. The shares, up 23 percent this
year, rose 2.3 percent to $37.14 during  regular trading .  Earlier Program  Under the previous repurchase agreement, AT&T has bought
back 143.5 million shares through June 30, the company said.
That amounted to $4.6 billion. Including  dividends , AT&T said it
has returned almost $10 billion to investors in the first half.  The rewards have contributed to a shrinking cash pile at
AT&T this year. Cash and equivalents fell to $2.15 billion at
the end of last quarter, down from $3.19 billion at the end of
2011. Even so, the company has been cutting back on capital
spending and trying to jettison slower-growth businesses.  Second-quarter capital spending fell 15 percent to $4.48
billion from a year earlier. In May, AT&T completed the sale of
its Yellow Pages directory unit to Cerberus Capital Management
LP for $950 million.  Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a conference
call this week that  capital spending  would “tick up” again in
the second half of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
