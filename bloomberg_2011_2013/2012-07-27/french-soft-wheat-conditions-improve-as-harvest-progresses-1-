French soft wheat rated as good or
excellent advanced to 71 percent in the week through July 23
from 70 percent a week earlier, crop office FranceAgriMer said.  Farmers had harvested 25 percent of the crop, up from 8
percent cut as of July 16 and compared with 64 percent
completion at the same time last year, according to  data 
published by the crop office today.  The corn crop was 77 percent rated good or excellent,
climbing 2 percentage points from a week earlier. The crop was
61 percent flowering, double the 30 percent a week earlier and
compared with 96 percent flowering at the same time in 2011.  France  is the European Unionâ€™s largest grower of wheat and
corn. Weather has become drier in the past two weeks after
months of rain, speeding up crop development and allowing
farmers to accelerate harvesting.  The ratings compare with 30 percent rated good or excellent
for wheat and 68 percent for corn last year at this time, when a
spring drought hurt winter-grain production.  Durum wheat was stable with 63 percent rated good or
excellent, while spring barley was unchanged at 80 percent. The
crop office discontinued its reporting of winter-barley
conditions with 97 percent of the crop harvested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
