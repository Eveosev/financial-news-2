Russia’s government may intervene on
the grain market, which has been affected by drought,  Interfax 
reported, citing Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov.  The government may sell grain from inventories to control
prices in the regions with the worst problems, not in the whole
country, according to the Interfax report.  The Agricultural Ministry doesn’t know what the estimated
losses are yet and any interventions would need government
approval, the newswire said, citing Fedorov.  A representative of the ministry’s press office, who
declined to be identified, wouldn’t provide any additional
comments when contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
