Romania plans to change its public
debt law from 2013 and introduce three debt thresholds, which if
exceeded, would trigger automatic budget restrictions, Ziarul
Financiar  reported today , citing Deputy Finance Minister  Liviu
Voinea .  The  finance ministry  wants to add three net-debt growth
thresholds at 35 percent of gross domestic product, 40 percent
and 45 percent, Voinea told the Bucharest-based newspaper. If
the 35 percent of GDP debt level is exceeded, it will trigger a
cap on public spending growth in line with inflation.  The 40 percent threshold would trigger a rule to balance
local administration budgets and restrict government transfers,
while the 45 percent ceiling would stop the government from
granting subsidies and state aid, according to Ziarul Financiar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
