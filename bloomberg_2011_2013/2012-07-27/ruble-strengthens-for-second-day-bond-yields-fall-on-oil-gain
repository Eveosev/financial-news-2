The ruble appreciated for a second
day against the dollar and yields on  Russia ’s international debt
declined as oil, the country’s main export, rose.  The Russian currency gained 0.3 percent to 32.1956 per
dollar as of 5:46 p.m. in Moscow, extending yesterday’s 1.4
percent advance. The country’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due
April 2020 climbed for a fourth day, cutting the yield by 11
basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.162 percent.  Brent crude  rose 0.7 percent to $105.91 per barrel after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  predicted the euro
will survive and reports signaled improving economic prospects
in the U.S. and  China . The ruble moved between gains and losses
against the dollar earlier in the day as investors scrambled to
cut short positions in the currency after the ECB statement,
according to Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign exchange at
Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow.  “It was like a train whose driver didn’t know where to
go,” he said by e-mail. “After Draghi’s comments everybody
felt happy with commodities and emerging-market currencies, and
the markets were not ready with their positions.”  The ruble gained less than 0.1 percent to 39.6752 per euro
and 0.2 percent to 35.5657 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency
weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
32.7125 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 32.8763 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
