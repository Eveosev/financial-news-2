Greek bank workers will hold a 24-
hour warning strike on July 30 to protest decisions being made
by international creditors and the government that may result in
job losses.  The government “must realize it doesn’t have the ethical
or political right to show weakness, ignore the historical
moment for Greek banks and succumb to the pressures of the
creditors,” OTOE, the bank union federation, said in a faxed
statement today.  OTOE said Greek banks, including state-controlled
 Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA and  Hellenic Postbank (TT)  SA, should
all be recapitalized and jobs guaranteed.  Lenders need recapitalizing after suffering losses on their
holdings of  government bonds  in a debt swap. Mergers would
reduce costs and make banks more attractive to investors,
Panayotis Thomopoulos, who heads the Hellenic Financial
Stability Fund, said on July 2.  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras formed a three-party
coalition government after the second election in six weeks on
June 17. He was briefed by European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials today on what they want done to bring
 Greece ’s reform program back on track, government spokesman
Simos Kedikoglou said on NET TV. Disbursement of bailout funds
is linked to implementation of the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
