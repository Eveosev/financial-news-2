JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman  Jamie Dimon  said he intends to keep running
the New York-based bank for many years after shuffling top
managers today.  “There’s no immediate succession in this,” Dimon, 56,
said in an interview. “I obviously serve at the pleasure of the
board, it’s completely up to them, but I would hope it’s many,
many more years” that he’s allowed to remain, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
