Italian business confidence declined
this month more than economists forecast as executives became
more concerned that the country’s economic recession will deepen
in coming months.  The manufacturing-sentiment  index  dropped to 87.1 from a
revised 88.7 in June, Rome-based national statistics institute
Istat said today. Economists had predicted a reading of 88.5,
according to the median of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Istat originally reported a reading for June business
confidence of 88.9.  Italy’s economy shrank for a third straight quarter in the
first three months of 2012 as the region’s debt crisis worsened
and Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity measures pushed the
country deeper into its fourth recession since 2001.  Industrial output in the euro region’s third-biggest
economy probably fell 1.7 percent in the three months through
June from the previous quarter as orders dropped, Rome-based
employers lobby Confindustria said in a note yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
