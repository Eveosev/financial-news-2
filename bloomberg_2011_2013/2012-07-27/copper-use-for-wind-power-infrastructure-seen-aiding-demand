Copper usage in  wind turbines  and
other renewable-energy products will help drive demand for the
metal, according to Bernd Langner, a former member of producer
Aurubis AG’s board.  Infrastructure projects in emerging economies and demand
from top global copper consumer China also will continue to fuel
usage, according to Langner. A windmill contains about 8 metric
tons of copper, with a further 5 to 8 tons needed for power
connections, he said.  Langner, author of  “Understanding Copper,”  spoke in a
telephone interview yesterday from Winsen (Luhe),  Germany .  On copper demand:  “Infrastructure, China will drive copper demand. Renewable
energy is also a big factor.  “The prospect for copper is good, of course driven by
China. The use of copper is a question of infrastructure -- new
lines, cables, transporting, power. Infrastructure projects in
the emerging countries and especially in  China  -- the copper
consumption will be high and also the increase will be high.”  On copper substitution:  “The danger for copper is not substitution that may occur
in one or two or three years, but maybe in five or 10 years.
Everybody is working on new systems with aluminum. When they
come on stream, they may take several years and it is very
difficult to go back to copper.  “The danger for copper is not only the copper price, but
also high volatility for copper. High volatility of the copper
price is more important for substitution than a high copper
price that you can rely on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
