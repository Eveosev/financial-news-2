BP Plc (BP/) ,  Eni (ENI)  SpA and  Standard
Chartered  Plc are among 24 companies in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index that may raise their dividends next week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  BP, Europe’s second-largest oil producer, might boost its
payout to shareholders by 14 percent to 7 cents a share,
according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that factor in
earnings and options prices. Eni, Italy’s biggest oil company,
could increase its dividend by 1.9 percent to 53 euro cents.
 Standard Chartered (STAN) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by market
value, will raise its interim payout by 12 percent to 27.8 cents
per share.  Companies in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  may boost shareholder payouts by
11 percent in the next 12 months, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings are forecast to grow
55 percent in that period.  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) , the maker of Dettol handwash,
will probably raise its interim dividend next week, by 3.6
percent to 57 pence, while  Shire Plc (SHP) , the Dublin-based maker of
Adderall, may do so by 21 percent to 2.9 cents.  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,
Europe’s biggest weapons maker, could boost its dividend by 5.3
percent to 7.9 pence.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
might cut its payout by 13 percent to 18.2 cents.  The Stoxx 600 has lost 0.2 percent so far this week amid
worse-than-expected economic data in the U.S. and Europe, and as
Spanish bond yields surged above 7 percent, reigniting concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is yet to be contained. The gauge
advanced 0.4 percent to 257.71 at 12:54 p.m. in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
