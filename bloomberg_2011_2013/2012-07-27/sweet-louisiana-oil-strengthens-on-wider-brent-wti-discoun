Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
strengthened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent oil widened.  WTI’s discount versus Brent grew 47 cents to $16.34 a
barrel based on September settlement prices. When Brent gains
versus WTI, it usually strengthens the value of U.S. grades that
compete with foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  The premium of Light Louisiana Sweet to the U.S. benchmark
added 80 cents to $17.40 a barrel at 2:26 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
was unchanged at $17 per barrel.  Poseidon’s  premium  gained $1.10 cents to $11.60 a barrel,
while Mars Blend increased 95 cents to $12 a barrel over WTI.
Southern Green Canyon’s premium rose 55 cents to $10.30.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, narrowed its premium
by 50 cents to trade at $13.75.  Bakken oil’s discount to WTI widened 75 cents to $4.75 a
barrel. Western Canada Select’s declined 50 cents to $20.  Syncrude trimmed its discount by 25 cents versus WTI to
$3.25. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen
in  Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
