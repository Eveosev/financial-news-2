Petroleos Mexicanos , the world’s
fourth-largest oil producer, reported a second-quarter loss as
higher costs offset an increase in revenue.  Pemex, as the state-owned company is known, had a net loss
of 25.9 billion pesos ($1.94 billion) for the three months
through June compared with a 16 billion-peso profit a year
earlier, the Mexico City-based company said today in a statement
to the Mexican Stock Exchange.  Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  is
struggling to halt seven years of production declines amid a
lack of shallow-water rigs. Pemex produced 2.54 million barrels
a day during the quarter. Sales rose to 406 billion pesos from
393 billion pesos a year ago, while the cost of sales climbed
9.9 percent and general expenses jumped 40 percent. The company
also reported 42.3 billion pesos of “negative financing,”
without elaborating.  Suarez Coppel is maintaining the state oil producer’s
forecasts to produce more than last year’s daily average of 2.55
million barrels. Pemex will reach daily production of 3 million
barrels by about 2017, he said.  Pemex has “several wells coming online in the second
half,” Suarez Coppel said July 20 in an interview at
Bloomberg’s  New York  headquarters. Pemex has faced a shortage of
shallow-water drilling rigs, known as jack-ups, delaying the
output increase, Suarez Coppel said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
