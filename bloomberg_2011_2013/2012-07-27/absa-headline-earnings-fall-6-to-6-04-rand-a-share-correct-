Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said profit declined 8.6
percent after it set aside more money for bad loans.  Net income dropped to 4.19 billion rand ($508 million) in
the six months through June from 4.58 billion rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender said in a statement
today. Earnings per share excluding one-time items fell 6
percent to 6.04 rand, less than the median estimate of 6.20 rand
by three analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Credit impairments
increased 39 percent to 4.02 billion rand, raising the group’s
credit-loss ratio to 1.59 percent from 1.16 percent.  It was these higher credit impairments, “particularly in
mortgages, that were the principal reason headline earnings
declined,” Absa said in the statement.  Amid an exodus of executives since Chief Executive Officer
 Maria Ramos  took over in 2009, Absa has slowed lending. Unlike
 FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  and  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Absa hasn’t
expanded in  Africa  and is still integrating its African
operations seven years after Barclays took a stake. Barclays CEO
 Robert Diamond , who saw African expansion as a way to boost
returns, resigned July 3 after the U.K. bank was fined for
attempting to manipulate the London interbank offered rate.  Net interest income rose 2 percent to 11.9 billion rand,
and the bank raised its dividend by 7.9 percent to 3.15 rand a
share. Its return on equity decreased to 13.8 percent, which is
above its cost of equity, from 16.2 percent.  Rates Cut  “Pre-provisioning results were in-line with expectation,
and the 8 percent increase in dividend will come as some relief
to shareholders,” Greg Saffy, banks analyst at RMB Morgan
Stanley in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  South Africa ’s 50 basis-point interest rate cut this month
will cost Absa about 190 million rand in income, Finance
Director David Hodnett, said on the same call. Cost cutting will
continue, Ramos said, with “the bulk” of the impact on staff
coming in the form of natural attrition rather than job cuts.  “With moderate economic growth, Absa’s credit-loss ratio
is expected to be in the region of 1.4 percent in 2012,” Absa
said. “Revenue growth is likely to remain subdued this year.
There are signs that consumers are starting to take strain.”  Absa is the only lender on the six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa
Banks Index (JBNKS)  to decline this year, dropping 1 percent. The index
is up 21 percent. Absa rose 3 percent to 139.70 rand by the
close in Johannesburg, while the index jumped 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
