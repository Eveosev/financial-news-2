Aon Plc (AON) , the world’s largest
insurance broker, gained the most since August as revenue
excluding currency fluctuations and acquisitions climbed.  Aon climbed  5.7 percent  to $49.15 at 10:19 a.m. in New
York. So-called organic revenue jumped 4 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the London-based broker, which has
its Americas headquarters in Chicago, said today in a statement.  Aon, led by Chief Executive Officer Greg Case, stands to
gain as insurers boost prices they charge businesses for
coverage, since the broker earns a commission on policies sold.
Property-casualty insurers increased rates by 4 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, according to MarketScout
data compiled by Bloomberg. Natural disaster losses and low
 interest rates  on investments led underwriters to charge higher
prices in 2011, reversing six years of declines.  “Aon remains well positioned for strong earnings growth as
commercial lines pricing improves,”  Meyer Shields , an analyst
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a report to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
