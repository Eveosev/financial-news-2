South Korea ’s Im Dong-Hyun, who is
legally blind, broke the first world record at the London
Olympics during the men’s individual archery event today.  Im scored 699 in the 72-arrows ranking round of the
competition at Lord’s Cricket Ground. That beat his previous
record of 696 set in May in Antalya,  Turkey .  “This is just the first round so I will not get too
excited by it,” the 26-year-old told the Olympic News Service.  The score also helped South Korea set a world record in the
team event of 2,087 points. His teammates Kim Bubmin, who scored
698, and Oh Jin-Hyek came second and third in the men’s
individual round.  Im has 20/100 vision in his right eye and 20/200 in his
left eye, meaning that he is legally blind in his left eye,
according to the news service. He won gold medals in the team
events at the Beijing and Athens games.  Larry Godfrey, a 36-year-old Briton, qualified fourth in
the individual event with a score of 680, while  France  came
second in the team competition with 2,021.  To contact the reporters on this story:
