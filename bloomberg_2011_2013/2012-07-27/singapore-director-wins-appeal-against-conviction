Peter Madhavan, the first
independent director in Singapore to be sentenced to jail, won
an appeal against his conviction for his role in filing
misleading regulatory statements from Airocean Group Ltd.  “Airocean was far from being reckless in any sense of the
word,” Singapore Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong said in a 117-
page ruling today. “Airocean acted properly and prudently in
seeking legal advice on whether or not to disclose what it
knew.”  Madhavan was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to four months
in jail for making misleading statements related to the
company’s chief executive officer being in a corruption probe.  The appeals case is Madhavan Peter v Public Prosecutor.
