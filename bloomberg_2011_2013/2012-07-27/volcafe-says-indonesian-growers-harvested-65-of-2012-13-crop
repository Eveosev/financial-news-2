Coffee growers in  Indonesia , the
third-biggest robusta producer, harvested almost 65 percent of
the 2012-13 crop under way there, according to Volcafe, the
coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Indonesian output will climb to 9.7 million bags in the
season that started in April, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
estimates. That’s up from 8.3 million bags a year earlier. A bag
of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  The “harvest is in full swing” and daily coffee arrivals
have improved, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in
a weekly report to clients e-mailed today. “Roasters’ demand
for robusta has been firm,” it added.  Bean arrivals at Indonesian ports were 12,750 metric tons
to 14,000 tons this week, Volcafe said. That’s up from 9,500
tons to 10,500 tons a week earlier, it said in a July 20 report.  Buyers of beans from Indonesia for August and September
shipments were paying a premium of $30 a ton to the price on the
NYSE Liffe exchange in London, unchanged from last week, data
from the trader showed.  In  Vietnam , the world’s biggest robusta grower, buyers’
interest in purchasing beans for the season that starts in
October is beginning much earlier than usual, the trader said in
the report. The weather has been good and beans are developing
“well” for the new crop, according to the report.  “When we see that the 26 million-bag current crop was
wolfed down by a coffee world hungry for robusta, the sprint to
bag some new crop seems understandable,” Volcafe said.  Buyers of Vietnamese beans for shipment in August and
September were paying a premium of $40 a ton above the exchange
price, unchanged from the previous week, the trader said. Higher
prices on NYSE Liffe encouraged selling, it said.  “Local exporters are keen to see bids for August and
September shipments in order to clean the warehouse,” Volcafe
said. Robusta coffee for September delivery advanced 2 percent
to $2,254 a ton by 3:07 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
