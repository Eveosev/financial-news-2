Treasuries fell for a third day amid
speculation major central banks from the  Federal Reserve  to the
 Bank of Japan  will boost measures to revive the global economy.  Two-year notes headed for a weekly decline after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday officials
will do whatever is necessary to preserve the euro, boosting
demand for higher-yielding assets. The decline in Treasuries was
tempered before a U.S. report forecast to show economic growth
slowed in the second quarter.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.46 percent at 8:19 a.m. London time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  The 1.75 percent
note maturing in May 2022 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face
amount, to 102 21/32.  Two-year yields were little changed at 0.23 percent, having
increased three basis points this week.  U.S. government securities have returned 1.4 percent this
month as of yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it
takes to preserve the euro,” Draghi said in a speech in  London .
“And believe me, it will be enough.”  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 1.4 percent annual
rate after a 1.9 percent gain in the prior quarter, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Consumer purchases, which
account for about 70 percent of the world’s largest economy, may
have grown at the weakest pace in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
