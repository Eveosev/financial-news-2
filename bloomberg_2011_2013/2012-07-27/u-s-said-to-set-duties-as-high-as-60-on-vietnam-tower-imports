The U.S. Commerce Department set
tariffs as high as 60 percent on imports of wind towers from
Vietnam, a person familiar with the decision said.  The agency today made preliminary findings in its
investigation to determine whether producers in the nation
are selling utility-scale wind towers in the U.S. below
production costs, according to the person who declined to be
identified before the agency announces the decision.  The department is investiging a complaint filed by U.S.
manufacturers including  Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN)  of Naperville,
 Illinois .  To contact the reporter on this story:
