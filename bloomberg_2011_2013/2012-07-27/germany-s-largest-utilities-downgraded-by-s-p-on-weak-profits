Germany ’s two largest utilities were
downgraded by credit agency  Standard & Poor’s  as falling power
prices worsen the outlook for profits.  EON AG (EOAN) , the country’s biggest utility, was downgraded one
level to A-, the fourth-lowest investment grade.  RWE AG (RWE)  was cut
to BBB+ from A-, S&P said in statements today.  At RWE, Standard & Poor gave poor power prices, loss-making
gas supply contracts and slow progress in a 7 billion-euro ($8.7
billion) disposal program as reasons for the downgrade. Fitch
also cut the credit rating of Germany’s second-largest utility
today, to A- from A.  German wholesale power for delivery next year has dropped
17 percent this year as the European’s economic crisis cuts
regional demand for electricity.  “RWE is in a good position to access the  bond market  at
attractive conditions at all times,” Rolf Pohlig, RWE’s chief
financial officer, said in a statement the company published
today. “We assume that this will continue to be the case.”  EON didn’t return a call for comment immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
