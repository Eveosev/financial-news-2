The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment declined,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 6 basis points to 167 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge, which has traded between 161.5 basis points and
175.3 basis points this month, is headed for its lowest close
since July 20, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 8 basis points to
177 as of 10:48 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The index is on track for its biggest one-day drop since
July 2 and its lowest close since July 20, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 6 basis points to 184
basis points as of 9:27 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index has risen from 178 basis points at the start of
the month, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
