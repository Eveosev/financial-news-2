LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ’s
Houston refinery ran an average of 267,000 barrels of crude a
day during the second quarter, Chief Executive Officer Jim Gallogly said during the company’s earnings call.  The refinery has run some lighter oil from the U.S. Midwest
to take advantage of West Texas Intermediate’s discount to
Brent, Gallogly said from the company’s office in Houston.  The plant has “done a few things to get some barrels” of
heavy Canadian  crude oil , Gallogly said. He said he expects
larger volumes of Canadian oil to reach the Gulf Coast in 2014.  The refinery has the capacity to run 302,300 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
