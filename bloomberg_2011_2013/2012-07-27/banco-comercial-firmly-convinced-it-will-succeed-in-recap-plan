Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  is
“firmly convinced” it will carry out its recapitalization plan
successfully, Chief Executive Officer Nuno Amado said at a press
conference in Lisbon today.  The lender has the capacity to repay loans it receives from
the Portuguese state and is confident a capital increase
scheduled for September will be fully subscribed by
shareholders, Amado said. The capital increase is expected to be
completed by the end of September, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
