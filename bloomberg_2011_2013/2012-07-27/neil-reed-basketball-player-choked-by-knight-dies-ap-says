Neil Reed, the former Indiana
University basketball player who was choked by coach  Bob Knight 
15 years ago, died from heart complications at his California
home, the  Associated Press  said. He was 36.  Pioneer Valley High School Principal Shanda Herrera said
Reed died yesterday in Nipomo, California, AP reported.  In March 2000, Reed accused Knight of choking him during a
practice in 1997, AP said. Knight, who was placed on a zero-
tolerance policy after a video showed the incident, was fired
when a student accused him of grabbing his arm.  Reed had coached football, basketball, golf and physical
education since 2007 at Pioneer Valley High in  Santa Maria ,
California, AP said, citing Herrera.  “The shock of the passing of Neil Reed and the sadness we
feel for his wife, two daughters and entire family is
overwhelming,” Indiana coach Tom Crean posted on his Twitter
account yesterday. “Tragic news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
