EON AG, Germany’s largest utility,
still expects its venture with  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  to build a coal-
fired power plant in northern Chile after a court on July 24
upheld an injunction against the development.  “We are optimistic the permission will be maintained,”
Josef Nelles, an EON spokesman, said today by phone.  Local residents challenged approval obtained by EON and MPX
to build the plant after concerns over damage to health, and the
companies have “little chance” of retaining permission for the
project, Financial Times Deutschland said without citing anyone.
EON rose 0.5 percent to 17.075 euros by 2:47 p.m. in Frankfurt.  The Castilla project, with capacity of 2,100 megawatts, is
part of a planned installation of 11,000 megawatts in Chile and
Brazil by the EON-MPX venture. MPX is 48.1 percent owned by
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , according to data Bloomberg
compiled. EON, which acquired an 11.7 percent stake in MPX by
July, plans to expand in  South America  through their venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
