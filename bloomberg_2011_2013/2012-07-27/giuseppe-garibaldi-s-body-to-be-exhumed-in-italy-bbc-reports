The body of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the
19th century military leader who played a key role in the
unification of  Italy , is to be exhumed after his descendants
raised doubts about its true location, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported.  The exhumation will be carried out at the end of September
at his tomb on an island near Sardinia, the  BBC  said, without
saying where it the got the information. The authorities gave
permission after Culture Minister Lorenzo Ornaghi backed a
request by Garibaldi’s family, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
