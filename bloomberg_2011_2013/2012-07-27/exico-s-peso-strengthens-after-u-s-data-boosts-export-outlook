Mexico ’s peso rose for a third day
after the  U.S. economy  expanded at a faster pace than analysts
forecast, boosting the outlook for the Latin American country’s
exports.  The peso climbed 1.3 percent to 13.2393 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, bringing its rally this year to 5.3
percent, the biggest among the most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The peso last rose for three straight days in the
period ending July 17. Today’s advance left the peso up 0.9
percent this week.  Mexico depends on exports for about 30 percent of its gross
domestic product, and sends 80 percent of them to its northern
neighbor. U.S. GDP rose at a higher-than-forecast 1.5 percent
annual rate last quarter after a revised 2 percent gain in the
prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 1.4 percent increase.  The currency extended gains as optimism rose that  Europe ’s
policy makers will act to ease the region’s debt crisis.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  will hold
talks with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann in an effort to
overcome the biggest stumbling block to a new raft of measures
including bond purchases, two central bank officials said on
condition of anonymity because the talks are private.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.38 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 1.06
centavo to 141.71 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
