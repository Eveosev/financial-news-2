Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and BG Group
Plc had their license for an offshore oil block in Brazil’s
Santos basin canceled, Upstream reported on its website.  The country’s oil regulator, known as ANP, withdrew the
license for the BM-5-52 block after an evaluation plan for the
Corcovado-1 discovery in the area wasn’t approved, Upstream
reported, citing a person that it didn’t identify.  Officials at BG and the ANP didn’t reply to e-mails and
telephone calls. An official at Petrobras’s press office
referred all questions to BG, which operates the block, and to
the ANP in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
