SEB Asset Management AG (S3EA) , which plans
to sell Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz as it liquidates the ImmoInvest
portfolio, found a new tenant for one of the complex’s buildings
to replace  Daimler AG. (DAI)   Hubert Burda Media Holding GmbH & Co., the German publisher
of Focus and Bunte magazines, will use Potsdamer Strasse 7 as
its Berlin offices, Frankfurt-based SEB Asset Management said in
a statement today. Daimler is the largest tenant in SEB Asset
Management’s most expensive property.  SEB ImmoInvest, a 6 billion-euro ($7.4 billion) property
mutual fund, will be wound up within five years after investors
asked for redemptions that exceeded its liquidity, according to
a May statement. ImmoInvest is the largest of seven German
mutual funds that have been forced to liquidate after failing to
meet invest redemption requests.  SEB Asset Management is a unit of  Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken AB (SEBA) , a Stockholm-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
