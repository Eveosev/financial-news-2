Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
 U.S. bank  by assets, is following  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in
hosting its first-ever conference call for fixed-income
investors.  Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, will host the call
at 8 a.m. New York time on Aug. 3 with Treasurer David Russo and
Tom Wipf, head of resource management, the New York-based firm
said today in a statement.  Porat has spoken in recent presentations about changes in
the firm’s funding profile and liquidity reserve as the company
seeks to reassure debtholders of Morgan Stanley, which has the
highest priced credit-default swaps among the nation’s biggest
banks. The firm cut its outstanding debt by $21 billion in the
past 12 months and doubled common equity since 2007, according
to Porat.  Goldman Sachs held its call, hosted by Treasurer Elizabeth “Liz” Beshel Robinson and CFO David A. Viniar, on July 24.
Robinson told investors that the firm may not issue long-term
debt to match the $11.8 billion it has in second-half maturities
and detailed efforts to boost deposits.  Citigroup Inc., the third-largest U.S. bank, holds a
conference call for fixed-income investors every quarter a few
days after reporting earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
