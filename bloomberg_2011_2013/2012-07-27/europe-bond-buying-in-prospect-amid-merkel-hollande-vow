German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Francois Hollande  said their countries are
“bound by the deepest duty” to keep the euro area intact and
that they will do “everything” necessary to protect the single
currency.  In a joint statement made after a telephone conference
today, Merkel and Hollande added that the 17 members of the euro
as well as institutions must fulfil their commitments “within
their own areas of competence.”  France and Germany both seek “quick” implementation of
resolutions made at a June 28-29 European Union summit, the
statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
