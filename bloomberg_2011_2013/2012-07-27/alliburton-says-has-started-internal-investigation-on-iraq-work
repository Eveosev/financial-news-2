Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the world’s second-
largest oilfield services provider, has begun internal
investigations into its operations in Angola and  Iraq .  The probes are looking at payments made to third-party
agents related to customs matters in Angola and Iraq, as well as
visa issues in Iraq, Houston-based Halliburton said today in a
federal filing.  Halliburton alerted U.S. Justice Department and Securities
and Exchange officials during the second quarter that it had
begun the inquiry after meeting with them about another internal
investigation the company has under way about possible
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA.  Halliburton has previously said it received an anonymous e-
mail in December 2010 alleging that current and former employees
violated Halliburton’s own business-conduct codes and the FCPA,
mainly through its dealings with an Angolan vendor. The e-mail
has alleged “conflicts of interest, self-dealing and the
failure to act on alleged violations,” Halliburton has said in
federal filings.  Halliburton  rose  3.3 percent to $33.62 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
