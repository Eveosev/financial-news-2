Rhoen Klinikum AG (RHK)  fell the most in
two weeks after lowering its net-income forecast because of a
slowdown in the restructuring of a German hospital unit and
costs from Fresenius SE’s failed takeover bid for the company.  Rhoen Klinikum dropped as much as 2.8 percent to 17.35
euros, the biggest intraday decline since July 12, and was
trading down 1.4 percent at 9:51 a.m. in  Frankfurt . That pared
the stock’s gain this year to 20 percent.  Profit will be 117 million euros ($143.7 million) in 2012
and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
will be 315 million euros, with both forecasts subject to a
variation of plus or minus 5 percent, the Bad Neustadt an der
Saale, Germany-based hospital operator said in a  statement 
today. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict net income of 144
million euros and Ebitda of 341.6 million euros, on average.  Sales will amount to 2.85 billion euros, plus or minus 2.5
percent, in line with a previous forecast, the company said.
Rhoen Klinikum previously predicted 2012 profit of 145 million
euros and Ebitda of 350 million euros.  Reorganization at the University Hospital Giessen & Marburg
has slowed, “which is why its trend in earnings of late has
been lagging well behind expectations,” Rhoen Klinikum said.
Higher wage increases in the hospital industry and a “steady
deterioration in prices” also are hurting profit, the company
said.  The 3.1 billion-euro acquisition offer by Fresenius led to
costs in the several million euros for consulting fees, Rhoen
Klinikum said.  Fresenius said on June 29 that another hospital operator,
Asklepios Kliniken GmbH, took a 5 percent stake in Rhoen
Klinikum, triggering trading on June 27 that interfered with
acceptance and settlement of the offer. About 84 percent of
Rhoen Klinikum shares were tendered, and the 22.50-euro-a-share
offer was contingent on winning at least 90 percent of the
stock,  Bad Homburg , Germany-based Fresenius said.  Combining Fresenius’s Helios hospital unit with Rhoen
Klinikum would have cemented Helios’s position atop the German
market, leaving Asklepios as the second-biggest operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
