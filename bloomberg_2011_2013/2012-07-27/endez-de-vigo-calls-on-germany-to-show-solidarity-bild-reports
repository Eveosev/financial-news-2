Inigo Mendez de Vigo,  Spain ’s
Minister for European Affairs, called on  Germany  to show more
commitment and solidarity to resolving the euro crisis,  Bild 
reported in a preview of an interview to appear today.  Germany benefits from exports within the European Union
more than any other country, the newspaper cited the official as
saying. Within a historical context, Mendez de Vigo said, other
countries assisted Germany after World War II while renouncing
reparations, the newspaper reported.  The minister also warned German politicians about “talking
Greece into bankruptcy” and rejected the possibility that Spain
will require assistance from the European Financial Stability
Facility, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
