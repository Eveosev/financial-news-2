Madagascan police deported former
president  Marc Ravalomanana â€™s wife from the country the same day
she landed at the airport in the capital, Antananarivo, their
son, Tojo Ravalomanana, said.  Police held Lalao Ravalomanana for two-and-a-half hours
before putting her on the next flight out of Ivato airport,
which was to Guangzhou in  China , the son said in an interview at
the terminal today.  Marc Ravalomanana has sought to return to his homeland and
resolve a political crisis triggered by his departure three-and-
a-half years ago, when his army-backed rival Andry Rajoelina
took over. Rajoelina and Ravalomanana met in Seychelles on July
24 for South African-mediated talks to end the impasse.  To contact the reporters on this story:
