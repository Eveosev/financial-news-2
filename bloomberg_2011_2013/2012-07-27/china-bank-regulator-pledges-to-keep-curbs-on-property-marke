China ’s banking regulator said it
will “decisively” enforce the government’s property curbs in
the second half of this year and enhance risk management of real
estate lending.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission will seek to “more
effectively” support stable economic growth, according to a
 statement  on its website yesterday. The watchdog pledged to
boost lending to key construction projects, small businesses and
affordable housing.  “Active progress was achieved in preventing and containing
risks in real estate loans” in the first half because the CBRC
“strictly curbed” lending to heavily indebted developers, the
regulator said, without elaborating.  China’s two-year effort to curb the  property market  has
included raising down-payment and mortgage requirements,
imposing property taxes for the first time in Shanghai and
Beijing, increasing building of low-cost social housing, and
imposing home purchase restrictions in about 40 cities.  Home prices  rose in the most cities tracked by the
government in 11 months in June, as housing sales rebounded
after some local governments loosened restrictions, fueling
expectations that policies aimed at stemming speculation may be
eased to help arrest an  economic slowdown .  The commission will support “reasonable” real estate
lending, with priorities given to households’ first home
mortgages and the development of smaller, lower-priced units,
and affordable housing, including public rental and shantytown
renovation projects, according to the statement.  Elsewhere in the government, the  finance ministry  won’t
relax property curbs even as it plans to bolster spending on
areas including  job creation , education and medical services,
according to a statement on its website on July 26.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
