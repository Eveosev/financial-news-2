About 1.6 million Zimbabweans need
food assistance this year, 60 percent more than a year ago, as
the country’s cereal harvest fell to the lowest since 2009, the
United Nations  World Food Programme  said.  This year’s crop was 1.08 million metric tons, a third less
than last year, the Rome-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today. Reasons for the decline include erratic
rainfall, reduced plantings and poor farming practices, it said.  “Our field staff are already reporting signs of distress
in rural areas, including empty granaries and farmers selling
their livestock,” Felix Bamezon, the WFP country director for
 Zimbabwe , said in the statement.  Zimbabwe’s southern and western provinces experienced
drought during the rainy season from November to April.  “We had only four inches of rain here, which killed even
drought-resistant crops and left us looking like a desert,”
Sitha Mpofu, a small-scale farmer and retailer, said in a phone
interview today from Beitbridge on the southern border with
 South Africa . The area usually receives about 12 inches of rain
annually, compared with 30 inches in the northern and eastern
provinces, he said.  While rains in the southern African nation’s main food-
producing Highveld districts were average they came late, Mark
Edwards, a Harare-based agronomist, said in a telephone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
