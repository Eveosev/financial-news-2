Scor SE (SCR) ,  France ’s largest reinsurer,
reported a 15 percent drop in second-quarter profit as declining
global markets hurt its equities investments. Revenue rose 33
percent, helped by last year’s acquisition of Transamerica Re.  Net income fell to 102 million euros ($125 million) from
120 million euros a year earlier, Scor said in a presentation on
its website today. That compares with the 108 million-euro
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The results remain solid,” said Benoit Valleaux, a
Paris-based analyst at Natixis SA who recommends buying the
shares. “The businesses are developing well.”  The  shares  rose 2.8 percent to 19.80 euros as of 9:48 a.m.
in Paris, giving Scor a market value of 3.8 billion euros. The
stock is up 9.5 percent this year compared with the 7.6 percent
gain of the 26-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index.  Scor’s revenue rose to 2.31 billion euros in the second
quarter, compared with 1.74 billion euros a year earlier, the
Paris-based reinsurer said. Scor said in September that it
expects annual sales of 10 billion euros in 2013 after
completing last August the $912.5 million purchase of the
mortality risk business of  Aegon NV (AGN) ’s Transamerica unit.  “We manage to combine revenue growth and high
profitability,” Chief Executive Officer Denis Kessler said on a
call with reporters. Second-quarter earnings show “regularity”
and include about 20 million euros of markdowns on Scor’s
equities investments, he said.  Scor had total invested assets of 13.2 billion euros at the
end of June, 80 percent of which are in bond-related holdings
and 5 percent in equities, according to its website. “We have
no need to sell these equities at any time” and markdowns on
equities holdings may reverse if markets improve, Kessler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
