Zimbabwe ’s plans to settle $10.7
billion of foreign debt are “reasonable,” said Mungai
Lenneiye, the country manager for the  World Bank .  “We think what the minister of finance has so far put in
place in terms of debt repayment sounds reasonable,” Lenneiye
told a conference in Nyanga, eastern Zimbabwe, today. “We think
in the new year the process of lending could begin.”  Aldo Dell’Ariccia, the European Union Ambassador to
Zimbabwe, told the conference the economic grouping will
reconsider new credit only if the southern African country
settles outstanding obligations.  “The EU cannot unveil credit at the moment because of the
existing debt,” he said. He didn’t say how much is owed.  Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  in March unveiled the
Accelerated Arrears Clearance, Debt and Development Strategy,
which seeks retire the country’s debt and enable the resumption
external financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
