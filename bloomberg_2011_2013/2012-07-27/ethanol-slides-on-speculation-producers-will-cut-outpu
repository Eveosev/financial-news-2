Ethanol rose for the first time in
seven days, boosted by gains in gasoline and corn futures.  The biofuel climbed as gasoline advanced on unplanned
refinery shutdowns and bets that central banks will boost
economic stimulus measures to spur growth. Corn increased as
drought in the U.S. and  Russia  reduced global supplies.  “Corn is up and gasoline is up and that is probably
boosting ethanol,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president
at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 1.4 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.555 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
after falling 6.8 percent in six days of losses. Prices have
dropped 6.2 percent since reaching a year-to-date high of $2.725
on July 18.  Corn for December delivery rose 17 cents, or 2.2 percent,
to $7.9325 a bushel in Chicago, up 57 percent since mid-June.
One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for August delivery rose 7.4 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $2.8878 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest level in a week.  At least 63.9 percent of the U.S. was in moderate to severe
drought as of July 24, up from 63.5 percent the previous week,
the U.S. Drought Monitor said yesterday. The International
Grains Council yesterday cut its forecast for Russian wheat
production by 10 percent to 44 million metric tons.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 2 cents to $2.61 a
gallon in  New York  and dropped 0.5 cent to $2.73 on the West
Coast. Prices rose 0.5 cent to $2.53 in Chicago and gained 0.5
cent to $2.59 on the  Gulf Coast .  To contact the reporters on this story:
