Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, rose the most in nine
months after profit beat analysts’  estimates  and the company
boosted its outlook for the second half.  Chubb advanced 4 percent to close at $72.32 in New York,
the most since Oct. 21. The insurer has gained 4.5 percent this
year, compared with a 1.8 percent rise in the 24-company  KBW
Insurance Index. (KIX)   Operating profit, which excludes some investment results,
was $1.37 a share, the company said yesterday in a statement,
beating the $1.15  average estimate  of 23 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer John Finnegan is raising
rates and culling unprofitable lines as near record-low bond
yields pressure investment income.  “This quarter may have marked Chubb taking over the baton
of pricing leader,” Josh Stirling, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., said in a note today. “The company’s momentum
continued to accelerate to levels modestly beyond Travelers own
substantial price-taking.”  Chubb lifted its full-year guidance for per-share operating
income to a range of $5.70 to $5.95. That compares with a
projection of $5.30 to $5.70 in January.  Net income fell 3.6 percent to $404 million as investment
income declined, the firm said. Travelers Cos. posted a profit
of $499 million last week as natural disasters cost less than
last year.  CB US <Equity> CN  NI INS
