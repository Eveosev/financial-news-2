Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal  will
receive about $1.2 billion in total revenue from the Olympics,
moving closer to breaking even on the games.  National broadcast and cable sales will deliver about $1
billion, with local TV and digital contributing another $200
million, Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Brian Roberts  said today in an interview on CNBC.  “It’s better than we thought,” Roberts said. “It’s a
good start and now we just have to, you know, make it all happen
in the next 17 days.”  NBC Universal paid about $1.18 billion for rights to the
London Olympics, which began today with the opening ceremony.
The company is spending about $100 million on production,
estimates  David Joyce , an analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. in New
York. He expected the network to lose $100 million to $200
million on the games.  Philadelphia-based Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable system
operator, gained 2.2 percent to $32.29 at the close of New York
 trading . The stock has climbed 36 percent this year. Comcast
