Italy’s securities regulator Consob
extended a ban on short selling on banking and insurance shares
until Sept. 14, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The restrictions, in place since July 23, ban short selling
on 29 banking and insurances shares. Consob decided to extend
the ban today given “the persistent uncertainty” on financial
markets, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
