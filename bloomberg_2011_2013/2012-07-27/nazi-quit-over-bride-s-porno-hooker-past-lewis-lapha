Calling his top brass together on
Nov. 5, 1937,  Adolf Hitler  explained the grand plan to invade
Austria and Czechoslovakia, followed by swift wars against
France and Britain.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Among those present was Werner von Blomberg, a keen Nazi,
former minister of defense, and the first field marshal of the
 Third Reich . Because of the timing, he was vehemently opposed to
the fuhrer’s Hossbach plans.  Blomberg might have been able to prevail, but on Jan. 27,
1938, he was forced to resign. The 59-year-old widower had
married the seductive Margarethe Gruhn, with Hitler and Goring
as witnesses.  The new bride, 35 years her husband’s junior, had posed for
pornographic photographs taken by a Czech Jew she’d been living
with, and had also been on the Berlin police register as a known
prostitute.  Hitler never appointed a successor to Blomberg and
effectively became minister of war himself.  I spoke with  Andrew Roberts , author of “The Storm of
War,” on the following topics:  1. Nazi Ideology  2. Hitler’s Blunders  3. Eastern Front  4. Japanese Mistakes  5. Fuhrer’s Suicide  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
