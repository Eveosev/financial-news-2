Sean Egan , president of Egan-Jones
Ratings Co., said Germany is putting its credit grade at risk if
it commits to more aid for debt-strapped countries,  Welt am
Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  “We will look carefully at what financial commitments
Germany makes in the coming weeks,” Egan told the German
newspaper, according to an e-mailed pre-release today. “And if
guarantees or credit lines are increased, we will act
immediately,” he was quoted as saying.  It is “absolutely possible” for Germany to default, Egan
said. “If Germany gives in now and doesn’t fight off the
desires of other countries, it will go off the rails itself.”  Egan-Jones currently has an A- rating on  Germany , according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
