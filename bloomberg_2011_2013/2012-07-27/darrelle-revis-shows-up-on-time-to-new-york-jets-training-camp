Darrelle Revis attended the opening
day of the  New York  Jets’ training camp yesterday after deciding
not to snub preseason preparations for the third time since he
joined the National Football League team.  “I just want to be here,” the four-time Pro Bowl
cornerback told reporters. “I want to be around the team and
just play ball.”  Revis wants to renegotiate the four-year, $46 million
contract he signed in 2010, which will pay him $7.5 million this
season, the New York Times reported.  “Something has to happen sooner or later in terms of my
future with the team,” Revis said. “I never said I was unhappy
about my contract. I know what I signed a couple years ago.
There were talks a couple years ago about a ‘band-aid’ and that
was that. Now we’re here and we have to move forward.”  Revis and the Jets reached an agreement on a new contract
on Sept. 6, 2010, ending a seven-month impasse during which the
player sat out training camp and the preseason. In 2007, Revis
refused to sign his first accord with the team, who took him
with the 14th pick in that year’s draft, until 19 days after the
July 27 start of training camp.  Jets officials have told his representatives that “we’ll
handle it later,” Revis said.  New York coach  Rex Ryan  said he was happy Revis showed up
on time. Revis had 52 tackles and four interceptions last season.
He has 18 career interceptions and 283 tackles.  “Obviously, he’s great,” Ryan said. “There’s no question
how I feel about Darrelle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
