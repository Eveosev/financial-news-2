CNP Assurances SA (CNP) ,  France ’s largest
life insurer, said first-half net income fell 0.5 percent on
lower demand for policies.  Net income declined to 540 million euros ($663 million)
from 543 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said in a statement today. That is in line with the 536 million-
euro average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It shows resistance,” said Benoit Valleaux, an analyst
at Natixis SA in Paris who recommends buying the stock. “But
we’ll wait to know the future chief executive’s strategic
decisions.”  CNP Assurances’s board of directors yesterday decided to
extend the term of Chief Financial Officer Antoine Lissowski as
interim chief executive officer until Sept. 25 at the latest.
Lissowski was appointed as interim CEO last month after former
CEO Gilles Benoist’s 14-year tenure ended.  CNP Assurances (CNP)  rose 1.5 percent to 8.27 euros by 10:35 a.m.
in Paris trading, giving the company a market value of 5.3
billion euros. The stock has dropped 14 percent this year,
trailing the 7 percent increase of the 26-member Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
