Brazil ’s telecommunications
regulator Anatel may determine at the end of next week that
mobile-phone companies should share their infrastructure to
increase network capacity, according to a government official
familiar with the matter.  The announcement may be made at the same time Anatel
suspends a ban on sales of voice and data service by  Tim
Participacoes SA (TIMP3) ,  America Movil SAB (AMXL) ’s Claro and  Oi SA (OIBR4) , said the
person, who asked not to be named because the discussion isn’t
public.  Network failures prompted the sales suspension, which
started on July 23. The ban on Claro includes Sao Paulo,
Brazil’s richest and most populous state, while Tim was blocked
from selling services in the second- and third-biggest states,
 Minas Gerais  and Rio de Janeiro. The end of the sales ban will
hinge on the investment plans presented by companies to improve
the quality of service.  Mobile-phone companies will be required to share all
infrastructure in some areas and only transmission towers in the
country’s biggest metropolitan areas, the person said.  Anatel didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment
made by e-mail and telephone.  Tim also didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment. Claro and Oi declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
