Saudi security forces detained a
number of people in the eastern al-Qatif region after Shiite
protesters burned tires last night, the official Saudi Press
Agency reported, citing an unidentified Interior Ministry
spokesman.  Mohammad Kadhim Jaafar al-Shakhoury, wanted by security
agencies, is among those detained, the spokesman said. There
were no casualties during the riots or when the security forces
moved in to end the incidents and detain protesters, he said.  On July 14 SPA reported that four Saudi security personnel
were injured in an attack by masked gunmen while on patrol in
the oil-rich  Eastern province . In that attack gunmen also fired
at a police station and threw a petrol bomb while riding
motorcycles, the Riyadh-based news service reported at the time.  While  Saudi Arabia , with its Sunni majority, largely
avoided the unrest that spread across the Arab world last year,
minority Shiite protesters have clashed with security forces in
eastern towns.  Saudi Arabia has accused Shiite-led  Iran  of interfering in
the affairs of Arab countries in the Persian Gulf, where three-
fifths of the worldâ€™s oil reserves are located. Iran denies
interfering and accuses Sunni rulers in  Bahrain  and Saudi Arabia
of discriminating against Shiites.  To contact the reporters on this story:
