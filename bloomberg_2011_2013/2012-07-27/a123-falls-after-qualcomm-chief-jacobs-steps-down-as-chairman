A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a U.S. maker of
lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and grid storage, fell
to a record low after a director resigned.  A123 dropped 22 percent to 49 cents at the close in New
York, the lowest since its initial public offering in September
2009. The shares have slipped 35 percent this week, giving the
Waltham, Massachusetts-based company a market value of $72
million.  Paul Jacobs , chief executive officer of  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the
largest supplier of semiconductors for mobile phones, stepped
down as an A123 director on July 23, according to a statement
today.  “I have elected to step down from A123’s board to focus on
Qualcomm’s growing and increasingly diverse business,” Jacobs
said in the statement. He had served on A123’s board since 2002,
according to a filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
