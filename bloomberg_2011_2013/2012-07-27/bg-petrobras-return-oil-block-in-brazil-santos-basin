BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  returned an off-shore block to the Brazilian oil regulator
after drilling two wells, BG said in an e-mailed statement.  The two companies didn’t find “commercial quantities” of
crude after drilling two wells in the BM-S-52 block in the off-
shore Santos basin, BG said.  BG held 40 percent of the block and was the operator, while
Petrobras held the remaining 60 percent. The BG statement was
released following a report by Upstream saying the Brazilian
regulator canceled the companies’ license to operate the block.  To contact the reporter on this story:
