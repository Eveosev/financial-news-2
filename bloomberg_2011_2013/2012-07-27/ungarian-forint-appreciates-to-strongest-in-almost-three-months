The forint advanced to the strongest
in 10 months, capping a third week of gains, as Hungary ended
the first round of aid talks and bets grew the euro area debt
crisis will ease.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 1 percent to 280.95 by 4:38
p.m. in Budapest, the strongest since Sept. 12. The government’s
benchmark 10-year bonds strengthened for a second day, cutting
yields nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.476
percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  wrapped up a week of
“constructive” loan talks in Budapest, the Washington-based
lender said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. European shares
climbed and the euro strengthened after Le Monde reported that
the European Central Bank is preparing to buy securities of the
region’s most indebted economies and German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  and French President  Francois Hollande  said they would do
anything to protect the euro. ECB President Mario Draghi
yesterday pledged to defend the euro.  “The external environment took a sharp turn on the ECB
president’s comments, then the market bought into the IMF
statement on the week spent here,” Levente Blaho and Adam
Keszeg, Budapest-based analysts at  Raiffeisen Bank International
AG (RBI) , wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
