The Australian dollar may extend
this month’s rally to the highest level since March, UBS AG
said, citing trading patterns.  The so-called Aussie may climb a further 1.4 percent to the
$1.0558 level reached March 27 after its moving average
convergence/divergence held above zero, according to  Richard Adcock , London-based head of fixed-income technical strategy at
UBS. The move would become more likely if other momentum
indicators such as the stochastic oscillator add to signs of
strength, he wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  “As the MACD is above its zero line reflecting a bullish
condition, we’re watching for momentum tools to cross higher to
signal resumption of strength,” Adcock wrote. “Such a signal
will develop on a close above $1.0350, to suggest a break of the
$1.0444/78 resistance, opening the door” to the March 27 level.  The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to $1.0412 as of
1:13 p.m. in Sydney from the close in  New York  yesterday. It
fell to as low as $1.0177 on July 25, the weakest since July 13.
Investors should buy the Aussie at a close above $1.0350,
targeting $1.0550 with a stop-loss order at $1.0170, Adcock
said. A stop loss is a preset instruction to exit a trade at a
certain level in case a bet goes the wrong way.  MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-
day average. The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving
average of the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals. A
stochastic oscillator chart measures the closing price of a
security relative to its highs and lows during a particular
period to try to predict whether it will rise or fall.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
