Cleveland Browns  owner  Randy Lerner 
said he’s in talks to sell part of the National Football League
team to James Haslam III, a part owner of the Pittsburgh
Steelers and the president of Pilot Travel Centers LLC, the
nation’s largest operator of travel centers and truck stops.  “I’ve been approached by Mr. Jimmy Haslam, who is
interested in making an investment in the Cleveland Browns,”
Lerner said in a statement sent by the team. “We are currently
in negotiations and both sides have agreed to keep that dialogue
and its details private.”  Lerner said the sides were taking care not to disrupt the
team’s operations as it prepares for the season and that he
would share further details if it becomes necessary.  The Browns finished with a 4-12 record in 2011, the team’s
fourth straight losing season. The team has played in Cleveland
since 1999, when NFL owners chose Al Lerner to buy the expansion
Browns franchise for what the  New York Times (NYT)  said was $530
million, after Art Modell moved the original team to Baltimore
in 1996 and renamed it the Ravens.  The Jacksonville Jaguars were sold last year for $760
million to  Shahid Khan , owner of Flex-N-Gate Corp., an auto
parts manufacturer.  The Browns start the season Sept. 9 at home against the
Philadelphia Eagles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
