Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , a backer of
LivingSocial Inc., said the daily-deal startup narrowed its loss
in the second quarter after revenue more than doubled.  LivingSocial, the main competitor to  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  in the
online coupon market, delivers discounts on restaurants, hotels,
events, and other goods and services.  The company posted revenue of $138 million in the three
months ended June 30, compared with $59 million a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing. It reported a net loss of $93
million, compared with a loss of $198 million a year earlier.  Brendan Lewis, a spokesman for Washington-based
LivingSocial, declined to comment on Amazonâ€™s filing.  Amazon, which owns a 29 percent stake in LivingSocial, said
the book value of the investment was $271 million in the second
quarter, compared with $298 million in the previous three
months.  The Internet deal market may generate $4.17 billion in U.S.
sales in 2015, up from $1.97 billion last year, according to
research firm BIA/Kelsey in Chantilly, Virginia.  LivingSocial is expanding beyond daily deals. In April, it
acquired Onosys, which specializes in technology that helps
restaurants receive orders over the Web and mobile phones.  To contact the reporters on this story:
