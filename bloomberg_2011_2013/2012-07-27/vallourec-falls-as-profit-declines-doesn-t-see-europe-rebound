  Vallourec SA (VK) , a producer of steel
pipes for the oil and gas industry, slid the most in more than
two months in Paris trading after the company said profit fell
by half and it couldn’t confirm earlier sales growth targets.  Vallourec dropped 7.5 percent to 32.955 euros by the close
of trading in Paris, the steepest decline since May 11. Net
income dropped to 56.6 million euros ($70 million) from 112.1
million euros a year earlier, the  Boulogne Billancourt , France-
based company said in a statement.  Chairman Philippe Crouzet said on a conference call
yesterday that the company won’t confirm previous targets for
sales growth as its industrial businesses in Europe and  Brazil 
have deteriorated and are unlikely to rebound this year.  “The continuous downward revision of guidance from
Vallourec management at such short intervals risks to undermine
the appeal of a story that has great long-term upside,”
 JPMorgan Cazenove  said in a note to investors today.  The company’s shares fell 20 percent on May 11 after
cutting its forecast for sales growth in half.  “The demand for pipes for sectors outside oil and gas
remains weak,” Crouzet said. “We aren’t confirming revenue
growth guidance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
