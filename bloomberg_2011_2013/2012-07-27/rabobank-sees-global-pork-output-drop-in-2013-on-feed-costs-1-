Global pork production is likely to
decline into 2013 as high feed costs spur farmers to liquidate
herds, Rabobank International said.  Global pork prices face “possible downward pressure” in
the next few months while farmers slaughter animals to stem
losses, Rabobank analysts including  David Nelson  said today in
an e-mailed report. Ultimately lower supplies will lead to a
rebound next year, and strong demand in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer of the meat, also will be supportive, the bank
said. Feed prices “will remain elevated until at least
mid-2013,” Nelson wrote.  “Prospects for the global pork industry’s performance are
not bright due to the impact of rapidly increasing rising feed
costs on production,” Nelson wrote. “Hog producers’ hedge
positions, their ability to source feed, and their liquidity
will be differentiating factors going forward.”  Benchmark global corn prices have surged 56 percent since
mid-June on the Chicago Board of Trade as the worst U.S. drought
since 1956 damaged crops. Corn touched a record $8 a bushel on
July 23, while soybean meal rallied to a record $509.80 per
2,000 pounds on the same day. Both are used in livestock feed.  Chinese  pork  demand may post a “strong recovery” in the
fourth quarter as supplies tighten, Nelson wrote. Canada’s pork
industry may have a competitive advantage into 2013 because it
is expected to have a “relatively good grain harvest,” Nelson
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
