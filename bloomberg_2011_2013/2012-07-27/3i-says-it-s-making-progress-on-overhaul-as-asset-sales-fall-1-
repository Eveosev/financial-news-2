3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s oldest
private-equity firm, said it is making progress in implementing
an overhaul aimed at reviving profit and deal-making after its
shares declined 18 percent over the past year.  “We are making good progress in implementing the strategic
changes announced at the end of June to refocus our investment
capabilities and reduce the group’s cost base,” Chief Executive
Officer Simon Borrows said in a statement today.  Asset sales declined to 119 million pounds ($187 million)
in the second quarter from 337 million pounds in the year-
earlier period, producing a profit of 56 million pounds. Net
asset value declined to 275 pence a share on June 30 from 279
pence at the end of March.  3i is cutting a third of its workforce and shutting offices
in  Hong Kong  and  Shanghai  after the shares plunged 77 percent in
five years. Borrows was named CEO in May after shareholders
urged the London-based company to stop making deals and instead
return money to investors.  The review cost 3i 15 million pounds in the quarter, most
of the money being used to make severance payments to employees
leaving the company, Finance Director Julia Wilson told
reporters on a call today.  3i rose 4.7 pence, or 2.3 percent, to 205.3 pence at 8:20
a.m. in London trading, giving the company a value of almost 2
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
