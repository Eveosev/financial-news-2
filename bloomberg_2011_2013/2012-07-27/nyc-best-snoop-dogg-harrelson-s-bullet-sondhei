Snoop Dogg, the Black Keys and TV on
the Radio will have hip-hop, rock and reggae fans flocking to
Randall’s Island for the first Catalpa NYC festival. More than
40 acts perform during the two-day event.  High Times magazine curates the reggae stage featuring Ras
Droppa, while Frisky’s Church of Sham Marriages has its “pimp
pastor” ready to wed anybody who turns up.  Don’t miss “The Afterburner,” a construction housing DJs
that shoots 30-foot flame balls into the air.  Saturday and Sunday 1 p.m. to 11 p.m. Information:
 http://www.catalpanyc.com .  Saturday Musicals  It’s the final weekend of the NY Musical Theatre Festival,
but you still have plenty of shows to catch.  How about “Zapata!” -- in which the Mexican revolutionary
hero appears to aid Occupy Wall Streeters?  Or maybe the story of a retired kosher butcher and a
lesbian writing teacher -- “A Letter to Harvey Milk?”  Most tickets are $25. Shows at various venues. Information:
+1-212-664-0979;  http://www.nymf.org .  Saturday Night  With her ethereal beauty, Diao Chan can make men do as she
pleases, and in “Feng Yi Ting,” what she wants is a sexual
coup d’etat.  When she meets one lover, Lu Bu, in the Phoenix Pavilion,
she persuades him to murder the other.  Soprano Shen Tiemei and countertenor Jiang Qihu star in Guo
Wenjing’s opera, with direction by Atom Egoyan.  Part of the Lincoln Center Festival, it’s at the Gerald W.
Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 524 59th St. Information: +1-
212-721-6500;  http://lincolncenterfestival.org .  Or you can actually go into the woods to see “Into the
Woods,” now in previews at Central Park’s open-air Delacorte
Theater.  Stephen Sondheim  and James Lapine’s mordant take on fairy-
tale happy endings stars  Amy Adams  as the Baker’s Wife and Donna Murphy as the Witch.  Part of Shakespeare in the Park’s 50th anniversary season,
the musical opens Aug. 9. Information: +1-212-539-8750;
 http://shakespeareinthepark.org .  End up at Cafe Lalo for an iced decaf cappuccino with a
slice of raspberry chocolate velvet cake.  At 201 W. 83rd St. Information: +1-212-496-6031  Sunday  Lyonel Feininger created comic books for kids, Sophie
Taeuber-Arp made puppets, while Marcel Breuer built chairs.  In the new show at the Museum of  Modern Art , design for
children takes center stage: there are LEGO blocks, the Slinky
and the Etch-a-Sketch, as well as nods to Disneyland and
Barbie’s Dream House.  Exploited, idealized, consumerized, children are a major
modern preoccupation, and in this exhibition you’ll be able to
see the cultural evolution of thinking about them.  “Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900-2000” runs
through Nov. 5 at 11 W. 53rd St. Information: +1-212-708-9400;

with a cucumber gimlet and then dig into a Lobster Cobb.  At 100 E. 53rd St. Information: +1-212-751-4840.  Sunday Matinee  “Bullet for Adolf” is Woody Harrelson’s baby -- he co-
wrote the play and with it makes his Off-Broadway directorial
debut.  The comedy is based on an unlikely friendship that formed
in 1983 Houston between Woody and black New Yorker Frankie
Hyman.  The World War II artifact of the title is, however, pure
fiction.  In previews at New World Stages, 340 W. 50th St. for an
Aug. 9 opening; runs through Sept. 9. Information: +1-212-239-
6200;  http://www.bulletforadolf.com .  Sunday Evening  Check out “I Love Bob,” an evening of toe-tapping
physical comedy that follows the adventures of an ordinary guy
who saves the Statue of Liberty.  It’s Parallel Exit’s latest full-length dance piece,
choreographed by Ray Hesselink and directed by the troupe’s
founder Mark Lonergan.  Starring as the clueless Bob, Ryan Kasprzak sends up Gene
Kelly, among other classic performers.  There are also clever topical references to  Wall Street ,
foreclosures, unemployment and greedy real estate magnates.  At Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer St. Information: +1-212-242-0800;
 http://www.joyce.org .  For post-show sustenance, try Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s
Mercer Kitchen.  Consider peekytoe crab and squash blossom tempura.  At 99 Prince St. Information: +1-212-966-5454.  (Zinta Lundborg is an editor for Muse, the arts and leisure
