Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) , the world’s
largest toothpaste maker, sold $500 million of 10.5-year bonds
to retire short-term debt that companies use to fund daily
operations.  The company issued the 1.95 percent bonds due February 2023
to yield 58 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the sale
will be used to retire  commercial paper , IOUs typically maturing
in 270 days or less that corporations sell to fund expenses such
as rent and salaries, according to a person familiar with the
deal who asked not to be identified without authorization to
speak publicly.  Colgate last sold bonds in April, issuing $500 million of
2.3 percent, 10-year obligations that also paid a 58 basis-point
spread, Bloomberg data show. The new notes are expected to be
rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, its fourth-highest level
of investment grade.  Procter & Gamble Co ., Colgate’s largest competitor, sold $1
billion of 10-year, 2.3 percent bonds in February with a 55
basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. The bonds yielded 1.92
percent July 25, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley
