Iceland’s annual inflation rate
slowed this month, easing pressure on the island’s central bank
to raise  interest rates  further.  Inflation slowed to 4.6 percent in July from 5.4 percent in
the prior month, Reykjavik-based  Statistics Iceland  said today
on its website. Consumer prices fell 0.7 percent on the month,
the agency said.  The central bank last month raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter point to 5.75 percent, the fifth increase since August
to steer Iceland’s recovery and ensure a stable krona as capital
controls are unwound. The bank targets 2.5 percent inflation.  “Raising interest rates in May and again now, in June, has
withdrawn some of that accommodation, as is appropriate in view
of the recovery of the real economy and the deteriorating
inflation outlook,” the  central bank  said in a June 13
statement. “As the recovery continues and spare capacity
disappears, it is necessary that the monetary policy slack
should disappear as well.”  Inflation is easing as the krona has risen after the
government in March closed a loophole that had allowed investors
to circumvent  capital controls  to speculate on the currency. A
stronger krona makes imported goods cheaper.  The currency has gained about 5.3 percent against the euro
this year and 0.2 percent against the dollar. It plummeted as
much as 80 percent in the offshore market against the single
currency following the island’s economic collapse in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
