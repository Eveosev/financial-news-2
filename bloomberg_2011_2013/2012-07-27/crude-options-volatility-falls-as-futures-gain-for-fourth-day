Oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures gained on speculation that the  European
Central Bank  and the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy to boost economic growth and curb the debt crisis.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.98 percent at 4:19 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 31.12 yesterday. It was
the fourth consecutive decline.  Oil for September delivery climbed 74 cents to settle at
$90.13 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
gained 0.8 percent after ECB President  Mario Draghi  was said to
be planning to hold talks with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann on stimulus measures including bond purchases. ECB and
Fed policy makers are scheduled to gather separately next week
to discuss the economy.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which fell 9 cents to 21 cents a barrel at
4:10 p.m. with 2,211 lots trading. September $83 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,965 lots changing hands as
they declined 17 cents to 49 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 52 percent of
the 93,232 contracts traded.  September $85 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 4,309 lots changing hands. They fell 21 cents to
$1.05 a barrel. September $83 puts declined 14 cents to 66 cents
on volume of 3,892.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,412
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,903 lots and
