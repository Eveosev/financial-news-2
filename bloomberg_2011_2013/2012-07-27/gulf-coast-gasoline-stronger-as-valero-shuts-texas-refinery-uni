Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a sulfur recovery unit for
maintenance at the Port Arthur refinery in Texas.  The unit and a tail gas incinerator will undergo planned
repairs,  Bill Day , a Valero spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  “The work isn’t having a material impact on production at
the plant,” he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.2 cents to 9.6 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:54 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level
since June 15. Prompt delivery rose 5.73 cents to $2.6873 a
gallon.  New York conventional gasoline strengthened for a second
day after  production  of the grade by regional refiners declined,
falling 13,000 barrels on a four-week average to 1.74 million
barrels a day, the Energy Department reported July 25. It was
the lowest level for the period since May.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York  Harbor narrowed 1 cent to 13 cents a gallon versus futures.  Production  of reformulated fuel by refiners and blenders on
the East Coast rose 5,000 barrels to 1.22 million barrels a day
on a four-week average basis, government data showed.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York narrowed 2.25 cents to 1.88 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
