Jeremy Lin will return to Madison
Square Garden on Dec. 17, while his former team the  New York
Knicks  will begin the National Basketball Association season
against the Brooklyn Nets.  The Knicks will face the Nets in the first game at the
Barclays Center on Nov. 1 and will host the NBA Champion Miami
Heat in their home opener at Madison Square Garden the next day.  The Heat will start the defense of their NBA title at home
on opening night against the Boston Celtics. The Oct. 30 matchup
means  Ray Allen ’s first game for Miami will be against his
former club.  Also on the first day of the season, the Washington Wizards
visit the Cleveland Cavaliers and the  Dallas Mavericks  play the
Los Angeles Lakers.  Lin this month left the Knicks to rejoin the Houston
Rockets, who signed the 23-year-old as a free agent less than a
year after dumping the point guard. The teams are scheduled to
meet in Houston on Nov. 23.  Harvard University graduate Lin took his talents to south
Texas after the Knicks declined to match Houston’s three-year,
$25 million offer that would have cost  New York  $25 million to
$35 million in its final year because of luxury taxes for
breaching league salary cap limits.  Anthony Davis , the No. 1 overall pick in this year’s draft,
will make his NBA debut on Oct. 31 as the New Orleans Hornets
meet the San Antonio Spurs.  The All-Star Game is in Houston on Feb. 17 and the regular
season ends April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
