The naira depreciated for a second
day, paring its advance against the dollar this week as foreign
exchange bureaus and importers demanded the U.S. currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer retreated 0.2
percent to 161.07 per dollar as of 11:52 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
naira has appreciated 0.4 percent this week.  “The decline is from buying pressure, arising from bureax
de change operators, individuals buying dollars for summer
holidays and importers,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer
of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., which trades
currencies, said by phone today.  The central bank said on July 9 it cut the amount of weekly
dollar sales to each bureau de change to $50,000 from $75,000
previously. The Abuja-based bank said July 24 it reduced the
amount of foreign exchange banks can hold as a percentage of
their shareholders’ funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and kept
its  interest rate  unchanged at 12 percent. The amount of cash as
a percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold with
the central bank was increased to 12 percent from 8 percent,
Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  Inflation accelerated to 12.9 percent in June, from 12.7
percent in May, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics
said July 18. The country’s foreign-currency reserves have
fallen by $1.3 billion since the end of May to $36.4 billion,
according to July 25 data compiled by the central bank. Fuel
imports have been a source of pressure on the naira, according
to the  Central Bank of Nigeria .  The yield on  Nigeria ’s seven-year domestic bonds due June
2019 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 16.43
percent, according to July 26 data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million
of Eurobonds due 2021 declined by four basis points to 5.39
percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9575 per dollar
in Accra, the capital, the weakest since at least 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
