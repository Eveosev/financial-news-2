France â€™s energy ministry said it
approved 214 solar power projects totaling 541 megawatts after
reviewing bids under two tenders it opened to competition last
year.  The ministry made a statement about the projects by e-mail
from Paris today. The results cover two tenders, one for
projects on buildings between 100 kilowatts and 250 kilowatts
and the other for projects bigger than that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
