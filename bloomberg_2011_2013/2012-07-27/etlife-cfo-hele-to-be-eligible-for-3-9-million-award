MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said incoming Chief Financial Officer John Hele will be
eligible for about $3.9 million a year under the company’s
variable incentive plan.  The award, which will be based on individual performance
and company results, includes a $2.2 million target for long-
term, stock-based incentives, the New York-based life insurer
said today in a regulatory filing.  Hele, who is stepping down as CFO of Arch Capital Group
Ltd., also gets a $600,000 salary and a $450,000 “sign-on
payment,” the company said. On Sept. 4, he replaces Eric Steigerwalt, who filled the CFO role on an interim basis and is
an executive vice president. William Wheeler, who had been
finance chief since 2003, was named president of the new
Americas division last year as Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  reshaped his management team.  “There are many opportunities for strong leaders to
contribute to the achievement of our vision and strategic
objectives,” Kandarian said in a letter to Hele included in the
filing.  Wheeler received almost $9 million in  compensation  in 2011
and $4.9 million the year before, MetLife said in a filing
earlier this year. Hele received total compensation of $2.3
million from Arch in 2011, including a salary of $600,000, a
$540,000 bonus and stock and options, the Bermuda-based insurer
said in a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
