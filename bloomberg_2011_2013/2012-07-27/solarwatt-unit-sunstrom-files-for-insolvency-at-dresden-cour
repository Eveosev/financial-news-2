SunStrom GmbH, a unit of the German
solar-power plant developer Solarwatt AG, filed for insolvency,
its administrator said.  SunStrom  employs about 140 people in Dresden and sought
protection from creditors with the local court yesterday, said
Ruediger Wienberg, who is the preliminary administrator for the
insolvency case, according to an e-mailed statement.  SunStrom “is interesting for investors” because it has
more than 12 years of project experience, Wienberg said in the
statement. Solarwatt filed for insolvency in June and seeks to
restructure under self-administration.  Increased competition in the solar-energy industry has
slashed profit margins, cutting solar-panel prices by half last
year and tipping more than a dozen companies into bankruptcy,
including  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the world’s largest cell maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
