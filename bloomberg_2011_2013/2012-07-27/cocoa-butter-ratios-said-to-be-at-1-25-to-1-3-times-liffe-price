Cocoa butter in the European market
is 1.25 to 1.3 times higher than the NYSE Liffe price, according
to three traders with direct knowledge of the sales.  The traders declined to be identified because they are not
authorized to speak to media. Cocoa butter, which accounts for
as much as 20 percent of the weight of a chocolate bar, was 1.2
to 1.3 times the exchange price last week. On May 25, it was
1.06, according to Commodities Risk Analysis LC.  A global glut of cocoa butter emerged after demand for the
by-product of bean processing fell following the global
economic recession of 2008-09, according to London-based broker
Marex Spectron Group. Cocoa butter is needed to make chocolate.
Cocoa powder that is also derived from beans was more in demand
because of its use in ice cream, drinks and cookies in  Asia .
That exacerbated the cocoa butter glut.  “Processors have been drawing down existing cocoa butter
stocks, rather than grinding fresh  cocoa beans  and selling them
at cheap prices, rather than focusing on just powder,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London , said in a
report dated yesterday.  Cocoa butter trades in  Europe  in liquid form at a ratio to
the NYSE Liffe bean price. Cocoa futures for December delivery
increased 0.9 percent to 1,581 pounds ($2,488) a ton at 1:30
p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
