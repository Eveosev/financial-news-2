U.K. government bonds fell for a
second day as speculation European leaders will step up measures
to contain the euro-area’s sovereign-debt crisis reduced demand
for safer assets.  Gilts dropped along with German bunds after French
President  Francois Hollande  and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said their countries would do everything needed to keep the euro
area intact. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
signaled yesterday that policy makers may resume their bond-
buying program to bring down Spanish and Italian yields. The
pound weakened against the euro.  “There’s a big risk-on move and the reciprocal of that is
higher yields, both in Germany and the U.K.,” said  Alan Clarke ,
an economist at Scotiabank Europe Plc in London.  The 10-year gilt yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.54 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
dropping to a record 1.407 percent on July 23. The 4 percent
bond maturing in March 2022 declined 0.57, or 5.70 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,572) face amount, to 121.92. The yield climbed
five basis points this week.  Germany  and  France  are “bound by the deepest duty” to keep
the 17-nation currency bloc intact, Merkel and Hollande said in
a joint statement after they spoke by telephone today. The two
sought “quick” implementation of resolutions made at a June 28-
29 European Union summit, they said.  U.S. Growth  Gilts also dropped after a U.S. report showed the world’s
largest economy grew more in the second quarter than analysts
forecast. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.5 percent
annual rate, after a revised 2 percent gain in the prior
quarter, the Commerce Department said. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.4 percent gain.  U.K. government bonds have returned 17 percent in the past
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bunds gained 12 percent, and Treasuries rose
9.4 percent.  The pound fell 0.4 percent to 78.65 pence per euro after
dropping to 78.74, the weakest level since July 17. Sterling
rose 0.2 percent to $1.5724. It earlier climbed to $1.5768, the
highest since June 20.  Sterling has appreciated 4.5 percent in the past year, the
third-best performer behind the yen and the dollar of the 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The euro has weakened 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
