To see photos on the games please
see: {OLY <GO>}  Olympic officials are banking on local enthusiasm to make the
games that start today in London a success after economic
difficulties curbed spending on the event.  The games officially get underway with Oscar-winning
director  Danny Boyle  showcasing Britain’s history to an
estimated television audience of more than a billion. The show
portrays the U.K. as a green and pleasant land before moving
through its industrial revolution in front of public figures,
such as U.S. presidential candidate  Mitt Romney , at the Olympic
Stadium. London is a fitting host, according to IOC President
 Jacques Rogge , whose group wouldn’t allow a moment’s silence at
the opening ceremony to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1972
Olympics, when 11 members of the Israeli team were killed in
Munich by terrorists.  “Going to London, it’s going to the country that invented
modern sport in the second half of the 19th century, included
sport in its school curriculum, loves sport, knows sport well,”
Rogge told reporters July 21.  To contact the editor responsible for this slideshow:
