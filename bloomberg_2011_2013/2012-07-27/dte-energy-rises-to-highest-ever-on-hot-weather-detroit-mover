DTE Energy Co. (DTE) , the owner of
 Michigan ’s largest utility, rose to its highest ever after
greater power demand spurred by hot weather lifted second
quarter earnings.  DTE Energy  rose  1.7 percent to $61.15 at the close in  New
York , the highest price since the stock started trading in 1980,
after reporting second-quarter earnings of 85 cents a share that
exceeded the average 70 cents of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The Detroit-based company’s stock earlier rose to
$62.08.  “Record-setting high temperatures in our service territory
provided an increase in demand at our electric utility,”
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gerard Anderson said in a
statement today.  The company expects its earnings for the full year to be
above the midpoint of its previously stated range of $3.65 to
$3.95 a share, Chief Financial Officer Dave Meador said on a
conference call today. DTE Energy also said it planned to sell
assets in the Barnett shale for $300 million by the end of the
year and that it plans to buy energy service assets from  Duke
Energy Corp. (DUK)  for $200 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
