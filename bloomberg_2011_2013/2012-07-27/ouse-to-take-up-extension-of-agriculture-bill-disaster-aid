The U.S. House next week will take
up a one-year extension of most of an agriculture-policy law
that expires in September along with a provision that would help
livestock producers hurt by a record drought, according to a
 posting  on the Rules Committee website.  If approved, the bill would allow growers of major crops
such as corn and soybeans to continue to receive so-called
direct payments, which are alloted regardless of commodity
prices and which the Senate and the House Agriculture Committee
voted to eliminate. It would also allow lawmakers to provide
emergency relief to cattle, pig and poultry producers who’ve
suffered losses, without having to make an election-year vote on
legislation that calls for deep cuts in food-stamp funding.  Democrats have said they’d resist a one-year extension
unless it was used as a way to open negotiations with the Senate
on the five-year agriculture bill that chamber approved in June.
While the House Agriculture Committee approved its bill last
month, Speaker  John Boehner , Republican of  Ohio , never scheduled
a vote for the measure on the House floor.  The current law authorizing spending for U.S. Department of
Agriculture programs, including nutrition and conservation
initiatives as well as subsidies, expires Sept. 30. While the
legislation includes provisions that help farmers insure major
crops, a measure that would have provided disaster aid for
ranchers expired last September.  Lawmakers are scheduled to leave for a monthlong recess
late next week and don’t return to  Washington  until Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
