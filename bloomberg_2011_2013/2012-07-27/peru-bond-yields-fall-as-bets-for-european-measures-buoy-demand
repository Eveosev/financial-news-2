Peruvian dollar-denominated bonds
gained as speculation European leaders will act to ease the
euro-region’s debt crisis buoyed demand for higher-yielding
emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar
bond due March 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.74 percent. That’s the lowest yield since the
security was issued in 2007. Peru’s local currency market is
closed today in celebration of Independence Day.  Global stocks rose on bets Europe may move toward a new
round of bond buying to ease borrowing costs. German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and French President  Francois Hollande  echoed
yesterday’s pledge by European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  that they will do everything possible to protect the
euro.  “Markets are on a positive note,”  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank in Lima, said in a phone interview.
“That’s helping Peruvian bonds continue the significant rally
we’ve seen” amid record foreign investment flows and forecasts
the economy will grow as much as 6 percent this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
