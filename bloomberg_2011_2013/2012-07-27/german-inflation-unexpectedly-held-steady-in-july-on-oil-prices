German inflation unexpectedly held
steady in July after energy prices rose.  Inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, stayed at 2 percent in July, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a decline to
1.9 percent, the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News
 survey  shows. In the month, consumer prices rose 0.4 percent.  While  oil prices  are up 7 percent this month, they are
still 7 percent lower than a year ago. The sovereign debt crisis
is also hurting the economy of the 17-nation euro region,
damping price pressures. The  European Central Bank  on July 5 cut
 interest rates  to a record low to stimulate growth and lending,
and President  Mario Draghi  said euro-area inflation may drop
below the bank’s 2 percent limit by the end of the year.  “There aren’t any risks for strong price increases in
Germany in the coming months amid the worsening growth outlook,”
said Ulrike Rondorf, an economist at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “In the euro area, there’s nothing to feed inflation.
Everything speaks against it.”  Economists predict euro-area inflation was unchanged at 2.4
percent in July, according to the median of 17 forecasts in a
separate survey. That report is due on Aug. 31.  In Germany, non-harmonized inflation remained at 1.7
percent, with prices rising 0.4 percent from June. The increase
is primarily due to seasonal factors, the statistics office
said. Prices for package tours and vacation rentals increased
from July last year, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
