U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will meet with German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  in
separate sessions on July 30.  The meeting with Schaeuble will take place on the German
island of Sylt in the afternoon of July 30, and the session with
Draghi will be held that evening in Frankfurt, the Treasury
Department said in a statement today.  The Treasury said the meetings will be closed to the press,
with a photo opportunity before the Schaeuble meeting. A
Treasury official with knowledge of the matter said that
Geithner and Schaeuble won’t hold a news conference after the
meeting.  European stocks rose for an eighth week as German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President  Francois Hollande 
joined Draghi in promising to do everything to protect the euro.  “France and Germany are fundamentally attached to the
integrity of the euro zone,” Merkel and Hollande said in a
joint statement today. “They are determined to do everything to
protect it.”  The leaders of the euro area’s two biggest economies issued
their statement a day after Draghi said that the central bank
will act to preserve the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
