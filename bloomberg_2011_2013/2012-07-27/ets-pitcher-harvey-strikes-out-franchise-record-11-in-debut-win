Matt Harvey set a franchise record
by striking out 11 batters in his Major League Baseball debut as
the  New York Mets  halted a six-game skid with a 3-1 win against
the Arizona Diamondbacks.  The 23-year-old right-hander allowed three hits and walked
three in 5 1/3 shutout innings at Chase Field in Phoenix last
night. Harvey threw 106 pitches, including 65 strikes.  Harvey also had a double and a single, making him the first
pitcher since 1900 to strike out more than 10 batters and get
two hits in his debut, the Associated Press said. The last Mets
pitcher to get a pair of hits in his first game was  David West 
on Sept. 24, 1988.  Harvey, the seventh overall pick in the 2010 draft, was 7-5
with a 3.68 earned-run average for Triple-A Buffalo before he
joined the Mets, who have starting pitchers Johan Santana,
Dillon Gee and  Mike Pelfrey  on the disabled list.  The Mets, who have lost 12 of their past 14 games, are
third in the National League East with a 48-51 record, 11 1/2
games behind the division-leading Washington Nationals.  Scott Hairston  hit a two-run double in the first inning to
give the Mets a 2-0 lead and  Andres Torres  scored on Rob Johnson’s sacrifice fly in the fourth. Jason Kubel crossed home
plate on Justin Upton’s sacrifice fly in the eighth for the
Diamondbacks’ (49-50) only score.  Bobby Parnell got his third save after pitching one inning
for the Mets (48-51).  Wade Miley (11-6) surrendered three runs on nine hits in 5
1/3 innings for the loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
