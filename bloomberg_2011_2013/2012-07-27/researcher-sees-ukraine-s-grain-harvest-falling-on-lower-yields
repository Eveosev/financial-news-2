Ukraine’s grain harvest declined to
20.5 million metric tons in the period from June through
yesterday from 26.3 million tons a year earlier as average
yields fell, agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Average grain yields fell to 2.4 tons a hectare (2.47
acres) from 2.94 tons a year ago, the Kiev-based researcher said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Wheat accounted for 13.3 million tons and barley for 6.2
million tons of the harvest, UkrAgroConsult said. The harvest
also comprises crops including peas, rye and oats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
