Sugar fell for a second day in New
York as dry weather in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer,
helped accelerate harvesting and increased production in the
first half this month. Coffee advanced.  Sugar output in Brazil’s center south, the main producing
region, rose 2 percent to 2.64 million metric tons in the first
half of July, industry group Unica said on July 25. Cane-growing
areas will get more dry weather through the beginning of August,
Celso Oliveira, a meteorologist at Sao Paulo-based forecaster
Somar Meteorologia, said by phone yesterday.  “We suspect participants had been waiting for Unica’s
report on the crush activity in Brazil center south for the
first fortnight in July to act,” Nick Penney, a senior trader
at Sucden Financial Ltd. in  London , wrote in a report e-mailed
today. “The report was construed as bearish.”  Raw sugar for October delivery slid 1.2 percent to 22.22
cents a pound by 7:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
White, or refined, sugar for October delivery fell 0.9 percent
to $609.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Wet weather is set to return to growing regions in Brazil
in the second half of August, Somar’s Oliveira said. Rainfall
may be as much as double the historical average, he said.  “Next month’s forecasts for above average rainfall could
slow things down again, bringing some bullishness back in
August,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
London said in a report e-mailed today. She forecast raw sugar
prices at 22 cents to 25 cents in three to six months.  Arabica coffee for September delivery was up 1 percent to
$1.7585 a pound on ICE Futures. Robusta coffee for September
delivery advanced 2 percent to $2,253 a ton on NYSE Liffe. The
price touched $2,257 a ton, the highest since May 29.  Robusta coffee inventories with valid certificates in
warehouses monitored by the NYSE Liffe exchange in London were
149,980 metric tons as of July 23, down 4.9 percent from two
weeks earlier, according to exchange data.  Cocoa for September was little changed at $2,317 a ton in
 New York . Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to 1,570
pounds ($2,468) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
