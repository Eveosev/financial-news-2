Asian currencies fell this week as a
deepening global economic slowdown curbed risk-taking and hurt
demand for the region’s assets.  Indonesia’s rupiah was set for the worst week in a month
after the government failed to raise its target amount for a
fifth straight auction of Islamic bonds. Data released yesterday
showed South Korea’s second-quarter economic growth was the
least in almost three years, and the Bank of  Thailand  cut its
2012 growth forecast to 5.7 percent from 6 percent on July 25.
The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s currencies, pared losses after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  pledged to preserve the euro.  “Risk-taking appetite has been low this week,” said
 Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United
Bank Co. “Economic slowdown is happening in many countries, and
although there are some hopes for  Europe  today, you never know
if Draghi’s comments will turn into concrete actions.”  The rupiah slid 0.5 percent this week to 9,495 per dollar
as of 3:25 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since June 22, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. Taiwan’s dollar weakened
0.4 percent to NT$30.10 and Malaysia’s ringgit slipped 0.3
percent to 3.1610.  India ’s rupee retreated 0.3 percent to 55.51.  Global funds sold $1.6 billion more Indonesian, South
Korean, Taiwanese and Thai stocks than they bought this week
through yesterday, according to exchange data.  China Concern  Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell 1.7 percent from
a year earlier to 467.2 billion  yuan  ($73 billion) in June, a
third month of declines, government data showed today.  Song Guoqing, a central bank adviser, said on July 21 that
growth in the world’s second-biggest economy may slow to 7.4
percent this quarter because of “problems on the export side.”
That would be the slowest pace since the first three months of
2009, according to official figures.  The yuan declined 0.11 percent this week to 6.3807, and
touched 6.3967 on July 25, the weakest level since Sept. 29.  “The current slowdown has undoubtedly inflicted a lot of
pain on the corporate sector,” said Yao Wei, a  China  economist
at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . Taxes and wages are
squeezing companies “from both ends” and the limited room
private businesses have for expanding is helping push China
“into a state of profitless growth,” Yao said.  Philippine Rate Cut  The  Philippine peso  rallied for a second day after the
central bank unexpectedly cut borrowing costs yesterday,
boosting optimism policy makers are stepping up efforts to help
the country weather the global slowdown. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas lowered its overnight rate to a record low of 3.75
percent from 4 percent.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 41.908 per dollar from
a week ago, aided by a 0.5 percent rally today. The currency has
strengthened 4.5 percent this year, the biggest gainer among
Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht gained 0.3 percent to 31.55 and
South Korea’s won also climbed 0.3 percent this week to
1,138.25. Vietnam’s dong declined 0.1 percent to 20,868.  To contact the reporters on this story:
