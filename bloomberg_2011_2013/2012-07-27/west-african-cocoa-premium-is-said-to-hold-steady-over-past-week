The premium paid in Europe for cocoa
from  Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the world’s largest growers, was
steady in the past week, according to three traders with direct
knowledge of the sales.  Ghanaian beans in the European market cost 90 pounds ($142)
to 110 pounds a metric ton more than futures on NYSE Liffe in
London, according to the traders who declined to be identified
because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. The
premium was 90 pounds to 100 pounds last week.  Cocoa beans from Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer,
were 60 pounds to 65 pounds a ton higher than the Liffe price in
the European market, the traders said. That compares with 60
pounds to 70 pounds last week.  Cocoa for December delivery traded at 1,579 pounds a ton by
2:19 p.m. on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
