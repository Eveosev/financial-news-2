McKesson Corp. (MCK) , the largest U.S drug
distributor, reached a $151 million settlement with states over
claims it caused Medicaid programs to pay too much for
prescription drugs.  The agreement resolves allegations that McKesson overbilled
states by reporting inflated prices for medications, state
attorneys general said today. The deal follows a settlement
reached in April with the federal government.  “This settlement holds McKesson accountable for attempting
to make millions of dollars in illegal profits,”  New York 
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who helped lead
negotiations, said in an e-mailed statement.  Kris Fortner, director of communications at San Francisco-
based McKesson, said in an e-mailed statement that the company
adhered to all applicable laws and regulations and that the
claims are “without merit.”  “We did not manipulate drug prices and did not violate any
laws,” Fortner said. The settlement was in the best interest of
the company’s employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders,
according to Fortner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
