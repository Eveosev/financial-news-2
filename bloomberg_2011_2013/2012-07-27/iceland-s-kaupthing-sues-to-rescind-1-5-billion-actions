The caretakers of failed Icelandic
lender  Kaupthing Bank hf  have filed about 50 lawsuits in order
to rescind transactions that were executed in the last months
prior to the bank’s collapse.  “The aggregate nominal amount claimed by Kaupthing in
these cases is equivalent to approximately 180 billion
Icelandic” kronur ($1.5 billion), the bank said in an e-mailed
statement from Reykjavik.  Kaupthing and two other Icelandic lenders defaulted on $85
billion in 2008, triggering an economic collapse in the north
Atlantic island and an International Monetary Fund-led bailout.  The bank is now aiming to complete the winding-up
proceedings by seeking an agreement with creditors which would
give them a stake in the future value of the bank’s assets.
Kaupthing has 5.2 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in assets and 17
billion euros in claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
