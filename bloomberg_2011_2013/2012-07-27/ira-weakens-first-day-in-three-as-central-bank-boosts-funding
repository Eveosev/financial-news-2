The lira weakened for the first time
in three days after the central bank raised the amount of
funding for lenders to the highest level in two weeks.  The Turkish currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8161 per
dollar at 10:33 a.m. in Istanbul. Yields on two-year benchmark
bonds increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.78 percent, climbing for the first time in three days.  Turkey ’s central bank offered 4 billion liras ($2.2
billion) in one-week  repurchase agreements  at its lowest funding
rate of 5.75 percent today, the most since July 13. Governor
Erdem Basci, who varies rates daily within a 5.75 percent to
11.5 percent corridor to control credit growth, said yesterday
he will switch the monetary policy’s focus to bank reserve
requirements. Basci cut the forecast for 2012 consumer-price
growth to 6.2 percent from 6.5 percent.  “I estimate the average funding cost declined to 7.7
percent today from 8.2 percent yesterday,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-
income strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  in Istanbul, said
in e-mailed comments.  The central bank cut  the average funding cost  to as low as
7.65 percent on July 20 from 10.83 percent on May 25, lowering
borrowing costs for lenders, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
