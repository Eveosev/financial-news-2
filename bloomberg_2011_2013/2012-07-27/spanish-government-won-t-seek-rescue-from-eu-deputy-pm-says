Spain  won’t seek a European bailout
and ruled out extending aid it’s set to receive beyond the 100
billion euros ($123 billion) committed to its banks, Deputy
Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.  “I will respond with absolute clarity: the government will
not seek a rescue, nor is asking for a rescue an option,” she
told reporters in Madrid today. She repeated the comments when
asked if Spain would ask the European rescue fund to buy the
nation’s bonds.  Saenz spoke as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President  Francois Hollande  were scheduled to discuss by phone
how to help Spain and implement agreements reached by European
leaders last month. Spain is increasingly reliant on domestic
banks for financing as foreign investors shun the nation’s bonds
amid record borrowing costs, data showed today.  While Spanish ministers including Foreign Minister Jose
Manuel Garcia-Margallo have called on the  European Central Bank 
to stem the surge in Spanish bond yields, Saenz censured such
comments today.  “No government can tell the ECB what it can or should do,
the ECB is independent,” she said.  It’s up to governments to take measures to calm tensions on
markets and to implement agreements reached with other European
leaders, she said. Deficit cuts are a prerequisite for an
economic recovery, she told reporters, after data showed the
 unemployment rate  rose to 24.6 percent in the second quarter,
the highest since at least 1976.  To contact the reporter on this story:
