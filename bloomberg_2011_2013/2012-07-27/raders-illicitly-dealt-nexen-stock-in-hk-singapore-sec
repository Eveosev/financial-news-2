The U.S. Securities and Exchange

the assets of traders using  Hong Kong  and Singapore accounts to
reap more than $13 million in illegal profits by trading in
advance of the announcement that Cnooc Ltd. agreed to acquire
 Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Hong Kong-based firm Well Advantage Ltd. and other unknown
traders stockpiled shares of Nexen stock based on confidential
information about the deal, the SEC claimed in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
