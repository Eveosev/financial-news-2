East African Cables Ltd. (EACL) , the
region’s biggest cable manufacturer, rose to its highest in five
weeks on an improved sales outlook before paring the gain to a
two-day high.  The stock rose 2.4 percent to 10.90 shillings as of the
3:00 p.m. close in Nairobi, the strongest level on a closing
basis since July 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  World Bank  approved $684 million in funding for a power
project connecting Ethiopia’s electrical grid with that of
 Kenya , Makhtar Diop, World Bank’s vice president for  Africa ,
said on July 13. Ethiopia will receive $243 million, while
Kenya, east Africa’s biggest economy, will get $441 million.  “Investors are interested in the outlook because there is
a lot of investment in electricity infrastructure in  East
Africa ,” Davis Mika, a Nairobi-based independent analyst, said
in a phone interview today. “That will create demand.”  The project is the first phase of a regional east Africa
power-integration program, which will probably cost $1.3
billion, benefiting 212 million people living in five countries
with a combined GDP of $107 billion, Diop said.  East African Cables’ profit in the six months through June
jumped 59 percent, the company said July 24. Net income was 274
million shillings ($3.25 million), compared with 172.3 million
shillings a year earlier. Revenue slipped to 2.25 billion
shillings from 2.35 million shillings a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
