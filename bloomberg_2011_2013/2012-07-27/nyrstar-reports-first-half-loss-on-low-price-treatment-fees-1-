Nyrstar NV (NYR) , the largest producer of
refined zinc, reported a first-half loss on lower prices and
fees charged to process the metal, missing analyst estimates.  The net loss was 28.9 million euros ($35.5 million) after a
profit of 20.4 million euros a year earlier, the Balen, Belgium-
based company said today in a statement. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and special items
declined 9.8 percent to 111 million euros, missing the 125.3
million-euro average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Ebitda dropped 22 percent from the previous half.  Sales declined 8.2 percent to 1.49 billion euros.  Profits were weakened by “a very challenging macro
environment, with weak metal prices and lower treatment
charges,” Nyrstar said. The fees this year fell to $191 a ton
based on a zinc price of $2,000 a ton, from $229 at $2,500. The
charges contributed 176 million euros in the first half, 14
percent less than a year earlier, Nyrstar said.  The stock  rose  9 percent to 3.648 euros by 12:13 p.m. in
Brussels trading, paring its loss for the year to 40 percent.  “The mining ramp-up continues to hit production targets,”
said  Richard Knights , an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. “We
think Nyrstar looks particularly interesting here, having fallen
53 percent from its peak of 2012. Spot zinc prices falling to 81
cents a pound have been the major reason for the
underperformance and are now comfortably into the top-end of the
cost curve and we think unsustainable.”  Average zinc prices for three-month delivery in London slid
15 percent to $1,989 a metric ton from the period a year before.  Mine Purchases  The company completed the ramp up of its Langlois mine in
 Quebec ,  Canada , producing about 17,000 tons of zinc concentrate
in the first half, according to the statement. Nyrstar expects
the mine to continue increasing production in the second half to
reach an annual output capacity of 50,000 tons, it said.  Nyrstar has paid about 1.1 billion euros for mines and
asset stakes from Greenland to the U.S.,  Peru ,  Chile  and  Mexico 
since 2009 to benefit from margins that are higher than
smelting. Mined zinc production rose 23 percent to 151,000 tons,
accounting for 50 percent of Ebitda, compared with 32 percent in
the previous half, Nyrstar said.  The cash cost of zinc mining rose to $1,255 a ton in the
first half from $1,095 a ton in the previous six months, Nystar
said in the statement. The cost of smelting operations increased
7 percent from the previous half to 568 euros a ton, it said.  Reducing Debt  “The average C1 cash costs at our mines were up 15 percent
on second half 2011 due primarily to the ramp-up completion at
the Langlois mine, the optimization of the Tennessee Mines, a
change in production mix and lower by-product prices,” it said.
“Cash costs are expected to reduce over the medium term to
$1,000 per tonne or less.”  Nyrstar cut debt by 100 million euros to 618 million euros
by the end of June, it said. “We continue to focus on
controlling costs and ensuring a reduction in debt as we face
further short term volatility,” Nyrstar said.  Refined zinc output fell to 538,000 tons from 561,000 tons
a year earlier and the company plans to produce 1.1 million tons
this year, Nyrstar said. Gold production in the period more than
tripled to 42,500 ounces from a year earlier.  Silver output more than doubled to 2.66 million ounces and
copper rose to 7,000 tons from 2,800 tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
