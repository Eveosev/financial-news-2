The euro area’s economic slump
probably deepened further in July as consumers and executives
grew more pessimistic about the outlook for the region’s
economy, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The gauge measuring economic activity in the 17-nation
region fell to minus 0.24 from minus 0.17 in June, the London-
based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of Italy ,
which co-produce the index, said today in an e-mailed report.  “The deterioration was due principally to the negative
results of surveys of businesses and households,” according to
the report.  The indicator, which includes price developments, stock-
market performance, industrial production and business and
 consumer confidence  readings, seeks to provide a real-time
estimate of economic growth.  The next index will be published Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
