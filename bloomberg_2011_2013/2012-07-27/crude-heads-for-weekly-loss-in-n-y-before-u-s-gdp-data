Oil traded little changed in New
York, heading for its first weekly decline in three, before
before data forecast to show the  U.S. economy  grew at the
slowest past in a year.  West Texas Intermediate crude pared earlier gains as the
euro weakened amid speculation that European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  may struggle to fulfill his pledge
yesterday to defend the currency. U.S. gross domestic product,
the value of all goods and services produced, rose at a 1.4
percent annual rate after a 1.9 percent gain in the prior 
quarter, according a Bloomberg News survey.  “The main focus will switch to the release of the GDP data
that could provide a better insight about the U.S. economic
prospects,” said Myrto Sokou, an analyst at Sucden Financial
Ltd. in London.  Oil for September delivery was at $89.50 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , having
earlier advanced as much as 84 cents to $90.23 a barrel. The
contract climbed 0.5 percent yesterday to $89.39, the highest
close since July 20. Prices are 2.2 percent lower this week.  Brent crude  for September settlement was up 38 cents at
$105.60 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate was at $16.16, up from $15.87 yesterday.  -- Editors:  John Buckley , Raj Rajendran  To contact the reporter on this story:
