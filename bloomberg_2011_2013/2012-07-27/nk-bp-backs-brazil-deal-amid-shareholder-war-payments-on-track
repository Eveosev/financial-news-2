TNK-BP,  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian venture
with a group of billionaires, will pay $200 million to  HRT
Participacoes em Petroleo SA  in October as planned even as the
Russian oil producer lacks a functioning board of directors.  The payments under a $1 billion letter of credit will go
ahead in installments and don’t need any additional decision
from the board, Gennady Shulenko, TNK-BP vice president for
finance, told repory in Moscow today.  TNK-BP’s board hasn’t met since last year when two
directors quit amid a shareholders battle that erupted over BP’s
failed plan to form an alliance with OAO Rosneft. The lack of a
full board has stopped dividend payments at  Russia ’s third-
largest oil producer and held up a decision on at least one
Russian project.  TNK-BP and HRT plan to complete a minimum of wight
exploration wells in  Brazil ’s Amazon this year,  Jonathan Muir ,
TNK-BP’s chief financial officer, told reporters .  “HRT is doing a nice job in terms of setting up the
operations in that challenging environment,” Muir said. Well
costs at the Brazilian partnership run between $20 million and
$30 million each, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
