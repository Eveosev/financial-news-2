Copper prices will climb this year
to average $8,250 a metric ton on consumption in  China  and
supply constraints, Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. said.  While the estimate is below its May forecast of $8,800,
it’s above the metal’s average of about $8,018 so far in 2012.
Aluminum and lead will average $2,000 a ton in 2012, nickel
$17,250 a ton and zinc $1,950 a ton, Natixis said in a report
today.  “Among the base metals, copper continues to exhibit the
strongest fundamentals,” Natixis said. “Despite the weak
global economy, restocking in China is driving a strong increase
in apparent demand. If underlying economic conditions begin to
improve, a significant rally in copper prices remains a distinct
possibility.”  Gold averaged about $1,643 an ounce so far this year and
that figure will fall to $1,550 for the whole year, Natixis
said. It sees silver at $28.50 an ounce, platinum at $1,560 an
ounce and palladium at $650 an ounce this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
