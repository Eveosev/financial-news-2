The  Philippines ’ Energy Regulatory
Commission approved feed-in tariff rates for hydroelectric,
biomass, wind and solar energy sources, lower than what the
nation’s renewable energy board asked for.  Run-of-river hydroelectric power sources will enjoy a 5.90
pesos a kilowatt-hour tariff, biomass 6.63 pesos, wind 8.53
pesos and solar 9.68 pesos, the commission known as ERC said in
an e-mail. The ERC deferred fixing the tariff for ocean thermal
energy conversion resource pending further study, it said.  The lowered tariffs will cushion the impact of the
incentive mechanism on electricity rates, while attracting
investments in renewable energy, ERC Executive Director Francis
Saturnino said in the statement.  The renewable energy board in its May 2011 petition sought
a 6.15 a kilowatt-hour tariff for hydroelectric, 7 pesos for
biomass, 10.37 pesos for wind and 17.95 pesos for solar energy
sources. Under a feed-in tariff, investors are paid a cost-based
price to provide a reasonable return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
