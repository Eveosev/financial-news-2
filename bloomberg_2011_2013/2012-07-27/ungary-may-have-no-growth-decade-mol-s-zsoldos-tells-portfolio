Hungary  may have a decade without
economic growth, according to Istvan Zsoldos, the chief
economist at Hungarian refiner  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Portfolio  reported.  The euro area, Hungary’s biggest export partner, will have
low growth in the next 10 years, either because it falls apart
or because of austerity measures taken to keep it together,
Zsoldos told the news website in an interview.  The currency union will disintegrate unless “political
preferences” change, Portfolio cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
