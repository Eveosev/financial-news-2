Six German states said inflation was
little changed in July.  The inflation rates in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia
remained unchanged at 2.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively,
the states’ statistics offices said. While inflation slowed to
1.7 percent in Brandenburg and Hesse and to 1.4 percent in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, it rose to 1.8 percent in Saxony, separate
reports showed. All six states said consumer prices rose 0.4
percent from June.  Economists forecast that  German inflation , calculated using
a harmonized European Union method, will slip to 1.9 percent
from 2 percent in June, the median of 18 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey  shows. The Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden will release that report later today.  While  oil prices  are up 7 percent this month, they are
still 7 percent lower than a year ago. The sovereign debt crisis
is also hurting the economy of the 17-nation euro region,
damping price pressures. The  European Central Bank  on July 5 cut
 interest rates  to a record low to stimulate growth and lending,
and President  Mario Draghi  said euro-area inflation may drop
below the bank’s 2 percent limit by the end of the year.  “Even if the slowdown of inflation is taking a breather,
the trend is going down,” said Kristian Toedtmann, an economist
at Dekabank in Frankfurt. “The ECB shouldn’t be irritated by
sticky prices this month.”  Economists predict euro-area inflation was unchanged at 2.4
percent in July, according to the median of 17 forecasts in a
separate survey. That report is due on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
