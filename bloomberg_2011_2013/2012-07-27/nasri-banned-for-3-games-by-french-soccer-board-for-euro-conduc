Manchester City midfielder Samir
Nasri was suspended for three games from the French national
soccer team for his conduct during the 2012 European
Championship.  Paris Saint-Germain winger Jeremy Menez was handed a one-
game ban for a confrontation with manager  Laurent Blanc , while
Rennes midfielder Yann M’Vila and Newcastle playmaker Hatem Ben
Arfa were given warnings over their conduct, the French soccer
federation said on its website.  Nasri was cited for a expletive-laden tirade against a
reporter following France’s quarterfinal loss to Spain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
