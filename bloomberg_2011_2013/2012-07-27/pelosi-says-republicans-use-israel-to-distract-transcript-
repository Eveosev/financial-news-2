U.S. House Democratic leader
 Nancy Pelosi  said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital With  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that
Republicans are using  Israel  in this year’s political
campaigns to distract from their tax-cutting agenda.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome to the show. We start with the
Democratic leader of the  House of Representatives , Nancy
Pelosi of  California . Thank you for being with us, Madam
Leader.  REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: My pleasure.  HUNT: Let’s talk about the pending fiscal cliff at the
end of the year. First, tax cuts expire, spending
sequestration. I know your position about the - the GOP
won’t compromise on tax cuts to the rich, but you’re asking
your Democrats to probably stand behind the president on
this, and yet every time before he has negotiated, caved,
capitulated, whatever term you want. Do you think the
president will really hang tough this time?  PELOSI: I think the president has hung tough. First of
all, let’s avoid the cliff. Why should we even be talking in
those terms? And we all are, so I - I agree with your
characterization, that that’s conversation. But it shouldn’t
be.  We can right now today pass middle-income tax cuts,
which assume the expiration of the high-end tax cuts. That’s
$800 billion.  HUNT: - will you offer the president’s plan as an
alternative, if given a chance, you Democrats?  PELOSI: We would offer the - what passed the Senate,
which is the president’s plan, yes. We would also have
another bill to address the estate tax, as well. Our main
bill will be -  PELOSI: But let me say that my caucus has stood with
the president a year ago with a plan that would reduce the
deficit by $4 trillion. Many cuts, investments in growth,
and assuming the expiration of the high-end tax cuts. He had
that conversation with the speaker. The speaker, we thought
there was agreement. The speaker walked away from that. But
we should return to some, not just to avoid the
sequestration, which is $1.1 trillion, an enormous amount of
money, but we need more  deficit reduction  from that.  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But if you can’t do that because the clock is
running and for whatever reason you can’t do it, would you
favor - or would you be willing to support a three-month
extension, say, of the tax cuts expiration, sequestration?  PELOSI: What would be the point?  HUNT: To give - to give the new Congress time to work
out something.  PELOSI: Well, the fact is, is that everybody agrees,
everybody agrees the middle-income tax cuts should continue.
We can do that right now today. And then you can do whatever
else you want to do. The beauty of it is, it helps middle-
income families, A. B, it takes away some of the uncertainty
-  HUNT: But that doesn’t address the sequestration -  (CROSSTALK)  PELOSI: No, it takes away some of the uncertainty,
because we’re talking $800 billion that can be used for
sequestration. And it eliminates all the talk about debt
limit and the rest of that.  HUNT: So you would oppose any kind of extension of
either the tax cut expiration or sequestration?  PELOSI: Well, what we’re talking about here is, how do
we reduce the deficit? How do we have fiscal soundness,
which is what is necessary for our  credit rating  and the
rest? At the same time, stimulate our economy with a middle-
income tax cut that will do that, and to do it in a way that
has fairness and balance. Let’s go to the table -  HUNT: Do you think you can do it by the end of the
year? I know you want to do it, but -  PELOSI: Of course we can.  HUNT: But do you think it will be done by the end of
the year?  PELOSI: Well, the only thing standing in the way are
the Republicans in the House of Representatives.  HUNT: Do you think they’ll change?  PELOSI: Well, hopefully all of your -  HUNT: You don’t sound optimistic.  PELOSI: All of your friends on  Wall Street  who are
concerned about full faith and credit of the  United States ,
who are concerned about certainty in our economy should be
urging them to do just that. You can always discuss the
other tax - whether it’s simplification and fairness. This
is about fairness. It’s about balance. It’s about injecting
demand into our economy to grow it. It’s about removing some
of the uncertainty - can’t ever remove it all in the
marketplace - but some of the fiscal uncertainty that is
there.  All of my senior Democrats on the committees here have
written to their chairman and asking them to sit down to
negotiate what changes could be made to avoid the
sequestration. Let’s do that now. What’s the - what does
three months do, except make it a longer period of time,
where we have uncertainty and no injection of demand into
the economy by having the middle-income tax cuts?  HUNT: Let me turn to a couple foreign policy questions.
Right before he left for  Europe ,  Mitt Romney  really
lambasted the president at the veterans conference as a
failed foreign policy that has appeased our enemies and -
and not been friendly to our friends.  PELOSI: Well, let me say that I’m not - with all due
respect to Mr. Romney, to use a veterans convention for a
political speech is something that is, I just think,
completely inappropriate, completely inappropriate. So the -
I think it’s just really more important to hear what he has
to say about where he wants to take this country in the
future.  And what I’m concerned about is that he is wedded and
supports the Ryan-Republican-Romney budget here, which will
only increase the deficit, will break the Medicare
guarantee. It’s a terrible budget. It’s not about growth in
the future. It’s about, again, tax cuts for the wealthy.  By the way, in order to do that, you have to penalize
the middle class. A person making over $1 million a year -
perhaps you’re one of them - will get -  HUNT: I wish.  (LAUGHTER)  PELOSI: - will get a tax break of an average $160,000 a
year. A middle-income person would get a tax increase of
about $1,000 a year. That’s really what is important. His
inappropriateness on this continent or another one is not
important. What is important are his policies for how he
would take the country -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: One more foreign policy question, though. He’s
going to Israel, and your Republican - the Republican
majority in the House, one of your counterparts,  Eric
Cantor , said Republicans have a golden opportunity with the
Jewish vote this year because there’s a, quote, “real cloud
over Obama’s chilliness with Israel.”  PELOSI: Well, you know what? That’s maybe his
characterization, but that, in fact, this president - and
hopefully during this campaign, it will become - this
president has been a staunch supporter of Israel. Many of
the things that he has done, in terms of Israel’s
qualitative edge in terms of how we have - have supported
Israel in that regard, for them to defend themselves, A, B,
is two issues that relate to  Iran . No president has done
more -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Do you think he’ll do as well with the Jewish
vote this time as he did last time?  PELOSI: The election will tell us that.  HUNT: What do you think?  PELOSI: But I - I think that he will. I think that he
will, because the fact is when the facts get out. You know,
as many of the Republicans are using Israel as an excuse,
what they really want are tax cuts for the wealthy. So
Israel, that can be one reason they put forth.  HUNT: That’s why some of the Republican Jewish
supporters are really active.  PELOSI: Well, that’s how they’re being exploited. And
they’re smart people. They follow these issues. But they
have to know the facts. And the fact is that President Obama
has been the strongest person in terms of sanctions on Iran,
which is important to Israel. He’s been the strongest person
on whether it’s Iron Dome, David’s Sling, any of these
weapons systems and initiatives that relate to Israel. He
has been there over and over again.  HUNT: Should Mitt Romney be pressured by Democrats to
release his previous tax returns?  PELOSI: I think he’s being pressured by the Republicans
to release his tax returns.  HUNT: But how about Democrats? Is that an issue that
you and the president and others should raise with him?  PELOSI: As I said, as far as Mitt Romney is concerned,
I’m concerned about his policies -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: So you don’t really think that releasing his tax
returns should be a big deal?  PELOSI: I think not releasing them is a big deal.  HUNT: Well, why don’t House members release theirs
then?  PELOSI: Because we’re not running for president of the
United States.  HUNT: But you’re a co-equal branch of government,
aren’t you?  PELOSI: Well, when we all run for president, then we’ll
have to take that into consideration. He could not even be a
member of his own cabinet -  HUNT: Thank you very much, Congresswoman Pelosi, for
being with us.  PELOSI: Thank you.  HUNT: When we come back, we’ll talk about Mitt’s
moments in  London .  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
