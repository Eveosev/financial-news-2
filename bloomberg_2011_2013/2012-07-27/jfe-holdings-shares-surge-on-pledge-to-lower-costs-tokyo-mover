JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , Japan’s second-
largest steelmaker, surged the most in five months in  Tokyo 
after saying it will pare costs to counter falling prices.  The shares rose 7.1 percent to 1,061 yen at the close of
trading, the most since Feb. 20. The stock was the top gainer on
the key Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  JFE is targeting cost reduction of 120 billion yen ($1.5
billion) in the year ending March 2013 by using cheaper low-
grade steelmaking materials, Executive Vice President Shinichi Okada told reporters yesterday in Tokyo after announcing
earnings. Net income will probably be 80 billion yen this year,
the company said, compared with the 69 billion yen median of 17
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors welcomed the management’s message of cutting
costs and doing what is required in times of uncertainty,” said
Kazuhiro Harada, a senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Japanese steelmakers may also benefit from a smaller-than-
expected reduction in the price of products supplied to domestic
carmakers after the Nikkei newspaper earlier today reported
 Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and Toyota Motor Corp. agreed to cut prices
of automotive steel by 2,000 yen a ton, or 2 percent, in the six
months to September, said Harada, who rates JFE stock
“neutral.”  Nippon Steel spokesman Tsuyoshi Yoshizumi and Toyota
spokesman Dion Corbett declined to comment on the report.  Nippon Steel gained 6.7 percent to 160 yen and its merger
partner  Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405)  rose 5.5 percent to 116
yen.  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  climbed 4.2 percent. The three Japanese
steelmakers are scheduled to report first-quarter results on
July 30.  Falling Prices  JFE forecast yesterday it will charge customers 71,000 yen
a ton in the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with 85,600
yen a year earlier. Prices fell to 75,700 yen in the first
quarter from 82,400 yen a year earlier. The company has yet to
conclude price talks with carmakers, Okada said yesterday.  The company forecast full-year sales will increase 4.2
percent to 3.3 trillion yen and operating profit will more than
double to 100 billion yen. The targets are “well within reach”
given the company’s forecast of saving 120 billion yen from cost
cuts, Shinya Yamada, an analyst at Credit Suisse Securities
 Japan  Ltd., said in a report to investors.  For the first quarter ended June 31, current profit, or
pretax profit from operations, fell 61 percent to 9.9 billion
yen as the strong yen and global oversupply squeezed JFE’s
profit margins. Net income more than doubled to 18.1 billion yen
in the three months ended June 30 from 7.1 billion yen a year
earlier after a one-time earthquake-related charge wasn’t
repeated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
