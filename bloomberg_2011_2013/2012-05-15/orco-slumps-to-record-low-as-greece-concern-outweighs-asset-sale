Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA slumped to an
all-time low as  Greece ’s failure to form a government drove
investors from riskier assets across  Europe , outweighing a $94
million asset sale by the company.  The stock dropped 2 percent to 66.5 koruna at the close in
Prague, the lowest since the developer in central Europe listed
its shares on the Czech bourse in 2005.  European stocks tumbled and Italian and Spanish bonds fell
after Greece called fresh elections, fueling concern the nation
will exit the euro. The shares in Orco, which is overhauling its
business and debt under a court-approved plan, earlier jumped as
much as 6.2 percent after the company said it sold a property in
 Prague  to a unit of U.S.-based L88 Companies.  “Orco shares failed to hold on to the morning gains that
followed the announcement of the sale” because investors regard
the prospects for early elections in Greece “as bad news mainly
for Europe’s financial sector,” Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst
at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
