India ’s bonds rose for a second day
after the central bank said yesterday it will purchase sovereign
notes at an open-market auction this week to help the government
sell a record amount of debt.  Yields on securities due 2021 fell to the lowest level in
almost a month as the  Reserve Bank  of India plans to buy a total
of 120 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) of bonds maturing in 2018,
2021, 2022 and 2027 on May 18, according to a statement.  “The central bank’s efforts are boosting liquidity that’s
needed to see the government’s debt-sale plan through,” said
R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer for fixed income and
currencies at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “I think the RBI
will continue such steps to help yields decline.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021
declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.48
percent as of 9:33 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the lowest since April 19.  Bonds also gained on optimism a drop in oil prices will
slow  inflation .  Crude prices have lost 4.5 percent this year to trade at
$94.36 per barrel in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Inflation in India, which imports almost 80 percent
of fuel it uses, averaged 7.1 percent this year, compared with
7.7 percent for the whole of 2011.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
dropped one basis point to 8.02 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
