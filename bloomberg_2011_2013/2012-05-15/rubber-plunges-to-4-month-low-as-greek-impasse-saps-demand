Rubber plunged to a four-month low as
the political impasse in  Greece  increased speculation that the
nation may leave the euro, deepening an economic slump in the
region and weakening demand for the commodity used in tires.  The October-delivery contract slumped as much as 5.1
percent to 265 yen a kilogram ($3,317 a metric ton), the lowest
level for a most-active price since Jan. 6, before settling at
270.1 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange. A slump this month
has trimmed rubber’s 2012 advance to 2.5 percent.  Asian stocks  fell for a fifth day on evidence of slower
growth in China and as doubts mounted Greece can avoid an exit
from the currency union. Greece’s President will call a meeting
of most party leaders today to make the case for a government of
non-politicians.  “The European turmoil raised concerns the Chinese economic
slowdown may worsen as the region is the biggest export market
for  China ,” Ken Kajisa, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in
Tokyo, said today by phone. China, the world’s largest auto
market, is also the biggest rubber user.  Foreign direct investment in China fell for a sixth month
in April, government data showed today.  Economic growth  may slow
to the “mid-7 percent range” this year, according to Pacific
Investment Management Co. That’s would be the slowest since 1999.  September-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
dropped 0.7 percent to close at 24,685  yuan  ($3,906) a ton. Thai
rubber on a  free-on-board  basis fell 1.7 percent to 115.25 baht
($3.67) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  Thailand’s Rubber Estate Organization left the price at
which it will buy ribbed smoked sheets from farmers unchanged at
115.39 baht to 115.48 baht per kilogram, despite a decline at
auctions, the agency said on its website today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
