Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS) , Polandâ€™s biggest
television network, surged the most in more than three months
after reporting higher-than-predicted profit in the first
quarter.  The shares advanced 4.1 percent to 13.8 zloty, the most
since Feb. 1, and traded at 13.54 zloty as of 9:04 a.m. in
Warsaw.  Net income almost tripled to 205.1 million zloty ($61
million) from 76.4 million zloty a year earlier, beating the
160.3 million-zloty mean estimate of three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
