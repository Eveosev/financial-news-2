     May 15 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index dropping to a four-month low, as continuing political
gridlock in  Greece  added to speculation the nation will leave
the euro and the ratings of 26 Italian banks were cut by Moody’s
Investors Service, damping demand for riskier assets.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which gets 39 percent of its sales
in  Europe , slumped 3.1 percent to its lowest level on record.
 Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  led shipping companies lower after a
gauge of cargo rates slid. Hokuetsu Kishu Paper Co. dropped 5.8
percent after forecasting a decline in profit.  The Topix lost 1.2 percent to 747.40 as of 3 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
the lowest close since Jan. 19. More than three shares fell for
each that rose on the measure. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
dropped 0.8 percent to 8,900.74, with trading volume 14 percent
above the 30-day average.  “The market is moving in anticipation of the worst-case
scenario because we don’t know what will happen” in Greece,
said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio investment group manager at
Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. that manages $109
billion in assets. “The Greek turmoil has yet to dent economic
fundamentals, but sentiment is causing a sell-off, particularly
in Japanese equities.”  The Nikkei 225 has retreated 13 percent from this year’s
high on March 27 as  China ’s economic growth slowed and on
renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The political
leadership vacuum in Greece after an inconclusive election has
stoked concern European officials will give up on the nation.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.5 percent
today. The gauge fell 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after
Greece’s struggle to form a unity government entered its second
week. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Europe has
done its “utmost” to rescue the financially stricken country,
limiting further room for leniency after about 240 billion euros
($308 billion) of aid pledges.  Italian Banks Downgraded  UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA were among 26 Italian
banks whose credit ratings were cut by Moody’s, which cited
weakened earnings and the country’s economic outlook.  Europe’s economy is expected to shrink 0.2 percent in the
three months ended in March from a year earlier, according to
the median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead
of today’s report. That would be the first contraction since the
last quarter of 2009.  “Investors would think if Greece goes, maybe Portugal,
Spain and Italy go,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “I think we may go
through a period of fairly intense uncertainty if they end up
leaving.”  Exporters Retreat  Exporters to Europe fell. Nippon Sheet Glass declined 3.1
percent to a record-low 93 yen after saying it will halt a
furnace at its German plant on slumping demand. Nintendo Co., a
maker of gaming consoles that gets 41 percent of its revenue in
Europe, lost 3.1 percent to 9,470 yen.  Shipping lines fell after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure
of cargo rates for commodities, capped a four-day slide with a
0.5 percent decline yesterday. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.,
Japan’s third-largest shipping company, declined 5.1 percent to
130 yen. Sector leader  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  slid 2.5 percent to 197
yen.  Hokuetsu Kishu Paper fell 5.8 percent to 437 yen after it
said net income will fall 41 percent to 7.5 billion yen ($94
million) in the year ending March 31, citing expectations for a
strong yen, high oil prices and power shortages.  Stocks on the Topix are valued at 0.89 times book value,
compared with 2.12 for the S&P 500 and 1.36 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. A value less than one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 1 percent to 22.11,
indicating traders expect a swing of 6.3 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
