Fondul Proprietatea SA (FP) , a Romanian
property fund, incurred a first-quarter loss of 1.5 million lei
($434,000), compared with a 14 million-lei profit a year
earlier, according to a filing with the Bucharest Stock
Exchange.  Net asset value declined to 16 billion lei at the end of
March, from 16.5 billion a year earlier, and to 15.5 billion at

 Transgaz SA. (TGN)  It was set up to compensate citizens for property
confiscated under communism and started trading on the bourse in
January last year.  Fondulâ€™s shares dropped 2.9 percent and traded at 0.475 lei
