Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s initial public
offering likely will account for 20 percent of California’s
personal income growth this calendar year, the state fiscal
analyst said.  California is likely to take in about $2.1 billion in taxes
from the biggest internet IPO during the next 13 months,
according a report today from the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
The state expects personal income to grow 4.9 percent in 2012.
If the  Facebook IPO  were excluded, that would total 4.0 percent,
the agency said.  Money paid to company executives, investors and insiders
would equal 1 percent of all personal income in 2012, the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
