Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the world’s
fifth-largest oil company by market value, said first-quarter
profit topped analysts’ expectations because of increased
revenue from gasoline sales and higher crude exports.  Net income  dropped 16 percent to 9.2 billion reais ($4.6
billion), or 71 centavos a share, from 10.99 billion reais, or
84 centavos, a year earlier,  Brazil ’s state-controlled producer
said today in a statement. Per-share profit beat the 64-centavo
average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Petrobras increased prices for gasoline and diesel by 10
percent and 2 percent, respectively, on Nov. 1 to reduce the
discount with international prices, the first boost in more than
three years. Oil exports rose 20 percent to 497,000 barrels a
day after the company sold inventories it accumulated in late
2011, Petrobras said in a regulatory filing.  “We had more exports at higher prices,” Chief Financial
Officer Almir Barbassa said at a press conference in  Rio de
Janeiro . “We sold more (gasoline) at higher prices as a result
of the price adjustment last year.”  Rising Fuel Imports  The company bought gasoline imports at a 17 percent premium
compared with domestic prices during the first quarter, Auro Rozenbaum, an analyst at Bradesco SA, said in a telephone
interview before the report was released. Fuel imports climbed
46 percent to 406,000 barrels a day from a year ago and 3
percent from the fourth quarter.  Petrobras is investing $224.7 billion over five years to
build refineries,  develop deepwater fields  and ramp up output at
Lula, the largest discovery in Brazil’s history. Petrobras is
spending more than any other major  oil company  as it develops
fields in waters as deep at 2,800 meters (9,186 feet) that are
trapped under a layer of salt.  The Brazilian producer said it discovered more oil in the
so-called pre-salt region during the quarter, including Carioca
Sela and Carcara in the Santos Basin and Pao de Azucar in the
Campos Basin. Petrobras started output at the Cascade field in
the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  in the period.  Brent crude  averaged $118.45 a barrel in the first quarter,
up from $105.52 a year earlier. Brent oil for June settlement
gained 0.6 percent to close at $112.24 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  Petrobras fell 2.2 percent to close at 18.49 reais in  Sao
Paulo  today. The earnings report was released after the end of
regular trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
