The Czech Republic’s weak economic
performance in the first quarter increases the chances that
 interest rates  will be cut rather than raised, Reuters reported,
citing central bank Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl.  “It is much harder to think about anything else in the
future other than further easing,” Hampl was quoted by Reuters
as saying in an interview during an economic conference in the
Polish city of Katowice today. “It is definitely yet another
factor heading in (the) anti-inflationary direction.”  Gross domestic product contracted 1 percent from the
previous quarter, the steepest drop since the second quarter of
2009, after shrinking 0.1 percent in the final three months of
last year, the Prague-based Czech Statistic Office said in a
flash estimate on today. The reading was worse than the median
forecast of 0.1 percent growth in a Bloomberg survey of 14
economists. GDP fell 1 percent from the same period of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
