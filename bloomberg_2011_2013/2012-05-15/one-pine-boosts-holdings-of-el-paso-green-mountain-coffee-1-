Lone Pine  Capital LLC bought more
than 25 million shares of  El Paso Corp. (EP)  in the first quarter,
making the hedge fund one of the energy firm’s biggest owners.  Lone Pine, run by Stephen F. Mandel Jr., more than
quadrupled its stake in Houston-based El Paso, according to a
regulatory filing today. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge
fund is now El Paso’s second-biggest shareholder after Vanguard
Group Inc., according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Icahn
Associates Corp., previously the biggest shareholder, sold its
entire stake, according to a subsequent filing.  The hedge fund also more than doubled its holding in Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., the Waterbury, Vermont-based
company that ousted Robert P. Stiller as chairman after he sold
shares to meet a margin call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
