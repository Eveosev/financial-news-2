Netia SA (NET) , Polandâ€™s second-largest
fixed-line phone company, tumbled to the lowest in more than
four months after posting a net loss in the first quarter,
missing estimates for a profit.  The shares declined as much as 5.3 percent to 5.34 zloty,
the weakest level since Jan. 10, and traded 4.1 percent lower at
5.41 zloty as of 9:08 a.m. in Warsaw.  The net loss narrowed to 9.85 million zloty ($2.94 million)
from 23 million zloty a year earlier. Three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a profit of 4.43 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
