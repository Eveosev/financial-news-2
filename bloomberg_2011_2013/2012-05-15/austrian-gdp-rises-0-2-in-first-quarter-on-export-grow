Austria’s economy expanded in the
first quarter after the Alpine republic’s manufacturers lifted
exports and people consumed more goods and services, the
government-backed Wifo economic research institute said.  First-quarter gross domestic product, the value of goods
and services, rose 0.2 percent from the preceding three months,
Wifo said today in an e-mailed statement. Households consumed
0.2 percent more. It was the first period of growth in Austria
since the second quarter of 2011, according to the institute.  Austrian manufacturers including  Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s
second biggest maker of hydroelectric turbines,  Palfinger AG (PAL) ,
the world’s biggest truck-mounted crane maker, and  RHI AG (RHI) , the
world’s biggest maker of fireproofing ceramics, reported higher
revenue in the first three months of the year.  Wifo revised its estimates for the third and fourth
quarters of last year to zero growth. It previously had said GDP
retracted 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter after increasing 0.2
percent in the third quarter.  Austria’s economy grew 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis,
according to Wifo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
