National championship-winning coaches
Jimmy Johnson and Phil Fulmer are among 17 inductees to the
College Football Hall of Fame.  Former Brigham Young University quarterback Ty Detmer, the
1990 Heisman Trophy winner as college football’s best player, is
also in the Hall of Fame’s class of 2012, along with former
Syracuse University wide receiver Art Monk.  Johnson, 68, coached at Oklahoma State from 1979 to 1983
and the  University of Miami  from 1984 to 1988, compiling an 81-
34-3 record. He went 52-9 in five seasons with the Hurricanes
and led Miami to a 12-0 season and the 1987 national
championship before coaching in the  National Football League .  “People for years have asked me to compare coaching in
professional football and coaching in college football,”
Johnson said at a news conference in New York. “While winning
back-to-back  Super Bowls  with the  Dallas Cowboys  was rewarding,
the most fun I had in football was in college.”  Fulmer, 61, had a 152-52 record as the University of
Tennessee’s coach from 1992 to 2008 and led the Volunteers to
the first Bowl Championship Series title in 1998.  Former Texas A&M coach R.C. Slocum was also selected to the
Hall of Fame, while others in this year’s class include
Louisiana State tailback Charles Alexander, Purdue halfback Otis
Armstrong and California quarterback Steve Bartkowski.  Also selected were University of Southern California split
end Hal Bedsole, Notre Dame tight end Dave Casper, Rice
quarterback Tommy Kramer, Colorado State defensive back Greg Myers, UCLA offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden, Texas Tech
defensive tackle Gabe Rivera, Kansas State linebacker Mark Simoneau and Air Force safety  Scott Thomas . Colorado offensive
lineman John Wooten was a selection of the Hall of Fame’s
veterans committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
