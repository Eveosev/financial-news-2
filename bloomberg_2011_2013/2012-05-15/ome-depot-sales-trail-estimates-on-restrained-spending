Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, forecast that sales this year will
slow from the first quarter because warm weather pulled forward
purchases of plants and gardening equipment.  First-quarter revenue rose 5.9 percent to $17.8 billion,
Atlanta-based Home Depot said today in a statement. That trailed
analysts’ $18 billion average estimate. Sales this year will
advance 4.6 percent, the company said.  Warmer-than-normal temperatures accelerated sales of
outdoor items, raising concern that second-quarter sales would
slow. Same-store sales decelerated during the course of the
first quarter, rising 5.4 percent in April after advancing 6
percent in March and 6.2 percent in February, Chief Financial
Officer Carol Tome told analysts today.  “How much sales were pulled forward from later in the year
is the question weighing on investors’ minds,”  John Tomlinson ,
an analyst at ITG Investment Research in  New York , said today by
telephone. He doesn’t rate Home Depot shares.  Profit this year will be $2.90 a share, including the
benefits of share repurchases and the termination of a loan
guarantee, up from a projection of $2.79 in February. Analysts
estimated $2.91, on average.  Home Depot fell 2.4 percent to $48.67 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have advanced 16 percent this year.  Customers spent an average of $54.51 per visit in the
quarter, up 2.2 percent from a year earlier, Home Depot said.
Sales at stores open at least a year gained 5.8 percent.  Net income in the quarter ended April 29 increased 27
percent to $1.04 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $812
million, or 50 cents a year earlier. Excluding some items,
profit was 65 cents a share, matching the average estimate of 25
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
