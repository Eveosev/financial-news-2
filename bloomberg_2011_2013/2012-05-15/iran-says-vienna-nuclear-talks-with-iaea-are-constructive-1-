Iran  said its negotiations with
International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors are on track and
constructive as the two sides entered a second day of meetings
in Vienna.  “We had good talks,” Iran’s IAEA Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh told reporters outside the Persian Gulf nation’s
embassy. “Everything is on the right track. The environment is
very constructive.”  A group of five IAEA officials, led by top inspector Herman Nackaerts, entered the embassy about 10:00 a.m. local time. They
declined to comment.  Iran and the IAEA are holding talks in an attempt to
address suspicions that the country is pursuing nuclear-weapons
capabilities. In a Nov. 8 report, the IAEA cited information
provided by a member state and satellite-imagery analysis
indicating Iran may have conducted high-explosive tests of
components for an atomic weapon at Parchin, 18 miles (30
kilometers) southwest of Tehran.  “The aim of our two days is to reach an agreement on an
approach to resolve all outstanding issues with Iran,”
Nackaerts told reporters yesterday before the meetings began.
“In particular, clarification of the possible military
dimensions remains our priority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
