AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker, shouldn’t get a further reduction for an
antitrust fine of 52.5 million euros ($67.5 million), an adviser
to the European Union’s highest court said.  Jan Mazak, the advocate general to the EU’s Court of
Justice, said the tribunal shouldn’t re-examine a reduction of
the penalty, according at a non-binding opinion today.  A 2010 lower court ruling cut AstraZeneca’s fine from the
60 million euros levied by EU regulators. The company misled
patent officials and flouted antitrust rules to block a generic
version of its Prilosec heartburn medicine, according to the
2005 antitrust decision.  “The General Court correctly examined all the elements
relevant to the calculation of the fine,” Mazak said in the
opinion. The higher court shouldn’t “substitute, on grounds of
fairness, its own assessment” for a previous ruling.  Prilosec was the world’s best-selling drug in the late
1990s. The European Commission, the region’s antitrust
regulator, said AstraZeneca blocked cheaper versions from 1993
to 2000 to keep prices high. AstraZeneca provided the patent
offices in  Belgium ,  Denmark ,  Germany , the Netherlands,  Norway 
and the U.K. with incorrect data to extend patent protection on
Prilosec, the EU said.  Antitrust Review  Mazak also advised the court to reject challenges from
regulators, AstraZeneca and the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations to the 2010 ruling.  EU antitrust officials are reviewing pharmaceutical
companies’ agreements with generic competitors to check whether
the deals break antitrust rules by delaying the market entry of
generic versions of branded medicines.  The EU in March dropped a probe into AstraZeneca and
Nycomed A/S, now part of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., after it
found no evidence that they had colluded to keep cheaper copies
of medicines off the market. The EU’s antitrust agency raided
AstraZeneca and Nycomed in November 2010. AstraZeneca, second to
GlaxoSmithKline Plc in the U.K., said at the time that the
inspections at its premises concerned the ulcer drug  Nexium .  While the court aide’s opinion isn’t binding, it is
followed by the court in the majority of cases.  The case is C-457/10 P AstraZeneca v Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
