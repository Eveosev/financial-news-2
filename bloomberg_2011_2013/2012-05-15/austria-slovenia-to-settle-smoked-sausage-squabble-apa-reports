Austria  is set to settle a dispute
over  plans  by its southern neighbor Slovenia to  protect the name 
of a sausage popular in both nations, the Austrian Press Agency
reported today.  Austria’s Agriculture Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich and his
Slovene colleague Franc Bogovic have reached a compromise in the
dispute, APA said, citing the Austrian ministry. An experts’
commission will meet next week to work out the deal, the agency
reported.  Slovenia will pursue its plan to restrict the right to sell
the smoked pork sausage under its traditional name --“Kranjska
klobasa” in Slovenia or “Krainer Wurst” in Austria -- under
European Union regulations that also protect Italian  Parma ham 
or Greek  Feta cheese . Under the deal the ministers reached,
Austrian producers would still be allowed to use the name
Kaesekrainer for a variety of the sausage that contains bits of
cheese and is the most popular in Austria.  Austria and Slovenia, both part of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire before World War I, are embroiled in several disputes
over their common cultural heritage. A 56-year debate over
minority rights for ethnic Slovenes in southern Austria ended
with a deal for dual-language road signs only last year.  Nationalist Austrian politicians including the late Joerg Haider objected to the use of some motifs on Slovenia’s euro
coins, arguing Slovenia was misusing Austrian symbols. Austria
gained a protected status like the one sought for the sausages
by Slovenia for  pumpkin seed oil , which is equally popular and
traditional in Slovenia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
