(Corrects company in second paragraph in the story
originally published May 11.)  Textile demand climbed 2.4 percent
last year to a record 82 million metric tons, led by growth in
polyester fibers, according to a study.  Natural fibers such as cotton had a 3.4 percent drop in
demand to 29.4 million tons, according to the study by The Fiber
Year GmbH in  Switzerland  and presented at a trade association of
chemical fiber manufacturers today in  Frankfurt . Cellulosic man-
made fibers that come from wood grew 6.3 percent to 4.7 million
tons, according to the study. Overall, man-made fibers growth
was 6 percent to 52.7 million tons, it said.  Cotton prices jumped 92 percent in 2010 and then fell 37
percent last year. “The textile future will depend to a larger
degree on man-made fibers,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
