Iran and  International Atomic Energy
Agency  inspectors extended a round of negotiations over the
Persian Gulf nation’s suspected nuclear-weapon work after both
sides said progress had been made.  IAEA inspectors will meet again with their Iranian
counterparts on May 21 in Vienna. They ended today two days of
talks in the Austrian capital.  “We discussed a number of options to take the agency
verification process forward,” IAEA chief inspector Herman Nackaerts told reporters. “We had a good exchange of views.”  Iran and the IAEA are holding talks in an attempt to
address suspicions that the country is pursuing nuclear-weapons
capabilities. In a Nov. 8 report, the IAEA cited information
provided by a member state and satellite-imagery analysis
indicating  Iran  may have conducted high-explosive tests of
components for an atomic weapon at Parchin, 18 miles (30
kilometers) southwest of Tehran.  “We had fruitful discussions in a very conducive
environment,” Iran’s IAEA Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh said.
“We have had progress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
