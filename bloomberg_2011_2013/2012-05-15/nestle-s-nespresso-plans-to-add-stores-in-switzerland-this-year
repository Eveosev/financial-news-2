Nestle SA (NESN) ’s Nespresso coffee brand
opened a new store in Geneva and said it plans to open another
boutique in  Switzerland  this year, bringing the total number of
shops in the country to 22 by the end of 2012.  Nespresso’s growth rate in its home market is “good,”
Pascal Hottinger, the head of Nespresso’s business in
Switzerland, said in an interview at the opening in a Manor
department store today, without giving a figure.  The next
opening will also be in a Manor store, he said.  “With Nespresso, you have a kind of small luxury one can
afford on a daily basis,” Hottinger said. “We have a product
that is probably resisting economic turmoil better than
others.”  Nespresso faces increased competition as food companies
including  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  seek to tap the expanding market for
single-serve coffee. Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle has sued
Ethical Coffee Co. and U.S. foodmaker  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)  after they
began to offer coffee-filled capsules compatible with Nespresso
machines in 2010.  Nespresso, which also supplies coffee to businesses, and a
partner have introduced a professional machine capable of making
as many as 300 cups per hour, Hottinger said.  “We were already present in five-star hotels and high-
class restaurants but the chefs would tell us if we have a big
reception, we need more high capacity,” Hottinger said. “It’s
a new inroad for Nespresso into gastronomy.”  The machine has automated cleaning and makes a broad range
of coffees, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
