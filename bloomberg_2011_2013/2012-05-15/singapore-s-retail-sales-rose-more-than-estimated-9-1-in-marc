Singapore’s retail sales grew more
than economists estimated in March as consumers increased
spending on food, clothing and telecommunication goods.  The  retail sales index  climbed 9.1 percent from a year
earlier after gaining a revised 20.1 percent in February, the
statistics department said in a statement today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists was for a
7.2 percent increase. Excluding automobiles, retail sales rose
6.5 percent from a year earlier.  Jobs growth and an expanding tourism industry have spurred
spending at hotels, restaurants and department stores, helping
offset a contraction in manufacturing last quarter. The island’s
retail sales have been boosted by prices of car permits near
record levels as the Singapore government limits the number of
vehicles to control pollution and congestion.  “A rise in car sales and a rebound in tourist arrivals
after seasonal weakness in January-February” supported retail
growth, Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based senior regional
economist at Barclays Plc, said before the report.  Adjusted for seasonal factors, retail sales rose 1.6
percent in March from February, when they dropped a revised 1.4
percent, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
