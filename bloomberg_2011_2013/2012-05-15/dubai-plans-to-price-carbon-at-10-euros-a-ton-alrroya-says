Dubai plans to offer United Nations
carbon credits at 10 euros ($12.85) a metric ton from next year
for sale to European countries, Alrroya reported, citing Waleed
Salman, chairman of the Dubai Centre for Carbon Excellence.  Dubai is seeking its first tradable emission credits under
the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism as it seeks to increase
 energy efficiency  and rely more on solar power to meet future
demand.  UN offsets for December delivery were up 0.6 percent at
3.66 euros a ton as of 11:03 a.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
