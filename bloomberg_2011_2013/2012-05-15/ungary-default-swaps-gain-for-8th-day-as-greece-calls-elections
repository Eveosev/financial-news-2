Hungary ’s cost of insuring against
default on government debt gained for an eighth day and the
forint dropped as Greece headed for new elections, raising
concern that Europe’s debt crisis will escalate.  The country’s five-year credit-default swaps rose 3 basis
points to 553 basis points by 5 p.m. in Budapest, the longest
rising streak since November, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency of Hungary, the European Union’s most
indebted eastern member, retreated 0.4 percent to 293.4 per
euro. That means a 1.5 percent loss in the past three days, the
most in a similar period since March 29.  Demand for riskier assets dropped as Greek Pasok party
leader  Evangelos Venizelos  said the country will hold elections,
threatening to extend the political deadlock that left the
country without a government since the last vote on May 6.
Hungary’s economy contracted more than economists estimated in
the first quarter, according to data from the Budapest-based
statistics office today.  “Spillover of euro zone weakness to  emerging markets  is
hitting Eastern Europe particularly hard,”  Marc Chandler , New
York-based global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman, and colleagues wrote in a research report today.  Hungary hasn’t started talks on an aid deal of its own
almost six months after requesting the assistance from the
 International Monetary Fund .  Hungary’s benchmark 10-year bonds dropped, lifting yields 4
basis points to 8.34 percent, the highest since April 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
