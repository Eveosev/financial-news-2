Manchester United’s Alex Ferguson was
named the best manager in Premier League history, while Red
Devils midfielder  Ryan Giggs  was voted top player.  Ferguson has led United to 12 Premier League championships,
including the inaugural title in the 1992-93 season. The Scot is
the only person to manage in every season in the league.  Giggs, like Ferguson, has captured 12 titles and appeared
in a league-record 598 games. He’s also the only player to have
played and scored in each of the league’s 20 years.  “Being named as the best player in the 20 seasons of the
Premier League is a tremendous honor for me and very humbling
when you consider some of the brilliant players who were
nominated alongside me,” Giggs, who beat out the likes of
 Thierry Henry , Alan Shearer and Dennis Bergkamp for the honor,
said in a statement. “The Premier League is bigger and better
than it was 20 years ago, there’s no doubt about it.”  The duo were honored today at a ceremony in London to mark
the league’s two-decade history. They were selected by a panel
of league experts, which chose Arsenal’s unbeaten
“Invincibles” in 2003-04 as the best team.  Giggs was also one of seven United players picked for the
panel’s team of the 20 years, joining Peter Schmeichel, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Cristiano Ronaldo,  Paul Scholes  and Roy Keane. Henry, Shearer, Tony Adams and Ashley Cole rounded out
the squad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
