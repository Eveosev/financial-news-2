The ruble weakened for an eighth day
against the dollar, erasing earlier gains, as crude oil gave up
its advance after the failed talks in  Greece  to form a new
government curbed appetite for emerging-market assets.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 30.6 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, extending its longest stretch of
declines since December and wiping out a rise of as much as 0.4
percent. The ruble fell 0.2 percent to 39.14 per euro and
declined 0.4 percent to 34.443 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Crude oil for June delivery fell 0.2 percent to $94.61 in
 New York , erasing its earlier advance of as much as 0.7 percent.
Greek Pasok party leader  Evangelos Venizelos  said new elections
will be held after attempts to form a government failed, adding
to concerns the country may exit the euro area.  The ruble has dropped 3.8 percent against the dollar since
the end of the first quarter, heading for its first quarterly
loss since Sept. 30. Over the same period Brazil’s real fell 8.7
percent, India’s rupee declined 5.6 percent and China’s  yuan 
depreciated 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
