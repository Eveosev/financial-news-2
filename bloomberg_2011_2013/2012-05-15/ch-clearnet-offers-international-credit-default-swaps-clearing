LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., owner of the
world’s largest  interest-rate swaps  clearinghouse, said it now
clears credit-default swaps internationally, expanding its two-
year old domestic French service.  LCH.Clearnet said in a statement that its CDSClear service
will work with 10 international banks, including Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc, in addition to four
French banks. It clears Series 5 and above of the Markit iTraxx
 Europe , HiVol and Crossover indexes, and will introduce single-
name clearing later this year, subject to regulatory approval.  Clearinghouses operate as central counterparties for every
buy and sell order executed by their members, who post
collateral, reducing the harm from a trader’s default. Credit
swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying
securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to
adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
