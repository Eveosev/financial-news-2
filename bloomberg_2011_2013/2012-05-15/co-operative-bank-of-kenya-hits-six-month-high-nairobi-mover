Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
country’s fourth-biggest lender by market value, headed for the
highest in six months on bets first-quarter earnings will grow.  The stock advanced 0.7 percent to 14.10 shillings by 2:48
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at that level would be the
strongest since Nov. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “They are yet to release their first-quarter numbers and a
section of the market believe earnings per share could grow 10
percent to 15 percent quarter-on-quarter,” George Bodo, head of
research at Nairobi-based Old Mutual Securities Ltd. said in a
phone interview today.  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) , Kenya’s biggest lender by market value,
posted a 13 percent increase in first-quarter profit to 2.64
billion shillings ($31.7 million) as loans surged.  Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the second-biggest, had a 37 percent jump
in first-quarter earnings. Both lenders reported earnings on
April 26.  In the full year to December, Co-operative Bank said net
income increased 17 percent to 5.36 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
