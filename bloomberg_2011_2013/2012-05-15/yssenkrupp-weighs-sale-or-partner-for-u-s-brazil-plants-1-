ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s largest
steelmaker, may seek a partner or sell its U.S. and Brazilian
plants as expenses rise and North American demand slows.  Brazil  output costs are rising “disproportionately,”
while the  U.S. economy  is showing no “major momentum,” the
Essen-based steelmaker said in an e-mailed statement today
announcing the review. The company didn’t provide a deadline for
the possible partnership or sale of the steel units.  “Since the plans for the project were made, the economic
parameters both in Brazil and in the USA have changed from our
original assumptions,” Chief Executive Officer  Heinrich Hiesinger  said in the statement. “There are clear reasons that
now call this strategy into question.”  ThyssenKrupp in 2010 started operating its CSA steel-slabs
plant, where it has a 73.1 percent stake, in Rio de Janeiro
state. The company built the facility, with a capacity of 5
million metric tons a year, to supply an estimated 3 million
tons of steel slabs a year to its mills in Calvert near Mobile,
 Alabama , and the rest to Germany.  Delays at the CSA contributed to impairment charges of 2.9
billion euros ($3.7 billion) in the last fiscal year, when it
reported a loss. Vale SA owns the remaining 26.9 percent.  “The viability of an integrated strategy with slab
production in Brazil and high-margin marketing in the USA is
therefore exposed to considerable risks,” ThyssenKrupp said.  ThyssenKrupp rose 2.9 percent to 16.28 euros at 4:39 p.m.
in Frankfurt. The stock has fallen about 9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
