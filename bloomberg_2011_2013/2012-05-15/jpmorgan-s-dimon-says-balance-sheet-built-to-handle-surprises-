JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman Jamie Dimon said the firm’s balance sheet
is built to withstand unexpected incidents after the company
last week announced a $2 billion trading loss.  “We maintain a fortress balance sheet to manage surprises
and setbacks like this,” Dimon told shareholders today at their
annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. “I’m confident when we’re
done here we’ll be a stronger company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
