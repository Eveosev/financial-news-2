Azerbaijan  pumped less oil and
natural gas in the first four months of the year compared with
the same period a year earlier, the State Statistics Committee
said on its website today.  The Caspian Sea nation produced 14.8 million metric tons of
marketable oil in the January-April period, down from 15.9
million tons a year earlier, according to data on the committee
website. Gas output declined to 6 billion cubic meters from 8.4
billion cubic meters.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million
tons of oil last year compared with 50.8 million tons the year
before. Gas production fell to 25.7 billion cubic meters from
26.3 billion cubic meters.  Azerbaijan cut oil output to ensure the peak period of
production from the BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field, or
ACG, continues for 10 to 15 years,  State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of Azerbaijan
Vice President Elshad Nasirov said in a May 1 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
