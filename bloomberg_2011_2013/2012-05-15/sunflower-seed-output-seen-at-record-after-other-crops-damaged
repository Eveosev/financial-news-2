Global sunflower seed production may
climb to a record for a second straight year as European
farmers replant fields this spring with the oilseed after
winter crops were damaged, Oil World said.  World output of the oilseed may rise to 39.01 million
metric tons in the 2012-13 crop year, above the previous record
of 38.83 million produced a year earlier, the Hamburg-based
researcher said today in a report. France, Romania, Bulgaria and
Hungary may plant record sunflower seed acreage, while sowing in
Russia and Ukraine may be “sharply above the government
estimates,” Oil World said.  “In many countries damage to winter crops (grains and
rapeseed) resulted in acreage abandonment, a large part of which
is now being replanted this spring with sunflowers or corn,”
the researcher said.  Crops in Russia and Ukraine still may be at risk because of
above normal temperatures and lack of rain in recent weeks, Oil
World said. If dry weather persists in the next two months
production is at “a high risk” of being lower than forecast,
according to the report.  Sunflower seed futures traded in Johannesburg climbed 8.4
percent this year by yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
