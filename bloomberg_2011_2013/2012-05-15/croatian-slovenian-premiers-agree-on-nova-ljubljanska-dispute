Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic and his Slovenian counterpart Janez Jansa said they
will work to resolve a dispute over money owed to Croatian
savers by the predecessors of Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.  “The issue of savers will be resolved to the benefit of
all citizens,” Jansa told reporters after meeting with
Milanovic today in Maribor, Slovenia. “Like with all the
remaining issues, we will try to resolve this one without much
ado.”  Croatia , which needs Slovenia to ratify its European Union
membership to enter the bloc in July 2013, doesn’t allow NLB to
operate in Croatia before the dispute is settled. The Ljubljana-
based debt is estimated at 312 million deutsche marks ($204
million), the former German currency that was widely used in
former  Yugoslavia .  Jansa also said it is in Slovenia’s interest that Croatia
becomes an EU member “as soon as possible,” according to a
statement on the Croatian government’s Twitter profile.  Slovenia and Croatia agreed in October 2010 to resolve the
dispute under the auspices of the  Bank for International
Settlements  in Basel. The bank a month later rejected mediation,
saying it could not bring any added value to negotiations.  An EU member since 2004, Slovenia blocked its neighbor’s EU
accession talks for 10 months in 2009 over a border issue. The
two countries in January agreed on a panel of legal experts to
work out a resolution.  “All the difficult issues are gone, there are only
technical aspects that we will resolve in joint commissions,”
Milanovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
