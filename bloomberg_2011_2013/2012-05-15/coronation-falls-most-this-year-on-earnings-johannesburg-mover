Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML) , a
South African  money manager , fell the most in three years after
earnings growth slowed in the six months through March.  The shares dropped as much as 6.4 percent and closed 5.6
percent lower at 27.30 rand in Johannesburg, the biggest one-day
fall since May 2009.  Diluted earnings per share adjusted for one-time items
advanced 6 percent to 86.7 cents in the six months through
March, the company said in a statement today. Earnings per share
on the same basis rose 38 percent in the year through September.  “We haven’t seen the growth that we have seen
previously,” Harry Botha, an analyst at Avior Research Ltd. who
has a hold recommendation on the stock, said by phone from
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
