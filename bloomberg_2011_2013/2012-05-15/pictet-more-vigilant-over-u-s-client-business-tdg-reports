Pictet & Cie. is “more vigilant than
ever” over its unit managing money for U.S. clients,  Tribune de
Geneve  reported, citing an interview with Nicolas Pictet, a
managing partner at the firm.  Pictet North America Advisors SA, led by 16 employees in
Geneva, oversees 3.3 billion Swiss francs ($3.5 billion) and is
profitable, the executive told the newspaper.  Pictet said that access to certain foreign markets may be
the main problem in future for the Swiss financial center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
