China  issued rules allowing the
nation’s insurers to invest in riskier debt as authorities seek
to expand the  bond market  in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Insurance companies may buy exchange-traded corporate bonds
that are unsecured, as well as non-financial company debt and
unsecured convertible debt issued by commercial banks, the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission said in  a statement  dated May 7
and posted to its website yesterday.  China has encouraged companies to raise more funds by
selling stocks and bonds as it seek to wean them from a
dependence on loans from state-owned banks and increase the
transparency of their finances. China Securities Regulatory
Commission Chairman  Guo Shuqing  said in a March interview with
the People’s Daily newspaper that international experience
showed over reliance on credit can lead to systemic risk.  Insurance companies gained in Shanghai trading, with China
Life Insurance Co. rising  0.96 percent , Ping An Insurance
(Group) Co. climbing  3.4 percent  and China Pacific Insurance
(Group) Co. rising  1.3 percent . China’s benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index fell 0.25 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
