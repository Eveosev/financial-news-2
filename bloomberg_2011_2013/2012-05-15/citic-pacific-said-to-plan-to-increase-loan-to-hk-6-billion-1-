Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , a Hong Kong-based
steelmaker with operations in iron ore mining and property
development in  China , plans to increase a loan to at least HK$6
billion ($773 million), according to a person familiar with the
matter.  The three-year facility will be marketed to other lenders
in general syndication later this month, the person said, asking
not to be identified because the details are private. Citic
Pacific originally sought a loan of HK$3 billion to HK$4 billion
and the size may be increased even further depending on bank
commitments, the person said.  Marjorie Law, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at Brunswick
Group LLP, which handles media relations for Citic Pacific,
didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the financing.  Proceeds will be used for the company’s iron ore project in
 Australia , the person said. Citic Pacific arranged a visit for
bankers to its sites in the country last month, another person
familiar with the matter said at the time.  Banks arranging the loan include Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., Bank of China Ltd. ( Hong Kong ), HSBC
Holdings Plc, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp., Hang Seng Bank Ltd., DBS Bank Ltd. and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the person who spoke
today said.  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., United Overseas Bank Ltd.
and another two banks have also joined to help organize the
borrowing, the person said, declining to elaborate further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
