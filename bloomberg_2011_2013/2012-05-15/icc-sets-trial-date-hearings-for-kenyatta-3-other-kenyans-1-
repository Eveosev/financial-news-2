The  International Criminal Court  will
hold hearings next month to set the trial date for four Kenyans
accused of directing and financing post-election violence four
years ago that killed 1,500 people.  The deliberations from June 11 to June 12 will also explore
the safety of prosecution witnesses, whether to disclose their
names and referrals to the ICC’s witness protection program, the
Hague-based court said today in an e-mailed statement.  In the first case, the court has charged Former Higher
Education Minister  William Ruto , radio presenter Joshua Arap Sang, with ordering murders, deportations and persecution. In
the second, Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura, the former head of the civil service, face the same
accusations, as well as being indirect co-perpetrators of rape
and other inhumane acts, according to the ICC’s website. All
four men maintain their innocence.  Kenyatta and Ruto say they plan to run for the presidency
in the next election, which the Independent Electoral and
Boundaries Commission scheduled for March 4.  Kenya was wracked by two months of violence sparked by
allegations of vote-rigging by supporters of then-opposition
leader  Raila Odinga , an ethnic Luo, following a Dec. 27, 2007
election.  The clashes subsided after incumbent President Mwai Kibaki,
a member of the most populous Kikuyu tribe, signed a power-
sharing accord with Odinga, who was named prime minister.  To contact the reporters on this story:
