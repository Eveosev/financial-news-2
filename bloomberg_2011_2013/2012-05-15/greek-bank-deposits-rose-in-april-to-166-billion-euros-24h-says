Greek banks saw business and
household deposits rise to more than 166 billion euros ($214
billion) in April from 165.3 billion euros in March,  24h.gr 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The increase was mainly due to a rise in household
deposits, which stand at 140 billion euros, the financial
website said.  Withdrawals havenâ€™t shown a worrying trend since the May 6
general election, which has led to political gridlock, 24h cited
bank officials as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
