The  Bank of Korea  is likely to keep
the key  interest rate  unchanged this year, setting a record for
the longest stretch that the benchmark has stayed on hold, an
adviser to the government said.  “Inflation pressures will bar a rate cut while the slower
economic growth path will prevent them from raising,’ said Yun Chang Hyun, who as president of the Korea Institute of Finance
advises the central bank,  finance ministry  and financial
regulators. He spoke in a May 11 interview in Seoul.  South Korea  held off from altering borrowing costs for an
11th month last week. The longest pause since the central bank
began setting a rate in 1999 was the 17-month stretch between
February 2009 and July 2010, when the benchmark was at a record
low of 2 percent to counter the effects of the global financial
crisis.  The export-driven economy will grow 3.4 percent this year,
Yun said. That is less than his institute’s October forecast of
3.7 percent.  All of the BOK’s seven board members voted last week to
keep the benchmark  seven-day repurchase rate  at 3.25 percent.  ‘‘The next move will be a hike and they will raise rates
only when they feel confident that the Europe crisis really hit
the bottom,” Yun said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
