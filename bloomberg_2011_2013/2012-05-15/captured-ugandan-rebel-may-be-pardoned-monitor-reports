Uganda’s Amnesty Commission may
consider pardoning a captured commander from Joseph Kony’s
Lord’s Resistance Army because he isn’t among the five rebel
leaders indicted by the International Criminal Court for war
crimes, the Daily Monitor reported.  Caesar Acellam, a field commander of the LRA, may be
considered if he applies for amnesty, the Kampala-based
newspaper reported, citing Nathan Twinomugisha, the commission’s
chief legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
