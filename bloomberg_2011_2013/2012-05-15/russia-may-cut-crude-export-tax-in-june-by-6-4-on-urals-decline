Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, may reduce its  export duty  on most crude shipments by
6.4 percent from June 1 after Urals prices dropped.  The standard duty may decline to $419.80 a metric ton, or
$57.27 a barrel, from $448.60 a ton this month, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry data. The
discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian Sea oil may
fall in June to $210.80 a ton from $232.40.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $114.18 a
barrel during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today. In the previous
monitoring period, the crude price averaged $120.76, according
to the ministry.  Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  must sign off on the levies
before they take effect.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products may drop
to $277 a ton next month from $296 in May. A gasoline tax
imposed from May 2011 to counter domestic shortages is expected
to decline to $377.80 a ton from $403.70 this month. That is 90
percent of the crude oil duty.  The government may raise the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $237.10 a ton in June from
$196.60 this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
