The birthplace of Secretariat, the
winner of horse racing’s Triple Crown in 1973, will be up for
auction a week from today following the foreclosure of the state
fair that bought the property.  Meadow Farm, which was purchased by the State Fair of
Virginia Inc. in 2003 and became the home of the fair in 2009,
will be sold at foreclosure auction on May 22 by Motley’s
Auction & Realty Group, according to its  website .  Secretariat swept the  Kentucky Derby ,  Preakness Stakes  and
Belmont Stakes as a 3-year-old colt. Thoroughbred racing hasn’t
had a Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.  The farm, which played a central role in the 2010 Walt
Disney Co. movie about Secretariat, was purchased by Christopher
Chenery in 1932. He was in bad health when his daughter,  Penny
Chenery , took over management of the farm and bred
Somethingroyal to Bold Ruler, producing Secretariat.  The State Fair of Virginia started in 1854 and is the
longest-running event in the state, according to Motley’s. The
property being auctioned on May 22 in Doswell, Virginia, about
26 miles north of Richmond, includes 331 acres of land, a 76,000
square-foot exhibition hall, and a 12,850 square-foot manor
house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
