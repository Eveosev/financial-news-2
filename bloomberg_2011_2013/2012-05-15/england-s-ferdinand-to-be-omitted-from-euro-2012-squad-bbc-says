Rio Ferdinand  is set to be omitted
from England’s Euro 2012 soccer squad and fellow defender Kyle
Walker will miss out because of injury, the British Broadcasting
Corp.  reported .  Manchester United’s Ferdinand, who has never played in a
European Championship and last represented the national team in
June, won’t be among the 23 players named today, the BBC
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Chelsea central defender  John Terry , who lost the England
captaincy in February after allegations that he racially abused
Ferdinand’s brother Anton, will be included, the BBC said. Terry
denies the charges and faces court July 9.  Full-back Walker, who won the Professional Footballers’
Association Young Player of the Year award this season, injured
his toe in Tottenham’s 2-0 Premier League win against Fulham
three days ago, the  BBC  said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
