IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB)  sued
 Bank of America Corp.  in New York state court over losses
related to more than $200 million in mortgage-backed securities
that it purchased.  The Dusseldorf, Germany-based bank contends Bank of
America, based in Charlotte,  North Carolina , misrepresented the
value of separate offerings of $200.3 million and $56.1 million,
according to two complaints filed in New York state Supreme
Court yesterday.  Bank of America “obtained mortgage loans from the
originators and created securities from them,” and sold them to
IKB “by means of offering materials which contained knowing
material misrepresentations and omissions,” IKB lawyers said in
the complaints.  IKB contends it sold the securities at a loss. The suits
allege common-law fraud, and seek damages, interest and legal
costs.  William Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman, said in an e-
mailed message that the company declined to comment on the
lawsuits.  The cases are IKB v. Bank of America, 651676/2012 and
651678/2012,  New York  state Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
