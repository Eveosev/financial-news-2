European stocks  dropped for a second
day, pushing the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index to its lowest level
since December, as Greece called a new election after the
country’s politicians failed to form a government.  Banks (SXXP)  posted the biggest contribution to the Stoxx 600’s
decline.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  plunged 6.1 percent, its biggest
slide in almost eight months, as revenue from assets under
management fell in the first four months of the year.  The Stoxx 600 retreated 0.7 percent to 245.76 at the close
in London, extending its drop from this year’s peak on March 16
to  9.8 percent . The gauge swung between gains and losses at
least nine times earlier today. The Stoxx 600 slid to its lowest
level since Dec. 30.  “Equities look cheap, but we all know why,” Didier Saint- Georges, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac
Gestion, which oversees about 50 billion euros ($64 billion),
said at a presentation in  London  today. “Valuations are not
necessarily pointing to any clear direction. For Europe, you
just don’t need growth, but also very profound adjustments both
fiscal and external, and that won’t happen quickly.”  National benchmark indexes fell in every western-European
market except Norway and Ireland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 0.5
percent and  France ’s CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent.  Germany ’s DAX
retreated 0.8 percent. Greece’s ASE Index plunged 3.6 percent to
its lowest level since November 1992.  Greece will hold its new vote as early as next month as
polls showed that the anti-austerity Syriza group could win the
ballot. The failure to form a government committed to austerity
has reignited concern that the country will leave the euro area.  Euro-Area Economy  Greece  will repay 435 million euros of foreign-law bonds
falling due today which weren’t tendered in the country’s debt
restructuring, the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  said in an e-
mailed statement . The repayment won’t prejudice future
decisions on other untendered bonds, the ministry said.  Germany’s Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Greece
must elect a government that sticks to the terms of its
international bailout if it wants to stay in the euro.  “If Greece -- and this is the will of the great majority -
- wants to stay in the euro then they have to accept the
conditions,” Schaeuble told reporters at a meeting of European
Union finance ministers in Brussels. “Otherwise it isn’t
possible. No responsible candidate can hide that from the
electorate.”  The Stoxx 600 lost 1.8 percent yesterday as Greece moved
closer to a possible exit from the euro area, European
industrial output slipped in March and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party lost a state election.  Euro-Area Economy  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation euro area stagnated
in the first quarter compared with the final three months of
2011, according to the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg. The  median forecast  of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had called for a 0.2 percent contraction. Germany’s
economy expanded 0.5 percent, compared with the 0.1 percent
 median estimate  of economists in a separate survey.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was
5.1 percent higher than the average over the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
 retail sales  increased 0.1 percent in April. That matched the
 median forecast  by 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
advanced 0.8 percent in March.  UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , the  biggest Italian
lenders , declined 5.5 percent to 2.53 euros and 5.5 percent to
97.65 euro cents, respectively, after Moody’s Investors Service
cut the credit ratings of 26 of the nation’s lenders, citing
weakened earnings and the domestic economic outlook.  Julius Baer  slumped 6.1 percent to 32.11 Swiss francs after
the Swiss wealth manager established in 1890 reported that its
gross margin, a measure of profitability, was “slightly below”
100 basis points over the period, compared with 105 basis points
in 2011. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  FLSmidth & Co. A/S tumbled 8.4 percent to 319 kroner after
the biggest maker of cement kilns posted net income and revenue
that missed analysts’ estimates. The Copenhagen-based company
reported first-quarter profit of 241 million kroner ($41.4
million) and sales of 5.15 billion kroner. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had predicted profit of 338 million kroner and  sales 
of 5.55 billion kroner.  Vivendi, Iliad Rise  Vivendi SA (VIV)  added 2 percent to 12.68 euros after reporting
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates. First-quarter net
income, excluding one-off gains or losses and some costs, fell
13 percent to 823 million euros. That beat the 765 million-euro
 average of analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Vivendi reiterated its forecast adjusted net income of more
than 2.5 billion euros this year, a decline of as much as 15
percent from 2011. It said in March that its earnings slump will
last through 2013 as SFR cuts prices to prevent customers from
defecting to France’s fourth mobile-phone operator,  Iliad SA. (ILD)   Iliad gained 3.6 percent to 102.20 euros. The company,
founded by entrepreneur Xavier Niel, posted  first-quarter sales 
that jumped 29 percent to 655.7 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
