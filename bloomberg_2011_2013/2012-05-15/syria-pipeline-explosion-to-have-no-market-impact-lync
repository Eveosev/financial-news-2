An explosion at a Syrian oil pipeline
yesterday will have no impact on global crude markets because of
the country’s declining output, said  Michael Lynch , president of
Strategic Energy & Economic Research.  “Syria isn’t a major player in the oil market on a good
day and with the current unrest and embargo it’s even less so,”
said Lynch in a phone interview from Winchester, Massachusetts.
“This is trivial. If the rebels blew up every pipeline in the
country nobody would care outside of Syria.”  An oil pipeline in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor was
rocked by a bomb, Reuters reported today, citing opposition
activists. The Syrian Arab News Agency reported explosions on
the same link on April 21 and 29.  The Paris-based  International Energy Agency  estimated in
its May monthly oil market report that  Syria  produced about
190,000 barrels a day last month, down from a daily average of
330,000 barrels in 2011 and 390,000 barrels in 2010.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is fighting a nationwide
rebellion that has spread as security forces killed thousands of
Syrians during a campaign to crush protests that began in March
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
