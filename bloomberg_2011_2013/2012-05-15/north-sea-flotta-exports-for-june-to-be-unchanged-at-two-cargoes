Exports of North Sea Flotta crude
will be unchanged in June from this month at two cargoes,
according to a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  The June program comprises one cargo each of 600,000
barrels and 650,000 barrels, the plan showed.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field. Loading programs
are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field
operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and
trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
