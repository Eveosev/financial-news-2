OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA ,
the  oil company  controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , fell the most in three weeks after reserve estimates at
its first development fell short of investors’ expectations.  OGX, based in  Rio de Janeiro , tumbled 2.3 percent at 11:20
a.m. in Sao Paulo. Earlier it slid as much as 4.7 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since April 23.  At Tubarao Azul, where OGX boosted output to 23,500 barrels
a day yesterday after adding a new well, the company calculates
total recoverable reserves of 110 million barrels over the
project’s lifetime. This figure will probably increase to 150
million barrels as the company improves technology and extracts
additional crude, Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca said on
a conference call with investors.  “The 110 million is smaller than we expected,” Auro
Rozenbaum, an analyst at Banco Bradesco SA in  Sao Paulo , said in
a telephone interview.  OGX’s target to produce as much as 40,000 barrels a day of
oil at Tubarao this year is also lower than previous company
estimates, Rozenbaum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
