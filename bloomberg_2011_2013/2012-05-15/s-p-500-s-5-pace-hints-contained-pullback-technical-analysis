The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  took
longer than usual to fall 5 percent from its peak this year, a
sign that any further retreat in U.S. stocks will be
“contained,” according to  Sam Stovall  of S&P.  The benchmark gauge reached the threshold yesterday after
spending 28 days without losing 5 percent from its April high.
Since 1950, it has taken an average 19 days to fall 5 percent,
based on a study by Stovall, S&P’s New York-based chief equity
strategist. Among those that took 28 days or longer to occur,
only 25 percent eventually turned into corrections, or retreats
of more than 10 percent, the data show. Stovall said in an e-
mail that he views losses of less than 5 percent as “noise”
and those of between 5 percent and 10 percent as pullbacks.  “The duration of this ‘noise’ likely indicates that the
ultimate decline will be contained, unless new worries emerge or
existing concerns become increasingly intensified in the coming
weeks or months,” Stovall wrote yesterday. “The market will
eventually bottom in a ‘pullback’ mode.”  The  S&P 500  has fallen 5.7 percent from its four-year high
in April amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening. The
index fell to a three-month low yesterday as  Greece  struggled to
form a new government, spurring speculation the nation may leave
the euro region.  Concern that European officials would fail to contain the
region’s debt crisis helped trigger the bull market’s biggest
retreat last year. The S&P 500 plunged 19 percent from April 29
through Oct. 3, 2011, as Moody’s Investors Service cut its
credit ratings on Portugal and Ireland to junk levels. The index
has since surged 22 percent amid better-than-expected U.S.
economic data and  corporate earnings .  Stovall sees the S&P 500 reaching 1,450 over the next 12
months, or an 8.3 percent gain from yesterday’s close of
1,338.35.  “Investors should stay the course and ride out what we see
as a seasonal slowdown,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
