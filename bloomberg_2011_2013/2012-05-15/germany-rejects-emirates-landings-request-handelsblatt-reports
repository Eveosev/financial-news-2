Germany â€™s transport ministry has
rejected a request by Emirates to increase the number of weekly
landings it is permitted to make in Germany,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing confidential correspondence between the
ministry and Emirates.  While airlines from the United Arab Emirates, which also
include Etihad Airways and  Qatar Airways , are no longer limited
to using only the airports in Frankfurt, Munich, Dusseldorf and
Hamburg in Germany, they will continue to be limited to 84
landings per week, the newspaper cited the letter as saying, in
a preview of an article that will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
