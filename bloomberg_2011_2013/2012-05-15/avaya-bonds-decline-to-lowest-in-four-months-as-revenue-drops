Bonds of Avaya Inc., the
communications-gear maker owned by private-equity firms, dropped
to the lowest level in four months as the company reported a
decline in quarterly revenue.  The company’s $700 million of 9.75 percent notes maturing
in November 2015 fell 7 cents to 90.5 cents on the dollar to
yield 13.3 percent at 4:55 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. That’s the biggest fall for the bonds
since they dropped by 9.25 cents on Aug. 25 and the lowest since
Jan. 4.  Avaya reported $1.26 billion in revenue for the first three
months of the year, down 9.6 percent from the same period last
year, according to a quarterly filing today. The company, which
has $6.1 billion in long term debt, the filing showed, said its
net loss narrowed to $162 million from $432 million.  The 9.75 percent notes of the  Basking Ridge , New Jersey-
based company are  rated  Caa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and
CCC+ by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporters on this story:
