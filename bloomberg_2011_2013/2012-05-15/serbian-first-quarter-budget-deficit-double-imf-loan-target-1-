Serbia’s first-quarter budget deficit
was double the target agreed upon in a loan program with the
 International Monetary Fund  while the government also breached a
self-imposed public-debt limit.  The shortfall totaled 52.7 billion dinars ($601.4 million)
compared with the IMF target of 26 billion dinars. Public debt
increased to 46.8 percent of economic output from 44.5 percent
at the end of February, the Belgrade-based  Finance Ministry  said
on its website today. The gap in March was 11.1 billion dinars
according to IMF methodology, it said.  March drew in  “significantly higher revenue” than
February, when three weeks of freezing temperatures and heavy
snowfall resulted in reduced power supplies to some industries,
the ministry said. Budget revenue in March rose on corporate
income-tax payments and a 3 billion-dinar dividend paid to the
state by government-held Telekom Srbija AD.  Spending in March rose to 79.4 billion dinars from 74.7
billion in February as the government paid subsidies to farmers
and to state-owned the road operator, while it continued to
finance the pay-as-you-go pension fund and repaid debt to
foreign creditors.  The Washington-based lender agreed with the government to
freeze a $1.3 billion loan program after it became clear  Serbia 
would slip on agreed targets, exceeding the budget-deficit limit
of 4.25 percent of gross domestic product by at least one
percentage point. The first-quarter budget gap totaled 6 percent
of GDP. Serbian fiscal rules set a limit of 45 percent of GDP
for public debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
