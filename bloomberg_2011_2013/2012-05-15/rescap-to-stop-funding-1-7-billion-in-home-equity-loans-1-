Residential Capital LLC, the bankrupt
mortgage company indirectly owned by the U.S. government, won
court approval to quit funding $1.7 billion in consumer home-
equity lines of credit to conserve cash.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck today approved the
company’s request to tell customers it will no longer fund their
so-called heloc loans. Peck ordered ResCap to provide consumers
with information about their legal rights related to  the loan
contracts.  “I consider this to be a fairly important matter,” Peck
said in court in Manhattan.  ResCap filed for bankruptcy yesterday with plans to sell
most of its assets to  Fortress Investment Group LLC. (FIG)  The company
listed assets of $15.7 billion and debt of
$15.3 billion in its petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. ResCap’s Chapter 11 filing is the biggest this year,
based on liabilities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Today’s decision means ResCap will no longer loan money to
consumers who have approved, home-equity lines of credit.
Funding such loans would “create liquidity concerns for the
estates,” ResCap said in court papers.  The company will continue to service loans that already
have been funded. ResCap also will keep making and funding
mortgage loans to consumers buying homes.  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the Detroit-based auto lender trying
to repay a U.S. government bailout, is ResCap’s parent.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
