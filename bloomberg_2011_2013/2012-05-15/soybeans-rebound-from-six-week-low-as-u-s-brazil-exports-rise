Soybeans rebounded from a six-week
low as export sales from the U.S. and  Brazil  climbed, draining
supply in the world’s two largest growers.  The amount of soybeans  inspected  for U.S. export almost
doubled in the week to May 10 to 20.3 million bushels from the
prior seven days, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday.
In Brazil, growers had sold 83 percent of the harvest as of May
11, up from 63 percent a year ago, according to researcher
Celeres.  “In the oilseed market, global stocks will tighten
considerably over the next 12 months, leaving this market still
susceptible to a large rally in prices,”  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  analysts including  Paul Deane  in
 Melbourne  said in a report e-mailed today.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 1.3 percent to $14.05 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 1:15 p.m. London time.
The oilseed yesterday reached $13.76, the lowest price since
March 30.  Rising demand for U.S. supplies will probably cut the
nation’s  inventories  by 31 percent from a year ago to 145
million bushels (3.94 million metric tons) before the 2013
harvest, the USDA said May 10.  Wheat for July delivery advanced 1.4 percent to $6.065 a
bushel. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat gained 0.6
percent to 196.75 euros ($252.55) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Wheat was supported after the USDA cut condition ratings
for the country’s winter crops yesterday, Rory Deverell, a risk-
 management consultant  at INTL FCStone in Dublin, said in a
report. About 60 percent of the  crop  was in good or excellent
condition as of May 13, down from 63 percent a week earlier that
received the top ratings, the USDA said.  Corn for July delivery climbed 0.9 percent to $5.885 a
bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
