SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge
fund run by  Steven Cohen , increased its stake in  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  as the U.S. government sold shares of
the bailed-out insurer.  SAC Capital added 4.4 million shares of New York-based AIG,
giving it 4.5 million as of March 31, according to a regulatory
filing today from the Stamford, Connecticut-based fund. D.E.
Shaw & Co., the New York-based hedge fund that uses computer
models to pick trades, increased its stake by 2.2 million shares
to 5.5 million, its filing shows.  AIG’s shares  increased  33 percent in the first quarter as
the insurer repaid part of its U.S. government rescue and bought
back stock. The insurer has sold assets including a stake in
Hong Kong-based insurer  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  to raise funds to cut the
Treasury’s stake, which stands at about 60 percent.  “There are some people that think that will continue to go
very smoothly and the overhang of the government share sales
will go away more quickly than perhaps we thought,” Paul Newsome, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a
a telephone interview.  Hotchkis & Wiley Capital Management LLC, a Los Angeles-
based  money manager , added 8.6 million AIG shares last quarter,
boosting its stake to 14.3 million, while Tradewinds Global
Investors LLC, a unit of Chicago-based Nuveen Investments Inc.,
sold 13.6 million shares, or about two-thirds of its holdings,
filings show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
