Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for a
20th day, the longest winning streak since July 2006, on
speculation lenders have more cash to invest in government debt.
The dong was steady.  The total amount of outstanding commercial loans dropped
1.71 percent as of April 16 from the end of 2011, Cafe F, an
online news service, reported last week, citing the National
Financial Supervisory Commission. Vietnam’s monetary authority
announced in February that it was limiting business lending.  “Small- and mid-sized banks have rushed to buy bonds as
they sold most of their debt portfolios last year when they
faced liquidity issues,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co. “Now that
liquidity has improved and lending is sluggish, they are
interested in purchasing.”  The  yield  on the five-year bonds fell seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 9.49 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest
level in 34 months.  The dong was steady at 20,850 per dollar as of 4:21 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
set the currency’s reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
