United-Guardian Inc. (UG) , a maker of
cosmetic ingredients and health-care products, rose to a record
in  New York  trading as volume surged to the highest since 2007.  United-Guardian, based in Hauppauge, New York, rallied 14
percent to $21.21 at 1:40 p.m. New York time, with 114,449
shares changing hands, 49 times its three-month average. The
stock reached $22.55 earlier, the highest intraday price since
at least 1983, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Based on some large blocks, it appears to be
institutional investors that are buying rather aggressively,”
United-Guardian Chief Financial Officer Robert S. Rubinger said
in a telephone interview. “There has been no new news out of
the company. Nothing has been leaked. There is nothing pending,
nothing unusual of late that would cause something like this.”  United-Guardian, founded in 1942, said on May 9 that first-
quarter earnings increased to 27 cents a share from 25 cents a
year earlier as sales climbed. Today’s surge pushed the stock’s
gain to 39 percent this year. That compared with a 5.7 percent
increase in the Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark gauge for
smaller U.S. companies.  Twenty-four  institutional investors  owned a combined 15
percent stake in United-Guardian as of yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
