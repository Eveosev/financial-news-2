Champlin/GEI Wind Holdings LLC, a
North American wind-energy developer backed by Good Energies
Inc., plans to sell wind-farm projects planned for Hawaii,  Utah ,
 California  and elsewhere to  Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND)  for $20
million.  The companies have executed a term sheet for the projects,
which are not yet under construction and which may someday total
4 gigawatts of generating capacity, Western Wind said today in a
statement.  Western Wind, based in Vancouver, said it will pay 8
million common shares of stock worth $2.50 a share.  Champlin/GEI was created in November 2010 after Good
Energies agreed to provide as much as $50 million to co-owner
 Champlin Windpower LLC , a closely held company formed in 2006 to
develop U.S. projects.  Champlin has asked regulators for permission to build a
990-megawatt project near Pioche, Nevada.  The acquisition needs to be approved by each company’s
board of directors, the Toronto Stock Exchange and applicable
securities regulatory agencies, according to the statement.  Casey Willis, senior project manager for Champlin/GEI,
which is based in Santa Barbara, California, didn’t immediately
return a phone message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
