Greece  is to repay 435 million euros
($556 million) of bonds falling due today as the nation faces
new elections after leaders failed to form a government.  Greece will pay the principal and interest on foreign law
notes which weren’t tendered into the country’s debt
restructuring, the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  said in an e-
mailed statement. The repayment won’t prejudice future decisions
on other untendered bonds, the ministry said.  Greece swapped about 200 billion euros of its sovereign
debt in March and April in the world’s biggest debt
restructuring, forcing holders of notes issued under domestic
law to accept a 53.5 percent loss on the face value of the
bonds. The May 15 redemption is the first out of about 6.4
billion euros of notes issued under foreign law that investors
refused to tender into the swap.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  called elections after
completing the restructuring and securing a 130 billion-euro
Greek bailout from the European Union and  International Monetary
Fund , the country’s second. The May 6 poll yielded no clear
winner and the country will hold repeat elections after
President Karolos Papoulias failed in a last-ditch attempt to
broker an agreement on a new government today.  Greece achieved a 96.9 percent participation rate on 206
billion euros of eligible debt in the bond exchange after the
government legislated to insert so-called collective action
clauses into notes governed by Greek law retroactively, allowing
a qualified majority of investors to agree on a loss that
holdouts would also be legally obliged to accept.  To contact the reporter on this story:
