Germany  and the European Financial
Stability Facility has demanded that the  European Central Bank 
pay back a 35 billion-euro ($45 billion) guarantee to the EFSF,
 Financial Times Deutschland  said in a preview of a story that
will run tomorrow, without saying where it got the information.  The ECB received the guarantee from the EFSF to cover risks
during the Greek government debt swap in March and wants to keep
it for as long as 10 months because of outstanding so-called
selective default bonds, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
