Sound Global Ltd. (SGL) , a Beijing-based
water and wastewater treatment company, hired Deutsche Bank AG
and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  to arrange a series of credit investor
meetings, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company met bond investors in Singapore last week and
in Hong Kong yesterday, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private.  Sound Global Chief Financial Officer Gerald Yu declined to
comment when contacted by telephone in Hong Kong today.  The company, which is listed in Hong Kong and Singapore,
has a yuan-denominated 6 percent convertible bond due 2015,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has the equivalent
of $774 million of  bonds and loans  that mature before 2020, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
