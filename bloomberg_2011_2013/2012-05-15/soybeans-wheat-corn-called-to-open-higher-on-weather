What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 16 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warmer, drier
weather than normal this month will deplete U.S. soil moisture
and hurt crop yields, Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness
for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open $7 to $8 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after a government report yesterday showed a drop
in U.S. crop conditions, while dry weather threatens crops in
parts of  Russia  and the Ukraine, Grow said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago after last weekâ€™s drop to the lowest in seven
months spurs increased demand for the grain, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
