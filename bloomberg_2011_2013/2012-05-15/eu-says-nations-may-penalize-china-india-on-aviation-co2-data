European Union nations may decide to
penalize 10 Chinese and Indian airlines should they miss a
“mid-June” deadline to report emissions data they failed to
submit by March 31, said Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard.  National regulators have already been in contact with
officials at the two nations “to remind them of their
obligations” under the EU carbon market, including publication
of emissions-output data for 2011, Hedegaard said today at a
briefing for journalists in Brussels. “They have been given
until mid-June this year to report back their data.”  Airlines flying to and from EU airports were this year
included in the EU carbon cap-and-trade market, the world’s
biggest by traded volume. Every non-EU airline must register
with one member state for administrative purposes.  “It’s up to member states to apply penalties,” Hedegaard
said. “That would be the next step,” should the  China  and
India airlines miss the new deadline.  The EU was examining whether China was putting in place
rules that could be deemed “equivalent measures” to the bloc’s
carbon market, Hedegaard said. The European Commission has said
that flights from and to nations with equivalent measures may
not need to comply with the bloc’s emissions-trading rules for
airlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
