One of  Libya ’s most powerful military
figures said he has resigned his post as head of the Tripoli
Military Council to run for public office,  Al Jazeera  reported.  Abdel Hakim Belhaj, who was an inmate at the U.S.-run
Guantanamo Bay prison for terror suspects, told the Arab
satellite channel late yesterday that his decision reflected the
country’s political transition and efforts to build national
institutions following last year’s uprising that led to Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
