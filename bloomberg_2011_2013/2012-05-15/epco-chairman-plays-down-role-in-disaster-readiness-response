The chairman of the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi atomic station’s operator deferred responsibility for its
readiness and response to last year’s nuclear crisis, saying
such measures were up to the company’s president.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s president was responsible for
implementing safety plans and bringing the plant under control
after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami last year caused the
meltdown of three nuclear cores, Tsunehisa Katsumata said
yesterday. Katsumata will be replaced as chairman in June
following the government’s announcement it would nationalize the
utility.  Katsumata spoke before a government-appointed commission
investigating the disaster that forced about 160,000 people to
evacuate from towns around the plant. At an earlier meeting of
the panel in February, Nuclear Safety Commission Chairman Haruki
Madarame played down his own agency’s responsibility for the
crisis, saying utilities and bureaucrats were to blame for lax
enforcement of the country’s atomic safety rules.  “In our company, the president has final responsibility
for implementation,” Katsumata said in response to questions
about his role in the company’s initial response to the mounting
crisis. “I was there as well, but I was looking at the
surrounding situation and providing advice as much as
possible.”  Tokyo Electric’s president at the time of the crisis was
 Masataka Shimizu , who resigned in May last year. He was replaced
by Toshio Nishizawa who will also be forced out under the
government’s plan to remove executives in charge at the time of
the disaster and bring in more outside directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
