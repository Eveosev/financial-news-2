Global soybean production may climb
16 percent in the next year as South American crops recover from
drought and farmers in the U.S. boost planting, Oil World said.  World output may total 274.3 million metric tons in the
2012-13 crop year, up from 237.5 million a year earlier, the
Hamburg-based researcher said today in a report. The harvest in
 Brazil  may increase 19 percent to 78 million tons.  Argentina ’s
crop may total a record 55 million tons, after plunging to 41
million in the 2011-2012 crop year, Oil World said.  “The second half of the season will bring more ample
supplies, if South American soybean production rebounds strongly
in line with our forecast,” Oil World said. “This requires a
sharp expansion of plantings and favorable weather conditions.”  The U.S. harvest, the world’s biggest, may rise 6.6 percent
from a year earlier to 88.7 million tons, Oil World said.
Farmers may plant 75.8 million acres, 1.9 million more than the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture   estimated  in March, according to
the report.  Soybean prices reached $15.125 a bushel on May 2 on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest since July 2008, as drought
slashed crops in  South America  and spurred importers including
 China  to purchase more supplies from the U.S. The price tumbled
4.9 percent last week, and touched a six-week low yesterday.  Limited Supplies  Recent declines may have been “premature” because global
soybean supplies are likely to remain limited until March 2013,
when South American farmers begin harvesting the next crop, Oil
World said. Record corn planting in the U.S., the world’s
biggest grower and exporter of the grain, may mean corn prices
will weaken relative to soybeans, Oil World said.  “It will be a long way to go until world supplies of
soybeans are again replenished sufficiently,” the researcher
said. “Contrary to corn, the global supply outlook for the
major oilseeds is currently still critical for 2012-13.”  Global rapeseed production in the 2012-13 crop year may
total 61.2 million tons, up from 59.5 million a year earlier,
as larger harvests in  Canada  and  Australia  more than make up for
declines in the European Union and in Ukraine, where output may
slide to four-year lows, Oil World said.  Production of four major oilseeds will rise to 418.3
million tons in the next crop year, up 34.7 million from a year
earlier, the researcher said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
