Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , Latin America’s
third-largest beef producer, will resume production in the
second quarter at three of nine plants, where output had been
suspended, after beef demand climbed, said the company’s
investor relations director, Ricardo Florence.  Increased demand for food products in the domestic market
helped the company post a first-quarter profit of 34.5 million
reais ($17.3 million), Florence said today in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo . Marfrig late yesterday posted profit
that rose 47 percent and beat analysts’ estimates.  Florence said that the company may sell more assets after
deals to sell logistics units to  JSL SA (JSLG3)  and distribution units
in the U.S.,  Europe  and Asia to Martin-Brower Co. The sale of
the distribution center for McDonald’s Corp. concluded in
February.  “When there is something that justifies it, we will send a
market statement,” he said, declining to identify any possible
deal.  The company benefits from the current dollar level, said
Florence.  “Our  cash flow  in dollars is evened out, but this currency
level helps making out exports more competitive,” he said.  Brazil’s real traded at 2.0054 per dollar on 4:20 p.m., as
the currency slid 6.79 percent in 2012.  He also said that the mad cow disease case in the U.S. may
potentially help the company’s exports.  “New markets may open up to us,” Florence said.  BRF - Brasil Foods SA and JBS SA are Latin America’s
largest meat producers by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
