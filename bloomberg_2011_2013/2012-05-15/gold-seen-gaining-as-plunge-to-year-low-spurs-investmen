Gold fell to a 19-week low as the
dollar rose after Greek Pasok party leader  Evangelos Venizelos 
said new elections will be held after attempts to form a
government failed, curbing demand for the precious metal.  A second Greek election threatens to extend the political
gridlock that has left the country without a government since
the vote on May 6. Bullion erased its gains for this year
yesterday as concern that Europe’s debt crisis is deepening
boosted the dollar. Before today, the greenback gained 2.3
percent this month against a basket of six currencies, while
gold retreated 6.2 percent.  “People want to move to cash because of the Greek
political impasse,” Sterling Smith, a market analyst at  Country
Hedging  in  St. Paul , Minnesota, said in a telephone interview.
“The dollar’s strength continues to hurt gold.”  Gold futures for June delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
