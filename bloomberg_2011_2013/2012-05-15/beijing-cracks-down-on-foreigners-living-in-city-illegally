Beijing police will ask people to
report illegal aliens as authorities start a crackdown on
foreigners living and working without authorization in the city.  The campaign, which runs from today to the end of August,
will see police tighten reviews of visa applications, comb areas
with large numbers of foreigners and “mobilize the public to
report them,” the Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.  Police will check passports and housing registrations in
areas where foreigners gather,  China Daily  reported today,
citing Lin Song, the police officer in charge of the campaign.
Beijing has set up a hot line for people to report on people who
don’t have proper documents,  China Central Television  reported
today.  China ’s vice minister of public security, Yang Huanning
said in April that China will strengthen management of
foreigners who live or work illegally in China.  Today’s campaign also comes after a British man was
detained after allegedly trying to sexually assault a woman in
Beijing on May 8, Xinhua reported. Video posted online showed
the man standing over the woman and then being beaten up as he
lay in a road.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
