Winds from Tropical Storm Aletta, the
season’s first named storm, reached 40 mph (65 kilometers per
hour) about 640 miles south-southwest of  Mexico ’s Pacific resort
of Manzanillo, the National Hurricane Center said.  The system was moving west-northwest at 9 mph and may
strengthen some over the next day though it poses no threat to
land, the NHC said today in a 2 a.m. Pacific time advisory. The
system is expected to weaken gradually after that and dissipate.  The eastern Pacific hurricane season officially started
today while the Atlantic storm period begins June 1. Both
seasons end on Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
