Aletta, the first tropical storm of
the eastern Pacific season, weakened today to 40 mph winds (65
kilometers per hour) about 785 miles south of the tip of
 Mexico â€™s  Baja California , the National Hurricane Center said.  Aletta was moving west at about 9 mph, with further
weakening expected over the next two days as the storm heads out
to sea, the Miami-based center said in an advisory at 11 a.m.
Pacific time.  Disturbed weather a few hundred miles off the Mexico-
Guatemala Pacific coast has a 20 percent chance of developing
into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the NHC also
said. The eastern Pacific hurricane season officially began
yesterday, while the Atlantic season starts June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
