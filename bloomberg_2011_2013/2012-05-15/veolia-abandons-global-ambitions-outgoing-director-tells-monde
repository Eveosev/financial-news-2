Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  is mistakenly
abandoning its global ambitions by selling U.S. and U.K. assets
to cut debt, Jean-Francois Dehecq, to be replaced as a director
of the world’s biggest water company tomorrow, told Le Monde.  The planned sale of the company’s stake in Veolia Transdev
is also an error that may hurt relations with municipalities on
which the utility depends for waste and water contracts, Dehecq
said in an interview with the newspaper. Dehecq is scheduled to
be replaced at an annual  shareholders’ meeting . Marie-Claire Camus, a spokeswoman for Veolia, declined to comment.  The company’s strategy is now based on financial ratios,
“short-term accounting” and “wretched” asset sales to boost
the share price, Dehecq was quoted as saying in Le Monde.  Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot plans to sell assets
and cut costs, departing from the growth under predecessor  Henri Proglio , still a director, who expanded Veolia to 77 countries.  The utility posted a 12 percent slump in first-quarter
earnings on May 4 after a “difficult” economy hurt waste
operations and profit from domestic water contracts dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
