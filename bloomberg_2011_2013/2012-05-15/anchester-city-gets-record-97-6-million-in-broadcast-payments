Premier League soccer champion
 Manchester City  got a record 60.6 million pounds ($97.6 million)
in broadcast payments for the 2011-12 season.  City’s total payment was the highest received by any winner
in the competition’s 20 editions, the Premier League said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The 20 clubs in  England ’s elite division equally split 50
percent of U.K. broadcast revenue, with 25 percent paid in merit
payments depending on a team’s finishing position and the final
25 percent paid in facility fees, which are paid each time a
club’s matches are televised in the U.K., the league said.  Clubs also got 18.7 million pounds each from overseas
broadcasting payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
