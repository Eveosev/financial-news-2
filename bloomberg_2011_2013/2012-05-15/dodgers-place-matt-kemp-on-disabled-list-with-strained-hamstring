The Los Angeles Dodgers placed All-
Star outfielder  Matt Kemp  on the 15-day disabled list with a
strained left hamstring, the team said in a  statement .  Before sitting out last nightâ€™s 3-1 win over the Arizona
Diamondbacks, Kemp had played in 399 consecutive games, the
longest active streak in Major League Baseball. He had last
missed a game on Aug. 18, 2009.  Kemp, 27, is hitting .359 with a team-leading 12 home runs
and 28 runs batted in this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
