Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , an
assembler of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and iPhone, declined to the
lowest level in almost four months in Taipei trading after
first-quarter profit margins declined.  The electronics maker fell 1.7 percent to NT$85.40, the
lowest close since Jan. 16 on volume about 34 percent higher
than the average for the past three months. The benchmark  Taiex
index (TWSE)  added 0.3 percent.  Consolidated  gross margin , a key measure of profitability
that tracks the ratio of sales less manufacturing costs, dropped
to 6.64 percent in the first quarter, from 8.89 percent in the
prior period, and missed the 7.76 percent average of nine
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Hon Hai on April 28
reported unconsolidated earnings with net income that  missed 
analyst estimates by 31 percent.  Operating margin, which measures the ratio of sales less
operating costs, narrowed to 1.52 percent on a consolidated
level, from 3.29 percent in the preceding quarter, the Taipei-
based company reported yesterday.  Both metrics are the lowest since Hon Hai started posting
consolidated quarterly data in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
