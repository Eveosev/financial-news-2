Oil dropped to the lowest price in
more than six months in New York after U.S. crude stockpiles
increased and talks to form a coalition government in Greece
collapsed, raising concern the region’s debt crisis will worsen.  West Texas Intermediate futures slid as much as 2 percent,
declining for a fourth day. U.S. inventories rose  6.6 million
barrels  last week, data from the  American Petroleum Institute 
indicated. A government report today is projected to show a gain
of 1.8 million, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Greece
will schedule new elections as early as June 10, which German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said will be a referendum on
whether the country stays in the euro.  “Demand destruction is back on the agenda,” said  Jonathan Barratt , chief executive of Barratt’s Bulletin, a commodity-
markets newsletter in Sydney. “The market is going to remain
weak over the next month or so until we get some clarity of
what’s happening in the world. The Greek turmoil is a problem.”  Crude for June delivery decreased as much as $1.85 to
$92.13 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest intraday price since Nov. 3. It was at
$92.21 at 2:33 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract fell
0.8 percent to $93.98. Prices are 6.7 percent lower this year.  Brent oil for June settlement, which expires today, slipped
1.2 percent to $110.85 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The more-actively traded July future retreated
1.3 percent to $110.05. The front-month price for the European
benchmark contract was at a  premium  to WTI of $18.61, after
closing at $18.26 yesterday, the widest gap since April 13.  Cushing Record  Oil in New York has long-term technical support at $89.83 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly
chart, that’s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall
to $32.40 in December 2008 from a record high of $147.27 in July
that year. Buy orders tend to be clustered near chart-support
levels. Futures last traded at that price in November 2011.  Crude inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for contracts traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , rose
2.8 million barrels last week to a record 46.9 million barrels,
according to the industry-funded API.  The reversal of the Seaway pipeline tomorrow to move crude
away from the storage hub at Cushing for the first time may do
little to ease the glut that has kept WTI below Brent for an
unprecedented 21 months, according to Citigroup Inc. and
Barclays Plc.  Fuel Supplies  The line’s capacity of 150,000 barrels a day won’t make
much difference to stockpiles amid “really heavy” refinery
maintenance, said Amrita Sen, a London-based analyst at
Barclays. Supplies will rise as production surges,  Ed Morse ,
global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York,
said in an April 16 note.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles dropped 2.6 million barrels last
week, the API said. They are forecast to fall  100,000 barrels  in
today’s Energy Department report, according to the median
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Distillate
inventories, a category that includes diesel and heating oil,
slid 1.6 million barrels compared with a projected 150,000
barrel gain.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Greek Crisis  Post-election attempts to form a government in  Greece  broke
down yesterday after nine days as President Karolos Papoulias
failed to broker a coalition in meetings with party leaders in
 Athens . New elections may be held next month. Four surveys have
given the lead to the anti-bailout Syriza party that says it
would tear up the conditions attached to 240 billion euros ($306
billion) of aid.  The euro weakened to an almost four-month low, making
dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of the
European single currency.  New York crude has dropped 17 percent since March 1, when
concern that Western sanctions against Iran would disrupt Middle
East supplies helped drive prices to $110.55 a barrel, the high
for the year. Brent has fallen 14 percent since reaching $128.40
the same day.  Iran  and  International Atomic Energy Agency  inspectors
extended a round of negotiations over the Persian Gulf nation’s
nuclear program after two days of talks ended in Vienna
yesterday with both sides saying progress had been made. IAEA
inspectors will meet again with their Iranian counterparts on
May 21 in the Austrian capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
