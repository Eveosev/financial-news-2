Christophe Coutte, head of credit and
emerging markets at  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ’s corporate- and
investment-banking unit, is leaving, a person with knowledge of
the matter said.  Coutte, based in London, is leaving the investment bank,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
the matter is confidential. Dow Jones newswires reported
Coutte’s departure earlier today, citing unidentified sources.  Antoine Lheritier, a Paris-based spokesman at  Societe
Generale , declined to comment when reached by phone. Coutte
didn’t immediately return a call to his London work phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
