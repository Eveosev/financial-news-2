Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)  dropped after
cutting the forecast it made a week ago for sales of steelmaking
coal mined in Appalachia because of a potential default by a
customer.  Patriot issued its forecast outside of regular trading
hours on U.S. markets. Patriot fell 3.1 percent to $4.68 at 8:38
a.m. in New York.  The company sees sales in the second quarter through the
fourth quarter of 3.9 million tons at an average price of $142 a
ton, St. Louis-based Patriot said in a statement after the close
of regular trading yesterday. That compares with a May 8
projection of 4.9 million tons at $138 a ton.  Patriot also revised its 2013 forecast for Appalachian
metallurgical coal to 200,000 tons at $122 ton from 400,000 tons
at $120 previously.  Patriot also produces thermal coal, which is used to
generate electricity. The companyâ€™s shares fell 43 percent this
year through yesterday amid a decline in U.S. coal shipments to
power stations as some utilities switch to natural gas, which
fell to a 10-year low last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
