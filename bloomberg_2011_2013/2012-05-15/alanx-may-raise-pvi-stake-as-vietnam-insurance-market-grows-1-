PVI Holdings (PVI) ,  Vietnam ’s second-
largest publicly traded insurer, plans to sell another 6 percent
stake to  Germany ’s Talanx AG by the end of this month, Chairman
Nguyen Anh Tuan said.  Talanx subsidiary HDI-Gerling Industrie Versicherung AG
will hold the stake, Tuan said in a telephone interview from
Hanoi today. He declined to disclose the price.  “Apart from Talanx, many other foreign investors are also
interested in buying a stake of PVI, however, because of the
room limited at 49 percent for foreigners, we will sell the
stake to the existing strategic partner,” Tuan said.  Talanx bought 25 percent of Hanoi-based PVI in August for
1.9 trillion dong ($91 million) to seek a foothold in the
Southeast Asian nation’s growing non-life insurance market.
 Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG)  last month bought 30 percent of
AAA Assurance Corp.  “Vietnam’s insurance market has great potential to develop
with growth pace two to three times higher than GDP,” said
Nguyen Thu Ha, an analyst who covers the insurance market at  Bao
Viet Securities Co. (BVS)  in Hanoi.  Non-life insurance revenue in Vietnam may increase 20
percent to about 24.2 trillion dong in 2012, according to a
report on the Association of Vietnamese Insurers’ website.  Vietnam’s gross domestic product rose 4 percent in the
first quarter, the lowest rate of expansion since 2009.  Hannover, Germany-based Talanx, the nation’s third-biggest
insurer, is restructuring its German retail business as it
prepares for an initial public offering.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
