The European Union’s project-
financing bank sought extra capital as the least expensive way
for cash-strapped governments to advance the growth agenda
pushed by new French President  Francois Hollande .  Werner Hoyer, head of the  European Investment Bank , said a
refusal by governments to provide the extra funds would force
the bank to scale back lending as the economy skirts recession.  “With the EIB’s current level of capitalization, we have
no choice but to gradually reduce lending volumes to protect the
financial strength of the bank,” Hoyer told EU finance
ministers in Brussels today, according to an e-mailed statement.
“A strengthening of our balance sheet is necessary if we want
to substantially step up our activities across the entire EU.”  An EIB boost has the backing of  France ’s Hollande, who made
the growth plea in his inaugural speech today before flying to
Berlin to meet German Chancellor  Angela Merkel . A proposal to
put an additional 10 billion euros ($13 billion) into the EU-
owned bank could unleash 60 billion euros in loans to co-finance
projects worth as much as 180 billion euros, according to the
 European Commission .  The Luxembourg-based bank signed loan agreements worth 61
billion euros in 2011. Finance ministers made no decision on the
capital increase today. It is on the agenda for a June 28-29
summit and would require approval of all 27 EU leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
