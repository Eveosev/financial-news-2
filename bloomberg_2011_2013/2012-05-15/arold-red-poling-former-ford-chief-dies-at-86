Harold A. “Red” Poling, former  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  chairman and chief executive officer who helped lead
the automaker through two recessions, has died. He was 86.  He died May 12 in Pacific Grove,  California , the Dearborn,
Michigan-based company, said yesterday in an e-mail. The cause
of death wasn’t known.  As chairman and CEO from 1990 to 1994, Poling led the
 company  through a deep recession, when Ford’s sales in North
America and  Europe  plunged and losses totaled $9.64 billion in
1991 and 1992. By the time he retired, Ford controlled 25.3
percent of the U.S. auto market, up from 21 percent in 1983. It
had net income of $2.53 billion in 1993, his final full year.  As leader of Ford’s North American auto operations during
an earlier financial crisis, Poling cut $2.5 billion in fixed
costs in 1980-1981 through plant closings and the elimination of
middle management jobs, AutoWeek reported.  “Those days are indelibly seared in my mind,” Poling told
the New York Times in 1990, when he became CEO. “I run scared
because I don’t ever want that to happen again.”  During those fraught years he also approved spending $3
billion to engineer an aerodynamic sedan named Taurus that
became the top-selling car in the U.S.  ‘Tremendous Gamble’  “We bet the company,” Poling said in a 1993 corporate
biography. “It was a tremendous gamble, but it has paid off
handsomely.” The automaker introduced the Taurus in 1985 as a
1986 model.  Automotive Industries magazine named Poling Man of the Year
for 1988.  “Red Poling was an extraordinary leader who had a profound
impact on Ford,”  Bill Ford , the automaker’s executive chairman
and great-grandson of its founder, said in a statement. “With a
list of accomplishments that span 43 years, including leading
the company through a remarkable turnaround during the 1980s and
1990s, Red was respected by all for his leadership, his passion
for being the low-cost producer and his genuine affinity for
people.”  Harold Arthur Poling was born on Oct. 14, 1925, in Troy,
 Michigan , and grew up in Fairfax,  Virginia , according to Ford.
Poling enlisted in the U.S. Navy at 17, two weeks after
graduating from Fairfax High School. After more than two years
in Naval aviation, he enrolled in  Monmouth College  in Monmouth,
 Illinois , where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1949. He
received a master’s in business administration in 1951 from
 Indiana University .  European Tour  In 1950, Poling worked at Ford on a summer internship. He
started full-time at Ford in 1951 as a cost analyst in the
office of the Steel Division’s controller, rising to assistant
controller of the Transmission and Chassis Division in 1964 and,
in 1968, controller of the Product Development Group. He was
promoted to vice president of finance for Ford’s European unit
in 1972.  Based in the U.K., he rose to president of  Ford of Europe 
in 1975 and to chairman about two years later.  He returned to the U.S. in 1979 to become executive vice
president and was elected a director. He took the helm of North
American auto operations in 1980, when car sales were running
below capacity, forcing the painful cuts in personnel and
plants.  He became president and chief operating officer in 1985,
vice chairman in 1987. In March 1990, he succeeded Donald E. Petersen as chairman.  Serious Golfer  Describing his strengths, he told the  Chicago Tribune :
“I’ve had the opportunity to run the two major auto operations
at Ford -- European and  North America . I believe that’s unique.
I’m consistent, dependable and predictable, three of the most
important characteristics top management can have, so that you
don’t have an organization trying to outguess you and waste
time. They know what to expect from me.”  Poling was an avid golfer, with an 8 handicap, who was
named “one of America’s top company executive golfers” by
Fortune magazine. He was a serious golfer who liked to say he
didn’t play “customer golf,” according to Ford.  With his wife, the former Marian Lee, Poling had two
children, Kathryn and Douglas. He had a third child from a
previous marriage, Pam Cruden, according to Ford.  Douglas Poling was one of the former American International
Group executives whose bonus payments in 2009, a year after the
company was bailed out by the U.S., drew protests, according to
the  New York  Times. The company said he returned his bonus,
which was the largest at $6.4 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
