Billionaire Edward Lampert took
advantage of surging stock prices during the first quarter to
cut stakes that his hedge fund holds in  Capital One Financial
Corp. (COF) ,  CIT Group Inc. (CIT)  and  Seagate Technology Plc. (STX)   RBS Partners LP held 661,495 CIT Group shares as of March
31, according to a Form 13 filed today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, down from 5.13 million shares at the
end of last year. The New York-based commercial lender’s shares
rose more than 18 percent during the first quarter.  Lampert’s hedge fund cut its Seagate stake to 1.02 million
shares at March 31 from 6.98 million shares at year end,
according to filing, while the money manager’s holdings in
Capital One fell to 4.48 million shares from 5.09 million.
Seagate soared more than 64 percent during the first quarter,
while Capital One rose almost 32 percent.  The firm also reduced its stake in  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  to 545,772
shares from 1.65 million during the first quarter.  RBS Partners, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, is a
management entity for Lampert’s primary hedge fund, ESL Partners
LP. RBS disclosed that the total value of its U.S. traded
equities was $6.48 billion at March 31 compared with $5.72
billion at Dec. 31.  Lampert disclosed that his controlling stake in  Sears
Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  declined to 43 million shares as of March 31 from
48 million shares as of Dec. 31. The decline may stem from
changes in Lampert’s management contracts with clients rather
than outright sales, which he would have had to disclose during
the quarter in insider reports.  Lampert is also the chairman of  Hoffman Estates , Illinois-
based Sears, which he acquired through an $11.9 billion merger
with Kmart Holding Corp. in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
