Saks Inc. (SKS) , the New York-based luxury
retail chain, reported first-quarter earnings growth that slowed
amid increased spending on marketing and other initiatives.  Net income in the quarter ended April 28 rose 13 percent to
$32.1 million, or 18 cents a share, from $28.4 million, or 16
cents, a year earlier, Saks said today in a statement. Profit
rose 51 percent in the same period a year earlier.  Saks spent more integrating its store and online
inventories into a so-called omni-channel, boosted advertising
and marketing and increased employee benefits. Selling, general
and administrative expenses climbed to 25.2 percent of sales
from 24.6 percent a year earlier.  Liz Dunn , an analyst with
Macquarie Group in  New York , who recommends investors hold the
shares, estimated 24.8 percent.  Saks was unchanged at $10.05 at the close in New York. The
shares have gained 3.1 percent this year.  Revenue advanced 3.8 percent to $753.6 million, Saks said.
Analysts projected $759.4 million, the average of 10 estimates.
Sales at stores open at least a year climbed 4.8 percent, the
company said.  Excluding some items, profit totaled 19 cents. Analysts
projected 18 cents, the average of 13  estimates  compiled by
