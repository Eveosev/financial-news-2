Iran Khodro Co. , the countryâ€™s
largest carmaker, said it plans to manufacture 30,000 cars,
mostly the  Samand  sedan, at a production site in neighboring
 Iraq  this year.  The company is delivering components to its Iraq plant for
assembly, Iran Khodro said in an e-mailed statement today.
Operations at the Iraq plant, which has received investment from
a local partner, started in 2011, the company said, without
