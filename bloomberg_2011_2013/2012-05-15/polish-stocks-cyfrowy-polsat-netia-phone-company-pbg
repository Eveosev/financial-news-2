Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  declined 1.2
percent to 2,111.15 at the close in Warsaw.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS)  , the nation’s biggest television
network, advanced 2.4 percent to 13.58 zloty, surging the most
in a week after reporting higher-than-predicted profit in the
first quarter.  Netia SA (NET)  , the country’s second-largest fixed-line
