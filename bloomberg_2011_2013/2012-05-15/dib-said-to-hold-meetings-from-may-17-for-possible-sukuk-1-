Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the United
Arab Emirates biggest bank complying with Islamic banking rules,
will meet investors from May 17 for a possible benchmark-sized
dollar sukuk sale, three people familiar with the details said.  The meetings will take place in Asia, the  Middle East  and
Europe, they said, declining to be identified because the
details are private.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  National Bank of Abu
Dhabi PJSC ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Dubai
Islamic will help arrange the meetings, they said.  Fitch Ratings assigned Dubai Islamic’s $2.5 billion trust
certificate issuance program a provisional A rating, its sixth-
highest investment grade, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. Moody’s Investors Service gave it a provisional Baa1
rating, three levels above junk.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) , the Saudi bank part-owned by  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA) , raised $750 million from the sale of five year
Islamic bonds today, priced at 185 basis points over the
benchmark midswap rate, four people familiar with the matter
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
