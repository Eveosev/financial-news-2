Egypt  sold $1.013 billion of dollar-
denominated treasury bills today, exceeding its $750 million
target as demand drove the yield to a record low. The nation’s
2020 dollar bond declined for a third day.  The average yield on the one-year notes fell to 3.706
percent from 3.844 percent at the last sale of similar-maturity
notes in February, according to an e-mailed statement from the
central bank. The North African country received bids for the
securities that surpassed the amount offered by 2.5 times, it
said. Egypt has raised $5.293 billion from five sales of 12-
month dollar bills since November.  The Ministry of Finance, on whose behalf the central bank
holds government security auctions, accepted more bids than it
had planned “due to increased appetite by local financial
institutions,” according to the regulator’s statement.  The country expects to sign a $3.2 billion loan agreement
with the IMF around the beginning of June, state-run Al-Ahram
reported today, citing Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed. The
first part of the loan could be disbursed around July 1, it
said. El-Saieed said in April the signing would take place that
month after the government obtained parliament’s approval.  One-year local-currency bills  yielded an average 15.85
percent at their last sale on May 10. Rising yields on pound-
denominated debt have forced the country to fall 25 percent
short of meeting its 36.5 billion-pound ($6 billion) fundraising
goal at sales of treasury bills and bonds this month.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due 2020 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.95 percent at
1:52 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the highest level on a closing basis in more than a
month. The Egyptian pound weakened 0.1 percent to 6.037 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
