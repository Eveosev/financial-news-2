The pound’s decline versus the dollar
may force futures traders that are the most bullish in a year on
sterling to lower their bets, fueling further depreciation of
the U.K. currency, according to Bank of America Corp.  Futures traders increased their wagers that sterling will
gain against the  U.S. dollar  to 25,339  contracts  in the week
ended May 8, the most since May 2011, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. They
now may “be forced to reduce,” driving the pound down toward
its 200-day moving average of $1.5831,  MacNeil Curry , a
technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in
a client note.  “This is a market that in certain respects has defied
gravity,” Curry said yesterday in a telephone interview. “As
we’ve seen risk-off transpire, this thing has rallied quite
significantly; people have gotten longer and longer. That just
makes it vulnerable.” Long positions are bets a currency will
strengthen.  The pound fell 0.6 percent yesterday to $1.5993 in  New York 
trading and touched $1.5989, the lowest level since April 18. It
has lost 1.5 percent since April 30, when it touched an eight-
month high of $1.6302.  The U.K. currency has support at $1.6004 and $1.5973, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch said. Support is an area on a chart
