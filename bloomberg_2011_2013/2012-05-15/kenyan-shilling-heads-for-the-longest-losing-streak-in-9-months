Kenya ’s shilling slumped for the
sixth day, poised for its longest losing streak in nine months.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 1.1 percent and traded down 0.7 percent at 84.25 by
2:32 p.m in Nairobi. A close at that level would be the biggest
six-day loss since August.  Tanzania’s shilling gained for the first day in three,
increasing 0.2 percent to 1,579 per dollar, while the Ugandan
shilling retreated 0.8 percent to 2,485 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
