Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ,  Japan ’s most
export-reliant carmaker, led shares of the nation’s automakers
lower as mounting concerns about the  European debt crisis  drove
the yen to the highest in almost three months against the euro.  Mazda declined as much as 9.1 percent to 100 yen, the
lowest intraday level based on data compiled by Bloomberg
stretching back to 1974. It traded at 103 yen at 10:56 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. All of the nation’s eight biggest
carmakers fell, including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)   “Mazda has a large exposure to the euro and may move
easily by the currency’s fluctuation,” said Satoshi Yuzaki, a
general manager at  Takagi Securities Co. (8625)  in  Tokyo .  The euro weakened as Moody’s Investors Service cut its debt
ratings on 26 Italian banks ahead of an economic report that may
show  Europe ’s economy shrank for the first time since 2009.
 Greece , without a government for more than a week, must decide
today whether to pay 436 million euros ($559 million) to
bondholders who shunned last month’s debt swap.  Mazda produces more than 70 percent of its vehicles in
Japan, out of which almost 80 percent are exported. That makes
it the most vulnerable major Japanese carmaker to an
appreciating yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
