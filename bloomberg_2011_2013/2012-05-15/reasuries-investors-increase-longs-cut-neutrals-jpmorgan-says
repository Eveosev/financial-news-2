U.S. Treasuries investors raised bets
to the highest level in more than two months that the price of
the securities will advance, according to a weekly survey by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The percent of “net longs” rose the most since March 5 to
11 percentage points in the week ending yesterday from zero the
previous week. The number of outright longs rose by 9 percentage
points to 26 percent, the most since Feb. 27. The percent of
shorts decreased to 15 percent, from 17 percent. A long position
is a bet that an asset will increase in value, while a short is
a wager it will decrease.  “It’s a reflection of the broader  market sentiment  toward
risk,” Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in  New York , said
by telephone. “There are concerns around  Europe , around the
odds of  Greece  potentially exiting the European monetary Union.
That’s helping to support a flight to quality into Treasuries.”  The percent of “neutrals” decreased to 59 percent from 66
percent in the same period. In the previous week, the survey was
“net neutral” for the first time since April 2.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
