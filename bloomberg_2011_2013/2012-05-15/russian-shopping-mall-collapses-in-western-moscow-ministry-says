A shopping mall partially collapsed
in west Moscow, with a 150-square-meter (1,615 square feet) area
of walls and roofing caving in today, the Emergency Ministry
said.  Seven people were rescued from the Michurinsky center, and
thereâ€™s no information yet about any injuries or fatalities,
said a spokesman for the Moscow-based ministry, declining to be
identified in line with government policy. Some people may be
trapped under the debris, Interfax reported, citing an
unidentified law-enforcement official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
