Australia ’s dollar reached the lowest
level this year against its U.S. counterpart after talks to form
a Greek government failed, fueling concern the nation may leave
the shared currency and damping investor appetite for risk.  New Zealand’s dollar slid against most of its major
counterparts as the Greek announcement spurred speculation
Europe’s debt crisis will worsen. The Aussie traded below parity
with the greenback for a second day. Global stocks fell.  “The mood in the market is pretty sour, and globally
that’s also the case,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst
in Washington at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency
brokerage. “You expect the commodity currencies to also
underperform.”  The Australian dollar declined 0.2 percent to 99.37 U.S.
cents yesterday in New York. It touched 99.22, the weakest since
Dec. 20. The Aussie gained 0.2 percent to 79.67 yen.  New Zealand dollar , dubbed the kiwi, weakened 0.9 percent
to 76.93 U.S. cents and touched 76.828, the lowest since Dec.
29. It fell 0.5 percent to 61.69 yen.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks dropped 0.9 percent.  Greek President Karolos Papoulias’s meeting in Athens
yesterday with political leaders failed to produce a government
after an inconclusive May 6 vote. He called for a meeting today
to form a caretaker government to lead the country until the
vote.  A second election threatened to extend Greece’s political
gridlock and reignited speculation the country will renege on
its pledges to cut spending, required by the terms of its 240
billion euros ($306 billion) in bailouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
