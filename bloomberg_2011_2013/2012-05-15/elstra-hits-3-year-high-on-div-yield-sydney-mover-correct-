     (Corrects amount of climb in first sentence to 3-Year)  Telstra Corp. (TLS) , Australia’s biggest
phone company, climbed to a three-year high in Sydney trading as
investors targeted a dividend yield underpinned by government
payments for the next decade  Telstra  surged  as much as 3 percent to A$3.75, its highest
level since Feb. 2009, and was trading 2.8 percent higher at
A$3.74 as of 1:54 p.m. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index declined
0.8 percent.  The Melbourne-based company’s plans to pay a 28 cent
dividend for the financial year ending June and the same amount
in fiscal 2013, funded by cash from a government-owned high-
speed Internet network. Telstra’s  yield of 7.7 percent , which
measures how much an investor will get from estimated dividends
compared with its share price, is the highest of all stocks in
the S&P/ASX 50 index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The money is rotating out of riskier assets into more
defensive stocks,” said Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG
Markets in  Melbourne . “What better place to park the funds than
at Telstra, which has very good dividend yields.”  The yield is more than double the nation’s benchmark
interest rate of 3.75 percent.  The company agreed last year to give control of its copper-
wire network to the government-backed National Broadband Network
in exchange for A$11 billion ($11 billion) of compensation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
