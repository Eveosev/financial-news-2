The  New York Mets ’ Citi Field will
host Major League Baseball’s 2013 All-Star Game, the New York
Post reported, without saying where it got the information.  Major League Baseball spokesman Pat Courtney said in a
telephone interview and Mets spokesman  Jay Horwitz  said in an e-
mail that they couldn’t confirm the report. Baseball
commissioner Bud Selig’s office said in an e-mailed statement
that MLB and the Mets will make a “major joint announcement”
tomorrow at City Hall in Manhattan.  Holding the All-Star Game at Citi Field has been discussed
since before the stadium opened in 2009, yet took so long to
come about because of the difficulty of organizing event
logistics in  New York , the Post said.  The Mets previously hosted the All-Star Game in 1964, the
year they opened Shea Stadium. Yankee Stadium was the site of
the All-Star Game in 2008, the last year the facility was used
before the  New York Yankees  moved to a new venue across the
street.  This year’s game is scheduled for July 10 at Kauffman
Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.  To contact the reporter on this story:
