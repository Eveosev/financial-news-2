Higson International Ltd., a Hong
Kong-based clothing maker, will invest 4 million euros ($5.1
million) in southern  Serbia , moving at least 10 percent of its
current production capacities in Asia.  The producer of the Iguana brand “was the first company
that moved to Asia and we want to be the first to move our
facilities to southeast  Europe ,” Chief Executive Officer Franz
Koller told reporters in Belgrade.  Serbia is trying to avoid a second recession in three years
after the economy contracted 1.3 percent in the first quarter of
2012 and the government wants to attract investment in
manufacturing industries to stop a further increase in
unemployment that already reached 24 percent at the end of 2011.  Higson, founded in  Germany  in 1978, will shift 10 to 15
percent of its production capacity from  Asia  to Serbia and will
export its sportswear “to the European Union, Russia, Ukraine
and Kazakhstan,” the Belgrade-based Economy Ministry said in an
e-mail.  Higson will initially pay 1 million euros to buy machines
and add 750,000 euros to open 500 jobs in Zitoradja, a town of
3,365 people in Serbia’s south. Eventually, the factory will
employ 1,500 people, Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
