Swaps contracts dropped for lower-
quality thermal coal from  Indonesia , the worldâ€™s biggest
exporter of the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte
Ltd., an energy broker. Prices for deliveries to  China  fell.  The June 2012 contract for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal
with a heating value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram fell 60
cents to $73.90 a metric ton on a net as-received basis
yesterday, according to data from the energy broker. Swaps for
the third quarter of 2012 were $1 lower at $73 a ton.  Contracts for China coal also declined. Coal with a heating
value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram on a net as-received
basis for shipments to South China for June fell $1.70, or 1.7
percent, to $96.65 a ton, Ginga said. The swap for the third
quarter declined $1.50 to $97.  The price of Chinese coal for power stations fell for the
first time in three years for May, a month when power producers
normally buy to stockpile the fuel before peak demand in the
summer. The benchmark grade at Qinhuangdao port with an energy
value of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram fell 0.6 percent from a
week earlier to a range from 775  yuan  ($123) to 785 yuan a ton
as of May 13, according to data from the China Coal Transport
and Distribution Association.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating, or spot price, is exchanged for a fixed rate over a
specified contract period.  About 60 percent of the coal from Indonesia is classified
as sub-bituminous. The grade is typically softer, with a dull,
earthy appearance, according to the London-based World Coal
Association. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian Energy Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
