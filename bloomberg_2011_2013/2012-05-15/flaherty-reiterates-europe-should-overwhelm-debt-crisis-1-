Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said  Europe  should use its own financial resources to
“overwhelm” the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Flaherty, speaking today to a parliamentary committee in
Ottawa, said the “incremental” approach used by European
leaders hasn’t worked.  Speaking to reporters after his testimony, Flaherty said
Germany is among those countries that should contribute more to
end the turmoil.  Germany “certainly is wealthy and has substantial
resources,” Flaherty told reporters after speaking to
committees of the House of Commons and Senate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
