Tanzania’s inflation rate fell for
the fourth consecutive month in April as energy and food-price
increases slowed, the National Bureau of Statistics said.  Inflation in  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy eased to
18.7 percent in April from 19 percent a month earlier, the Dar
es Salaam-based agency said in a statement handed to reporters
today in the city. Prices rose 0.8 percent in the month.  Energy price-growth declined to 24.9 percent from 29.4
percent in the previous month, while the food inflation rate
dropped to 24.7 percent from 24.9 percent, the agency said.  Tanzania may achieve inflation of less than 10 percent by
the end of this year, after the rate peaked at 19.8 percent in
December driven by increasing food and energy prices, according
to the International Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
