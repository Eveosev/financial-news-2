The European Union said it is
considering complaining to the  World Trade Organization  about
Argentinean import restrictions that the EU says violate global
regulations.  EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht “will be looking at
all the possibilities, of which the multi-lateral response
including WTO action is certainly one he is considering,” John Clancy, De Gucht’s spokesman, told reporters today in Brussels.  Argentina  has subjected a number of imports to licensing
regulations since 2008, a policy that the EU and 18 other WTO
members have said hinders trade. Governments and businesses say
the Latin American nation’s import-substitution rules, which
force foreign companies to produce goods in Argentina or lose
 market access , are protectionist.  “The high and increasing number of import-restricting
measures implemented by the Argentine government in application
of its discriminatory import-substitution policy is a cause of
considerable concern,”  De Gucht  said in an April 19 letter to
Argentina’s foreign minister. “You are certainly aware of the
very serious legal considerations these measures raise from a
WTO perspective and the growing concern among WTO members
affected by this policy, which is manifestly incompatible with
WTO rules.”  WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said on April 20 that the
import curbs may breach global commerce rules.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
