Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., the
largest supermarket chain in the Balkans, said first-quarter
profit tumbled as the region’s economic slump pushed consumers
to spend less.  Net income in the period was 700,000 euros ($893,830) from
10.2 million euros in the first three months last year, the
Ljubljana-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Revenue advanced 3.6 percent to 676 million euros, it said.  “A significant economic slowdown, increase in jobless
rates and lower real disposable income have resulted in reduced
spending,” Mercator said in the statement.  Mercator, which Croatian rival Agrokor d.d. attempted to
take over earlier this year, faces slowing economies at home and
abroad as it fights increased competition from new entrants such
as  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  of  Belgium .  The Balkan-region economies are struggling to avoid a
second recession in three years as the debt crisis in Europe
damps demand for their exports and  Greece ’s deepening crisis
makes banks reluctant to lend.  Agrokor plans to make another offer for Mercator, Croatian
newspaper Poslovni said yesterday after Croatia’s largest
private company abandoned its previous bid in February due to a
protracted process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
