Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to the
weakest in two months against the dollar after the country’s
inflation accelerated.  The currency of Africa’s largest oil producer declined 0.1
percent to 158.125 per dollar as of 5:01 p.m. in Lagos, its
weakest since March 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation accelerated to 12.9 percent in April, the fastest
since October 2010, from 12.1 percent in March, the  National
Bureau of Statistics  said today. The  Central Bank of Nigeria ,
which raised its  policy rate  to a record 12 percent in October,
forecast inflation will peak at 14.5 percent in the third
quarter before gradually slowing to below 10 percent by the end
of 2013.  “The inflation rate will put the naira under pressure of
depreciation,”  Bismarck Rewane , chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Financial Derivatives Co., said by phone today.
“The central bank may want to fight inflation by holding the
rate at the current level as increasing it further will be
counter-productive.”  “We expect inflation to peak at about 13.5 percent in
July, owing largely to the secondary effects of the partial
removal of fuel subsidies earlier this year,” Absa Capital
strategists, led by Ridle Markus in Johannesburg, wrote in a
report today.  Yields on Nigeria’s Eurobonds due 2021 declined by four
basis points to 5.514 percent in  London .  Borrowing costs on domestic bonds due 2015 gained four
basis points to 15.03 percent as of May 14 data on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi fell 0.7 percent to 1.9050 per dollar, in the
capital Accra, the weakest since at least June 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
