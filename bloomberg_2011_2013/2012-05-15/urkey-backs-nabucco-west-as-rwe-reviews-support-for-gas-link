Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS,
the Turkish state pipeline company known as Botas, reiterated
its support for the Nabucco West project after  RWE AG (RWE)  said it’s
reviewing its commitment to the whole Nabucco venture.  “Botas and the Turkish Ministry of Natural Resources fully
support it,” Levent Ozgul, Botas’s director of strategy and
business development, said today by e-mail.  RWE said yesterday it’s examining whether its “commercial
requirements” are still met by Nabucco, a planned pipeline
designed to carry natural gas from the Caspian Sea region to
central  Europe . The project may be scaled back to the Nabucco
West link, which would take gas from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz
field to the proposed Trans-Anatolia Pipeline, known as Tanap.  Nabucco West is competing with other pipeline projects for
gas from the Shah Deniz development partners, which are
accepting formal bids for shipment rights tomorrow.  “ Turkey  assumes that Nabucco West will be the natural
continuation of Tanap,” which is led by Azerbaijan and Turkey,
Ozgul said.  As well as Botas and RWE, Nabucco’s project members include
Vienna-based  OMV AG (OMV) , Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt (MOL) , Bulgargaz EAD and
Romania’s Transgaz SA. Mol said last month it isn’t prepared to
finance Nabucco and may sell its stake.  The pipeline venture, designed to lower the European
Union’s dependence on Russian gas, has faced repeated delays in
the past eight years after struggling to secure fuel sources
amid competition from other export links.  To contact the reporter on this story:
