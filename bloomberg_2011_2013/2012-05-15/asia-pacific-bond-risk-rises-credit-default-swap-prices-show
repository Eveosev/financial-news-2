The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 6.5 basis points
to 188.5 basis points as of 10:02 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The gauge is set for its highest
close since Dec. 20, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 4 basis points to 190 as of 8:06
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The index is poised to close at the highest level since Jan. 20,
CMA data show.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index increased 3 basis points to
211 as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The benchmark matched its highest level reached on Nov.
25, according to CMA prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
