Taiwan’s dollar touched a one-month
low as a political impasse in  Greece  fueled concern the nation
will leave the euro.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Global funds sold $214 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought today, a seventh day of net sales, according to
exchange data. Greece, without a government for more than a week,
must decide today whether to pay 436 million euros ($559 million)
due to bondholders who shunned a debt swap last month.  “The situation in  Europe  continues to damp risk-taking
appetite,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Europe will continue to be the main
thing moving sentiment.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell to NT$29.514 against its U.S.
counterpart at the close, from NT$29.502 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier touched NT$29.579, the weakest
level since April 16. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, rose 47 basis
points to 5.2 percent.  The yield on the 1 percent notes due January 2017 was 0.967
percent, compared with 0.961 percent yesterday, according to
Gretai Securities Market. It touched 0.95 percent earlier, the
lowest level for  benchmark  five-year debt since March 1.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
 Taiwan  Interbank Money Center. It closed at 0.514 percent on May
11, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
