About 2,900 Moroccan judges began a
week-long strike to protest against judicial corruption and
interference by the executive branch that they say undermines
their independence.  The judges will wear an armband for a week in the hope that
the government will negotiate with them, and are ready to
intensify their protest in the coming weeks if their demands are
not met, the 3,700-member Club of Moroccan Judges said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Pro-democracy protests in  Morocco  that started in February
2011, at the height of uprisings in other Arab nations, have
sought to secure greater independence of the judiciary in the
country. Last week, King Mohammed VI appointed a commission to
draft judicial reforms.  The group representing the judges was established in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
