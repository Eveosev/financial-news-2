U.S. social-media advertising
spending may rise to $9.8 billion in 2016 from $3.8 billion last
year, as companies seek to harness new tools that help reach
people who interact online, researcher BIA/Kelsey  said .  Higher ad spending at  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube and  LinkedIn
Corp. (LNKD)  boosted BIA/Kelsey’s forecast from six months ago. In
November, BIA/Kelsey projected 2011 social-media advertising
revenues would reach $3.4 billion -- $400 million less than the
figure released today.  “We’ve slightly accelerated our numbers for 2012 and 2013
because of the growth we’ve seen with social video, with YouTube
as a driver,” said  Jed Williams , an analyst and program
director at Chantilly, Virginia-based BIA/Kelsey. “YouTube will
play an increasingly important role.”  The researcher bumped up its 2012 social-media advertising
spending estimate by $200 million to $4.8 billion, Williams said
in a phone interview. Next year’s spending will reach $5.9
billion, up from the $5.8 billion BIA/Kelsey expected in
November, he said.  The increased forecast comes as the world’s largest social-
networking site,  Facebook Inc. (FB) , prepares to sell shares to the
public. Facebook is poised to surpass United Parcel Service Inc.
as the most valuable company in history to go public in the
U.S., based on market capitalization, data compiled by Bloomberg
and Dealogic show.  “Better performance, coupled with richer formats and
creative elements, like video, will be the principal social-ad
market-growth drivers,” Williams said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
