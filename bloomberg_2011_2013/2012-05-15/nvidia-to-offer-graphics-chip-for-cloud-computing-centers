Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  unveiled a version of
its processors that will work in cloud-computing centers,
offering users the ability to stream advanced graphics through
the Internet to remote devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPad.  Nvidia collaborated with software maker  Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS) 
to make the technology work, Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said at a company conference today in San Jose,
California. Nvidia is one of the top three providers of so-
called graphics processing units, or GPUs.  Huang said his company is working on several applications
of the technology aimed at improving the capabilities of
electronics devices like smartphones, tablets, televisions and
personal computers. He demonstrated a new, high-end video game
being played by two competitors via the Internet, one using a
tablet and the other using a television.  “With the cloud we can literally put GPU computing in the
hands of billions of mobile users around the world,” he said.  In an another demonstration, Huang showed an iPad remotely
accessing a PC running  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows operating
system. The technology may be deployed by customers such as
phone-service providers or Internet-access providers.  The hardest challenge to solve has been removing the lag
between input on a device and response from the remote computer,
Huang said.  Santa Clara , California-based Nvidia has managed to
reduce that to a response time similar to that of a computer-
game console.  Nvidia  shares  fell 1 percent to $13 at the close in New
York. They have declined 6.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
