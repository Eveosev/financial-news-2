  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the world’s sixth-
largest wireless operator by subscribers, said first-quarter
profit dropped 36 percent as competition made its Russian
business less profitable.  Net income fell to $318 million from $500 million a year
earlier, hurt by tax expenses and exchange-rate fluctuations,
Amsterdam-based VimpelCom said today in a  statement . Profit was
less than the $412.5 million average of two estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales excluding acquisitions gained 3 percent to
$5.6 billion.  VimpelCom,  Russia ’s third-largest wireless company by
subscribers, has begun reorganization to cut costs after buying
Wind Telecom SpA last year. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization from the Russian wireless
division, the largest unit, narrowed to 41.3 percent of sales
from 42.1 percent a year earlier as the price per minute of
voice calls declined and low-margin handset sales increased.  Talks to sell a stake in the company’s Djezzy unit to the
Algerian government are continuing, Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder said in an interview, reiterating the company’s intention
to remain in  Algeria . The company may sell units in its smaller
markets or merge them with competitors, Lunder said, without
giving details.  “The situation is improving but there are still things
that prevent VimpelCom from growing, most importantly the
situation in Algeria,” said Sergey Libin, a Moscow-based
analyst at Raffeisenbank. “Compared to the  fourth quarter , net
profit is actually quite good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
