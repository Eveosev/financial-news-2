Investors are reducing gold holdings
for a third month, the longest stretch since 2004, and favoring
the dollar as a haven from  Europe ’s debt crisis, even as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. predicts record prices for the metal.  Bullion erased its gains for 2012 this week as the dollar
rose against a basket of currencies for a record 12 straight
days. Gold held in exchange-traded products fell 30.8 metric
tons since reaching a record 2,410.2 tons on March 13, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,  ABN Amro 
Bank NV and Barclays Plc cut their forecasts in May, though
Goldman expects prices to rise 26 percent to $1,940 an ounce in
12 months.  Gold rallied for 11 consecutive years and prices rose more
than sevenfold, with demand accelerating in 2008 amid the global
recession. Now, mounting concern that  Greece  may exit the 17-
nation euro and prospects for faster U.S. growth are boosting
the dollar, making it more attractive than bullion to some
investors seeking to protect their wealth. Hedge funds are the
least bullish on the metal since December 2008.  “Gold is just another risk asset,” said Michael Aronstein, the president of Marketfield Asset Management in New
York, who predicted the 2008 slump that drove  commodities  down
66 percent in seven months and then the rebound in 2009. “It
made you a lot of money if you took the risk eight or 10 years
ago. A real safe haven would be a pile of high-denomination
Swiss franc or dollar notes, stored in a safety deposit box.”  Trading Partners  Futures dropped 1.9 percent this year to settle at
$1,536.60 on the Comex today in New York. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities declined 1.9 percent, and the MSCI
All-World Index of equities climbed 1.7 percent. The  Dollar
Index , a gauge against six major trading partners, added 1.5
percent after retreating as much as 2.6 percent. Treasuries
returned 1 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Bullion slid as much as 21 percent from its intraday record
in September, the common definition of a  bear market . On a
closing basis, futures need to settle at $1,513.52 an ounce to
record a 20 percent drop from its August settlement peak of
$1,891.90.  Gold’s correlation to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, a measure of U.S. equity derivatives known as
the  fear gauge , has now dropped to near zero after moving in
lockstep as recently as September, when  New York  futures touched
a record $1,923.70 before plunging 19 percent. The 30-week
correlation coefficient between the greenback and bullion is now
at -0.66, compared with -0.24 in September, with a figure of -1
meaning the two move opposite to each other.  Barclays, RBS  The metal will average $1,740 in 2012, compared with
$1,673.76 so far this year, according to the median estimate of
11 analysts tracked by Bloomberg since March. Barclays cut its
outlook by 8 percent to $1,716 last week and RBS lowered its
forecast by $25 to $1,725 on May 4. ABN Amro said May 2 its
prediction dropped to $1,550, from $1,600 in January.  The  European Central Bank  will be forced to pump more money
into the euro region in response to the debt crisis, reviving
the appeal of gold,  Hussein Allidina , the head of commodity
research at Morgan Stanley in New York, wrote in a report May
14. The ECB already flooded markets with more than 1 trillion
euros ($1.28 trillion) to avert a credit crunch. Prices will
rebound to an average of $1,825 this year and $2,175 in 2013,
Morgan Stanley forecasts.  The  Federal Reserve  is likely to start a third round of
stimulus in June, Goldman’s commodity research team, led by
 Jeffrey Currie  in New York, wrote in a report May 9. The metal
rose about 70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in
two rounds of so-called quantitative easing ending in June 2011.
It’s too early to say the dollar has reclaimed its status as the
currency of last resort over gold, the team wrote.  Soros, Paulson  Billionaire investor  George Soros  raised his stake in the
SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded product backed by
bullion, according to a filing yesterday reflecting first-
quarter holdings. Paulson & Co., the hedge fund founded by
billionaire  John Paulson , maintained its investment in the ETP
last quarter, while  Steven A. Cohen ’s SAC Capital Advisors LP
cut.  Record-low  interest rates  from the U.S. to Europe may prop
up demand for gold, which generally earns investors returns only
through price gains. The Fed has pledged to keep rates at
“exceptionally low levels” at least through late 2014. Central
banks are buying bullion at the fastest pace in five decades,
adding 439.7 tons in 2011. They may purchase a similar amount
this year, the London-based World Gold Council estimates.  VIX Correlation  When gold reached its record Sept. 6, it was moving in
tandem with the  VIX (VIX)  as Europe’s debt crisis and mounting concern
about the U.S. recovery spurred investors to buy the metal to
diversify their assets. At the time, the metal’s correlation
coefficient with the VIX surged to as high as 0.92. A reading of
1 indicates that the two securities trade in lockstep. The
correlation is now less than 0.1 percent.  The Dollar Index gained for 12 sessions through May 15, the
longest rally since its inception in 1973. The leadership vacuum
in Greece and concern that the country would quit the common
currency spurred investors to sell euros and buy dollars. That
also diminished demand from investors who use gold to hedge
against a weaker greenback. Open interest, or contracts
outstanding, in U.S. futures dropped 18 percent since July, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Holdings in ETPs backed by gold retreated 0.3 percent this
month after dropping 0.7 percent during the previous two months,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the second quarter, the VIX
has surged more than 40 percent while gold has dropped 6.9
percent, poised for the biggest quarterly loss since June 2004.  Net-Longs  Hedge funds and other speculators are  holding  a net-long
position of 92,498 futures and options, down from 253,653
contracts in August, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show.  “Usually, gold could be viewed as a safe haven or a contra
play to the  U.S. dollar ,” said Bill Greiner, who helps manage
$13 billion of assets as chief investment officer at Mariner
Wealth Advisors in  Kansas City ,  Missouri . “It’s really doing
neither right now. It’s highly possible that we’ll see gold and
commodities in general continue to drift down until the Fed
steps in with some sort of quantitative easing package.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
