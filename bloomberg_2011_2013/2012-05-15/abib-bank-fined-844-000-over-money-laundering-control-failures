Habib Bank AG Zurich was fined
525,000 pounds ($844,000) by the U.K. financial watchdog for
failing to put in place effective  money-laundering  controls.  The  Financial Services Authority  also fined a former bank
official 17,500 pounds for failing “to take reasonable care to
establish and maintain” systems to prevent money laundering,
the agency said in an e-mailed statement. The problems at the
bank lasted from 2007 to 2010, the FSA said.  “Firms must take a dynamic approach to assessing money
laundering risk so they can adapt to the ever-evolving risks of
financial crime,” Tracey McDermott, the  FSA ’s acting director
of enforcement and financial crime, said in the statement today.  The FSA is leading a crackdown on companies that have
insufficient systems and controls to manage risk. Coutts & Co.,
a private bank owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, was
fined 8.75 million pounds in March for not having effective
money-laundering controls.  About half of Habib Bank’s deposits came from jurisdictions
“which had less stringent anti-money-laundering requirements or
were perceived to have higher levels of corruption than the
U.K.,” the FSA said.  Both Habib Bank and the former official agreed to settle
with the FSA at an early stage and qualified for a 30 percent
discount. Anjum Iqbal, chief executive officer of the bank in
the U.K., couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.  To contact the reporter for this story:
