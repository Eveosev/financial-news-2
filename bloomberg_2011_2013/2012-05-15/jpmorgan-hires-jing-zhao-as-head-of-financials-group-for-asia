JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  hired Jing Zhao
from Citigroup Inc. to run its financial institutions group for
Asia outside Japan.  Zhao will be based in Hong Kong and report to Therese Esperdy and Todd Marin, co-heads of investment banking for the
Asia-Pacific region, according to an internal memo that was
confirmed by JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie Cheung. Zhao was co-head
of Citigroupâ€™s financial institutions team in Asia outside
Japan. She joined Citigroup in 2006.  Zhao is joining JPMorgan after Olivier de Grivel, former
head of the financial institutions group for the Asia-Pacific
region, retired this year. Zhao, who spent more than a decade at
Morgan Stanley before joining Citigroup, will start at JPMorgan
this summer, according to the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
