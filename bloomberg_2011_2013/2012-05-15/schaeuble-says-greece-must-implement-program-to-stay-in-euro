Greece  must elect a government that
sticks to the terms of its international bailout in order to
stay in the euro, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
said.  “If Greece -- and this is the will of the great majority
-- wants to stay in the euro then they have to accept the
conditions,” Schaeuble told reporters at a meeting of European
Union finance ministers in Brussels today. “Otherwise it isn’t
possible. No responsible candidate can hide that from the
electorate.”  Greece’s announcement today of new elections “doesn’t
change the situation,” Schaeuble said. “The program is agreed.
We need a government that’s capable of making decisions.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
