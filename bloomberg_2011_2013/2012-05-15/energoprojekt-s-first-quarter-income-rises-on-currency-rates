Energoprojekt Holding AD (ENHL) , a Serbian
construction and energy company, said its net income increased
more than tenfold in the first three months, because of positive
exchange rates.  The Belgrade-based group reported a 157.3 million-dinar
($1.8 million) net income, after 13.3 million dinars a year
earlier, as it took advantage of its foreign  operations  in 19
countries where it is paid in dollars or euros, while the dinar
lost 6.4 percent over the period, it said in a regulatory
 filing .  The net currency effect was 132 million dinars, which
helped compensate for a fall in the operating profit to 13.64
million dinars from 23.9 million dinars a year ago, according to
the report. First-quarter pretax profit was 162.56 million
dinars from 14.77 million dinars a year ago.  Energoprojekt’s  shares  rose 0.2 percent in  Belgrade  today,
to 451 dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
