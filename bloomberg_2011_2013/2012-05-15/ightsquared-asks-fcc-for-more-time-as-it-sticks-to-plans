LightSquared Inc., the satellite
company that filed for bankruptcy after the U.S. said its
proposed mobile data network would disrupt navigation gear, is
seeking to keep its permits.  The business backed by  Philip Falcone  still intends to
deploy a nationwide wireless system, Executive Vice President
 Jeffrey Carlisle  said in a May 10 meeting with Austin Schlick,
the Federal Communications Commission’s general counsel,
according to a disclosure filing posted today on the agency’s
website. The FCC shouldn’t revoke permits as proposed in
February, according to the filing.  “LightSquared stands ready to continue to work with
federal government stakeholders and the GPS community to find a
solution that will placate all affected constituencies,” the
filing stated.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for Chapter
11 protection from creditors yesterday in  New York . U.S.
officials had concluded its proposed service would interfere
with gear that uses the global-positioning system.  The filing gives LightSquared time to resolve regulatory
issues, Falcone said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. He is
chief executive officer of Harbinger Capital Partners, which has
invested about $3 billion in LightSquared  Tammy Sun, an FCC spokeswoman, declined to comment in an e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
