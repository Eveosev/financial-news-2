United Co. (UAL)  Rusal, the world’s largest
aluminum producer, may elect Matthias Warnig as chairman when
the new board of directors is formed on June 15, Vedomosti
 reported , citing two unidentified people close to the company.  Warnig, a former East German Stasi agent who has known
President Vladimir Putin since at least 1991, was nominated by
Chief Executive Officer Oleg Deripaska’s En+ Group, which is
Rusal’s largest shareholder, the newspaper said.  Rusal elected Barry Cheung as chairman on March 16 to
replace billionaire shareholder Victor Vekselberg, who quit amid
a dispute with Deripaska.  The En+ press service declined to comment. On Monday, Rusal
said its board nominated Warnig as an independent, non-executive
director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
