The pound strengthened to a 3 1/2-
year high against the euro as Greek political party leaders
meeting in  Athens  today failed to form a government, meaning new
elections will be needed.  Gilts snapped a two-day advance after growth in Germany
helped the economy of the 17-nation currency bloc avoid joining
Britain in a double-dip recession. Sterling weakened against the
dollar as a U.K. report showed the trade deficit narrowed less
in March than economists forecast.  “Once again sterling is looking likely to close on the day
higher against the euro,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on
the corporate and institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank
Plc in London. “The sustained bout of sterling pressure against
the euro has been fairly incessant over the past six weeks and
looks likely to continue until euro-zone woes quieten down or
the pound runs out of steam.”  The pound was little changed at 79.68 pence per euro at
5:03 p.m.  London  time after appreciating 0.1 percent to 79.60
pence, the strongest level since November 2008. The U.K.
currency declined 0.4 percent to $1.6022. It earlier dropped to
$1.6011, the lowest level since April 19.  Sterling has appreciated 4.1 percent in 2012, the best
performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis spurred demand for U.K. assets as a haven. The
dollar gained 0.6 percent and the euro fell 1.1 percent.  ‘Adverse Conditions’  Greece  “is once again headed to elections in a few days
under adverse conditions,”  Evangelos Venizelos , the leader of
the socialist Pasok party, said after Greek President Karolos
Papoulias failed to broker the creation of a government at a
meeting with party leaders.  The yield on the  10-year gilt  climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.90 percent, after declining to a
record 1.86 percent yesterday. The 4 percent bond due in March
2022 dropped 0.175, or 1.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount,
to 118.765.  The U.K. sold 2.75 billion pounds of 5 percent bonds due in
March 2025 today. The debt was sold at an average yield of 2.251
percent, compared with 2.356 percent at a previous auction of
the securities on Feb. 1.  Germany ’s gross domestic product grew 0.5 percent last
quarter from the previous three months, when it fell 0.2
percent, the Federal Statistics Office said in Wiesbaden. GDP in
the euro region stagnated, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.2 percent contraction.  The U.K. economy fell into its second recession since 2009
in the first quarter.  Britain’s trade deficit shrank to 8.56 billion pounds in
March from a revised 8.59 billion pounds in February, the  Office
for National Statistics  said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News forecast a reduction to 8.4 billion pounds.  Gilts have gained 0.4 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries rose 1.1 percent,
and German bunds returned 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
