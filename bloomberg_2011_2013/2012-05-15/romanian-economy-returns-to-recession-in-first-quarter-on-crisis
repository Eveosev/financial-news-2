Romania slipped back into a recession
in the first quarter as the European sovereign-debt crisis and
freezing temperatures slowed growth in exports and industrial
output.  Gross domestic product  shrank a seasonally adjusted 0.1
percent from the previous quarter, after contracting 0.2 percent
in the fourth quarter, the  National Statistics Office  in
Bucharest said today in an e-mailed flash estimate. GDP grew a
seasonally unadjusted 0.3 percent from a year earlier, below the
median estimate of 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists.  Romania’s economy has fallen into a second recession in
four years, after exiting its worst decline on record last year,
as European austerity measures aiming to cool the sovereign-debt
crisis slowed exports from the eastern European country, home to
Dacia SA cars. Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall also
disrupted transportation and supply chains.  “The second-quarter data will be crucial in shedding light
on whether the observed softening in economic activity is
largely driven by temporary factors such as harsh winter
conditions,” Citigroup Inc. economists Ilker Domac and Gultekin Isiklar wrote in a note to clients before the report.  The country will probably see growth slowing this year to
1.5 percent from 2.5 percent in 2011 as European spending cuts
hinder export growth, according to International Monetary Fund
forecasts. The economy will probably grow 1.4 percent this year,
the European Commission said in its spring forecast published on
May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
