Pershing Square  Capital Management
LP, the hedge fund run by William Ackman, boosted its stake in
J.C. Penney Co. to 18 percent of the company’s stock and cut
holdings in  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  and  Fortune Brands Home &
Security Inc. (FBHS)   The fund reported holding about 39.1 million J.C. Penney
shares valued at $1.38 billion as of March 31, up from about
38.7 million shares as of Dec. 31, according to a filing today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Pershing Square, whose founder is known for investing in
companies to press for changes, decreased its stake in Fortune
Brands to about 13.3 million shares valued at $294 million from
about 20.8 million shares in December. The fund also cut its
 Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  holding to about 15.5 million shares valued at
$589.4 million.  J.C. Penney, based in Plano, Texas, fell 13 percent to $29
at 5:55 p.m. in New York after reporting a first-quarter loss
and saying it will discontinue its quarterly dividend after
sales fell more than anticipated.  Pershing Square, based in New York, also reduced its Family
Dollar Stores Inc. position to 2.6 million shares valued at
$165.5 million from 8.4 million shares.  Pershing Square’s biggest position by market value on March
31 was 24.2 million shares of  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) 
valued at $1.83 billion.  Money managers who oversee $100 million of equities or more
must file, within 45 days of the end of each quarter, a Form 13F
with the SEC that lists their U.S. exchange-traded stocks,
options and convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S.
