Lindt & Spruengli AG (LISN)  Chairman Ernst Tanner plans to step down from his post as chief executive
officer in the next three to five years,  Bilanz  reported in an
interview with the manager.  A successor should be appointed from within the Kilchberg,
Switzerland-based chocolate maker, though Tanner’s son shouldn’t
replace him, Bilanz cited the CEO as saying in an interview to
be published tomorrow. Tanner would stay on for a couple of
years for the successor to benefit from his experience, Bilanz
said in a preview of the article sent to news organizations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
