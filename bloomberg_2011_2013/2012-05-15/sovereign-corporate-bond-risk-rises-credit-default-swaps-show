The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, reversing an
earlier decline, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed 3.5 basis points to
296.5 at 3:39 p.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration
in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 14.5
basis points to 730.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 3.5 to 172.5.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers was up seven basis points at 287.5 and the
subordinated index was 9.5 higher at 473.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
