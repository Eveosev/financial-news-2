Singapore ’s April private home sales
climbed to the highest in almost three years, boosted by
purchases in the suburban areas of the island city.  Private home sales rose 3.9 percent to 2,487 units last
month from 2,393 units in March, the highest since July 2009,
according to data from the  Urban Redevelopment Authority .  Home sales remained above 2,000 units in each of the past
three months as buyers invested in so-called shoebox apartments.
Singapore may introduce measures to regulate the sale of such
homes after a record number of these units were sold in the
first quarter, Khaw Boon Wan, Singapore’s National Development
minister, said yesterday.  Singapore’s private residential property  price index 
declined 0.1 percent to 206 points in the three months ended
March 31 from the previous quarter, according to data by the
authority. Homes priced below S$750,000 ($596,777) contributed
42 percent of new sales last quarter. In the previous three
months, those houses accounted for 25 percent.  Developers sold 1,764 shoebox apartments, or those that are
less than 50 square meters (538 square feet), in the three
months ended March 31, the most since the Urban Redevelopment
Authority began collating the data in 2007.  Home sales climbed to 6,458 units in the quarter, according
to the data. Prices rose 1.1 percent for the mass market in the
same period, the authority said.  Katong Regency in eastern Singapore contributed to the most
sales last month, with 244 units, according to the government
data. Sales were also boosted by the Ripple Bay development at
Pasir Ris, while  CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL)  sold 131 units of its Moshe
Safdie-designed Sky Habitat, a 509-unit project in Bishan, a
suburb in the central part of the island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
