Oil rebounded from near its lowest in
five months in  New York  after manufacturing in the region for
May exceeded forecasts.  West Texas Intermediate advanced as much as 0.7 percent
after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index increased to 17.1 this month from 6.6 in April. The median
estimate in a survey of Bloomberg economists called for an
increase to 9. Crude supplies in the U.S. probably climbed 1.5
million barrels last week to 381 million, the most since August
1990, according to a Bloomberg News survey before government
data tomorrow.  “The build-up of inventories in the U.S. is something to
consider, but the other side of the coin is that the  U.S.
economy  has shown impressive signs of recovery,” said
 Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd in
London.  Crude for June delivery was at $95.47 a barrel, 66 cents
higher in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:38 p.m. London time. Prices dropped 1.4 percent to $94.78
yesterday, the lowest close since Dec. 19.  Brent for June settlement gained $1.02 to $112.59 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European
benchmark contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate was
$17.22, compared with $16.79 yesterday.  Prices rose in London as Germany’s faster-than-estimated
economic growth helped the euro area avoid its second recession
in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
