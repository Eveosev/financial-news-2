The central and eastern U.S. may warm
up enough by the end of the month to boost energy demand as
temperatures climb into the 80s Fahrenheit (upper-20s Celsius).  Temperatures across the East are forecast to be 5 to 7
degrees above normal, with the western Great Lakes and  Chicago 
reaching 8 to 14 degrees higher than normal from May 25 to May
29, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “This warm change is likely to bring a boost to cooling
demand across parts of the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, where
widespread 80s are likely for at least a few days,” MDA said in
its 11- to 15-day outlook.  Natural gas futures advanced today on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange after the forecasts, which may boost demand
for power-plant fuel for air conditioning.  Commodity Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  was
cautious in his forecast, saying in a note to clients that it
only takes temperatures moving past the 70s to send averages
above normal at this time of year. Those highs don’t match the
heat that drives the big demands for electricity in July and
August, Rogers said from his office in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The  New York Independent System Operator , which oversees
much of the state’s electricity grid, had its highest demand of
33,939 megawatts on Aug. 2, 2006, according to the ISO’s
website. The grid operator expects a peak of 33,295 megawatts
this summer.  The increase in electricity may affect the natural gas
market because consumption is expected to peak at 31.2 billion
cubic feet a day in the third quarter, when air conditioning use
is the highest, up from 27.7 billion a year earlier, according
to the Energy Department.  The normal average temperature for May 16 in New York is
63, according to MDA. It’s 58 in Boston, 59 in Chicago, 67 in
 St. Louis , 70 in Atlanta, 74 in Dallas, 77 in Houston, 60 in
Seattle and 72 in  Burbank ,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
