Israeli consumer price-linked bonds
declined, pushing yields higher for the first time in three
days, on speculation inflation may slow in coming months as
economic growth falters.  The yield on the 3.5 percent inflation-linked notes due
April 2018 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
1.14 percent at 11:16 a.m. in  Tel Aviv . The two-year break-even
rate, the yield difference between inflation-linked bonds and
fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, fell four basis
point to 281, implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.81
percent. The Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  will
release April inflation data today.  The economy grew an annualized 2.5 percent in the first
quarter, the slowest pace since the three months ended June
2009, according to the median estimate of 11 economists
 surveyed by Bloomberg . The statistics bureau is scheduled to
release the data tomorrow. Unemployment rose to 6.9 percent in
March from 6.5 percent the previous month, the statistics bureau
said April 30.  “Inflation is expected to moderate in coming months on the
back of weaker demand and rising unemployment affected by a
global economic slowdown,” said Yaniv Hevron, head of macro-
strategy at  Ramat Gan , Israel-based Excellence Nessuah
Investment House Ltd. “In this environment, we recommend non-
linked government bonds over consumer-price linked bonds.”  Slowing Growth  The yield on the 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bonds due January 2022
increased one basis point to 4.54 percent.  Economic growth  is expected to slow to 3.1 percent this
year from 4.8 percent in 2011, the central bank said on March
26. Two-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, was unchanged at 2.57
percent.  Consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in  April from the previous
month as electricity and gasoline costs increased, according to
the median estimate of 14 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.
Electricity prices rose by 8.9 percent at the beginning of
April, and gasoline prices increased 0.6 percent in the month,
the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources said.  The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.8258 a dollar. The
Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, a measure of inflation-linked and fixed-
rate corporate bonds, fell for a third day, declining 0.3
percent to 264.13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
