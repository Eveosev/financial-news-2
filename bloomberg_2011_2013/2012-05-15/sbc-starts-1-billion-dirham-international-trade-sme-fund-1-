HSBC Bank  Middle East  Ltd. said it
started a 1 billion-dirham ($272 million) international trade
fund for small and medium-sized businesses with 30 percent
allocated to companies held by United Arab Emirates nationals.  Loan growth at the bank in the small and medium business
segment grew about 20 percent in 2011 and will probably increase
by just under that figure in 2012, Nick Levitt, HSBC’s head of
U.A.E. commercial banking in Dubai, said today at a conference
in  Abu Dhabi . Total loans outstanding for the bank in the
segment are valued at $600 million, he said.  Total loan growth in the U.A.E. in the first-quarter was
0.7 percent, Levitt said.  Abdulfattah Sharaf, chief executive officer of HSBC Bank
Middle East, said at the same event that the bank would probably
integrate its operations with the acquisition it made this year
of Llyods Banking Group Plc’s consumer and commercial-banking
assets in the U.A.E. by the end of the year.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank, said on March 29
that it agreed to buy $769 million of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s
consumer and commercial-banking assets in the U.A.E. to bolster
its presence in the Middle East.  HSBC said at the time that customer accounts in the U.A.E.
grew 11 percent to $18.17 billion in 2011. Chief Executive
Officer  Stuart Gulliver  in February named the UAE along with
Mexico and India as an area for “repositioning” the bank in
consumer finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
