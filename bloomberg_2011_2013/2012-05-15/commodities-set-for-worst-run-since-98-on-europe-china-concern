Commodities declined for a tenth day,
set for the longest losing streak since 1998, on concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen as  Greece  remains without a
government while economic growth in  China  may slow further.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of raw materials fell
as much as 0.5 percent to 632.7, and traded at 634.35 by 7:12
a.m. in  London . Oil futures traded near a five-month low in  New
York  and copper dropped to the lowest price since January on the
London Metal Exchange. Spot gold and silver declined.  The euro extended losses after Moody’s Investors Service’s
downgraded Italian banks yesterday and speculation persisted
that Greece may be forced to abandon the single currency. Data
today may show that the region’s  economy contracted  for a second
quarter. China may grow at the weakest pace in 13 years in 2012,
according to a forecast from Pacific Investment Management Co.  “I don’t know where the bottom is,” said Koun-Ken Lee, a
Singapore-based strategist at  Standard Chartered  Plc. “Prices
may depend on what transpires in Europe. Commodity fundamentals
remain tight and we are bullish for the second half.”  Europe shrank 0.2 percent in the three months to March,
according to the median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before a report today that may show the region is in
recession. More than a week after inconclusive elections, Greek
President Karolos Papoulias is seeking support for a government
of non-politicians. A Greek euro exit would spark speculation
other countries may follow, according to Jefferies
International.  Slowing Growth  Inbound investment in China, the largest user of metals,
slid 0.7 percent in April from a year earlier, the Ministry of
Commerce said today. China’s economic growth this year may be in
“mid 7-percent range,” according to Ramin Toloui, Pimco’s
global co-head of  emerging markets  portfolio management.  The S&P GSCI has dropped 7.5 percent this month following
declines in March and April. That exceeded the 5.7 percent loss
in the  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks. Investors pulled
$260 million out of commodity index exchange-traded funds last
week, the most this year, according to Standard Chartered.  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent to
$93.91 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , near
yesterday’s intraday low of $93.65, which was the cheapest since
Dec. 19. Three-month copper retreated as much as 1 percent to
$7,763.50 a metric ton, the lowest level since Jan. 12, and last
traded at $7,814.75  Spot gold dropped as much as 0.6 percent to $1,547.75 an
ounce, a level last seen in December. Silver dropped for a
seventh day, trading 0.2 percent lower at $28.1025 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
