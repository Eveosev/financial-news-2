Boston  Red Sox  third baseman  Kevin Youkilis  will probably begin a minor-league rehabilitation stint
in the next 48 hours, ESPN reports, citing people in Major
League Baseball it didn’t identify.  Youkilis, 33, has been out since April 28 with a lower back
injury and was eligible to return from the disabled list
yesterday. Youkilis’s contract with the Red Sox runs through the
end of this season and the three-time All-Star could have trade
value if he’s able to show he’s healthy, ESPN said.  With Youkilis out, rookie Will Middlebrooks has played
third base for Boston and is the third player in Major League
Baseball history to hit at least four home runs and drive in 13
or more runs in his first 10 games.  Middlebrooks is hitting .304 while Youkilis was batting
.219 with two homers and nine runs batted in over 18 games
before he went on the disabled list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
