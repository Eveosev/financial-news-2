Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) 
fell to the lowest level since July 2010 on bets wireless
competition may hurt profits at Israel’s second-largest fixed-
line operator as it starts selling mobile-phone plans.  Shares of Hot, which also provides cable television
services, plunged 8.7 percent to 34.50 shekels at the close in
 Tel Aviv .  Golan Telecom, partly owned by French entrepreneur Xavier
Niel, started mobile-phone services yesterday offering unlimited
voice and messaging at 99 shekels ($26) a month and selling SIM
cards without handsets. Hot said the same day its unit will
start mobile-phone services at 89 shekels a month for unlimited
use.  “The feeling is that Golan Telecom caught Hot off guard
and Hot reacted under pressure, offering prices that are much
lower than what it planned originally,” Ori Licht, head of
equity research at I.B.I.- Israel  Brokerage & Investments Ltd.
said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
