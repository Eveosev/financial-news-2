Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo  is prepared to weather a credit crisis as Brazil’s
biggest water utility reduces reliance on international  capital
markets , Chief Financial Officer Rui de Britto Affonso said.  “We have several funding resources,” Affonso said in an
interview in  New York . “If international markets dry up, we can
go to the domestic market. We also get long-term funding from
entities like the International Monetary Fund that guarantee a
stable stream of investments.”  Foreign capital markets represented 11 percent of Sabesp’s
debt at the end of 2011, compared with 24 percent in 2002,
according to company data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
