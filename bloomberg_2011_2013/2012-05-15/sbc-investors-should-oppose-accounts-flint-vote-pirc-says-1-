HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA)  annual report
should be opposed by shareholders and they should vote down
Chairman  Douglas Flint ’s re-election, Pensions & Investment
Research Consultants Ltd. said.  The reliability and audit quality of the accounts of
 Europe ’s biggest bank may be affected by the International
Financial Reporting Standards used, PIRC said in a statement
today. Flint’s position as executive chairman is an “obstacle”
to his independence, the corporate-governance advisory firm
said.  There “is a problem with the standards, which may
significantly impact on audit quality and the reliability of
accounts, particularly in relation to net assets and profits,”
said PIRC. “This might have been less of a problem if HSBC had
not used IFRS throughout the whole group.”  The adviser last month criticized U.K. competitor Barclays
Plc’s commitment to IFRS at the cost of producing a “true and
fair view” of the bank, which meant profits were overstated.
The PIRC advice comes amid greater shareholder activism. About
27 percent of shareholders last month opposed the pay report of
Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets.  Bonuses paid to HSBC’s employees “are disclosed but not
charged to the accounts, or accrued,” PIRC said. A spokesman
for HSBC declined to comment.  ISS, a shareholder adviser, said HSBC investors should
approve all its resolutions at the annual meeting on May 25.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
