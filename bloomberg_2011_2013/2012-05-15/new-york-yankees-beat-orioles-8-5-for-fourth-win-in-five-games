The  New York Yankees  beat the
Baltimore Orioles 8-5 for their fourth win in five games as Mark Teixeira’s seventh-inning home run snapped a 5-5 tie.  Curtis Granderson added a solo homer and Nick Swisher had a
two-run double last night as the Yankees improved to 4-0 this
Major League Baseball season at Baltimore’s Camden Yards.  David Phelps got the win in relief of Yankees starting
pitcher Ivan Nova, who left the game after 5 1/3 innings with a
right foot injury. New York’s  Rafael Soriano  pitched the ninth
inning for his second save. Reliever David Robertson was
unavailable because of rib cage soreness and may undergo
precautionary tests later today, manager  Joe Girardi  said.  Reliever Frank Francisco, who allowed five earned runs in
his previous two appearances, rebounded to notch his ninth save
last night as the New York Mets beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-1.
Francisco closed out the win for Mets 41-year-old starting
pitcher Miguel Batista, who allowed four hits in seven scoreless
innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
