(Corrects exporters must convert at least 50 percent of earnings
to rupees in second paragraph - original story said dollars.)  India ’s rupee strengthened,
rebounding from a five-month low, on speculation the central
bank sold dollars to curb losses in Asia’s worst-performing
currency this quarter.  The rupee dropped past 54 a dollar earlier today as concern
 Europe ’s debt-crisis is worsening damped demand for emerging-
market assets. The  Reserve Bank  of India this month raised
 interest rates  on local banks’ foreign-currency deposits and
said exporters must convert at least 50 percent of their
earnings to rupees. The RBI’s efforts will probably prove futile
and the rupee may plunge to an unprecedented 55 a dollar before
ending June at 54, according Standard Chartered Plc.  “The central bank will likely continue intervening and
regulatory measures will keep coming in,” said Priyanka Kishore,
a foreign-exchange strategist at  Standard Chartered  in Mumbai.
“Tinkering with the domestic dollar supply is not the same as
encouraging capital inflows, which will need a change in the
global backdrop.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 53.8300 per dollar as of
9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
dropped to 54.0700 earlier, the lowest level since Dec. 15. The
currency has lost 5.5 percent this quarter.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 12 basis points,
or 0.12 percentage point, to 11.82 percent.  Six-month onshore currency forwards were trading at 55.24 a
dollar, compared with 55.53 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were little changed at 55.64. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
