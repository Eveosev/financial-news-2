U.S. House lawmakers, acting after
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  announced $2 billion in derivatives trading
losses, delayed a committee vote on legislation easing Dodd-
Frank Act swaps rules.  The U.S.  House Agriculture Committee  postponed a May 17
committee meeting to vote on the measures, which would limit the
international reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law’s swaps
regulations and allow more derivatives trading to occur in
federally insured banks.  “As always,  Washington  has a tendency to overreact. While
the news of JPMorgan’s trading loss is unfortunate, the
bipartisan legislation the committee was scheduled to consider
is unrelated to the cause of the trading loss,” Representative
Frank D. Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the
committee, said in a statement.  “However, this committee will take the time to gather all
relevant information before we proceed to ensure there are no
unintended consequences of the legislation that would encourage
recklessness in our financial institutions,” Lucas said.  The bill restricting the international scope of Dodd-Frank
rules gained bipartisan support in a separate U.S. House
committee. JPMorgan,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
have argued that applying the rules to overseas branches would
hurt their ability to compete with rivals based outside the U.S.  The legislation would need passage by the full House and
Senate before it could be sent to President  Barack Obama  for
final approval. Neither chamber has scheduled a vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
