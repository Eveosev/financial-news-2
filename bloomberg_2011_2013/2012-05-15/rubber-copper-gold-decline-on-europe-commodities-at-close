The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities climbed 0.07 percent to 636.21 at 4:19 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.3 percent to 1,496.371.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest in five months in  New York 
before reports forecast to show U.S. crude stockpiles rose to
the highest level in 21 years and Europe’s economy shrank.  Crude for June delivery was at $94.67 a barrel, down 11
cents in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:07 p.m. Singapore time. Prices dropped 1.4 percent to
$94.78 yesterday, the lowest close since Dec. 19, and are down
4.1 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell for a second day in New York on
forecasts that mild weather will limit demand from electricity
generators.  Gas declined as much as 1.8 percent today, extending
yesterday’s 3.1 percent drop, after Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland , said weather in the western U.S. over the
next two weeks may be “fairly benign with below-normal
demand,” while variable warmth is expected in the South and the
East. A supply surplus ended March at a six-year high after the
fourth-warmest winter on record crimped fuel demand.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha swaps for June fell $4.25, or 0.5 percent, to
$905.75 a metric ton at 10:15 a.m.  Singapore  time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Prices slumped for
the 14th day, the longest declining streak since Bloomberg began
tracking the data in January 2011.  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures dropped to $67.59 a ton from $69.43 yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread is at its narrowest
since Dec. 2.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude fell 11 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $16.02 a barrel, PVM data showed. The spread is at
the narrowest since April 16. Singapore gasoil swaps for June
rose 5 cents to $123.10 a barrel.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold dropped to the lowest price this year as the euro
weakened to a four-month low on concern  Greece  will exit the
shared currency, boosting the dollar. Silver was set for the
worst run in more than three years.  Immediate-delivery gold declined as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,552.97 an ounce, the lowest level since Dec. 30, and traded
little changed at $1,554.72 at 12:54 p.m. in Singapore. June-
delivery bullion fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1,552.60 in New
York, also the cheapest since Dec. 30, and was at $1,554.40.  Spot silver fell as much as 0.4 percent to $28.045 an
ounce, the lowest price since Jan. 3. That’s the seventh daily
decline and the longest losing streak since March 3, 2009. The
metal last traded little changed at $28.1225.  BASE METALS  Copper declined to a four-month low on concerns that the
political impasse in Greece and credit-rating downgrades of
Italian banks by Moody’s Investors Service signal further
contraction in  Europe .  The metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 1
percent to $7,763.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
the lowest since Jan. 12, before trading at $7,804 by 12:40 p.m.
Shanghai time. The July contract on the Comex dropped 0.6
percent to $3.5335 per pound.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans rebounded from a six-week low as export sales from
the U.S. and  Brazil  climbed, draining supply in the world’s two
largest growers.  The July-delivery contract rose as much as 0.3 percent to
$13.9075 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$13.8825 by 2:08 p.m. Singapore time. Futures dropped as much as
2.1 percent to $13.76 yesterday, the lowest price since March
30.  Corn for July delivery was little changed at $5.835 a
bushel, while wheat for delivery in the same month rose 0.5
percent to $6.01 a bushel.  Rubber plunged to a four-month low as the political impasse
in Greece raised speculation the nation may leave the euro,
deepening an economic slump in the region and weakening demand
for the commodity used in tires.  October-delivery rubber slumped as much as 5.1 percent to
265 yen a kilogram ($3,317 a metric ton), the lowest level for a
most-active contract since Jan. 6, before trading at 270.1 yen
on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 3:39 p.m. local time. Prices
have trimmed this year’s advance to 2.5 percent.  Palm oil  advanced on speculation that demand may rise
before the Muslim fasting month and after yesterday’s biggest
price slump in more than 14 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
