Ukraine may lose 30 percent of the
grains harvest in the east and south because of hot, dry
weather, the national weather center said.  Yields may be lower after hot weather since April 26,
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agro-meteorology department at the
weather center, said by phone today from Kiev.  Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk declined to
comment today on the harvest forecast.  The government has
previously estimated output at 42 million to 45 million tons.  Rains are forecast in the north and west part of Ukraine
tomorrow, with sporadic wet weather in the south, Adamenko said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
