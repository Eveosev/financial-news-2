Russia  ran a  budget surplus  in April,
narrowing the four-month fiscal gap to 0.3 percent of gross
domestic product, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The cumulative  deficit  shrank to 60.3 billion rubles ($2
billion) in April, from a downwardly revised 70.2 billion rubles
a month earlier, the Moscow-based ministry said on its website
today, citing preliminary data.  Russia, which depends on energy exports for half of its
budget revenue, may run a surplus this year, acting Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov said last month. The average crude oil
price needed to balance the budget will drop from $117 a barrel
this year to $113 next year and $107 in 2014, the government
estimates. Higher energy revenue pushed the  federal budget  into
a surplus of 0.8 percent of economic output in 2011.  Urals crude oil, Russia’s chief export blend, has gained
more than 3 percent since the start of the year, averaging
about $116.4.  Revenue was 4.07 trillion rubles at the end of April, or
34.5 percent of the government’s target for the year, while
spending was 4.13 trillion rubles, or 32.6 percent of the goal,
according to the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
