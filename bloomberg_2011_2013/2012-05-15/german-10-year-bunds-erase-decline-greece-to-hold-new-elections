German  10-year bunds  erased a decline
after a report said Greece will hold new elections.  The 10-year yield was little changed at 1.45 percent as of
2:12 p.m. London time.  The rate earlier rose as much as four basis points to 1.50
percent.  Independent Greeks leader  Panos Kammenos , one of the Greek
party leaders meeting with President Karolos Papoulias to form a
government in Athens today, indicated that the talks had failed
and new elections will be held.  Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds extended their decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
