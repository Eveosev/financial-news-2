German 10-year bund yields were
within four basis points of a record low as new Greek elections
were called for after attempts to form a government failed.  German bonds fell earlier after a report showed gross
domestic product in  Europe ’s biggest economy rose more than
analysts forecast. The euro region avoided a recession,
according to a separate report. Italy’s bonds slid, pushing the
10-year yield to a three-month high, after Moody’s Investors
Service cut the credit ratings on 26 of the nation’s banks.
Greek bonds slid for an 11th day.  “The news keeps uncertainty in the market,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in
London. “That will underpin demand for bunds. It keeps the risk
open for another five or six weeks and gives another reason not
to sell core markets aggressively.”  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.47 percent
at 5:07 p.m.  London  time, after rising as much as four basis
points to 1.50 percent. The rate declined to 1.434 percent
yesterday, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the
securities in 1989. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in July 2022
traded at 102.615 percent of face value.  Greece will go to the polls again “in a few days under
adverse conditions,” said  Evangelos Venizelos , the leader of
the Pasok party, which was one of the two biggest vote winners
in inconclusive May 6 elections.  Greek Gridlock  The announcement came after Venizelos and other party
leaders met President Karolos Papoulias today in  Athens . A
second Greek ballot threatens to extend the political gridlock
that has left the country without a government.  Greece ’s 2 percent bond due February 2023 declined for an
11th day, pushing the yield up 182 basis points, or 1.82
percentage points, to 29.401 percent. The price dropped to 14.27
percent of face value.  Greece sold three-month treasury bills at a yield of 4.34
percent, up from 4.2 percent at the previous auction on April
17, the Public Debt Management Agency said. Investors bid for
2.32 times the securities offered, the agency said.  Italy’s two-year note yield jumped for the third day,
gaining 21 basis points to 3.51 percent, the highest since May
3, with the 10-year yield increasing 17 basis points to 5.87
percent, the most since Feb. 16. Five-year note yields surged
above 5 percent for the first time since Jan. 31, advancing 22
basis points to 5.01 percent.  German GDP  German GDP rose 0.5 percent in the first quarter after
falling 0.2 percent in the previous three months, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted a 0.1 percent gain.  The data “reinforces the story of a two-speed economy,
where  Germany  operates at one level and everyone else operates
at another,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist
at Rabobank International in London.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by Greece, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  The Irish 5 percent bond due October 2020 fell for a second
day, pushing the yield up 40 basis points to 7.42 percent, the
highest level since Jan. 25, according to Bloomberg data.  Germany plans to sell an additional 5 billion euros of its
benchmark 10-year bund tomorrow.  France  is scheduled to auction
notes maturing between 2014 and 2017, as well as inflation-
linked securities due between 2022 and 2027.  ‘Bunds Are Bullish’  German 10-year bund futures may advance as much as 0.6
percent should they remain above a key level of support, UBS AG
said, citing trading patterns.  The contracts may climb to 144.04, according to  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy in London,
citing Fibonacci analysis.  The bund futures contract expiring in June fell 0.2 percent
to 143.29. It climbed to a record 143.69 yesterday. Support
refers to an area on a chart where analysts expect orders to buy
a security to be grouped. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching certain highs or lows.  German debt has returned 2.7 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds gained 8.8 percent,
and Spanish securities lost 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
