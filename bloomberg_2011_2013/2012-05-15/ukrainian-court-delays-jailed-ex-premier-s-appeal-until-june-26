A Ukrainian court delayed hearing
opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko ’s appeal against her prison
sentence, prompting her lawyer to say he’d turn to the  European
Court  of Human Rights.  The court, based in the capital, Kiev, will reconvene June
26 because Tymoshenko, who’s hospitalized with back pain, should
attend the hearing in person, prosecutor Oksana Drogobytska said
on private TV  Channel 5 .  “Clearly, they’re dragging their feet,” Sergiy Vlasenko,
a lawyer for Tymoshenko, said today in a statement on her
website. “We consider today’s decision final and will appeal to
the European Court for Human Rights.”  Tymoshenko was handed a seven-year prison sentence in
October after a court ruled she overstepped her authority as
prime minister when signing a 2009 natural-gas pact with  Russia .
She says the case was engineered by President  Viktor Yanukovych 
to silence opposition before parliamentary elections in October.
The European Union, the U.S, and Russian have condemned her
conviction.  Officials such as European Commission President Jose Manuel
Barroso have pledged to skip Euro 2012 soccer matches in Ukraine
in protest at Tymoshenko’s imprisonment. The final of the
tournament, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland, will take
place in Kiev on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
