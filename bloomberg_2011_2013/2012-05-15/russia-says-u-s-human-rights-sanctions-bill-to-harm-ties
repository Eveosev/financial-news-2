Russia  warned that a U.S. bill
imposing sanctions against Russian officials suspected of human-
rights abuses will harm relations between the two countries.  Such a law would be “a gross interference in Russian
internal affairs and, of course, it won’t have any positive
effect on U.S.-Russian ties, to put it mildly,” Konstantin Dolgov, the Foreign Ministry’s human-rights representative, told
reporters in Moscow today.  A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers has proposed
legislation that would impose travel and financial restrictions
on any official abusing human rights in Russia, including 60
people suspected of involvement in the death of anti-corruption
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail in 2009.  Russia’s Foreign Ministry last month warned it would
retaliate with unspecified measures against the law. The State
Department has said there is “a desire and an interest to make
this a matter of law” in Congress and that the Obama
administration is discussing the issue as it seeks lawmakers’
support to repeal a 1974 law that restricted trade with the
former  Soviet Union .  The so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment’s continued existence
will penalize U.S. companies doing business in Russia after it
joins the  World Trade Organization  later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
