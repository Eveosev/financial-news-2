Greenlight Capital Inc., the hedge-
fund manager run by  David Einhorn , exited its stake in  Yahoo!
Inc. (YHOO)  during the first quarter while opening new positions in
 Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  and Expedia Inc.  The New York-based fund also sold 7.68 million  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  shares, cutting its stake to 7.49 million, according to a
filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
stock has surged 25 percent since May 25, 2011, when Einhorn
called for Microsoft’s board to replace Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer.  Greenlight sold 3.02 million Yahoo shares during the first
quarter, according to the filing. Chief Executive Officer Scott Thompson resigned this week after failing to correct errors in
his credentials.  Einhorn’s firm purchased 2.4 million Computer Sciences
shares during the first quarter, 1 million Expedia shares and
almost 562,000 shares of grocery-store chain  Roundy’s Inc. (RNDY)  The
fund didn’t own shares of those companies at the end of the
fourth quarter, according to a filing in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
