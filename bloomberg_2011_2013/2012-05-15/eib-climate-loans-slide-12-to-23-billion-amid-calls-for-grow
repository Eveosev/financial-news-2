The European Union’s finance arm said
lending to climate projects fell 12 percent to 18 billion euros
($23 billion) in 2011 and it’s up to member states to decide how
to respond to recent calls for the lender to expand business.  “I can hear many voices calling on us to expand the level
of our operations at this difficult time for nearly every member
of the EU,” Werner Hoyer, the head of the  European Investment
Bank , said today in an e-mailed statement.  The EIB helps finance projects such as offshore wind farms,
contributing to an EU target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions
by a fifth in 2020 compared with 1990 levels. The 2011 lending,
accounting for about a third of total EIB loans, compares with a
record  20.5 billion euros  in the previous 12 months.  The bank had “no choice but to gradually reduce” loans to
protect its ability to borrow and lend on favorable terms at its
current capitalization level, Hoyer told EU finance ministers in
Brussels today. It was up to the bank’s shareholders, the 27
member states of the EU, to decide how to “make best use” of
the EIB if it’s to increase lending in the region, he said.  The bank also reduced loan volumes after “extraordinary
signature activity” in 2009 and 2010 as it contributed to the
European Economic Recovery Plan, Hoyer said.  “The EIB’s commitment to support investment for climate
action projects within overall lending for different sectors
remains strong,” Richard Willis, a bank spokesman, said today
by e-mail. “This rose to represent 30 percent of total lending
in 2011. However, as overall lending levels decreased there was
a slight reduction in absolute lending for such projects.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
