Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell as talks to form a new government in Greece failed,
increasing concern the country will be forced to leave the
single European currency and derail efforts to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest
consumer electronics exporter that gets a fifth of its sales in
Europe, fell 1.1 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316)  and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., the three biggest
banks in Japan, may be active after forecasting profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as lending rebounds. ADRs of BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company, declined 2.3
percent as metals prices dropped.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 8,845 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,910 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,860 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid
0.2 percent in Wellington.  “As the pressure builds in Europe, you need to see another
mini crisis before policy makers will step in, and we’re not
there yet,” said Andrew Pease, Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages about $150 billion. “Markets and economies
in Asia are at the mercy of the export story.”  Second Election  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has fallen for the past five
trading days amid concern a political impasse in Greece will
destabilize austerity plans in Europe. Greek leaders said a
second election will be held after political gridlock left the
nation without a government since elections on May 6. Greeks
have withdrawn as much as 700 million euros ($893 million) from
the nation’s banks, President Karolos Papoulias told party
leaders.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Francois Hollande said they would consider measures to spur
economic growth in Greece as long as voters there committed to
the austerity demanded to stay in the euro.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The index slid 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday, a third
day of declines.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 5.8 percent gain by the S&P
500 and a 0.5 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 12.7 for the
S&P 500 and 10.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. extended its nine-day slump to 9.2
percent, closing at 95.24.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum slid 0.6 percent
