The number of Americans driving
during the Memorial Day holiday weekend will rise 1.2 percent
from a year earlier, according to a forecast by the  American
Automobile Association .  Approximately 30.7 million Americans plan to drive to their
destinations, up from 30.3 million who drove last year,
according to AAA, the biggest U.S. motoring organization. The
number of air travelers will fall 5.5 percent to 2.5 million
from 2.7 million in 2011.  Overall, about 34.8 million Americans will travel 50 miles
or more from home during the four-day weekend culminating in the
May 28 holiday, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said. Thatâ€™s a 1.2
percent increase from 34.3 million a year ago.  Memorial Day marks the traditional beginning of the summer
travel season and the peak period for gasoline use. This year,
the holiday falls a day earlier than in 2011. Weekend holiday
travel tends to be more robust when the holiday falls later in
the month, AAA has said.  The average distance traveled will be 642 miles, down from
792 in 2011. Median spending will rise to $702 from $692 last
year, AAA said.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.727 a gallon yesterday. Prices are down 20.9
cents since reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4. Prices
peaked in 2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  The projections by AAA are based on research and forecasts
from IHS Global Insight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
