Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) , Chile’s largest retailer
by sales, reported an unexpected drop in first-quarter profit on
financial costs and the sale of a  put option  to UBS AG.  Net income fell to 54.4 billion pesos ($109 million) from
65.8 billion pesos a year ago, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 69.9 billion pesos.  “The fall in profits reflects higher non-operational
losses due to a rise in financial costs,” Cencosud said in the
statement. The company booked a non-recurring loss of 6.8
billion pesos related to the sale of a put option to UBS for a
stake in an Argentine unit.  Sales rose 25 percent to 2.16 trillion pesos, while
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
increased 7 percent from a year earlier to 156 billion pesos.
The average analyst forecast for Ebitda was 161 billion pesos.  Cencosud operates supermarkets, shopping malls, department
stores and home improvement stores in Chile, Argentina,  Brazil ,
 Peru  and Colombia.  The company plans to sell by the end of June as many as 270
billion new shares in Santiago and  New York . Cencosud hasn’t
decided how many shares it will sell in each country or hired
investment banks, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Rodriguez told
reporters today. Proceeds may fund three years of expansions and
won’t be used to repay debt, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
