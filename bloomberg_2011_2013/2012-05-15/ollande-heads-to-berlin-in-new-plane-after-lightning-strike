French President  Francois Hollande 
made two attempts at his first official visit to Berlin after
his plane was struck by lightning, forcing him to turn back.  Hollande returned to Paris to change planes after the
strike. He landed in Berlin at about 7:10 p.m., arriving at the
offices of  Chancellor Angela Merkel  about 20 minutes later, an
Elysee press officer said.  The trip is Hollandeâ€™s first since being sworn in as
president earlier today and came as the governments of the two
largest euro countries grappled with the prospect of new
elections in Greece. Greek President Karolos Papoulias  failed
to broker a governing coalition following an inconclusive May 6
vote, raising concern it may exit the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
