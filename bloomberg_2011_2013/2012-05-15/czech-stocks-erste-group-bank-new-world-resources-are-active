The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
dropped for a fourth day to a five-month low, trading down 1.1
percent at 866.60 by 12:32 p.m. in Prague.  The following are among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  fell for a fourth
day to a four-month low, sliding 1.2 percent to 366.60 koruna.
Lenders were among the biggest stock decliners as Greece’s
failure to form a government drove investors from  Europe .  New World Resources Plc (NWR)   dropped for a fourth day
to its lowest in almost three years as commodities declined,
overshadowing the Czech coking-coal producer’s unexpected first-
quarter profit. The stock slid 2.5 percent to 109.7 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
