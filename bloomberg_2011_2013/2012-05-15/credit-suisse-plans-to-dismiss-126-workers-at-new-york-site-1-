Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
biggest Swiss bank, told New York state regulators it will
eliminate 126 jobs in  Manhattan  over the coming months.  The dismissals affect offices at 1 Madison Ave. and 11
Madison Ave. and will extend through Aug. 6, the bank wrote in a
Department of Labor filing. The firm decided last year to scale
down its investment bank and said it would cut 3,500 jobs.  Financial companies, mainly in Western Europe and the U.S.,
disclosed plans last year to eliminate more than 200,000
positions as they adapt to  capital requirements  and prolonged
economic weakness. Jack Grone, a spokesman for Zurich-based
Credit Suisse, declined to comment beyond the filing.  The firm said last month that first-quarter  profit  plunged
96 percent to 44 million Swiss francs ($47 million) after it
booked accounting charges related to its own debt and costs for
2011 bonuses. The company said at the time it was on track to
save about 2 billion francs in annual costs by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
