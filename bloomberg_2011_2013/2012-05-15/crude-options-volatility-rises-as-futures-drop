Crude-oil options volatility rose as
the underlying futures dropped to the lowest level in almost
five months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.8 percent at 3:45 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 28.7 yesterday. Volatility has
increased from below 21 percent on April 27 as futures prices
have dropped $10.95 a barrel.  “Crude came off kind of orderly,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York . “It was a
slow decline all day.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell 80 cents to settle at
$93.98 a barrel on the Nymex. It was the lowest close since Dec.
19 and third consecutive decline.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $90 puts, which rose 8 cents to 20 cents a barrel at
4:25 p.m. with 4,662 lots trading. June $95 calls were the
second-most active options with 2,246 lots changing hands as
they fell 72 cents to 32 cents.  Calls accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 53 percent of the 167,669 trades
in the previous session. June $90 puts were the most actively
traded, with 8,094 lots changing hands. They rose 5 cents to 12
cents a barrel. The next-most active options, September $70
puts, added 7 cents to 40 cents on volume of 8,064.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 39,166
contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 36,633 lots and
December $150 calls with 36,056.  To contact the reporters on this story:
