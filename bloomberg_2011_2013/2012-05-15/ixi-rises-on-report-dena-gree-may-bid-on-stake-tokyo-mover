Mixi Inc. (2121)  rose the most in nine
months in Tokyo trading after Nikkei Business said  DeNA Co. (2432)  and
 Gree Inc. (3632) ,  Japan ’s two biggest social game companies, will
probably be among bidders for a stake in the social network.  Mixi gained as much as 11 percent, the most since Aug. 17,
to 175,000 yen and traded at 165,800 yen at the 11:30 a.m. break
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. President Kenji Kasahara is seeking
to sell his 55 percent stake, Nikkei Business magazine reported,
citing an unidentified financial-industry official. The report
“isn’t factual,” Mixi said in a statement on its website.  Mixi, which pioneered social networking on the Web in
Japan, has lost about 92 percent of its market value since
December 2007 as competitors  Facebook Inc. (FB) , DeNA and Gree, which
also offer games on their sites, lured away customers. Mixi
expanded its partnership with Twitter Inc. in November to add
more services.  “There are hopes among some investors that Mixi may get a
premium when it’s sold,” said Mitsuo Shimizu, a market analyst
at Tokyo-based Iwai Cosmo Securities Co.  Tomoyuki Akiyama, a spokesman for DeNA, and Shinichi
Iriyama, a spokesman for Gree, also denied the Nikkei report in
phone interviews.  DeNA dropped 4.6 percent and Gree lost 5.4 percent.  Kasahara, Mixi’s founder, plans to sell part of his stake
at first and the rest later, according to the Nikkei report
carried on its website.  Facebook had 13.5 million unique users in Japan in
February, up from 6 million a year earlier, according to data
from Nielsen. That put the  Menlo Park , California-based company
ahead of Twitter and Mixi in Japan for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
