Chinese banks are filling a gap in
shipping-industry lending left by European counterparts,
underpinning a 7.3 percent expansion in credit to the global
industry in 2011’s final quarter, the country’s ambassador to
the U.K. said.  Following are comments made by Liu Xiaoming at a conference
in  London  today.  China  needs to learn from other countries that
offer ship finance in areas including risk control and credit
management, Liu said.  “Chinese banks have adequate funds to provide support for
foreign owners who want to build ships in China, given the large
number of ships built in China every year.  “There’s great potential in further raising China’s status
in international markets of ship finance.  “Shipping finance in China is still at early, early stages
of development, and compared with  Europe , China is far behind
London and other world shipping centers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
