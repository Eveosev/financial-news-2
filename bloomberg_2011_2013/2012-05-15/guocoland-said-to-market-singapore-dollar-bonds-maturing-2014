GuocoLand Ltd. (GUOL)  is seeking to sell as
much as S$100 million of bonds due in November 2014, according
to a person familiar with the matter.  Standard Chartered Plc is managing the offering of the notes,
which may yield about 4 percent, the person said, asking not to
be named as the details are private.  GuocoLand spokesman Bruce Lee wasnâ€™t immediately able to
comment when called at his office in  Singapore  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
