Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s Pasadena,
Texas, refinery’s fluid catalytic cracker is back in service
after it was shut down over the weekend following a  power
failure .  Customer commitments weren’t affected, Sophie Gates, a
Houston-based spokeswoman for the refinery, said in an e-mailed
statement.  A loss of power May 12 forced the plant to shut down two
boilers, the company said in a May 13 filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  The plant has a capacity of 106,500 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
