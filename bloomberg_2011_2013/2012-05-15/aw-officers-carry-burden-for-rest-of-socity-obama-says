President  Barack Obama  honored the
nation’s law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty,
saying everybody who wears the badge carries a unique burden.  “Even in the face of tragedy, I know that so many of you
will return home and continue to do what you have always done,”
Obama said at the 31st annual National Peace Officers Memorial
Service in Washington. “You carry these burdens so the rest of
us don’t have to.”  There were 173 local, state and federal law enforcement
officers killed in the line of duty in 2011, according to the
National Law Enforcement officers Memorial Fund. That is a 13
percent increase over 2010. Through today, there were 40
fatalities among officers in 2012, according to the
organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
