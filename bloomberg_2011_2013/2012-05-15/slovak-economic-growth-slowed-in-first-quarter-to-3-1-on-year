Slovak economic  growth  slowed in the
first quarter to 3.1 percent from from a year earlier as the
euro regionâ€™s debt crisis damped demand.  The result compares with a 3.4 percent rise in the previous
period and an average estimate by three economists in a
Bloomberg survey for a 2.8 percent expansion. On a quarterly
basis, gross domestic product advanced a seasonally adjusted 0.8
percent, the same pace as in the previous three months, the
Slovak Statistical Office in Bratislava said on its  website 
today.  The economy in the east European country, which adopted the
euro in 2009, is slowing as the lingering debt crisis in the
region cuts demand for exports. The European Commission on May
11 predicted GDP to growth 1.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
