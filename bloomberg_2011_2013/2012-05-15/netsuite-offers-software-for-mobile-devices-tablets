NetSuite Inc. (N) , the software maker
majority-owned by  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s Larry Ellison, is adding to its
lineup of online applications with software enabling companies
to manage consumer transactions from websites and mobile
devices.  The software, which will be delivered to customers over the
Internet, includes components for managing e-commerce
merchandising and loyalty programs and can be used on tablets,
including Apple Inc.’s iPad, the San Mateo, California-based
company said in a statement.  “The devices workers are using now and expect their
companies to support are myriad,” said Chief Executive Officer
Zach Nelson in an interview, who will be demonstrating the new
product, named SuiteCommerce, during a speech at the company’s
annual customer  conference  in San Francisco today.  NetSuite is trying to expand in the crowded market for
online business applications against companies including
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) ,  SAP AG (SAP) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and Oracle. Many e-
commerce programs are designed for online shopping and don’t
take tablet computers and smartphones into account, Nelson said.  Square Inc., the mobile payments company, plans to use the
application to send data from merchants’ credit-card
transactions to NetSuite’s financial applications, NetSuite said
in a separate statement. Merchants will be able to use Square’s
Register product to capture purchases on an iPad and then send
the data to NetSuite.  SuiteCommerce will work with devices running Apple’s iOS
and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, Nelson said.  Shares of NetSuite rose 1.5 percent to $43.26 in New York
yesterday. The stock gained 6.7 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
