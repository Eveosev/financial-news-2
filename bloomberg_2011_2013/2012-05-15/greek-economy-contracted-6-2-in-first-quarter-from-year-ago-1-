Greece ’s economy shrank in the first
three months of 2012, the  13th contraction  in the past 14
quarters as policy makers struggled to stay in the euro.  Gross domestic product dropped 6.2 percent from a year
earlier in the first quarter after contracting 7.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2011, the Athens-based Hellenic
Statistical Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. The
figure is based on non-seasonally adjusted data. The agency
didn’t provide a seasonally adjusted figure.  The European Commission forecasts Greece’s economy will
contract 4.7 percent this year, its fifth year of a recession
compounded by spending cuts and tax increases demanded as a
condition for a rescue.  Greece has been in a political impasse since inconclusive
May 6 elections left party leaders unable to form a government.
The deadlock has raised the possibility of another vote to be
held as early as next month, and also raised doubts that Greece
can avoid an exit from the euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
