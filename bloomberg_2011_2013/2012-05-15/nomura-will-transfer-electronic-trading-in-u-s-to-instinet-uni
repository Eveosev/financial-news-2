Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s largest
brokerage, will use its New York-based Instinet Inc. unit as its
main electronic trading arm.  The broker will transfer electronic trading in the U.S. to
Instinet, an operator of alternative platforms, according to two
people who have been briefed on the decision and declined to be
named because the information isn’t public. The Japan branch of
Instinet will be closed and folded into Nomura’s local trading
operation, the people said. The  Hong Kong , Singapore and Sydney
offices remain open while no decision has been made in regards
to  Europe , they said.  “Nomura is fully committed to Instinet and its agency
trading model, and is working toward a goal of Instinet becoming
the Nomura Group’s electronic trading arm,” the parent company
said in a statement.  Nomura bought Instinet for $1.2 billion in cash from  Silver
Lake Partners  in February 2007 as part of a global expansion
strategy. Instinet co-owns alternative trading platform company
Chi-X Global Holdings Inc. with several brokers including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and Bank of America Corp.  Nomura appointed Joji Watanabe, currently head of its
Instinet Japan Ltd. unit, to lead trading execution services in
the country, Nomura said in a statement today. Watanabe will
stay in charge of Instinet Japan as it winds down.  The Japanese brokerage’s shares have risen 21 percent since
hitting their lowest price in at least 37 years in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
