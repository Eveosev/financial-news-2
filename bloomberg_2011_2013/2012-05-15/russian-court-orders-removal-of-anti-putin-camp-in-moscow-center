A Moscow court ordered police to
remove a round-the-clock protest camp in the center of the
Russian capital that was set up after President  Vladimir Putin ’s
inauguration for a third term in the Kremlin.  “The ruling is to be implemented immediately,” a
Basmannyi district court spokeswoman said by phone, declining to
be identified in line with court policy.  Police detained hundreds of people on May 6 after clashes
between riot officers and demonstrators who gathered in their
thousands to rally against Putin 24 hours before his
inauguration. More arrests ensued in the following three days as
protesters held a series of unauthorized gatherings.  The encampment near the Chistye Prudy metro station is
modeled after the Occupy Movement protests. Putin’s spokesman,
 Dmitry Peskov , has called for police to disperse the
demonstrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
