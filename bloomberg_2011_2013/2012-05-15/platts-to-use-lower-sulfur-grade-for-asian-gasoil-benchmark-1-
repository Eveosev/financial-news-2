Platts, the publisher of data used to
price everything from Singapore fuel oil cargoes to Asian crude
oil purchases, plans to use a gasoil grade with lower sulfur
content as the benchmark for  Asia  from next year.  The company will change its benchmark to the grade
containing 500 parts per million of sulfur from Jan. 2, 2013,
replacing gasoil with 5,000 parts per million used currently,
the company said in an e-mailed statement. The unit of  McGraw-
Hill Cos. (MHP)  recommends that market participants use a one-time
differential of $1.70 a barrel to amend price contracts when the
change takes place, it said.  “The lower sulfur specifications reflect changing supply
and demand trends across the regions,” the company said. “We
will no longer publish any value for gasoil containing 5,000
parts per million of sulfur in Asia after that date.”  Platts told a forum of traders in  London  on Feb. 20 that it
was considering the assessment change to Singapore gasoil.
Companies and exchanges such as  CME Group Inc. (CME)  are also amending
sulfur specifications in fuel contracts from 2013 to meet
changes in environmental regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
