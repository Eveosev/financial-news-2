Stocks fell as talks to form a new
Greek government failed and concern grew about the stability of
the nation’s banks, while the Dollar Index extended its longest
rally ever as the euro slid to a four-month low.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.6 percent to close
at a three-month low of 1,330.66 at 4 p.m. in New York. The
 Dollar Index, (DXY)  a gauge of the currency against six major peers,
rose for the 12th straight day. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index
closed at the lowest level of the year and oil slumped to a
five-month low. Ten-year Treasury yields were little changed at
1.77 percent while Spanish and Italian 10-year yields rose at
least 12 basis points.  U.S. equities extended losses in the final hour of trading
as concern about  Greece  overshadowed data showing New York-area
manufacturing grew more than forecast. Leaders said a second
election will be held after political gridlock left Greece
without a government since elections on May 6. Greeks have
withdrawn as much as 700 million euros ($893 million) from the
nation’s banks, President Karolos Papoulias told party leaders
yesterday, according to transcripts released today.  “The politics in Greece is very frustrating for the
market,”  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital
Management in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47
billion, said in a telephone interview. “While the overall
economic data in the U.S. was mixed to positive, the risk
related to Greece remains a concern on the minds of investors.”  Economic Data  The  New York  Fed’s general economic gauge, known as the
Empire manufacturing index, increased to 17.09 this month from
6.6 in April, topping the median economist estimate for a
reading of 9. Gross domestic product in Germany, Europe’s
largest economy, rose 0.5 percent from the fourth quarter,
compared to a 0.1 percent gain forecast by economists, while
growth in the euro area stagnated, reports showed today.  Gauges of energy and raw-material producers slumped 1.5
percent and industrial shares slipped 0.6 percent to lead
declines among all 10 of the main industry groups in the  S&P
500 . Home Depot Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  lost
more than 2.3 percent for the biggest declines in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average ,  which slipped 63.35 points to 12,632.00 for
its lowest close since Jan. 19.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. rebounded 1.3 percent after falling 12
percent in the previous two sessions, its biggest drop in three
years. Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  told shareholders at
the company’s annual meeting that he sees no reason the bank’s
dividend would be affected following a $2 billion trading loss
disclosed last week. The  Department of Justice  and the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  have begun a criminal probe of the loss,
a person familiar with the matter said.  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  rose 3.7 percet, trimming a rally of as much
as 27 percent, after the largest daily-deal website reported
first-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  Homebuilders Rally  A measure of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes climbed 2.2
percent. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
index of builder confidence rose to 29, the highest since May
2007. The gauge exceeded the highest projection in a Bloomberg
News survey in which the median estimate was 26. Lennar Corp.
and D.R. Horton Inc. rose more than 2.5 percent each to pace
gains.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  boosted the price range on its initial public
offering to seek as much as $12.8 billion. The new range is $34
to $38 a share, a regulatory filing today shows, implying a
market value of as much as $104.2 billion.  The S&P 500 today extended its drop from a  four-year  high
in April to 6.2 percent. The index took longer than usual to
fall 5 percent from its peak this year, a sign that any further
retreat in U.S. stocks will be “contained,” according to  Sam
Stovall  of S&P.  Retreat From Peak  The benchmark gauge reached the threshold yesterday after
spending 28 days without losing 5 percent from its April high.
Since 1950, it has taken an average 19 days to fall 5 percent,
based on a study by Stovall, S&P’s chief equity strategist.
Among those that took  28 days  or longer to occur, only 25
percent turned into corrections, or retreats of more than 10
percent, the data show. Stovall said in an e-mail that he views
losses of less than 5 percent as “noise” and declines between
5 percent and 10 percent as pullbacks.  The euro weakened 0.8 percent to a four-month low of
$1.2727. The shared currency fell against 12 of 16 major peers,
while the dollar increased against 15 of 16. The Dollar Index
climbed 0.8 percent to 81.272, the highest level since January,
as the gauge extended the longest stretch of daily gains since
its inception in 1973.  Commodities  Natural gas rallied 3.6 percent and corn and wheat climbed
at least 1.7 percent to lead gains in 16 of 24 commodities
tracked by the S&P GSCI Index, while declines in oil and gold
left the gauge little changed.  Oil futures dropped 0.8 percent to $93.98 a barrel before a
government report tomorrow that is forecast to show U.S. crude
supplies climbed to the highest level since 1990.  Gold futures for June delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,557.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices
earlier slid to $1,546.80, the lowest since Dec. 30.  Gauges of commodity companies and banks fell more than 1.7
percent to lead declines among 16 of 19 industry groups in the
 Stoxx 600. (SXXP)  Spain’s IBEX 35 Index sank 1.6 percent to an almost
nine-year low and Italy’s benchmark index slid to the lowest
since March 2009. Greece’s ASE Index slid 3.6 percent to the
lowest level since November 1992.  Greece Election  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  called Greece’s
decision to hold a second election a referendum on whether the
country stays in the euro. Post-election attempts to form a
ruling coalition in Athens broke down today after nine days,
sending Greeks back to the polls next month with surveys giving
the lead to an anti-bailout party that would tear up the
conditions attached to 240 billion euros ($307 billion) of aid.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  lost 0.6 percent as
Brazil’s Bovespa index sank 2.3 percent. India’s Sensex Index
rose 0.7 percent and the Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of
mainland stocks jumped 1 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index
slipped 0.3 percent after a report showed foreign direct
investment dropped. The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  sank 2.1
percent on concern a territorial dispute with China will
escalate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
