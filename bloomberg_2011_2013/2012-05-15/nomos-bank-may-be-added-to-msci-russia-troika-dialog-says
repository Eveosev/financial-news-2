Nomos Bank, the lender part-owned by
Russian billionaire  Alexander Nesis , which listed shares in
London and Moscow in April 2011, may be added to the  MSCI Russia
Index (MXRU)  tomorrow, according to Troika Dialog.  MSCI is due to post the results of its semi-annual index
rebalancing on its website after 1 a.m. Moscow time on May 16.
OAO Phosagro, a Russian fertilizer producer, which listed shares
in London and Moscow in July 2011, may be another candidate for
the MSCI Russia index, according to Troika.  “MSCI may add one of the Russian companies that recently
listed shares, and Phosagro and Nomos match the preferred
capitalization,”  Ovanes Oganisian , strategist at Troika Dialog
in Moscow, said by phone. “We have a feeling that one of these
shares will be added, most likely Nomos, as its free float
matches the MSCI criteria.”  Nomos shares were little changed at 730.60 rubles as of
6:06 p.m. in Moscow, while Phosagro declined 1 percent to 835
rubles, headed for its lowest level since Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
