The  Oklahoma City  Thunder showed no
ill effects from an eight-day postseason layoff, routing the Los
Angeles Lakers 119-90 in the opening game of their National
Basketball Association second-round series.  The Philadelphia 76ers beat the Boston Celtics 82-81 in
yesterday’s early NBA playoff game to tie their Eastern
Conference series at one game apiece.  The Thunder, who completed a four-game first-round sweep of
Dallas on May 5, raced to a 59-44 halftime lead against the
Lakers, who two days before had fought past the Denver Nuggets
in a decisive seventh game. The home team’s advantage swelled to
as many as 35 points during the second half last night.  “We just tried to come out aggressive,” said  Russell Westbrook , who had 27 points, nine assists and seven rebounds
for the Thunder. “We hadn’t played in a while and I had some
good legs underneath me.”  Oklahoma City’s  Kevin Durant , the runner-up to Miami’s
LeBron James for the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award, had 25
points and  James Harden  finished with 17 points off the bench.  The Thunder, who had only four turnovers and shot 53
percent from the field, also will host Game 2 of the best-of-
seven Western Conference series tomorrow.  The NBA playoffs continue with a pair of games tonight. The
Miami Heat host the  Indiana Pacers  after winning Game 1 of their
Eastern Conference series, and the  San Antonio Spurs  are home to
the  Los Angeles Clippers  in the opening game of their series in
the West.  Kobe Bryant  and Andrew Bynum scored 20 points to lead the
Lakers. Metta World Peace, suspended for the first six playoff
games after an elbow to the head of Oklahoma City’s Harden on
April 22, added 12 in his second game back since the ban ended.  Philadelphia Evens Series  In Boston, Jrue Holiday scored 18 points for Philadelphia,
while Andre Iguodala had 13 and Evan Turner added 10, including
a driving layup with 40.4 seconds left to put the 76ers ahead
for good.  It was the first postseason win in Boston since 1982 for
the 76ers, who blew a 10-point fourth-quarter lead in Game 1.  “We’re growing,” the 21-year-old Holiday said. “We have
a young team and I can’t preach enough on our vets for really
just taking us under their wings and keeping us focused.”  The best-of-seven series now moves to Philadelphia for the
next two games, including Game 3 tomorrow.  The Celtics came back to win the series opener 92-91 on May
12 and erased an eight-point deficit in the final quarter last
night, taking a 72-71 lead with 2:20 left. It was one of four
lead changes in the closing minutes.  Late Free Throws  After Turner’s driving scoop shot put Philadelphia back
ahead 76-75, the 76ers hit six straight free throws in the final
12 seconds to withstand a pair of late 3-pointers by the Celtics,
including one by  Kevin Garnett  at the buzzer.  “Our young guys keep growing and they’re really becoming
men,” 76ers coach Doug Collins said at a news conference. “I’m
so proud of them. You play a game like this, it’s worth like 10
regular-season games of experience.”  Ray Allen had 17 points to lead  Boston , while Garnett
finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
