Belarus has no plans to sell a
controlling stake in state-run fertilizer producer Belaruskali,
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko said.  “Nobody should give up Belaruskali, it would be a crime,”
Semashko told reporters today in the capital city of Minsk.  President  Aleksandr Lukashenko  said last week that the
government is prepared to sell a stake in the company that’s
worth as much as $32 billion in its entirety.  China , India,
Russia and two western companies are competing for a
shareholding in Belaruskali which produces 15 percent of the
world’s potash, he said in October.  Belaruskali is set to repay a $1 billion loan from OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, and the Eurasian Development
Bank ahead of schedule to avoid paying a higher  interest rate ,
Semashko said.  The company’s improved finances and a more stable economy
will allow Belaruskali to allocate funds to repay the debt six
months early, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
