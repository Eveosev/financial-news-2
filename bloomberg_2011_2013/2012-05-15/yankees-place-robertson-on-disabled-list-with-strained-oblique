The New York Yankees placed relief
pitcher  David Robertson  on the 15-day disabled list with a
strained oblique muscle, further depleting the team’s bullpen
after the knee injury sustained by  Mariano Rivera .  Robertson got the Yankees’ first two save opportunities
after Rivera, Major League Baseball’s career leader with 608
saves, tore his right anterior cruciate ligament catching fly
balls before a game on May 3.  An All-Star last season, Robertson didn’t pitch in the
Yankees’ past three games because of soreness in his rib cage.
Rafael Soriano closed out last night’s 8-5 win in Baltimore,
recording his second save in the past five games.  Robertson, a 27-year-old right-hander, has a 0-1 record
with a 2.51 earned run average and 24 strikeouts in 14 1/3
innings this season. He was 4-0 with a 1.08 ERA in 70 relief
appearances in 2011, with 100 strikeouts in 66 2/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
