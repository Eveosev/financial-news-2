Global poultry prices may “remain
strong” in the next two quarters as world meat demand increases
and supplies decrease in the U.S. and Brazil, Rabobank
International said.  Beef prices that climbed to a record this year will support
poultry, Rabobank analysts including David Nelson said in a
report e-mailed today. U.S. wholesale choice  beef  prices climbed
to $1.988 a pound on Feb. 29, the highest since at least January
2004, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Brazil, the world’s biggest chicken-meat shipper, is
cutting output after a strengthening real reduced demand for its
exports, and U.S. chicken breast inventories are 13 percent
smaller than last year, according to the Rabobank report.  Europe ’s poultry industry should benefit from rising
exports to Asia, Africa and the  Middle East , while the U.K. and
Germany may have excess supplies, Rabobank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
