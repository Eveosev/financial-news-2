John Doyle , the chief executive
officer of American International Group Inc.’s Chartis Global
Commercial Insurance unit, said low interest rates are
contributing to higher prices for some coverage.  “I don’t think much has changed in the supply-demand
balance, or maybe imbalance at the moment, around the world, and
yet prices are up,” Doyle said at the Goldman Sachs Insurance
Symposium in New York today. “What did change in that period of
time was that the Fed did come out and say that interest rates
are going to be low for an extended period of time. I do think
that’s a factor in the market.”  Editor: Dan Kraut  To contact the reporter on this story:
