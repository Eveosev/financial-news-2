Santiago’s appeals court has fined
Andres Bello University, which is affiliated with Baltimore-
based Laureate Education Inc., for alleged violations of  Chile ’s
consumer protection law, the judiciary said in a  statement 
posted on its website today.  Andres Bello must pay 1.98 million pesos ($3,970) after
being accused of overcharging a student for a class, according
to court filings e-mailed by the judiciary press office. The
court ruled that some clauses in student contracts with the
university are “abusive,” the judiciary said in the statement.  Laureate’s corporate communications office didn’t
immediately respond to a voice message and e-mail from Bloomberg
News seeking comment. The ruling is filed under docket number
1905-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
