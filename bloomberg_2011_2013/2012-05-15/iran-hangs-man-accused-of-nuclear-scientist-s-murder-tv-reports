Iran  today executed a man it
sentenced to death for the 2010 murder of an Iranian nuclear
scientist,  state television  reported.  Majid Jamali Fashi, who was accused of being a spy for
Israel’s intelligence agency, was hanged early today, according
to a report published on the television’s website. Jamali Fashi
was sentenced to death after being convicted in a Tehran court
on August 23 of receiving training from Mossad to carry out the
assasination of Massoud Ali-Mohammadi, the report said.  Ali-Mohammadi was killed after a bomb planted on a
motorcycle in front of his house in northern Tehran was set off.
At least four nuclear scientists have been targeted in recent
years in similar operations, which Iranian officials say are led
by  Israel  and the U.S. to sabotage the country’s nuclear
program.  Iran is at odds with the U.S. and its allies over its
nuclear program, which they accuse of being a cover for
developing bombs, an allegation the Persian Gulf country
rejects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
