The price of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make most solar panels, dropped 2.6 percent
last week, adding to almost three months of continuous declines,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The materialâ€™s average spot price was $23.17 per kilogram
last week compared with $23.78 a week earlier, a survey by the
London-based research group showed today. The price, which
tumbled by two-thirds during 2011 on oversupply issues, is down
about 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
