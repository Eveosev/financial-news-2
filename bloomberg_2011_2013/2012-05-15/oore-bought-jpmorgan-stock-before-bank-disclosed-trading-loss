Moore Capital Management LLC, the $15
billion hedge fund founded by Louis Moore Bacon, boosted its
stake in  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co. before shares of the bank plunged
because of a $2 billion trading loss.  The hedge fund, based in  New York , bought about 6 million
shares of JPMorgan in the first quarter and held a stake valued
at about $297.3 million, according to a filing today with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Moore owned 450,000
shares of the New York-based bank at the end of last year.  Shares of JPMorgan have fallen 12 percent through yesterday
since the company disclosed the trading loss on May 10. The
trades in synthetic credit derivatives led to the resignation of
senior managers and prompted Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
to say the investments were “flawed, complex, poorly reviewed,
poorly executed and poorly monitored.”  Moore also bought 6.8 million shares of San Francisco-based
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  valued at $233 million, according to the  SEC
filing . Shares of the biggest U.S. mortgage lender have risen 18
percent this year. Moore purchased 5.2 million shares of
Minneapolis-based  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  worth $163.2 million.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of the end of each
quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S.
exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
