Thailand ’s baht halted an eight-day
decline as Germany’s economy growth beat estimates, easing
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is deteriorating and weighing
on global growth. Bonds fell.  Gross domestic product in Europe’s largest economy rose 0.5
percent from the fourth quarter, compared with a 0.1 percent
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, figures showed today. The
baht earlier dropped to a three-month low as investors sought
the relative safety of the dollar amid concern that Greece will
exit the euro. Greek President Karolos Papoulias will try to
persuade party leaders today to accept his proposal for a unity
government after an inconclusive May 6 election.  “Given the sell-off in previous sessions, there could be
some rebound in risk assets should we hear any tiny bit of
progress in the European debt issue,”  Frances Cheung , a
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong , said in an e-
mailed response to questions by Bloomberg. “However, I doubt
any rally can be sustained.”  The baht advanced 0.1 percent to 31.33 per dollar as of
3:51 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 31.40 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 26. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange swings
used to price options, was little changed at 4.52 percent.  Global funds trimmed ownership of Thailand’s stocks by $179
million this month through yesterday, according to data from the
stock exchange.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.65 percent bonds due December
2021 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.83
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
