The Swiss competition authority
extended by a year provisional measures allowing  Swatch Group AG (UHR) 
to reduce supplies of watch parts to third parties, giving it
more time to complete an investigation into the matter.  The temporary measures will remain in force through 2013,
the competition body, known as  Comco , said today in an e-mailed
statement. The regulator said it won’t complete its
investigation before the middle of 2012, and acknowledged that
watch companies need to order parts several months in advance.  Swatch won provisional backing last year from the regulator
to cut deliveries to competitors, forcing many companies to find
other suppliers or invest in their own capacity. The owner of
the Omega brand has been required to supply movements to third
parties because of its dominant position. Swatch’s ETA unit is
estimated by analysts to make about two-thirds of the mechanical
movements used in Swiss watches. Swatch argues some ETA
movements being sold to wholesalers end up in fake watches.  Under the provisional measures, ETA can reduce deliveries
of movements, or the internal mechanism of a timepiece, to
watchmakers by 15 percent of 2010 levels and deliveries of
components that make up movements by 5 percent.  Swatch rose 1 percent to 388.90 Swiss francs as of 9:18
a.m. in Zurich trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
