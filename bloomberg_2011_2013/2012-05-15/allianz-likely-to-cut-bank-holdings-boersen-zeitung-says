Allianz SE (ALV)  is likely to reduce its
shareholdings in banks because of new regulations for insurance
companies that penalize firms holding stakes in lenders,
 Boersen-Zeitung  reported in a preview of a story that will run
tomorrow, citing Allianz Chief Financial Officer Oliver Baete.  Allianz has holdings in European lenders including
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) , UniCredit SpA,  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) ,  Banco
BPI SA (BPI)  and Zagrebacka Banka d.d., the German newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
