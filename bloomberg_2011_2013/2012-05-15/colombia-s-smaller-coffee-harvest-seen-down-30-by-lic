Coffee production for the smaller of
two annual crops in  Colombia , the world’s second-biggest grower
of arabica beans, may fall 30 percent this year as rains damage
trees, according to researcher F.O. Licht GmbH.  Output for the mid-crop will decline from 3.1 million bags
last year, the Ratzeburg, Germany-based company wrote in a
report dated today. Colombian growers usually harvest the main
crop from October to December. A smaller one, known as mitaca,
is normally collected from April to June. A bag of coffee weighs
60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “Continuing rains triggered by the La Nina weather
phenomenon are seen impacting the 2012 mitaca,” F.O. Licht said
in the report. “This would point toward 2012 output falling
short of the 7.8 million bags that the National Federation of
Coffee Growers expects.”  Total production for the year could be as low as 7 million
to 7.2 million bags, F.O. Licht said, citing estimates from
unidentified producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
