Tudor Investment Corp., the $11
billion hedge fund run by Paul Tudor Jones, bought shares of an
exchange-traded fund that tracks financial companies, and a
stake in  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co., during the first quarter.  Tudor purchased 8.66 million shares of the Financial Select
Sector SPDR Fund, making the ETF its biggest U.S. stock holding
as of March 31, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund bought 1.27 million
shares of JPMorgan, making the New York-based bank its second-
largest equity position.  JPMorgan surged 38 percent in the quarter and the Financial
Select ETF rose 22 percent as equities rallied. Shares of
JPMorgan have fallen 12 percent through yesterday since the
company disclosed a $2 billion trading loss on May 10 involving
synthetic  credit derivatives . Moore Capital Management LLC, the
hedge fund founded by Louis Moore Bacon, is among rivals that
also bought shares in JPMorgan earlier this year.  Tudor, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, also bought 238,000
shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF, according to the
filing, while selling its stakes in  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) , Apple
Inc. and Noble Energy Inc.  Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Tudor, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
