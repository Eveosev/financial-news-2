Azerbaijanâ€™s economy expanded 0.3
percent in the first four months from the same period a year
earlier, the State Statistics Committee said today.  The non-oil economy grew 9.5 percent, while the oil and gas
economy shrank 6.4 percent, the committee said on its website.  Inflation accelerated 2.7 percent from the beginning of the
year mostly on food prices, it said.  The Caspian Sea nation, which is the third largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , saw its economy all but
ground to a halt last year, growing only 0.1 percent after oil
production fell 10.17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
