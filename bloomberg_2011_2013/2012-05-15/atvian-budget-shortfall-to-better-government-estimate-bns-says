Latviaâ€™s budget deficit will narrow
more than the government estimated this year, reaching 2.1
percent of gross domestic product, the  Baltic News Service  cited
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis as saying.  The government revised its deficit forecast from a previous
projection of 2.5 percent of GDP, BNS said today. The shortfall
will probably narrow to 1.4 percent in 2013, it quoted
Dombrovskis as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
