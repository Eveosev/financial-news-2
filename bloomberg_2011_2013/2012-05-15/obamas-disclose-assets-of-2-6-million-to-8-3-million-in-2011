While President  Barack Obama  has
cited the financial relief available to homeowners by
refinancing at low-interest rates, he and his wife weren’t among
Americans who sought out a lower-cost loan last year.  The Obamas still held at the end of 2011 a 30-year mortgage
on their Chicago residence of between $500,001 and $1 million at
a rate of 5.625 percent, according to financial disclosure forms
released yesterday by the White House. The loan was obtained in
2005.  Rates for a 30-year fixed  mortgage  averaged 4.46 percent
last year, according to Bankrate.com data, hitting a low at the
end of the year of 3.92 percent. In 2011, 4.3 million homeowners
refinanced, according to data from the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development.  Costs have dropped more since then, with the national
average rate for a 30-year mortgage hitting 3.75 percent as of
May 14, according to Bankrate.com.  With the housing market still a drag on the economy in an
election year, Obama has been promoting programs to help
homeowners refinance. Speaking May 11 in  Nevada , the state with
the highest rate of foreclosure filings per household, Obama
urged Congress to expand a refinancing program for homeowners
who owe more than their properties are worth, calling it “a
smart thing to do not only for homeowners but for our economy.”  Total Assets  The disclosure, required under a 1978 federal ethics law,
also showed the president and first lady  Michelle Obama  held
total assets of between $2.6 million and $8.3 million last year,
with as much as $1 million of it in a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  asset
management account.  The forms show two JPMorgan checking accounts for the
Obamas -- with $500,000 to $1 million in a joint account and
another account held by the first lady with a balance between
$1,000 and $15,000. Last year the couple reported having between
$250,001 and $500,000 in the asset management account.  Obama this week cited JPMorgan’s $2 billion trading loss,
disclosed May 10 by Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon , as
showing the need for greater government oversight of the
financial industry.  In an interview May 14 on ABC’s “The View” program, he
called JPMorgan “one of the best managed banks there is.”
Obama said Dimon is “one of the smartest bankers we got and
they still lost $2 billion and counting.”  Treasuries  The disclosures, which cover the period ending Dec. 31,
show $1 million to $5 million of the Obamas’ assets are in U.S.
Treasury notes, and $600,000 to $1.25 million are in Treasury
bills. Treasury notes have maturities of between one and 10
years; Treasury bills have maturities of one year or less.  The first couple also have Section 529 tax-advantaged
college savings accounts for both daughters, ages 13 and 10,
with balances each between $100,000 and $200,000.  Because the disclosure form provides asset values only in
broad ranges, it’s difficult to know whether the Obamas’ net
worth has risen or fallen and if so by how much.  The asset with the greatest potential decline in value
since 2010 was a joint account holding Treasury bills. It was
valued at between $1 million and $5 million in last year’s
filing and declined to between $500,000 and $1 million in this
year’s disclosure.  Last year, Obama reported assets of between $2.8 million
and $11.8 million.  Republican Presidential candidate  Mitt Romney , the former
governor of  Massachusetts  who helped form a private-equity firm
in  Boston , estimated his wealth to be as much as $250 million on
financial disclosure statements.  The vice president and his wife,  Jill Biden , reported
assets of between $239,000 and $866,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
