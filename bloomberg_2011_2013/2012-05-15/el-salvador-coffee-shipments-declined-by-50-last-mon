Coffee exports from  El Salvador  fell
by 50 percent last month, according to preliminary figures from
 Consejo Salvadoreno del Cafe , the country’s coffee council.  Shipments declined to 149,514 quintals (114,704 60-kilogram
bags) in April from 298,635 quintals in the same period a year
earlier, the council said in report e-mailed yesterday.  Most of the beans were shipped to the U.S., Germany, Japan
and Canada, according to the report. The U.S. is the world’s
biggest consumer and Germany the third, according to the
International Coffee Organization in London.  El Salvador will produce 1.6 million bags in the 2011-12
season started in October, according to data on the website of
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
