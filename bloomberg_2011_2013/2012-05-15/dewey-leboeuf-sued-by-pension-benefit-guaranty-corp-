Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, the failing New
York-based law firm, was sued by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. in an effort to take over pension plans covering 1,776
lawyers and staff.  The PBGC is seeking the termination of the law firm’s
retirement plans and appointment as trustee, as well as the
transfer of the plans’ records and assets. The government agency
claimed in a complaint filed in  Manhattan  federal court
yesterday that three Dewey pension plans were underfunded by
$80 million as of May 11.  The move follows the PBGC’s announcement May 10 that it
would take over Dewey’s pension plans. The agency said it will
guarantee benefits up to limits set by the law, about $56,000 a
year for a 65-year-old retiree.  The firm was sued last week by Vittoria Conn, a 55-year-old
document specialist seeking to sue on behalf of employees she
claims weren’t provided with the legally required notice before
being fired. Conn is seeking 60 days’ pay and benefits for the
fired workers. Associates in the firm have been told today is
their last day, she said.  The case is Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. Dewey &
LeBoeuf LLP, 12-CV-3833, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
