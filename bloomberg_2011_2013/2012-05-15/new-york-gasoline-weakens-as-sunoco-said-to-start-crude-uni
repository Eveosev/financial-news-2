New York  gasoline weakened after
 Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  was said to be restarting a Philadelphia crude unit
shut since a fire May 9.  The plant repaired a hole and began returning the unit to
service yesterday, said a person familiar with the operations
who declined to be identified because heâ€™s not authorized to
speak for the refinery.  The differential for unleaded, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor widened 2.25 cents to a discount of 4.5 cents a
gallon versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 1:50 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery dropped 4.73 cents to $2.8892 a gallon.  Reformulated 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the  Gulf Coast 
dropped 2.75 cents a gallon to a discount of 1.5 cents versus
futures.  Crude unit 137 at the Philadelphia plant can process
200,000 barrels a day, according to Genscape Inc., an energy
information provider based in Louisville, Kentucky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
