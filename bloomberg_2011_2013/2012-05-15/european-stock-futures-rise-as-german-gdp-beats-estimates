European stock futures climbed,
indicating the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  will rebound from its
lowest level in four months, as a report showed Germany’s
economy grew at a faster pace than economists had predicted.
U.S. index futures advanced, while Asian stocks fell.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  may decline after
Moody’s cut the credit ratings of 26 of the nation’s lenders,
citing weakened earnings and the domestic economic outlook.
Swatch Group AG may move after Switzerland’s competition
authority extended measures to ensure the world’s biggest
watchmaker delivers parts to competitors.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June gained
0.5 percent to 2,192 at 7:11 a.m. in London, while FTSE 100
Index futures expiring the same month rose 0.1 percent. Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index futures climbed 0.5 percent, while the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.7 percent.  The Stoxx 600 lost 1.8 percent yesterday as  Greece  moved
closer to a possible exit from the euro area, European
industrial output slipped in March and German Chancellor Angela
