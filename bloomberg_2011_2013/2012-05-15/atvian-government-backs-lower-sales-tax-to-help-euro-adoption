Latvia’s government approved a plan
to cut the value-added tax by 1 percentage point from July to
slow inflation as the nation seeks to qualify for euro adoption.  The sales levy will be cut to 21 percent to match the level
in neighboring  Lithuania  and help competition in the region, the
 Finance Ministry , based in the capital, Riga, said today in a
statement on its website. Latvia raised VAT from 18 percent in
2008 as budget revenue faltered amid a recession.  The Baltic country, which exited a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.6
billion) bailout from a group led by the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  in December, is seeking to adopt
 Europe ’s common currency in 2014. To do so, countries must meet
inflation, interest-rate, budget-deficit and debt targets.  Inflation must be within 1.5 percentage points of the
average in the three EU countries with the lowest rates, making
the current threshold 3.1 percent. Latvia’s rate was at 4.1
percent in March.  The government is also planning to gradually reduce the
personal income tax to 20 percent by 2015 from 25 percent now,
the  Finance Ministry  said. The tax will be cut 1 percentage
point starting next year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
