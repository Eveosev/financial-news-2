China  remained the  largest  foreign
U.S. creditor, adding to its holdings in March as the Treasury
10-year note yield reached the highest level since October.  China’s holdings rose by 1.3 percent to $1.17 trillion,
U.S. Treasury Department data released yesterday show. Those of
 Japan , America’s second-largest lender, slipped 0.2 percent to
$1.08 trillion. Net foreign purchases of Treasuries increased
$17.8 billion, or 0.4 percent, to a record $5.12 trillion, the
data show.  The 10-year Treasury yield touched 2.40 percent on March
20, after ending 2011 at 1.88 percent, as investors speculated
gains in the U.S. labor market were a sign of sustainable
economic growth. China’s currency reserves rose 3.9 percent
during the three months ended March 31, reversing the first
quarterly decline since 1998, according to the People’s Bank of
China.  “The price level made more sense at that point,” said
Larry Dyer, a U.S. interest-rate strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc
in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve . “All investors are looking for yield but also
a little bit worried about the rate levels. It may be consistent
with buying dips. Everyone who’s called for an end of Chinese
purchases has found themselves on the wrong side of the facts.”  The data showed China held $1.1552 trillion of Treasuries
in February, a decrease from the $1.1789 trillion reported for
the period on April 16. The Treasury is now revising holdings
data on a monthly basis rather than annually based on the
nationality of the beneficial holder of the debt, while the
initial data will still count the location of the purchase.  Longer-Term Securities  China increased its holdings of longer-term notes and bonds
by $14.6 billion, or 1.3 percent, to $1.166 trillion. Its stake
in short-term bills rose by $100 million to $3.9 billion,
Treasury data show.  China’s holdings of U.S. government securities rose 1.6
percent in the first three months of 2012, reversing a 9.3
percent decline in the final three months of the previous year.
The world’s second-largest economy held $1.15 trillion
Treasuries as of Dec. 31, down from $1.16 trillion in December
2010 and from a peak of $1.31 trillion in July 2011.  For the first three months of 2012 Japan increased its
holdings of  U.S. government debt  by 2.4 percent, its slowest
pace of accumulation since the period from April through June
2011 following last year’s earthquake and tsunami.  Hong Kong ’s  Treasury holdings  dipped $3 billion in March,
or 2.1 percent, to $138.8 billion, while the U.K., which is
often seen as a proxy for Chinese demand, declined $4.1 billion,
or 3.5 percent, to $112 billion.  The Fed remains the top holder of  U.S. debt  with $1.665
trillion on its balance sheet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
