Japan ’s output of copper and copper-
alloy fabricated products declined 5.3 percent in January from a
year earlier, slumping for a third month as demand from the
automotive sector remained subdued, an industry group said.  Production, including sheets and tubes, was 56,690 metric
tons last month, compared with 59,864 tons a year ago, the Japan
Copper & Brass  Association  said today, citing preliminary data.
Output totaled 56,997 tons in December, down 5.7 percent from a
year earlier.  Japan’s  trade deficit  swelled to a record 1.63 trillion yen
($17.4 billion) in January on energy imports and a weaker yen,
highlighting one cost of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies
that are driving down the currency. Exports gained  6.4 percent 
last month from a year earlier, the first advance in eight
months, while imports rose 7.3 percent, the  Finance Ministry 
 said  on Feb. 20.  “Demand from the auto and semiconductor industries
continued to slow,” said Keizo Tani, research manager at the
association. “Overall sentiment was still subdued.”  The country’s output of the copper products totaled 768,938
tons in 2012, down 6.7 percent from 824,431 tons in 2011. That
was the second straight annual drop and the lowest level since
2009. Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to $7,871 a ton at 11:52 a.m. in  Tokyo 
and has declined 7.5 percent in the past year.  The Japanese currency has fallen 13 percent against the
dollar in the past three months amid Abe’s calls for aggressive
monetary easing to end deflation. The yen touched 94.77
yesterday, the lowest level since May 2010.  Japan’s copper wire and cable shipments dropped 2.7 percent
to 54,500 tons in January from a year earlier, decreasing for a
second month, the  Japanese Electric Wire & Cable Makers’
Association  said on Feb. 20. Keiichi Ohki, an official at the
association’s research department, said that benefits from the
weaker yen had yet to be felt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
