Iron ore, trading near 16-month
highs, may slump 54 percent to the lowest level since 2009 as
 China  boosts production and global supply climbs, said  UBS AG. (UBSN)   Rates may tumble to $70 a ton in the three months ending
September after trading between $130 and $160 through June,
Sydney-based commodity analyst  Tom Price  said in a phone
interview today. China is the world’s biggest importer.  Iron ore has surged 75 percent from a near three-year low
in September as China’s growth rebounded from a seven-quarter
slowdown. That may prompt an increase in Chinese output and
idled mines with capacity of 100 million tons a year are set to
return to the market from March, according to Macquarie Group
Ltd. on Feb. 22. Global seaborne supplies will climb 9.1 percent
this year, Morgan Stanley estimates.  “We expect a big correction in the third quarter,” said
Price. “We see a big lift in supply.” Ore with 62 percent
content delivered to the port of Tianjin in China cost $151.90 a
dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd. Rates rose
to $158.90 on Feb. 20, the highest since October 2011.  While Price joins analysts from  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  to
Deutsche Bank AG in predicting cheaper prices in the second
half, his estimate is lower than most. Westpac senior economist
Justin Smirk and Bank of America Corp. expect $110 by yearend.  Rates may jump above $160 in the short term amid lower
supplies from  India  and as the  cyclone  season in  Australia 
threatens shipments, said Price. March ore  swaps  rose 1.8
percent to $150.06 yesterday, snapping seven daily losses, data
from SGX AsiaClear show, as a severe tropical cyclone neared
 Port Hedland , the world’s largest bulk export facility.  Cyclone Rusty  Rusty, a category 3 storm, is 170 kilometers (106 miles)
northeast of Port Hedland, said the Bureau of Meteorology. The
port, which ships ore from  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , has closed and Rio Tinto Group’s Dampier and
Cape Lambert iron ore shipping facilities are shut.  Australia is set to deliver about 80 percent of total new
seaborne supply this year, most of it in the second half, UBS
analysts including Price said in a Jan. 31 report. That will
coincide at a time when China has “sufficient” ore and as
steel production declines in the second half, they said.  “The trade will remain pretty tight generally all the way
through to June or July and then it starts to fall over going
into August or September,” said Price. Iron ore slumped 22
percent in the third quarter of 2012. Global seaborne supply
will outpace demand by 20 million tons in 2013 from a 37 million
ton deficit last year, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Iron ore  is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight  To contact the reporter for this story:
