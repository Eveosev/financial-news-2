Grupo Televisa SAB (TV) , the worldâ€™s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said fourth-quarter profit
increased 36 percent as more Mexicans signed up for satellite
and cable-television services.  Net income  climbed to 3 billion pesos ($235 million) from
2.17 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based Televisa
said yesterday in a statement. Profit topped the 2.6 billion
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.2
percent to 19.8 billion pesos, just above the 19.6 billion
estimate.  Televisa is depending more on its pay-TV businesses for
expansion as growth slows at its broadcast networks, whose
viewers increasingly turn to the Internet and to cable channels
for entertainment. Satellite subscriptions rose 5.5 percent from
the previous quarter to 5.2 million, while cable-TV accounts
grew 2 percent to 2.3 million.  Broadcast advertising  sales  rose 3.6 percent from the same
period a year earlier to 7.7 billion pesos.  Operating income climbed 3.5 percent to 5.32 billion pesos.
Net income was boosted by a gain of 687.6 million pesos from the
value of derivative instruments, compared with an increase of
70.3 million pesos a year earlier.  Televisa rose less than 1 percent to 68.31 pesos at 9:47
a.m. in Mexico City. The shares had fallen less than 1 percent
this year through yesterday, in line with the benchmark IPC
index.  (Televisa will hold a conference call to discuss fourth-
quarter results at 10 a.m. New York time. To listen, dial
