MorphoSys AG (MOR) , the German
biotechnology company that helps drugmakers discover new
medicines, fell the  most  in 18 months as concern that  Europe ’s
debt crisis will worsen prompted investors to sell the best-
performing stocks.  MorphoSys  fell  3.9 percent to 32.80 euros at 11 a.m. in
 Frankfurt  in trading of 214,000 shares, almost three times the
average for a full day in the past three months. The stock
dropped as much as 9.1 percent, the biggest intraday decline
since Aug. 5, 2011.  MorphoSys had almost doubled in the past year before today,
helped by optimism about the company’s experimental arthritis
drug and takeover speculation. European stocks declined and
Italy’s borrowing costs rose to a three-month high after
inconclusive elections in the country sparked concern about the
debt crisis.  “The stock had an extreme gain in the past,” Timo Kuerschner, an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg said in
a telephone interview.  MorphoSys isn’t aware of any tangible news that would have
caused the stock to fall, Claudia Gutjahr-Loeser, a spokeswoman
for the Martinsried, Germany-based company, said in a telephone
interview today.  “The volume today is huge,” she said. “Really, people
are selling in a negative market thanks to  Italy .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
