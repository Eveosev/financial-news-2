A preliminary decision by Mexico’s
ruling party to lift internal barriers against taxing food and
medicine and increasing private investment in the oil industry
is “credit positive” for the nation, according to Moody’s
Investors Service.  The proposal to change the bylaws of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s party is “one of the elements that would have to be
present for us to contemplate an official higher rating,”  Mauro Leos , a Moody’s senior credit officer, said in an interview
today, adding that it would not lift Moody’s Baa1 rating on
Mexico on its own.  The decision by Institutional Revolutionary Party leaders
requires a final vote in the party’s March 1-3 national assembly
and approval would constitute another credit positive event,
Leos said by telephone from New York.  Pena Nieto has pledged to lift growth by boosting tax
collection and breaking state-run Petroleos Mexicanos’s oil
monopoly after eight years of production declines. Changing the
bylaws of the  party, known as PRI, would give Pena Nieto the
option, not the obligation, of presenting bills to expand the
items covered by the nation’s value-added tax and amend  Mexico ’s
Constitution to let companies sign joint ventures with Pemex.
The president hasn’t announced specifics for his planned
legislation.  Party documents currently state that the PRI “won’t accept
applying VAT on food and medicine” and that it supports “the
principle of a nationally integrated oil industry that conforms
to what is established in Articles 25, 27 and 28 of the
Constitution.” Both phrases would be stricken under the
proposal.  Moody’s rating puts Mexico, Latin America’s second-biggest
economy, in the same category as  Russia , South Africa and
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
