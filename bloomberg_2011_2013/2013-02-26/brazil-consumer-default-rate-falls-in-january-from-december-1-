Brazil ’s consumer-loan default rate
in January fell from the month before, even as interest rates
rose in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  The consumer default rate fell to 7.9 percent from a
revised 8 percent in December, the central bank said in a report
distributed today in Brasilia. The company loan default rate was
unchanged from a revised 3.7 percent in December.  President  Dilma Rousseff  has pushed banks to boost lending
and reduce borrowing costs to stimulate Brazil’s $2.5 trillion
economy. Policy makers have also kept the benchmark  interest
rate  at a record low since October, even as inflation has
accelerated above 6 percent. Brazil’s consumer credit default
rate is tending to fall and the share of income used by
consumers to pay debts is declining, the central bank’s director
for economic policy, Carlos Hamilton, told reporters on Feb. 21.  Banco do Brasil  SA,  Latin America ’s largest lender by
assets, is one bank that has boosted lending. Its shares climbed
the most in two months on Feb. 21 after the company reported
higher-than-expected fourth quarter profits driven by faster
credit expansion. Banco do Brasil also said loans at least 90
days overdue dropped to 2.05 percent from 2.19 percent the
previous quarter.  Average Rates  Brazil’s average rate on loans rose in January to 26.1
percent from a revised 25.3 percent in December. Average rates
on consumer loans rose to 34.5 percent from a revised 33.9
percent the month prior. Rates on corporate loans rose to 18.8
percent from a revised 17.9 percent.  Outstanding credit was unchanged in January from December
at 2.4 trillion reais ($1.2 trillion), the central bank said
today. Credit expanded 16.4 percent from a year ago.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, were unchanged at 7.80 percent
at 10:50 a.m. local time. The real strengthened 0.1 percent to
1.9805 per U.S. dollar.  The central bank on Dec. 20 cut its 2012 growth forecast to
1 percent. That’s down from growth of 2.7 percent in 2011 and
7.5 percent in 2010.  In this report, the central bank changed the methodology
used to measure total outstanding real estate loans to include
both consumers and companies. The new numbers are not comparable
to the previous figures, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
