(Corrects name of executive in second paragraph.)  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s
largest producer of the metal, said the tax implications of
spinning off its South African operations will be an important
factor in determining whether it proceeds with the idea.  “Tax will be one of the key determinants in which way we
go,” Executive Director Tony O’Neill yesterday in an interview
with Bloomberg Television’s Alix Steel in Hollywood, Florida,
where BMO Capital Markets is holding a mining and metals
conference. “We have tax in different countries. That seems to
be significant.”  Billionaire investor John Paulson, whose hedge fund is the
biggest shareholder in AngloGold, has said the Johannesburg-
based mining company might increase in value if it were to split
its business between South African assets and operations outside
the country. Gold Fields Ltd., another South African gold miner
in which Paulson invests, said in November it plans to spin off
most of its operations in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
