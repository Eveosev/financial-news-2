Wheat futures rebounded from an
eight-month low on speculation that the grain’s discount to corn
will spur increased use in animal-feed rations. Corn also
gained, and soybeans were little changed.  Cash-wheat prices in  Kansas City  were 30.5 cents below corn
yesterday, the lowest in eight months, while Toledo cash wheat
traded at a 32.25-cent discount to corn, the lowest since May,
data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show. Production of
chicken meat and pork will each rise 0.7 percent in 2013, the
USDA said last week.  “Wheat is finding its way into more cattle feedyards and
hog and poultry rations,” Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview. “Wheat is undervalued.”  Wheat futures for delivery in May rose 0.5 percent to
$7.085 a bushel at 10:43 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
grain earlier fell to $6.9775, the lowest since June 25, as snow
in the U.S. Great Plains eased drought conditions.  Corn prices gained on speculation that a drop to a seven-
week low yesterday will attract demand from livestock and
ethanol producers, Grow said.  Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose 1 percent to 797,000
barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 15, the U.S. Energy
Information Administration said last week. Output has climbed
for three straight weeks.  Corn futures for delivery in May climbed 1.2 percent to
$6.935 a bushel in Chicago, and soybeans for the same delivery
month slid less than 0.1 percent to $14.3475 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
