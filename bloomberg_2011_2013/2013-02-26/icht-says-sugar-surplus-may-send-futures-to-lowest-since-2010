Sugar harvests worldwide will exceed
demand for a fourth year, potentially pushing down futures by as
much as 12 percent to the lowest level since 2010, according to
Germany-based researcher F.O. Licht GmbH.  “Prices will remain under pressure,” Managing Director
Christoph Berg said in a phone interview before a conference in
Bangkok today. “The level of around 16-17 cents might be the
floor that we may see in the third quarter during seasonal
weakness.” Futures last traded at 16 cents in July 2010.  Rates plunged 50 percent from a three-decade high in
February 2011 as farmers from  Thailand  to  Russia  boosted
plantings. The decline made sugar the worst performer on the
 Standard & Poor’s  gauge of 24 raw materials ranging from natural
gas to copper in the past year. The drop in prices means farmers
in countries such as  India  and Ukraine may seek better returns
in other crops, Kingsman SA said in a report e-mailed Feb. 1.  The glut in the year starting April 1 may be smaller than
the 7 million tons to 8 million tons this season, said Berg,
declining to give a figure. Kingsman estimates the surplus will
shrink 51 percent in the 12 months starting Oct. 1.  While output in Brazil, the biggest producer and shipper,
will probably increase 6 percent to about 36 million tons,
ethanol supply may climb about 10 percent to 26.4 billion liters,
said Berg. The price gap between sugar and ethanol is not big
enough to spur millers to make more ethanol at the expense of
the sweetener, he said.  Ethanol Trigger  “Sugar will have to fall to around 16-17 cents to make
millers switch to ethanol on a larger scale,” said Berg. “If
sugar falls to that level, it may increase ethanol output in
 Brazil  by 1 billion liters and may reduce sugar output by 1
million tons.”  Brazil said last month it would boost the amount of ethanol
blended into gasoline to 25 percent in May from 20 percent.  Government mandates in Brazil, India, the  Philippines  and
Thailand will help boost ethanol production, Berg said at F.O.
Licht’s Sugar and Ethanol Asia 2013 conference today. Global
output will probably increase to 102.93 million cubic meters in
2013-2014 from 99.22 million cubic meters a year earlier, he
said. Demand is estimated at 102.92 million cubic meters, up
from 98.88 million cubic meters in 2012-2013.  Berg said sugar has become a more competitive feedstock for
ethanol compared with corn. The grain reached a record $8.49 a
bushel last year and traded at $6.855 in  Chicago  today.  Smaller Crops  Sugar production is expected to decline in  China , India,
 Pakistan  and Thailand, said Berg, without providing estimates.
World consumption may gain about 2 percent as the global economy
recovers and lower prices spur demand, he said.  Output in Thailand, the second-largest exporter, may drop
below a government estimate in the current harvest from a record
last year, said the Cane and Sugar Industry Policy Bureau, a
division of the Office of Cane and Sugar Board. Production will
be less than 9 million tons in the year started Nov. 1 as dry
weather cut cane yields, the bureau’s director Rangsit Hiangrat
said at the conference. The forecast was made by the board this
month. The country produced 10.2 million tons in 2011-2012.  Supplies worldwide will be 5.6 million tons more than
demand in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, Lausanne, Switzerland-
based researcher Kingsman said in the report. That compares with
11.5 million tons in 2012-2013. Production will drop 1.8 percent
to 178.5 million tons as consumption rises 1.6 percent to 172.9
million tons from a year earlier, it said.  Raw sugar for May delivery declined 0.3 percent to close at
18.09 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. yesterday. Prices
reached 36.08 cents on Feb. 2, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
