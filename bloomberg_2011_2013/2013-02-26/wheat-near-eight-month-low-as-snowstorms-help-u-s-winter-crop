Wheat traded near an eight month-low
as a second major snowstorm brings relief to a U.S. winter crop
that was in its worst shape since at least 1985 when it went
dormant in November.  The contract for May delivery traded little changed at
$7.055 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 10:20 a.m.
Singapore time, after slumping as much as 2.1 percent yesterday
to $7.04, the cheapest level for futures since June 25.  About 23 percent of the winter-wheat crop in  Kansas , the
largest U.S. grower of the variety, was rated good-to-excellent
by Feb. 24, up from 20 percent at end-January as snow boosted
moisture, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.
More than a foot (30 centimeters) of snow was expected in parts
of the southern Great Plains, four days after a storm brought as
much as 20 inches, National Weather Service data show.  “Heavy snow throughout the hard red winter wheat belt last
night, which complements last week’s snowfall, is providing
another significant improvement in soil moisture, helping
alleviate existing drought conditions,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in
a report. “The bulls have seemingly given up on wheat prices
over the past week, yet appetite could quickly return.”  Corn for May delivery gained 0.2 percent to $6.8675 a
bushel in Chicago, while soybeans rose 0.3 percent to $14.40 a
bushel. That puts the price of soybeans at 2.10 times the cost
of corn, compared with a 10-year  average  of 2.43 times. The
crops compete for acreage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
