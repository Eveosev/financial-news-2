Mexico reported its biggest  trade
deficit  since November 2008 on falling exports, supporting
expectations that policy makers will cut the benchmark  interest
rate  this year for the first time in four years.  The trade deficit widened to $2.9 billion last month from
$273.5 million a year earlier, the national statistics agency
said in a preliminary report published today on its website. The
gap surprised all 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey, whose
median estimate was for a $216 million surplus. Exports fell 0.2
percent from a year earlier, the first drop since June.  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy has been posting
worse-than-expected results, with retail sales falling 1.8
percent in December, industrial output shrinking for the first
time in three years and January’s unemployment rate rising more
than estimated by all 16 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Today’s
report backs economists’ forecasts that the central bank will
cut its 4.5 percent benchmark rate, said Gabriel Lozano, chief
 Mexico  economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “Data in December wasn’t good at all and today’s number
definitely adds to some concerns about the speed of the
recovery,” Lozano said in a telephone interview from Mexico
City. “It supports the call for a cut in the next few months.”  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Mexico’s economy to
grow 3.5 percent this year after expanding 3.9 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
