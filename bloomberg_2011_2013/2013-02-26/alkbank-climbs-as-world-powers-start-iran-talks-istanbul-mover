Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , a state-run
Turkish lender, climbed the most in almost a month after the
U.S. and its partners suggested sanctions on Iran’s banking
system could be eased if the Islamic state agreed to curb its
nuclear activities.  Halkbank, as the lender is known, jumped 3.6 percent to
17.15 liras at the close in Istanbul, its biggest advance since
Feb. 1. The rise pared the stock’s loss this year to 2 percent.
Turkey’s  index  of banks added 2.3 percent, while the benchmark
 ISE National 100 (XU100)  index increased 1.1 percent.  Halkbank Chief Executive Officer Suleyman Aslan said the
lender has been acting as an intermediary for Turkey’s oil
purchases from Iran “in a currency other than dollars,” in an
interview with Bloomberg HT television on June 12.  The U.S. and its partners have urged  Iran  to curb its
nuclear activities and are offering in exchange to ease banking,
petrochemical and gold sanctions, according to two officials
attending the talks in Almaty,  Kazakhstan .  “It’s only natural that as talks with Iran progress,
pressure on Halkbank shares is lifted,” Baki Atilal, research
manager at Istanbul-based brokerage Turkish Investment, said in
a phone interview today. “New offers extended to Iran,
accompanied by signals of moderation, will continue to be
positive for the stock.”  The talks between Iran and the U.S., Britain,  France ,
Germany, China and Russia started today and will resume
tomorrow, according to diplomats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
