JDA Software Group Inc. agreed to
end a lawsuit it brought in 2011 accusing  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 
of failing to honor a commitment to provide financing for its
acquisition of I2 Technologies.  Credit Suisse and Wachovia Bank in August 2008 agreed to
provide $450 million in financing to fund the proposed
acquisition of I2, Scottsdale, Arizona-based JDA said in a
complaint filed in October 2011 in New York State Supreme Court
in  Manhattan .  JDA was scheduled to complete the acquisition on Nov. 6,
2008, until Credit Suisse said it wouldnâ€™t honor its commitment
to provide funding for the purchase unless JDA agreed to changes
in the loan terms, the  software company  said in its suit.  The two sides have agreed to end the lawsuit, according to
a court filing dated yesterday. David Gordon, an attorney
representing JDA, and Brian Burns, an attorney for Zurich-based
Credit Suisse, declined to comment on the filing in phone
interviews.  JDA resumed talks to  acquire  I2 in August 2009 and
announced three months later that it planned to buy the company
for an enterprise value of about $396 million, about $50 million
more than the purchase price under the original agreement, the
company said in its complaint. JDA completed the acquisition in
January 2010.  JDA, a provider of software to help manage supply chains,
was  acquired  by closely held Atlanta-based RedPrarie Corp. in
December.  The case is JDA Software Group Inc. v. Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, 652997/2011,  New York  State Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
