The lira ended its longest losing
streak since August on speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve
will calm financial markets after  Italy ’s inconclusive
elections.  The currency recovered from its lowest level since October
as Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke  is set to testify on monetary
policy today before the Senate Banking Committee. The lira fell
as much as 0.3 percent earlier today after it emerged  Silvio Berlusconi , the former premier who has vowed to reverse
austerity measures, and Beppo Grillo, who also opposes crisis-
fighting measures, won about 55 percent of the popular vote in
Italy, raising the possibility of a repeat election.  “Today we are seeing optimism with regard to Bernanke,”
Bulent Topbas, a  fund manager  at Strateji Menkul Degerler AS in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “People are expecting
Bernanke to fine-tune the markets in a positive direction and
say that the music will continue.”  The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.8038 per dollar at 5:02
p.m. in Istanbul. It has weakened 2.5 percent this month,
pushing the currency below its 200-day moving average against
the dollar. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.7 percent.  The  U.S. economy  is recovering while still “far from
healthy and vibrant conditions we would like to see,” Bernanke
said Feb. 15 at G-20 meeting in Moscow. “We believe that by
strengthening the U.S. economy we are helping to strengthen the
global economy as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
