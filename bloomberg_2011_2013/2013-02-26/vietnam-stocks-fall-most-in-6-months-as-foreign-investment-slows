Vietnamese  stocks  dropped the most
in Asia on concerns foreign investors are slowing purchases of
the nation’s shares amid speculation the government is making
limited progress in its economic restructuring plan.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  slid 3.9 percent, the biggest drop since Aug.
23, to 465.05 at the close in  Ho Chi Minh City .  Tan Tao
Investment Industry Joint-Stock Co. (ITA) , the most-active stock by
volume today, slumped 6 percent.  Kinh Bac City Development Share
Holding Corp. (KBC)  plunged 6.9 percent. The index’s 30-day volatility
climbed to the highest since Oct. 1.  Overseas investors  bought  a net $3.86 million of Vietnamese
shares this month through yesterday, compared with $123.4
million in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The gain in the market was largely due to foreign
investment inflow, and the flow is reversing now,” Le Chi Phuc,
investment director at SGI Capital, a unit of Saigon Invest
Group, said by phone today. “The stock market also got over-
optimistic that the economic outlook will improve with the
restructuring process, but investors haven’t seen much
improvement yet.”  Vietnam ’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved a master
plan to restructure the economy, overhaul banks and speed up
share sales of state-owned companies, the government said on
Feb. 21. The plan, to be implemented through 2020, aims to
enhance the country’s competitiveness and growth.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
