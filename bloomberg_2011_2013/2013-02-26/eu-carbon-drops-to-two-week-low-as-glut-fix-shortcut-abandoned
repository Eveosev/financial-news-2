European Union carbon permits closed
at their lowest level since Feb. 7 a day after Matthias Groote,
chairman of the EU parliament’s environment panel, scrapped
fast-track talks on a plan to cut a surplus of allowances.  The December contract fell 5.9 percent to close at 4.30
euros ($5.60) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London . Certified Emission Reductions for December rose 1 cent
to 35 cents a ton.  The EU benchmark declined 17 percent over the past two
sessions after Groote decided not to pursue a vote that might
have hastened a decision on a 900 million-ton temporary
reduction in supply of emissions permits through 2015.  “Without a vote anytime soon in the parliament, the carbon
market is going to remain in the doldrums,” Eric Bickel, an
analyst at energy management company Schneider Electric SA in
Louisville,  Kentucky , said today by e-mail. “If this market has
to wait four months before finding some semblance of balance,
then we’re going to see very little impetus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
