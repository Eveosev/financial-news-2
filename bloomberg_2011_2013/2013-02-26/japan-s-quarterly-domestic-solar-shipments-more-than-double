Japan ’s domestic shipments of solar
cells and modules more than doubled to 1,003 megawatts in the
three months to December 31, the Japan Photovoltaic Energy
Association  said  today.  Local shipments were 406 megawatts in the same quarter in
2011. Imports, counted in domestic shipments, more than tripled
to 342 megawatts from a year. Exports fell 66 percent to 111
megawatts, the association said in a statement on its website.  Japan introduced above-market rates for clean energy in
July to spur investment as the country diversifies its
generation sources after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The data was compiled from 37 companies including  Kyocera
Corp. (6971)  and  Suntech Power (STP)  Japan Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
