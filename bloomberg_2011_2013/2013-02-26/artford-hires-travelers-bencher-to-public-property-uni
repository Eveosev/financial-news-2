Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer focusing on property-casualty coverage, hired
Susan Bencher to run a unit that caters to cities, counties and
other public entities.  Bencher, who was a leader of  Travelers Cos. (TRV) ’s national
property division, will be head of the public-entity property
business, Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same
name, said today in a statement. She will report to  David Carter , senior vice president of middle-market commercial
insurance.  Hartford Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee agreed last
year to sell units including a life operation, and is expanding
in commercial-property coverage as tight budgets and declining
tax revenues pressure cities and counties. Bencher will focus on
municipalities, schools and housing authorities, as well as
special districts handling water, sewer, parks and transit.  “Sue’s outstanding reputation in the public-entity risk
arena and strong relationships with the agents and brokers who
specialize in this sector make her ideally suited for this
role,” Carter said in the statement.  Bencher has almost two decades of experience structuring
insurance programs for public entities, Hartford said. She
graduated from the University of Hartford with a bachelor’s
degree in insurance, Pamela Rekow, a company spokeswoman, said
in an e-mail.  Hartford gained 1.3 percent to $23.35 at 4:10 p.m. in  New
York  trading. It has climbed  14 percent  in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
