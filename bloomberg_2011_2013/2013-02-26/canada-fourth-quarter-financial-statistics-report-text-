information provided by enterprises that derive this data from
their financial statements. Since January 1, 2011, Canadian
publicly accountable enterprises have been required to replace
Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (CGAAP) with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when
preparing their financial statements for fiscal years starting
on or after January 1, 2011. Canadian private enterprises are
required to replace CGAAP by Accounting Standards for Private
Enterprises or IFRS. The adoption of new accounting standards by
some enterprises since the beginning of 2011 may affect
comparability with prior periods.  Quarterly profit numbers referred to in this release are
seasonally adjusted and are in current dollars. The quarterly
financial data for the first, second and third quarters of 2012
have been revised. For more information on seasonal adjustment,

X201000311141&amp;lang=eng) .  Quarterly financial statistics for enterprises are based
upon a sample survey and represent the activities of all
corporations in Canada, except those that are government
controlled or not-for-profit. An enterprise can be a single
corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership
and/or control, for which consolidated financial statements are
produced.  Profits referred to in this analysis are operating profits
earned from normal business activities. For non-financial
industries, operating profits exclude interest and dividend
revenue and capital gains/losses whereas, for financial
industries, these are included, along with interest paid on
deposits.  Operating profits differ from net profits, which represent
the after-tax profits earned by corporations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
