Natural gas futures fluctuated near
a two-week high in New York amid forecasts of below-normal
temperatures that would increase heating-fuel consumption.  Gas moved between gains and losses as MDA Weather Services
in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted mostly colder-than-average
weather in the eastern half of the U.S. from March 3 through
March 7. The futures gained 3.7 percent to settle at $3.414 per
million British thermal units yesterday, the highest closing
price since Feb. 6.  “We’re seeing a little bit of follow-through from
yesterday’s big run,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Natural gas for March delivery fell 0.7 cent to $3.407 per
million British thermal units at 9:53 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures are up 34 percent from a year
ago. Trading volume was 22 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day.  The March gas contract expires today. The more actively
traded April contract slid 2.1 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.449
per million Btu.  April $3.50 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They fell 1.3 cents to 9.8 cents per million
Btu on volume of 262 contracts as of 9:49 a.m. Calls accounted
for 53 percent of options volume.  The low in New York on March 3 may be 29 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 2 Celsius), 3 less than usual, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in Chicago may be
23 degrees, 4 below normal.  Inventory Report  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
data from the Energy Information Administration show. The agency
is part of the Energy Department.  The EIA’s weekly stockpile data, due Feb. 28 at 10:30 a.m.
in  Washington , may show supplies fell by 165 billion cubic feet
in the week ended Feb. 22, according to the median of four
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
change for the week is a decrease of 118 billion. Last year,
inventories slid by 106 billion during the period.  Supplies totaled 2.4 trillion cubic feet in the week ended
Feb. 15, 18 percent above the five-year average and 9.2 percent
below levels a year earlier.  Marketed gas production will average a record 70.02 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 1.1 percent from 2012, as output
from the Marcellus shale formation in the Northeast grows, the
Energy Information Administration said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook , released Feb. 12 in Washington.  Henry Hub  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $3.53 per million British thermal units in 2013,
compared with $2.75 per million Btu last year, the agency said.  Stockpiles of the fuel may total about 2 trillion cubic
feet at the end of March, down from 2.477 trillion at the same
time last year, according to the report.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 84 percent of its
energy needs in the first 11 months of last year, on pace to be
the highest annual level since 1991, EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
