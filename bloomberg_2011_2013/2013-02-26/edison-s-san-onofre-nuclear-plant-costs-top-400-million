Edison International (EIX)  has spent $402
million on costs associated with its San Onofre nuclear power
plant in Southern  California  that’s been shut for more than a
year with damaged steam generators.  Costs for repairs and inspections climbed to $102 million
and replacement power expenses rose to $300 million through Dec.
31, Rosemead, California-based Edison said today in a regulatory
filing.  State regulators have opened a probe to decide whether
Edison can recover costs for its reactors, which have been
offline since January 2012 after the company found unusual wear
on tubes supplied by Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd. (7011)  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is evaluating
whether it’s safe for Edison to restart one of the units.  Edison rose 4 percent after the close of trading in New
York after reporting fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.79 a
share, above the $1.05 average of 12  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Adjusted quarterly results were helped by increased rates
at Edison’s utility and excluded a writedown on its generation
unit, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December,
according to a statement.  Edison sees 2013 adjusted earnings between $3.45 a share to
$3.65 a share, above the $3.24 average of 17 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Edison’s San Onofre losses have been reduced by $37
million, its share of a $45 million payment from Mitsubishi as
part of a warranty claim, Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci
said today during a conference call with investors. Edison has
asked for $106 million in repair costs to be covered by
Mitsubishi, the company said.  Southern California Edison operates the nuclear plant and
owns a 78.2 percent stake.  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Electric &
Gas unit owns 20 percent and the City of Riverside, California,
owns 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
