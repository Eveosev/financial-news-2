Rubber dropped to a two-month low
after Japan’s currency strengthened by the most in almost three
years yesterday, cutting the appeal of yen-based contracts, on
concern  Italy ’s elections will lead to renewed turmoil in  Europe .  The contract for August delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 2.9 percent to 289.7 yen a kilogram
($3,134 a metric ton), the lowest level for a most-active
contract since Dec. 25. Futures traded at 292 yen at 11:02 a.m.,
extending this year’s losses to 3.5 percent.  The yen traded at 92.55 per dollar after surging 1.7
percent to 91.82 yesterday, the biggest gain since May 2010.
Italy may require another vote after partial election results
suggested the four-way race may end in a divided parliament, an
aide to Democratic Party candidate Pier Luigi Bersani said.  “Investor appetite for futures weakened as the European
turmoil boosted the yen as a haven,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst
at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Rubber also declined on concerns demand from China, the
biggest consumer, may slow, Saito said. China may tighten
monetary policy because of excessive liquidity in the market and
rising property prices, China Securities Journal reported today.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.4 percent to 24,555  yuan  ($3,941) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board declined 0.6 percent to 91.20 baht ($3.05)
a kilogram on Feb. 22, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand. The Thai market was closed yesterday for
a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
