Evgeni Malkin of the  Pittsburgh
Penguins  was placed on injured reserve and will miss at least
the next three games after being diagnosed with a concussion and
suffering short-term memory loss.  Malkin, 26, was injured during a Feb. 22 National Hockey
League game against Florida when he collided with Panthers
defenseman Erik Gudbranson while skating in on goal. The
Penguins’ center fell on his back, slid into the end boards and
struck his head.  The Penguins last night placed Malkin on injured reserve
and said he won’t accompany the team on a three-game road trip
that begins today against the  Florida Panthers . Malkin also will
miss games against the Carolina Hurricanes on Feb. 28 and the
 Montreal Canadiens  on March 2.  Penguins coach Dan Bylsma said Malkin hasn’t suffered any
headaches or disorientation since hitting his head.  “He’s had no other symptoms,” Bylsma said on the team
 website . “He’s feeling fine and his memory is returning.”  Malkin has four goals and 17 assists this season and is
tied for 12th in the NHL in scoring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
