Bank of England Deputy Governor
 Charles Bean  said policy makers are “disappointed” with the
impact of the pound’s depreciation on the rebalancing of the
economy and there could be a case to see it fall further.  “It’s fair to say we have been disappointed about not
getting more a kick to the recovery from net exports,” Bean
told lawmakers on Parliament’s Treasury Committee in London
today. “There has been some rebalancing, but not anywhere as
much as we would have liked to have seen.”  Bean also said that the “puzzle” may be related to
Britain’s services exports.  While sterling has fallen about 25 percent on a  trade-
weighted basis  since the start of 2007, there has been
“unexpected weakness” in the exports of financial and business
services since the global crisis, he said. It is not clear to
what extent officials can expect that demand to come back, or if
it is permanent, the deputy governor said.  “You might think some of this might be relatively
persistent -- the bit that’s connected to the exports of banking
services,” Bean said. “If that’s the case you might take the
view we need an even bigger depreciation to make our exports of
goods and other services more competitive.”  Still, “I’m not convinced that we necessarily need a
nominal depreciation to get that,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
