Copper climbed the most in two weeks
as surging new-home sales in the U.S. signaled stronger metal
demand, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke defended
stimulus measures intended to spur growth.  Purchases of new homes in the U.S. jumped 15.6 percent in
January from December to the highest level since July 2008, a
report from the Commerce Department showed today. “We do not
see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some
financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a
stronger economic recovery,” Bernanke said today in testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee.  “The housing data was bullish,” Carlos Perez-Santalla, a
broker at PVM Futures Inc. in Hoboken, New Jersey, said in a
telephone interview. “Bernanke’s statements pushed the right
buttons, and we are seeing higher prices.”  Copper futures for May delivery added 0.6 percent to settle
at $3.583 a pound on the Comex at 1:15 p.m. in New York, the
biggest gain since Feb. 8. Volume was almost double the average
in the past 100 days.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery rose 0.3 percent to $7,858 a metric ton ($3.56 a
pound). Stockpiles monitored by the exchange increased for a
ninth session to 438,375 tons, the highest since Oct. 25, 2011.  Aluminum for delivery in three months declined 0.7 percent
to $2,023 a ton after touching $2,010, the lowest since Nov. 29.  Zinc, lead and tin climbed in London. Nickel fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
