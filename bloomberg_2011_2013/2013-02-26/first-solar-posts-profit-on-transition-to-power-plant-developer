First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
biggest maker of thin-film solar panels, said first-quarter
revenue will fall short of analysts’ expectations after it
shuttering a plant in  Germany . The shares fell 7.3 percent after
the close of regular trading.  Net income was $154.2 million, or $1.74 a share, compared
with a net loss of $413.1 million, or $4.74 a share, a year
earlier, Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar said today in a
statement. Excluding costs related to restructuring, the company
earned $2.04 cents a share, exceeding by 27 cents the average
estimate of 21 analysts. Sales rose to $1.08 billion from $660.4
million.  First Solar last year began reducing capacity as a global
surplus and waning government support drove down solar-panel
 prices  31 percent in 2012. The company boosted revenue last year
by expanding efforts to build large  power plants  with its
panels, and needs to develop more projects to keep its pipeline
filled, according to Rob Stone, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in
 Boston .  “We believe additional bookings are needed to avoid
further shut-downs and charges,” Stone said in a research note
Feb. 22.  First Solar is finishing solar farms faster than it’s
selling new ones, he said. Most of its current projects will be
complete by 2015.  “We believe the actual backlog peaked in the second
quarter at 2.5 gigawatts and currently stands at 1.85
gigawatts,” Stone said.  The shares fell 9.3 percent to $28.75 at 4:48 p.m., after
the close of regular trading in  New York .  ‘Battlefield Stock’  “They had a healthy quarter but it looks like revenue
guidance for the first quarter was below street expectations,”
 Sanjay Shrestha , an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, said
today in an interview. “This is a battlefield stock and without
full guidance for the year the shares are getting hit.”  For the first quarter, sales will be in the range of $650
million to $750 million, less than the $803.6 million average
estimate of 18 analysts. That will result in per-share profit of
70 cents to 90 cents, which compares to an average estimate of
78 cents.  First Solar announced in April plans to close its plant in
 Frankfurt  an der Oder, Germany, with about 560 megawatts of
annual production capacity. The company also idled four
production lines in Malaysia.  First Solar has about 1,800 megawatts of panel production
capacity, mainly in  Malaysia  and the U.S., Stone said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
