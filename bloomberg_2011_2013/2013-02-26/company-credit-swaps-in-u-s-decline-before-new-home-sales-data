A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as better-than-expected American home sales tempered
concerns that political tensions in Italy will intensify the
 European debt crisis .  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 0.8
basis point to a mid-price of 89.4 basis points at 4:15 p.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The index
has advanced 0.6 basis point in February and is down 5 basis
points this year.  New home sales  in the U.S. jumped in January to the highest
level since July 2008, according to data from the Commerce
Department. The measure increased 15.6 percent to a 437,000
annual pace from 378,000 in December. The monthly gain was the
biggest since 1993. The index climbed as much as 0.8 basis point
earlier today as the Italian election stalemate spurred concern
that the debt crisis will worsen as support for austerity wanes.  “There is a risk-off trade environment and economic data,
particularly housing is looking good, but Europe still looks
risky,”  Mirko Mikelic , senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third
Asset Management in  Grand Rapids ,  Michigan  said in a telephone
interview. “The good news in the U.S. is offsetting some of the
European bad news.”  Caesars’ Loss  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Bond researcher CreditSights Inc. shifted its
recommendation on  Caesars Entertainment Corp.’s (CZR)  first-lien
senior secured debt to “underperform” after the largest owner
of U.S. casinos said yesterday its fourth-quarter loss more than
doubled.  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index dropped 5.6 basis points to 445.9 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  Philip Morris International Inc. (PM)  sold $1.85 billion of
bonds in a three-part offering that includes its first floating-
rate debt since the tobacco seller was spun off from Altria
Group Inc. in 2008. The company’s $400 million of two-year notes
yield 5 basis points more than the London interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $600
million of 2.625 percent, 10-year debt that yields 95 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $850 million
of 4.125 percent 30-year debt at a 120 basis-point spread.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from
each other, was set at 0.29 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The average relative yield on speculative-grade, or junk-
rated, debt narrowed 0.7 basis points to 505.7 basis points,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and less than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
