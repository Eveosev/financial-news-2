China ’s  yuan  advanced to a two-week
high after the central bank strengthened the daily fixing for
the first time in four days.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  reference  rate by
0.06 percent to 6.2856 per dollar after data yesterday showed
manufacturing expanded for a fourth month. The Purchasing
Managers Index published by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics showed a preliminary reading of 50.4 for February,
compared with the final 52.3 for January and the median estimate
of 52.2 in a Bloomberg survey.  “Although the PMI data disappointed the market, it’s still
resilient relative to other major economies,” said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange analyst at Haitong International
Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “Room for yuan declines is
limited.”  The currency rose 0.07 percent to close at 6.2295 per
dollar in  Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System show. It touched 6.2284 earlier, the strongest level
since Feb. 8. The spot rate is at 0.92 percent premium to the
fixing, compared with the maximum 1 percent allowed.  The U.S. Senate Finance committee is due to deliberate
today the nomination of Jack Lew by President  Barack Obama  for
U.S. Treasury secretary.  “I would press China to move to a market-determined
exchange rate, level the playing field for our workers and
firms,” Lew said in written responses to questions from
committee ranking member Orrin Hatch.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.02
percent to 6.2293 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.02
percent to 6.3260, a 1.5 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  Hong Kong’s government will announce the sale of HK$10
billion ($1.3 billion) of inflation-linked bonds, the city’s
third such issuance, a person familiar with the plan said today,
asking not to be named as the details aren’t public yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
