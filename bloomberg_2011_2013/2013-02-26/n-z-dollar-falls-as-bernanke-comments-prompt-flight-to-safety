The  New Zealand dollar  fell to its
lowest level in almost eight weeks after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the U.S. central bank’s asset
purchases, decreasing demand for risk assets.  The so-called kiwi declined versus all 16 of its most-
traded peers after Bernanke said the Fed’s unprecedented
stimulus actions are supporting economic expansion with little
risk of inflation or asset-price bubbles. Australia’s dollar
also fell against most major counterparts following Bernanke’s
comments, erasing an earlier advance that came amid increasing
metal prices.  “The New Zealand dollar is badly underperforming,” Adam Button, a currency analyst at Forexlive.com in  Montreal , said in
a telephone interview. “We saw a knee-jerk reaction to buy U.S.
dollars and sell commodity currencies after Bernanke’s
comments.”  New Zealand’s dollar depreciated 0.9 percent to 82.63 U.S.
cents at 2:31 p.m. in  New York  after falling earlier to 82.24,
its lowest level since Jan. 4. The kiwi fell 0.7 percent to
75.93 yen after reaching 75.18, its weakest since Jan. 28.  The Australian dollar decreased 0.1 percent to $1.0243
after declining to $1.0201, its lowest since Oct. 10. The so-
called Aussie was little changed at 94.21 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  declined 0.6 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials fell 0.8 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 2.2 percent this
year, the third-biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The Aussie has gained 0.7 percent, and the U.S. dollar
has increased 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
