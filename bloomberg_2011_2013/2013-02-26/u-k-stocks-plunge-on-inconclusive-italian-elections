U.K. stocks plunged after Italians
failed to award a clear mandate to govern to any of the
political parties that contested parliamentary elections,
increasing concern about the pace of reforms in the euro area.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS)  all fell more than 2 percent as a gauge of lenders
posted the biggest decline on the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  retreated the most in four months after
reporting its results.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  tumbled 1.3 percent to
6,272.89 at 8:51 a.m. in London, its biggest drop since Feb. 21.
The gauge has still  rallied 6.4 percent  this year after U.S.
politicians agreed to a compromise federal budget. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index also slumped 1.3 percent, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index decreased 0.1 percent.  U.K. stocks slid after Pier Luigi Bersani’s party and its
allies won 31.63 percent of votes in the Italian Senate, while
Silvio Berlusconi and his partners took 30.72 percent. The final
figures from the  Interior Ministry  mean that any new government
in the country will have to contend with a deadlocked upper
house, potentially frustrating efforts to reform labor markets
and reduce spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
