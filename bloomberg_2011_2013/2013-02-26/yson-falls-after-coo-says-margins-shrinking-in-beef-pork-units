Tyson (TSN)  Foods Inc. slumped the most in
more than six months after the largest U.S. meat processor said
margins narrowed in its beef and pork units.  Tyson fell 3.7 percent to $22.40 at the close in New York,
the most since Aug. 6.  Wholesale beef prices are coming down from their highest
level in at least eight years, while the most-active cattle
futures in Chicago have climbed 14 percent in the last 10 months
as the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s led the cattle herd to
shrink.  “Margins have been compressed throughout the past month as
the value of beef has fallen more than the price of cattle,”
James Lochner, chief operating officer of Springdale, Arkansas-
based Tyson, said at the Goldman Sachs 17th Annual Agribusiness
Conference today.  Margins for Tyson’s pork business also narrowed in the
current quarter, he said.  The company expects “strong performance” for the chicken
business, especially in the second half of the fiscal year that
ends in September, according to a statement today.  “Demand is strong, and we’re seeing signs of consumers
trading from beef to chicken,” Lochner said. “Even with
pricing up substantially year over year, chicken is a good value
for consumers, and food service continues to promote chicken
heavily.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
