The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
climbed to the highest in two weeks, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 4 basis points to 111.5 basis
points as of 8:19 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is on course for its highest
close since Feb. 11, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 3.5 basis points to
127 as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The gauge is set for its highest close since Feb. 8,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 3 basis points
to 118 basis points as of 10:38 a.m. in Sydney, National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is poised for its
highest since Feb. 8, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
