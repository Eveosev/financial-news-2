The  Federal Reserve  requested
comment today on a new rule that would authorize its 12 district
banks to provide financial services to financial market
utilities designated as systemically important by the Financial
Stability Oversight Council.  The FSOC, a board of U.S. regulators including the Fed and
 U.S. Treasury , on July 18 designated eight financial market
utilities as systemically important.  The Treasury Department listed the entities as: ICE Credit
LLC, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., and the Clearing House
Payments Co. LLC. Also listed by the Treasury were the Options
Clearing Corp., CLS Bank International, the Depository Trust
Co., Fixed Income Clearing Corp., and National Securities
Clearing Corp.  The Fed district banks would also provide financial
services to the firms.  To contact the reporters on this story: Craig Torres in
