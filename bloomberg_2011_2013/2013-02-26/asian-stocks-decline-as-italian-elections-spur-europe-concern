sparking another bout of volatility in Europe,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment market research in Sydney at

almost impossible.”  European Uncertainty  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  increased 0.2

Tokyo. “The Italian elections are causing uncertainty about its
political stability, but this time the euro region does have a
safety net with their unlimited bond-purchase plan.”  Italian Elections  Italy may be left with a hung parliament after partial
