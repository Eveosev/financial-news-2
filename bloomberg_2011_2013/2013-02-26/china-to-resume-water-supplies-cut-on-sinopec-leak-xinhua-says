China  is expected to resume water
supplies in Yongxiu county in the eastern province of Jiangxi
today after they were cut off by pollution caused by a leak from
an oil pipeline run by a unit of  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028) , the official Xinhua  News Agency  reported.  Tap water to 60,000 people in the county was suspended
yesterday due to a polluted intake used by a water utility on
Liaohe River, the news agency said, citing local authorities.
Straw and oil-absorbing felt were sent to Wucheng, 49 kilometers
(30 miles) from the leak, to prevent the pollution from flowing
into Poyang Lake, Chinaâ€™s biggest freshwater lake, the report
said.  The pipeline run by the Jiujiang unit of the company known
as Sinopec was shut off, the Yongxiu county government said
yesterday in a website  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
