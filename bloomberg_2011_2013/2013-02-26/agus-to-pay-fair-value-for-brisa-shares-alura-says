Tagus Holdings Sarl will pay a
reasonable price for the remaining shares of  Brisa-Auto Estradas
de Portugal SA (BRI)  before removing the Portuguese toll-road operator
from the stock market, Alura Capital Partners predicted.  “Alura is confident that Tagus will end up paying a fair
value for shares currently held by the minority shareholders of
Brisa,” Alain Demarolle, whose Alura Capital hedge fund holds a
stake of less than 2 percent in Brisa, said in a telephone
interview today. He declined to say what a fair price would be.  Tagus, a venture of Portuguese holding company Jose de
Mello SGPS SA and Arcus Infrastructure Partners, asked
Portuguese regulator CMVM on Sept. 4 for permission to remove
Brisa from trading in Lisbon after securing 92 percent of the
highway operator’s voting rights in a 2.76 euros-a-share bid for
the company.  Tagus said on Feb. 11 the CMVM promised to approve the
request to delist Brisa if shareholders that didn’t sell their
shares in last year’s bid were offered an adequate exit
mechanism. The CMVM said today that Tagus has until March 1 to
submit an exit mechanism to the remaining shareholders of Brisa.  “The CMVM has clearly indicated that it will guarantee the
protection of the minority shareholders in Brisa and that has
been crucial to ensure that these shareholders get a fair price
for their shares,” said Demarolle, a former adviser to ex-
French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.  Demarolle declined to state the exact size of Alura’s stake
in Brisa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
