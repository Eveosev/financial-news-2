South Korean  consumer confidence 
remained at its highest level since May as gains in the won
drove down the prices of imported goods.  The  sentiment index  was unchanged at 102 for February from
January, the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today.
A reading above 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  Consumer confidence remained high even as  South Korea â€™s
economy grew at the slowest pace in three years last quarter.
The won strengthened more than 3 percent against the dollar over
the past year, boosting purchasing power by making imports
cheaper, Sun Yoo, a Seoul-based analyst at Woori Investment &
Securities, said before the release.  The consumer confidence index is based on responses from
2,011 households across the nation. The survey was conducted by
post and e-mail from Feb. 12 to Feb. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
