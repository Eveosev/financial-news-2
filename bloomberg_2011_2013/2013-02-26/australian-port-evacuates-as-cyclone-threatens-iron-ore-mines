The approach of Severe  Tropical
Cyclone Rusty  toward the north-west Australian coast triggered
orders for the evacuation of parts of Port Hedland, site of the
world’s biggest bulk export terminal.  People in low-lying areas should move to emergency shelters
as the upgraded Category 3 storm, with winds of as strong as 195
kilometers (121 miles) an hour likely to cause “rapid and
powerful flooding,” Western Australia’s Department of Fire and
Emergency Services said today in an e-mailed statement.  Port Hedland, a town of about 20,200 people, exports iron
ore from mines owned by BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest
mining company,  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  and Atlas Iron Ltd.
Rusty is located about 170 kilometers north-east of  Port Hedland ,
the Bureau of Meteorology said in an update at 8 a.m. western
standard time on its website.  Cyclone season lasts from about November to April and high
winds as well as flooding can disrupt iron ore operations in the
world’s biggest exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
