One global aluminum smelting company
asked two buyers in  Japan , Asia’s biggest importer, for a 6.3
percent increase in the premium they pay over London Metal
Exchange prices, three executives directly involved in the
negotiations said.  The company offered to sell aluminum at $255 a metric ton
over the LME cash price for the three months through June, said
the executives, who asked not to be named because the talks are
private. They asked that the companies involved not be
identified. Other producers have yet to make offers, they said.  The proposal would be the first fee increase in two
quarters and coincides with efforts by Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to end deflation in the world’s third-largest
economy.  The negotiations may be settled by the middle of March, the
executives said.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the LME climbed to
a five-month high of $2,186 a ton on Feb. 21. It was little
changed at $2,037.50 at 10:55 a.m. in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
