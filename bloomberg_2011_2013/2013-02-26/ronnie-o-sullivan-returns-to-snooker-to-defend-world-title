Ronnie O’Sullivan said he’s
returning to snooker and will defend his world title in the
championship tournament that starts in April.  In November, O’Sullivan said he’d pull out of the sport for
the rest of the season, indicating he’d miss the championship
event that runs from April 20 to May 6 in Sheffield,  England . He
said he can make an impact at the tournament although he faces a
“massive challenge.”  “I just thought it was time to come back, I got bored and
had to get back to playing, winning or losing, and it shows how
big a part of my life snooker is,” the 37-year-old Englishman
told a televised news conference in London today. “I am used to
being written off. I know how good I am and that I can do
this.”  O’Sullivan, known as “the Rocket,” has played only one
competitive match since winning his fourth world title last
year. He didn’t disclose the reasons for stepping away from
snooker in November, and his absence prompted talk that he might
quit altogether. He’s frequently said he was considering giving
up the game and has spoken of “a depression to do with
snooker.”  He said he faces a difficult task in Sheffield because of
lack of match practice.  “I‘ve played three or four exhibitions but I‘ve played 10
days in nine months,” O’Sullivan said today. “I‘ve potted lots
of balls, but I’m match-rusty. I‘ve not played matches in tense
situations and it’s going to be a tough call with no practice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
