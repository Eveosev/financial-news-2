Petroleo Brasileiro (PETR4) , the state-run
oil producer known as Petrobras, fell to a seven-year low after
 Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11)  cut it to the equivalent of hold, saying an
increase in gasoline prices was insufficient to bolster profit.  The stock declined 1.2 percent to 16.74 reais at the close
of trading in  Sao Paulo , the lowest price since November 2005.
The shares sank 7.5 percent in the past five days amid the
longest losing streak for the stock since October.  Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras’s 6.6 percent increase to
gasoline prices last month fell short of the 10 percent to 15
percent that BTG Pactual estimates the company needs to be able
to bolster its balance sheet, analysts Gustavo Gattass and Luiz
Felipe Carvalho said in a report. The price limits force
Petrobras, which is controlled by the government, to pay more
for the fuel it imports than it can sell it for.  “We fear that the small magnitude of the increase is a
signal that Petrobras’s board does not share our sense of
urgency with regards to the deterioration of the company’s
balance sheet,” the analysts wrote in a note dated today.
“This has made Petrobras a much more risky stock for the longer
term than we’d like.”  BTG Pactual cut its rating on Petrobras from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
