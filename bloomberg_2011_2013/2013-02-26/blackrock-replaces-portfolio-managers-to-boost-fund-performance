BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , seeking to improve
performance at actively run products, replaced five portfolio
managers at funds including those that invest in small-company
stocks and energy.  Natural resources funds including the $773 million
 BlackRock Energy and Resources Portfolio  and the $384 million
BlackRock All-Cap Energy and Resources Portfolio will be managed
by Robin Batchelor and Poppy Allonby, according to a  filing 
yesterday by the New York-based company with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The funds were previously managed by
Denis Walsh and Daniel Neumann, who took over after former
manager Daniel Rice said in June he was stepping down to avoid
the appearance of a conflict of interest.  BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager with $3.8
trillion in assets, is seeking to improve the performance of
actively managed funds as deposits trailed those of index-based
investments. BlackRock hired Chris Leavy in October 2010 from
OppenheimerFunds Inc. to oversee fundamental equity, and last
year reorganized its bond unit to give more autonomy and
accountability to individual managers.  “We have to continually find ways to improve by
identifying opportunities to enhance performance,”  Robert
Kapito , BlackRock’s president, said Feb. 13 at the Credit Suisse
Financial Services Forum in  New York . “I will have less
patience going forward with underperforming active products and
we will look to replace those teams quicker than we have
replaced them in the past.”  Managers Replaced  The managers for the $1.4 billion BlackRock Small Cap
Growth Equity Portfolio, Andrew Thut and Andrew Leger, will be
replaced, as will Eileen Leary, who ran the $286 million
BlackRock Mid-Cap Growth Equity Portfolio, according to separate
filings yesterday. Jessica Greaney, a spokesman for BlackRock,
confirmed that Walsh, Neumann, Thut, Leger and Leary will be
leaving the firm.  Rice, who helped manage five energy and natural resource
mutual funds at BlackRock, stepped down last year amid an
incident related to disclosure. Rice is one of the founders of
Rice Energy, a company with a subsidiary that has a joint
venture with one of the top holdings of a mutual fund he
managed.  BlackRock Energy and Resources Portfolio lost 21 percent in
the past 12 months, trailing 99 percent of peers, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Over the past five years, the fund
has declined at an average annual rate of 6 percent, behind 82
percent of rivals.  Trailing Rivals  The institutional shares for  BlackRock Small Cap Growth
Equity Portfolio (PSGIX)  returned 3.5 percent in the past year, trailing
74 percent of rival funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Travis Cooke will be the lead portfolio manager for
the small-cap fund, according to the filing.  BlackRock’s Mid-Cap Growth Equity fund returned 2.3 percent
over the past 12 months, putting it behind 76 percent of rivals.
Lawrence Kemp, who joined BlackRock in December, will lead the
fund, along with Phil Ruvinsky and Kathryn Mongelli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
