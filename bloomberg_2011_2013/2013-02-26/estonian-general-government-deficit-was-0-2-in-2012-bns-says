Estonia recorded a general
government budget deficit equivalent to 0.2 percent of gross
domestic product last year, the  Baltic News Service  reported,
citing the countryâ€™s  Finance Ministry .  The deficit figure was lower than an earlier estimate of
1.2 percent of GDP as tax revenue increased more than forecast
and unemployment fell, BNS reported today, citing the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
