Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL) , a Russian
Internet company, plans to pay $899 million in special dividends
next month after reducing its stake in  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and exiting
investments in  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  and  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)   Mail.ru’s global depositary receipts rose as much as
4.6 percent, and were up 2.8 percent at $36.35 as of 8:59 a.m.
in London, bringing their advance to 5.4 percent this year.  “It’s positive that the company decided to pay out almost
all cash from its balance sheet to shareholders instead of
potentially wasting it on acquisitions,” Konstantin Belov, an
analyst at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by telephone.  Mail.ru, controlled by Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov 
and part-owned by China’s  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  and South
Africa’s  Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , will pay investors $4.30 a share as of
March 20, the Moscow-based company said today in a filing.  Net income rose 37 percent last year to 8.5 billion rubles
($278 million), Mail.ru said. Profit matched the median  estimate 
of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue jumped 39
percent to 21.2 billion rubles, led by paid additional services
in social networks and games.  The Russian company sold a stake in Facebook for about $320
million in October, reducing its holding in  Mark Zuckerberg ’s
social-network operator. The stake currently stands at about 0.6
percent, according to Mail.ru. It also fully disposed of 4.1
percent ownership in e-commerce operator Groupon and a 1.2
percent stake in game developer Zynga during the fourth quarter,
Mail.ru said.  The Russian company said it expects revenue growth of 25
percent to 28 percent this year and a margin on earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in a “low
fifties” percentage. The Ebitda margin was 54.5 percent of
sales in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
