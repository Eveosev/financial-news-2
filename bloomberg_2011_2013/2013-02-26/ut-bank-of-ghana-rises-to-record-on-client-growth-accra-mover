UT Bank Ltd. (UTB)  rose to a record as the
Ghanaian lender benefits from initiatives to reach more clients
in West Africa’s second-biggest economy, according to African
Alliance Securities Ltd.  The stock rose 2.2 percent to 47 pesewas by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital, Accra, the highest since at least March
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As many as 79,275
shares traded, equivalent to 69 percent of the three-month daily
average.  UT Bank will start a program to send mobile branches into
communities across  Ghana  including large shopping markets, Pearl Esua-Mensah, deputy managing director, said by phone. The
project will be rolled out by the end of the first quarter, she
said, declining to give details.  The lender “is stepping up their knowledge in banking
small- and medium-sized businesses, which I expect to boost
their retail business significantly,” Derrick Mensah, a senior
analyst at African Alliance Securities, said by phone from
Accra.  The company’s net income rose 57 percent to 13.5 million
cedis ($7 million) in the nine months to Sept. 30 as net
interest income, the money banks earn from lending, climbed to
46.9 million cedis from 37.8 million cedis a year before.
Customer deposits advanced 33 percent to 673.8 million cedis, UT
Bank said on Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
