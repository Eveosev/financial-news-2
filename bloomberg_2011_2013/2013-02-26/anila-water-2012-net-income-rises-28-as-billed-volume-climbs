Manila Water Co. (MWC) , the Philippines’
largest publicly traded water provider, reported profit rose 28
percent last year to 5.44 billion pesos ($133 million), buoyed
by higher billing volumes in the capital’s East Zone.  The water and wastewater utility that serves half of  Manila 
also said today in a stock exchange filing that revenue rose 21
percent from a year earlier to almost 14.6 billion pesos.  Manila Water has water and sewage service partnership
ventures in Vietnam and Thailand and last October acquired Suez
Environnement Co.’s 51 percent stake in PT PAM Lyonnaise
Jaya, which holds the concession contract for western Jakarta.  The shares fell 1.5 percent to 35.75 pesos in Manila,
trimming gains this year of the Quezon City-based unit of  Ayala
Corp. (AC)  to 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
