India  needs 50 runs to win the first
cricket Test against  Australia  after dismissing the touring team
for 241 in its second innings early on the final day.  Australia added nine runs to its total of 232-9 after its
last-wicket pairing took the match into a fifth day on a
deteriorating pitch in Chennai. Moises Henriques top scored with
81 not out, while offspinner Ravi Ashwin led India’s bowlers
with 5-95 to follow up his seven wickets in the first innings.  Home captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck a career-best 224
to help lift India to 572 all out yesterday in reply to
Australia’s first-innings 380.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
