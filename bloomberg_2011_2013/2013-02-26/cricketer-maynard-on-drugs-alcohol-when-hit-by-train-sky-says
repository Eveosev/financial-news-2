English cricket player Tom Maynard
had drugs and alcohol in his system when he was hit by a  London 
Underground train last year,  Sky News reported  on its website.  The 23-year-old was electrocuted by stepping on a live rail
as he fled police on June 18 and was then struck by an
underground train near Wimbledon Park station in June, an
inquest into his death heard today, Sky said.  Forensic tests showed Maynard, who played for county club
Surrey, had cocaine and ecstasy in his system and a toxicology
test showed he was nearly four times over the legal drink drive
limit, Sky reported.  Forensic pathologist Simon Poole told the court Maynard was
hit by a train but appeared to already be unconscious, adding
his injuries included “burns consistent with contact to a live
train rail,” Sky said.  Maynard’s car was stopped by police at about 4:15 a.m.
local time after it was seen “driving erratically,” Sky said.
He then ran away and was found 55 minutes later one-half mile
away on the train line, the broadcaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
