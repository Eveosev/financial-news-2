Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  rose to a
record high on speculation the country’s biggest lender by
assets will announce this week full-year profit increased as
much as 22 percent.  KCB, as the lender is known,  climbed  6.1 percent to 39.25
shillings a share by the close in Nairobi, the highest since at
least May 1997. More than four times the three-month daily
average volume was traded.  The company will announce full-year earnings Feb. 28.
Profit in the nine months through September surged 35 percent to
8.69 billion shillings ($99.3 million) as income from loans
grew, the lender said Oct. 25. Joshua Oigara took over as chief
executive officer of KCB on Jan. 1. Oigara, formerly chief
financial officer, said in August the lender’s cost to income
ratio target is 52 percent by the end of 2012 from 60 percent a
year earlier.  “There is building investor demand ahead of end-year
results,” Ted Macharia, a research analyst at Nairobi-based AIB
Capital Ltd., said by phone. “The bank under new management is
trying to trim its cost to income ratio to below 50 percent.”  Profit after tax will be about 13.4 billion shillings
compared with 11 billion shillings a year earlier, he said.
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd. has a similar
estimate.  The stock has climbed 31 percent this year, compared with a
gain of 11 percent for the benchmark  Nairobi Securities Exchange
All Share Index (NSEASI) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
