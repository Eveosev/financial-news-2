United Aircraft Corp. will deliver
the first Sukhoi SuperJet-100 to an Indonesian customer today,
Mikhail Pogosyan, the head of the state-owned aircraft maker,
said today in an interview on the Rossiya 24 television channel.  Indonesian carrier PT Sky Aviation, which has ordered 12 of
the regional jets, expected to take delivery by the end of last
year after carrying out inspections, the company said in a Dec. 5 
statement.  A SuperJet carrying reporters and potential customers
crashed in  Indonesia  during a promotional flight on May 9 last
year, killing all 45 on board the 90-seat plane. The pilot may
have ignored a system warning that the aircraft was heading
toward a mountain, according to the official investigation
report released on Dec. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
