Italy’s new parliament will have the
highest number of women in the republic’s history, reaching
about 31 percent of members of the newly elected body, farmers’
union Coldiretti said.  Women will make up 32 percent of lawmakers in the lower
house, the Chamber of Deputies, and 30 percent in the Senate,
compared with 21 percent and 19 percent respectively in the
previous parliament, according to data compiled by Coldiretti
and sent in an e-mailed statement. The new parliament convenes
March 15.  The average age of those elected will drop to 48,
Coldiretti said. The average age of 45 for the lower house and
53 for senators compares with 54 and 57 respectively in the
previous assembly, Coldiretti said.  The party with the highest number of women elected is the
Democratic Party, with 41 percent of female representatives.
Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement is the party with the youngest
lawmakers, with an average age of 37, Coldiretti said. The
youngest member of the new parliament will be Marta Grande, 25,
of the Five Star group.  Italian party chiefs began jockeying to forge a coalition
of rivals and head off a second vote as a political vacuum of at
least a month loomed.  In the aftermath of an inconclusive election, Democratic
Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani and resurgent ex-Premier Silvio
Berlusconi may be seeking to avoid another ballot that would
favor populist Grillo, whose movement was the top vote-getter in
its first national contest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
