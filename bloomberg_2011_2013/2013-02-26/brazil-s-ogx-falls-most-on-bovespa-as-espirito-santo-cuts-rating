OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
the oil company controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , dropped
the most on Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index as Banco Espirito
Santo de Investimento SA cut its rating on the stock.  Shares tumbled 4 percent to 3.14 reais at 2:32 p.m. in Sao
Paulo trading, the steepest decline on the  Bovespa index , which
fell 0.7 percent.  Espirito Santo cut its rating on the stock to neutral from
buy, citing a delay connecting the company’s fourth Campos Basin
well. Rio de Janeiro-based OGX postponed the connection of the
well due to be completed this quarter until the second half of
the year, Espirito Santo analysts said in a report published
today.  “We now expect further deterioration in the company’s
financial condition due to the delayed production startup,”
Oswaldo Alcantara Telles Filho and Filipe Rosa, analysts at
Espirito Santo, wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
