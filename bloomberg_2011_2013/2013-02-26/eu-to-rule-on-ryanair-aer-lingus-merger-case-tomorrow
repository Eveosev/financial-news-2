The European Commission will
announce its decision tomorrow on  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ’s bid for
 Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL) , said Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for
the Brussels-based regulator.  “The commission will take a decision tomorrow on the
proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair,” Colombani said
in an e-mail. He said an earlier statement by another spokesman
that the EU would take a “major decision” referred to a merger
case.  Ryanair,  Europe ’s largest discount carrier, said earlier
this month that the EU was planning to block its takeover
attempt for its Irish rival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
