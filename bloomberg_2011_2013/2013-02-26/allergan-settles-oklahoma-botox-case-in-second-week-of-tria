Allergan Inc. (AGN)  reached a confidential
settlement during trial with the mother of a 6-year-old  Oklahoma 
boy who wound up on a ventilator after he was injected with
Botox.  The mother of Jackson Wells claimed the injection, given to
treat spasticity in his legs, caused the boy to develop acute
botulism, leaving him unable to breathe on his own. Jessica
Wells also claimed Allergan promoted the drug for children
despite a lack of regulatory approval for such use.  Allergan settled the lawsuit yesterday during trial while
the boy’s treating doctor was testifying, said plaintiffs’
lawyer Ray Chester. The trial began Feb. 19 in  Oklahoma City 
federal court.  “While the amount is confidential, young Jackson Wells
will be well taken care of for life,” Chester said in an
interview today. U.S. District Judge Robin J. Cauthron confirmed
the settlement in a one-page order yesterday closing the case.  Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for  Irvine , California-based
Allergan, declined to comment on the settlement.  Botox, Allergan’s best-selling product, generated more than
$1.7 billion in sales last year, about equally divided between
uses for medical purposes and wrinkle treatment, according to
the company’s earnings statement this month. The company is
projecting as much as $2 billion in 2013 sales.  The case is Wells v. Allergan Inc., CIV-12-973-C, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Oklahoma (Oklahoma City).  To contact the reporters on this story:
