U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
said that if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad isn’t willing to
join negotiations, then those fighting him deserve support.  “If the president of the country decides he isn’t going to
come and negotiate and he’s just going to kill his people, then
you at least need to provide some support for the people who are
fighting” for their freedom, Kerry said today at a meeting in
Berlin with students.  Kerry made his remarks in response to a question about
U.S. plans to deal with terrorists in  Mali  and spoke of the need
to act early to counter militants. The new secretary of state is
on his first overseas tour in Europe and the  Middle East .  Kerry yesterday hinted at a U.S. policy change toward Syria
during talks in London. “We’re determined to change the
calculations of President Assad on the ground,” he said,
without offering details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
