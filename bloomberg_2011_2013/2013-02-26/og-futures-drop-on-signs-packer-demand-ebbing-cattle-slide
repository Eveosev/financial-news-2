Hog futures declined for the ninth
time in 10 sessions on speculation that U.S. demand for the
animals will wane. Cattle prices rose.  James Lochner, the chief operating officer at  Tyson Foods
Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S. meat processor, said today at a
conference that beef and pork margins have narrowed. U.S.
meatpackers slaughtered 831,000 hogs in the first two days of
this week, down 1.7 percent from a year earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show.  “Narrowing margins usually mean the packer doesn’t want to
pay as much,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-
Peterson Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “If the packer is losing money, he’s going to
tighten his bid.”  Hog futures for April settlement declined 0.4 percent to
close at 81.575 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. This month, the price has slumped 8.7
percent, heading for the biggest decline since July.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.293 a pound. The price climbed for the third straight
session, the longest rally in three months. The commodity has
dropped 2.3 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement increased 0.3
percent to $1.41175 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
