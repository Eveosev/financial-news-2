Indian Railways , Asia’s oldest
network, plans to link passengers fares and freight rates with
fuel prices for the first time as it seeks to cut more than $4.5
billion of losses stemming from below-cost tariffs.  Charges for shipping commodities on the network will be
linked to fuel prices starting April 1, Rail Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said in parliament in New Delhi today while
announcing the operator’s annual budget. He didn’t give a
timeframe for tying passenger fares to fuel prices.  The plan will help boost earnings for the world’s third-
largest network that is targeting an investment of 14 trillion
rupees ($259 billion) by 2020 to expand and modernize its
facilities. Bansal’s measure underscores the government’s
resolve to rein in the budget deficit by paring subsidies that
add to losses at state-owned companies.  “The fuel-linked freight increase is a good move,” said
Sonal Varma, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc in Mumbai.
“That will over time minimize their losses.”  Linking freight tariff to fuel prices will lead to an
average increase of 5 percent in rates, Bansal said. Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh’s government last month allowed state-
owned refiners to raise diesel prices on their own every month
till the deficit from below-cost sales is wiped out.  2014 Election  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, due to unveil the
federal government budget on Feb. 28, has vowed to narrow the
budget shortfall even as economic growth falters and an election
due by May 2014 adds pressure to boost spending to win the
support of voters. Chidambaram’s goal is a shortfall of 4.8
percent of gross domestic product in 2013-2014, from an
estimated 5.3 percent this year.  The railways, which carries 23 million travelers every day,
will lose 246 billion rupees in the year ending March 31 from
subsidized passenger services, Bansal said today. The operator
left passenger fares unchanged following an increase last month.  Share prices of companies that cater to the railways
plunged.  Kalindee Rail Nirman (Engineers) Ltd. (KRNE)  sank 8.7 percent
to 72.35 rupees at 2:49 p.m., bound for a five-month low.
 Texmaco Rail & Engineering Ltd. (TXMRE)  Lost 7.3 percent while  Titagarh
Wagons Ltd. (TWL)  fell 6.2 percent.  The state-owned network will borrow 151 billion rupees in
the year starting April 1, almost the same amount it aims to
raise this fiscal year. Railways plans to spend 634 billion
rupees next year, Bansal said.  Dollar Bond  The yield spread on Indian Railways’s 2017 dollar bond over
Treasuries dropped six basis points to 196, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The carrier’s revenue will rise to 1.44 trillion rupees in
the year starting April 1, compared with a revised target of
1.26 trillion rupees this year. The increase in passenger fares
last month will add 66 billion rupees in annual revenue.  The railways will add 500 kilometers (311 miles) of new
tracks next fiscal year, the minister said. India has added an
average 180 kilometers of railroads every year since gaining
independence in 1947, according to the rail ministry.  The nation currently has about 65,000 kilometers of track
network. By comparison, China plans to expand its network to
120,000 kilometers from 91,000 kilometers in the five years
ending 2015.  Indian Railways said in 2009 that it plans to carry 50
percent of the nation’s inland freight by 2020 from 35 percent.
To reach this goal, it plans to add 25,000 kilometers of track,
increase train speeds, triple procurement of four-wheeled cargo
wagons and build locomotive factories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
