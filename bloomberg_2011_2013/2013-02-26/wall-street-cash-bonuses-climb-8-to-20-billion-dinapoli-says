Wall Street’s cash bonus pool rose 8
percent to $20 billion in 2012 as profits surged, according to
projections by  New York  state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.  Employees took home an average cash bonus of almost
$121,900 last year, DiNapoli, a 59-year-old Democrat, said today
in a conference call with reporters. The pool climbed as some
firms moved up payments to 2012 to avoid paying higher federal
personal income taxes taking effect this year and as profits in
the securities industry increased three-fold, he said.  “Wall Street is still in transition, but it is slowly
adjusting to changes in its economic and regulatory
environment,” DiNapoli said. “Profits and bonuses rebounded in
2012, but the industry is still restructuring. Despite its
smaller size, the securities industry is still a very important
part of the New York City and New York state economies.”  Profits at New York Stock Exchange firms’ broker-dealer
units, the traditional measure of profitability for the
securities industry, were $23.9 billion in 2012, about three
times more than the $7.7 billion earned in 2011, DiNapoli said.
That made 2012 among the most profitable years on record.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. bank, reported its
third straight year of record profit for 2012, and  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said full-
year net income rose 68 percent. Bank earnings have been buoyed
by a surge in mortgage fees and gains in investments.  Cash ‘King’  Jefferies Group Inc., the Wall Street investment bank that
agreed to sell itself to  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , is paying
year-end bonuses in immediately available cash, the firm’s
executives said in a December memo to employees.  Global announced merger-and-acquisition volume reached its
highest level in the fourth quarter since the third period in
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue from
trading and fixed income, commodities and currencies rose 21
percent, according to analytics firm Coalition Ltd.  “Cash is king right now,” said  Jeanne Branthover , head of
the financial-services practice at Boyden Global Executive
Search Ltd., a New York-based recruiting firm. “Organizations
are recognizing that cash is important to retain their talent.”  Still, the industry continues to cope with the fallout from
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and new
regulations that followed. As of December, employment totaled
169,700 jobs, 1,000 fewer than a year earlier, DiNapoli said.
The securities industry in New York City has regained only 30
percent of the 28,300 jobs lost during the recession, he said.  Predicted Drop  As recently as October, DiNapoli predicted the 2012 bonus
pool would drop. The last time the pool shrank for  two
consecutive years  was in 2007 and 2008, at the beginning of the
global financial crisis, according to the comptroller’s office.
This year’s $20 billion pool is below the $34.3 billion peak
reached in 2006.  Morgan Stanley, the investment bank cutting staff as its
chief seeks to trim costs, is deferring bonuses for employees
who have both total pay of more than $350,000 and incentive
compensation of at least $50,000, a person briefed on the matter
said in January. The previous year, most cash bonuses were
capped at $125,000.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the second-largest U.K. lender by assets,
said in February that it cut its bonus pool, and  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest bank is paying part of some workers’
bonuses in bonds that can be wiped out.  In fiscal 2008, Wall Street accounted for more than 20
percent of New York state’s tax revenue and 12 percent of New
York City’s. By fiscal 2011, those percentages had dropped to 14
percent and 7 percent, respectively, DiNapoli has said.  DiNapoli’s bonus estimates don’t include stock options or
other deferred pay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
