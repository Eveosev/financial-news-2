Ukraine ’s early start to spring
planting and the possibility of limited winter-kill losses will
leave less acreage for late-planted crops such as corn and
sunflowers, according to Oil World.  Conditions are favorable for a pickup of Ukraine’s grain
and rapeseed crops in 2013-14, provided weather conditions
remain favorable, the Hamburg-based researcher wrote in an e-
mailed report today.  Winter grains successfully emerged from the soil on 98
percent of the planted area as of mid-February, according to Oil
World. Of the grain crop, 91 percent was in good or satisfactory
condition, it said.  “Winter crop conditions continue to improve in Ukraine,
with recent warm weather promoting additional emergence and
development of late planted crops, mainly in the southern
regions,” Oil World wrote.  Of the sprouted rapeseed, 6 percent was considered as weak
and sparse, supporting the idea of a rebound in Ukraine’s
rapeseed production this year, according to the researcher.  Farmers in Crimea have already started planting early
spring crops, mainly wheat and barley, while farmers in northern
regions are preparing to sow, aided by a lack of snow cover and
adequate soil moisture, Oil World wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
