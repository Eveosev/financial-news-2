Treasuries fell as  Federal Reserve 
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the central bank’s
unprecedented asset purchases during congressional testimony,
fueling demand for riskier assets.  Benchmark 10-year notes yields rose from a one-month low as
the central bank chief said monetary stimulus is supporting the
economic expansion with little risk of inflation or asset-price
bubbles.  U.S. debt  rallied the most since November yesterday as
investors sought the safety after inconclusive elections in
 Italy  triggered concern  Europe ’s debt crisis would intensify.
Treasury sold $35 billion of five-year securities as part of its
$99 billion in note sales this week.  “After the Bernanke talk, the bid for Treasuries faded as
the market is taking a breather,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia, which oversees $12 billion in fixed income assets.
“Government policy and the Fed are driving Treasury trading.”  The 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.88 percent as of 5:01 p.m. New York time, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 2 percent note
maturing in February 2023 lost 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 2/32.  The yield reached 1.84 percent, the lowest since Jan. 24.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks gained 0.6 percent.  Debt Returns  Treasuries of all maturities have returned 0.5 percent this
month, while losing 0.4 percent this year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. U.S. debt returned 2.2 percent in
2012.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, reached
negative 0.73 percent today, the most costly level since Jan.
23. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Treasury trading  volume  rose yesterday to $401.6 billion,
the highest level since Feb. 1, according to ICAP Plc, the
largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . Daily
volume has averaged $292.5 billion this year, compared with $240
billion in 2012.  The five-year securities drew a yield of 0.777 percent,
compared with a forecast of 0.771 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-
cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 2.85, versus 2.88 last
month and an average of 2.86 at the past 10 sales.  Market Levels  “It suggests that the secondary market is efficiently
priced.,” said  Scott Sherman , an interest-rate strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, a primary dealer. “Despite
the rally people are more than happy top still buy at these
levels. The five-year auction suggests concerns are still
alive.”  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  41.7 percent of the notes after
purchasing 39.7 percent in January. The average for the past 10
offerings is 40.9 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.3 percent of
the notes compared with an average of 13.2 percent at the past
10 auctions.  The U.S. is scheduled to auction $29 billion of seven-year
notes tomorrow. A $35 billion two-year sale yesterday drew
purchase orders for 3.33 times the amount offered, the lowest
level in 19 months.  Italy’s Vote  U.S. 10-year yields dropped as much as 11 basis points
yesterday, the biggest intraday slide since Nov. 7, after
Italian results showed pre-election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani
won the lower house by less than a half a percentage point,
while  Silvio Berlusconi , the former premier fighting a tax-fraud
conviction, won a blocking minority in the Senate.  Money manager Kenneth Heebner, convinced that a growing
U.S. economy will eventually prompt the Federal Reserve to boost
interest rates, has bet 21 percent of his CGM Focus Fund on a
decline in U.S. Treasuries. The $1.44 billion fund, which
Heebner uses to make concentrated wagers on stocks, had sold
short $300 million of U.S. Treasury bonds at the end of last
year, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. That is up from $190 million at the end of
the third quarter and $80 million halfway through last year.  The  SEC filing  showed that CGM Focus had sold short $200
million of 2.75 percent Treasuries and $100 million of 3.125
percent bonds that mature in August and February 2042
respectively.  Bernanke used his testimony to push back against colleagues
on the  Federal Open Market Committee  who favor curtailing the
$85 billion in monthly bond-buying amid concern about the growth
of the Fed’s record $3.1 trillion balance sheet.  “Bernanke put his dovish slant back out there,” said
 Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The market has the need to go higher.”  Fed policy makers cut their target for the federal funds
 rate , which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to a
range of zero to 0.25 percent in 2008. In January, they affirmed
their pledge to keep the target near zero “at least as long”
as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and inflation is
projected to be no more than 2.5 percent.  The central bank is buying $85 billion of Treasury and
mortgage bonds a month to put downward pressure on interest
rates. The Fed purchased $1.4 billion of Treasuries maturing
from February 2036 to August 2042 today.  Bernanke is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House
committee tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
