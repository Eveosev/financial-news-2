Wind-farm developers in  Brazil  may
be required to assume the costs of connecting their power
projects to the grid as the nation seeks to avoid further delays
in constructing new transmission lines.  A proposed rule will affect developers that win new
contracts to sell energy in so-called A-3 government-organized
auctions for power projects, Andre Pepitone da Nobrega, director
of the country’s power regulator Agencia Nacional de Energia
Eletrica, said today at a conference in Sao Paulo.  Brazil is shifting the onus of developing transmission
lines to developers from distributors after the utility Cia.
Hidro Eletrica do  Sao Francisco  failed to connect 26 wind farms
in the northeast before a May deadline, Nobrega said.
Transmission lines represent about 10 percent of the cost of a
typical wind farm, he said.  “We’re doing what we can to avoid a repeat of these
delays,” Nobrega said.  Chesf, a unit of state-controlled power company  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , expects to complete the three
transmission lines linking about 620 megawatts of wind farms by
the end of the year, Nobrega said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
