U.K. stocks  dropped to the lowest
level in more than two weeks, led by a selloff in financial
companies, as Italy’s election stalemate reignited concern that
the euro area’s debt crisis will worsen.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest bank by market value,
and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  both lost more than 2 percent as Italian bond
yields climbed the most in 14 months.  Schroders Plc (SDR) , Europe’s
largest publicly traded money manager, fell 3.1 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index sank 84.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to
6,270.44 at the close in  London , its lowest level since Feb. 8.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index also lost 1.3 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.5 percent.  “Italy’s election results are turning out far less clear
cut than markets would have liked, with the center-left parties
winning a clear majority,” said Jeff Taylor, head of European
equities at Invesco Perpetual in London. “Unhappy stock markets
and higher Italian bond yields are a certainty for a while as
the doubtless lengthy haggling between the political parties
takes center stage.”  The results in  Rome  showed pre-election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won the lower house by less than a half a point while
 Silvio Berlusconi , the former premier who has vowed to reverse
austerity measures, won a blocking minority in the Senate. An
Italian government requires a majority in both houses.  Italy’s Debt  The results may lead Italian President Giorgio Napolitano
to install an interim government to write a new election law
before calling further elections. Italy’s  10-year government
bond yield  climbed as much as 44 basis points to 4.93 percent,
its biggest daily increase since Dec. 19, 2011.  The increase in borrowing costs “is a clear indication
that traders are concerned that the next prime minister will not
be as pro-Europe as Monti,” said David Madden, a market analyst
at IG in London. “The Italian economy is almost as big as the
U.K., so if there are any more doubts about their financial
health we are likely to see another wave of selling, potentially
reigniting the euro-zone debt crisis.”  HSBC dropped 2.3 percent to 713 pence, its biggest selloff
since July 2012. Barclays, the  U.K.’s second-biggest bank , sank
4.7 percent to 297 pence, while Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
slid 4.3 percent to 339.5 pence.  Schroders led a decline by money managers, decreasing 3.1
percent to 1,980 pence.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  declined
2.5 percent to 424.7 pence and Man Group Plc dropped 4.3 percent
to 101.9 pence.  Provident Financial  Provident Financial Plc (PFG)  fell 3.7 percent to 1,468 pence.
The U.K.’s biggest subprime lender reported a 12 percent
increase in full-year pretax profit to 181.1 million pounds
($274 million), matching the 181 million-pound  average analyst
estimate , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  lost 3.7 percent to 2,469 pence after the
owner of Premier Inn budget hotels and Costa Coffee shops
reported like-for-like sales growth of 2.7 percent for the 14
weeks to Feb. 14. Chief Executive Officer Andy Harrison said
Premier Inn will face more competition.  Redrow Plc (RDW)  led housebuilders lower, falling 3.5 percent to
188.9 pence, even after the company reported a 50 percent
increase in first-half pretax profit to 23 million pounds. The
company said it plans a “modest final dividend” at the end of
the year. The stock had surged 18 percent from the beginning of
the year through yesterday.  Persimmon Plc declined 1.5 percent to 885.5 pence and
 Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  retreated 1.1 percent to 235.5 pence.  Sports Direct  Sports Direct International Plc (SPD)  dropped 5 percent to 409
pence after Chairman Mike Ashley sold 25 million shares in the
U.K.’s largest sporting-goods retailer at 400 pence a share.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. placed the shares via an accelerated
bookbuilding process.  St. Modwen Properties Plc sank 11 percent to 248.6 pence as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Numis Corp. placed as many as 20
million shares on behalf of the company. The proceeds will be
used to help fund the redevelopment of Nine Elms, which includes
the New Covent Garden Market site.  GKN Plc (GKN)  rallied 3.6 percent to 261.3 pence, one of 14
companies on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  to have advanced today. The supplier
