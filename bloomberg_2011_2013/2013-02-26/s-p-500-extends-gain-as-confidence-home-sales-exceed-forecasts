U.S. stocks extended gains after
data on  consumer confidence  and new home sales topped forecasts,
bolstering optimism in the world’s largest economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.7 percent to
1,497.72 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York , rebounding from yesterday’s
1.8 percent slump.    The Conference Board’s index climbed to 69.6, exceeding all
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, from a revised
58.4 in January, data from the New York-based private research
group showed today. It was the first improvement in four months
and the biggest since November 2011.  Purchases of new homes in the U.S. jumped in January to the
highest level since July 2008, showing the industry will keep
adding to growth in the economy. Sales, tabulated when contracts
are signed, surged 15.6 percent to a 437,000 annual pace,
exceeding the highest forecast in a Bloomberg survey and
following a 378,000 rate in the prior month, figures from the
Commerce Department showed. The median estimate of 72 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a rise to 380,000. Prices
climbed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
