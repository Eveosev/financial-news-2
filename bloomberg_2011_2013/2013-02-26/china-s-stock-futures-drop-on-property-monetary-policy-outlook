China ’s stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a one-month low, on speculation the
government will announce property curbs during a legislative
meeting next week and after money-market rates jumped.  Guangzhou Pearl River Industrial Development Co. slumped 4
percent after the Shanghai Securities News reported the city of
Guangzhou plans to announce housing restrictions.  Jiangxi Copper
Co. (600362)  and Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. led declines for metal and coal
producers after the China Securities Journal said in a
commentary the government may tighten monetary policy because of
excessive market liquidity and rising property prices. The
seven-day repurchase rate jumped the most in two months.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slumped 1.4 percent to
2,293.34 at the close, the lowest level since Jan. 25. The
measure rose as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The 30-day
volatility for the index jumped to the highest level since Jan.
28. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slid 1.4 percent to 2,567.59. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  lost 1.9 percent in  Hong Kong .  “There’s too much uncertainty before the National People’s
Congress,” said Xu Shengjun, an analyst at Jianghai Securities
Co. in  Shanghai . “People are worried there will be even more
tightening measures for the property sector.”  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 5.8 percent after gaining
as much as 24 percent during a bull-market rally that started on
Dec. 3. Its valuation of 9.5 times projected 12-month earnings
is the lowest since Dec. 26. The index is still up 1.1 percent
this year. Trading volumes were 9.5 percent lower than the 30-
day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  NPC Meeting  The National People’s Congress will start on March 5 and
the  Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference  on March
3. The China Securities Journal reported yesterday some property
measures will likely be announced before the meetings.  A gauge of  property stocks  in the Shanghai index plunged
2.4 percent, the most among five industry groups. Guangzhou
Pearl River, a residential real-estate developer, lost 4 percent
to 12.10  yuan , the lowest since Dec. 25. China Vanke Co. the
biggest developer, declined 1.7 percent to 10.82 yuan.  The Shanghai Securities News also reported Beijing has
completed a draft of property-control measures. Premier  Wen
Jiabao  called for home-purchase restrictions in cities with
“excessively fast” price gains last week, as a Feb. 22
government report showed new  home prices  climbed in January in
53 of the 70 cities that are tracked, compared with the previous
month’s 54, which was the most since April 2011.  Tighten Liquidity  The central bank conducted 5 billion yuan of 28-day repo
operations today, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at auctions. The seven-day repo rate rose 53
baiss points to 3.82, the most since Dec. 25, as the central
bank drained cash throgh market operations.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, sank
2.6 percent to 23.54 yuan. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the
listed unit of the nation’s biggest maker of the lightweight
metal, fell 3 percent to 4.82 yuan.  Yanzhou Coal (600188) , China’s
fourth-biggest producer, lost 3.4 percent to 17.18 yuan.  “What’s adding fuel to fire is bad earnings,” said Xu.
“Earnings that have been reported are worse than expected. If
we get any unexpected negative news at the congress, stocks may
even fall below 2,000.”  Ping An Bank Co. is scheduled to release earnings next
week, while Ping An Insurance Group Co. and China Coal Energy
Co. will report the following week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
