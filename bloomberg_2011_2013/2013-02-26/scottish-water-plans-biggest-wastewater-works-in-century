Scottish Water Ltd., the fourth-
biggest U.K. water company, is planning the largest improvement
in Glasgow’s wastewater infrastructure in at least a century.  The publicly owned utility said the 250 million-pound ($379
million) works program intends to improve the water and
environmental conditions of the River Clyde and help control
sewer flooding from heavier rainfall amid climate change.  Network upgrades and water-system works will include safety
valves on the River Clyde and tributaries such as the River
Kelvin and White Cart Water to control wastewater during storms,
as well as improvements in southwestern Glasgow to remove excess
surface water from known “pinchpoints.”  The investment will make metropolitan Glasgow’s wastewater
infrastructure “fit for the 21st century, help protect the
natural environment and meet the needs of growth and
development,” Geoff Aitkenhead, Scottish Water’s asset
management director, said in yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
