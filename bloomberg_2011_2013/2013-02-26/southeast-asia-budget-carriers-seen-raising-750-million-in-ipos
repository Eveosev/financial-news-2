Southeast Asian budget airlines may raise a combined $750 million from initial public offerings this year,  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY) ’s investment bank said, as no-frills companies take on full-service carriers with cheap fares.  Nok Airlines Co., backed by  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI) , Bangkok Airways Co., and two units of AirAsia Bhd., are among companies preparing for IPOs, said Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, chief executive officer of Maybank Kim Eng, in an e-mail. His estimate would mark the biggest year for such deals since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Economic expansion across Southeast  Asia  is enabling more people in  Indonesia , Vietnam and Cambodia to get on a plane for the first time as budget airlines challenge full-service carriers such as  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and Malaysian Airline System Bhd. Carriers are betting the growth potential is enough to convince investors to overlook share declines among other low-cost airlines that went public in recent years.  “Budget airlines are the biggest beneficiaries of the growth in  air travel ,” he said. They “tend to enjoy premium valuations when compared to legacy full service carriers.”  Budget airlines in Southeast Asia are planning the industry’s first IPOs since  Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)  and  Cebu Air (CEB)  Inc. sold shares in 2010. Tiger shares are down 52 percent since its January 2010 listing in  Singapore  while Cebu has lost 47 percent since its debut in October that year in  Manila .  Taking Share  Shares of  AirAsia (AIRA) , Southeast Asia’s biggest budget airline by market capitalization, have more than doubled since the 2004 IPO. The stock gained 8.3 percent, the most since Aug. 2010, to close at 2.86 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Tiger dropped 0.7 percent to 72.5 Singapore cents in Singapore and Cebu Air dropped 0.5 percent to 65.80 pesos.  Asia will account for 33 percent of global passengers in 2016, according to the  International Air Transport Association . Budget carriers’ market share in the Asia-Pacific region rose to 24 percent last year from 1.1 percent in 2001, according to the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an industry consultant.  The region’s passenger growth, both domestic and international, is expected to add about 380 million travelers between 2012 and 2016 to 1.2 billion,  IATA  forecast in December.  “Asia is the fastest growing market for air travel globally,” said Tengku Zafrul. “Airlines in Asia are seen as offering better returns and hence investors across the globe have a strong appetite for listings out of Asia.”  Aircraft Orders  The number of aircraft in the region’s fleet will almost triple to 13,670 in 2031 from 4,710 in 2011, according to  Boeing Co. (BA) , the world’s biggest planemaker.  “There’s not too much of a surprise why airlines are coming to the market, they need the capital,” said Andrew Orchard, an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. in  Hong Kong . “The market in general has been better this year, so it’s not a bad time to be looking at raising capital.”  Companies raised $12.9 billion in IPOs in Southeast Asia last year, led by Malaysia’s Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd. and  IHH Healthcare Bhd. (IHH) , data compiled by Bloomberg show. IPOs in the region have raised $572 million this year.  Nok Air, a budget carrier controlled by Thai Air, plans to sell shares in an IPO in August, according to Chief Executive Officer Patee Sarasin. Nok Air, based in Bangkok, may sell a 30 percent stake in itself and use the money to buy Boeing 737-8 or 737 Max planes, Patee said last month. The carrier has been profitable for the past five years, he said without disclosing the amount it aims to raise.  New Routes  Bangkok Airways, Thailand’s oldest private carrier, plans to have its IPO in the first half of this year, President Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth said Oct. 18.  Nok Air and Bangkok Air declined to comment on the progress of the offering.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to support new routes, repay debt and build a hangar at Bangkok’s  Suvarnabhumi Airport . The airline is in the initial stages of considering an order for about 30 narrow-body planes, either Airbus SAS A320neos or  Boeing 737  MAXs, Puttipong said.  AirAsia is targeting an IPO for its Indonesia budget unit in the third quarter, which may have a market value of about $1 billion when listed, according to  Tony Fernandes , group chief executive officer of the airline. The carrier is also planning to debut its long-haul arm, AirAsia X.  ‘Lot of Activity’  The Indonesian unit is “about to be listed,” Fernandes said in a Bloomberg TV interview today.  More low-cost carriers may tap the market and there could be “a lot of activity” in the sector over the next 24 months, according to Tengku Zafrul.  In the medium term, Indonesia-based PT Lion Mentari Airlines and Citilink, the low-cost airline unit of  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) , may hold IPOs, Tengku Zafrul said. Later on, India- based Indigo and Go Airlines India Pvt. could also consider listings as the country looks to ease regulatory restrictions in the aviation sector, he said.  “There’s plenty of investor demand from Asia for good aviation stories with growth potential,” said Chad Parker, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Morgan Stanley’s investment-banking unit, who focuses on transportation. “The outlook for growth in Asia is intact.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Joyce Koh in Singapore at  jkoh38@bloomberg.net ; Kyunghee Park in Singapore at  kpark3@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Philip Lagerkranser at  lagerkranser@bloomberg.net ; Anand Krishnamoorthy at  anandk@bloomberg.net
