Japan ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
down  yields  to the lowest since June 2003, on speculation
Haruhiko Kuroda will become the next central bank governor and
expand asset purchases.  Five-year rates declined to  levels  unseen since the
government started issuing the debt in February 2000, and 30-
year yields dropped for a third day. Japanese Finance Minister
Taro Aso told reporters yesterday that Kuroda would be a
“correct” choice as the chief of the  Bank of Japan. (8301)  Kuroda,
who currently leads the  Asian Development Bank , has said the BOJ
has substantial room to ease monetary policy further and
additional measures could be justified this year.  “We’re more likely to see the next BOJ governor and deputy
decide to buy more government debt,” said Takahiro Sekido, a
Japan strategist in  Tokyo  at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
who formerly worked at the BOJ.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell three basis
points to 0.675 percent at 1:15 p.m. in Tokyo from yesterday,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The price of the 0.8 percent security
maturing in December 2022 advanced 0.278 yen to 101.149.  Five-year rates declined half a basis point to 0.115
percent. Thirty-year yields fell three basis points to 1.87
percent, the least since Sept. 27. Twenty-year yields dropped
three basis points to 1.68 percent, the lowest level since Dec.
13. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery gained 0.24 to
144.91 in Tokyo, after reaching 144.95, the highest for a lead
contract since Dec. 10.  Deputy Governors  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to tap Kikuo Iwata, an
academic who has urged a ramping up in Japan’s monetary base to
end deflation, and senior BOJ official Hiroshi Nakaso, as deputy
governors, according to one government official and a ruling
coalition executive, who asked not to be named as the talks are
private. Current Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and two deputies
will step aside on March 19.  Demand for the refuge of  government bonds  increased on
concern  Italy  may require a second vote after election results
pointed to a divided parliament. The spokesman for Italy’s
Democratic Party candidate Pier Luigi Bersani said projections
of the election results “show a risk of ungovernability.”  “Italy’s election has created lots of uncertainty and is a
risk factor for financial markets,” said Sekido at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
