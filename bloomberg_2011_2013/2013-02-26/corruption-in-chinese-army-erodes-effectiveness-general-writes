Corruption in the Chinese military,
which may include officers who drive luxury cars, live in
opulent homes and pay for vacations with public funds,
undermines the army’s effectiveness, a retired major general
wrote in a commentary.  Corruption hurt  China  more than a century ago, when its
modern naval fleet was defeated by Japan, Major General Luo  Yuan 
 wrote  in the Chinese version of the state-owned Global Times
newspaper today. The newspaper is owned by the Communist Party’s
official People’s Daily.  “Combat effectiveness is more undermined by corruption
than anything,” Luo wrote. “It is hard to imagine that a
corrupt army can vanquish the enemy and win victory.”  The People’s Liberation Army has the world’s second-biggest
defense budget after the U.S., and China is expected to announce
its planned military spending for 2013 next week on the eve of
an annual session of its national parliament. Last year the
government said it would spend 670.3 billion yuan ($107.6
billion) on its military in 2012 and the country commissioned
its first  aircraft carrier .  Luo doesn’t have an operational command in the PLA and
comments on foreign policy and the military through his position
as vice president of the China Strategic Culture Promotion
Association. He set up a microblog on  Sina Corp.’s (SINA)  Weibo earlier
this month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
