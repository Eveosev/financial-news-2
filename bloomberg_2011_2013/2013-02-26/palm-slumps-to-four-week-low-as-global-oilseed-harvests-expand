Palm oil  dropped to the lowest level
in four weeks as global production of palm and soybeans is set
to climb this year on increased acreage.  The contract for May delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent
to 2,448 ringgit ($789) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest price for the most active month since Jan.
29, before trading at 2,451 ringgit by the end of the morning
session. Futures declined for a fifth day.  Palm oil will probably decline this year after Asian
producers boosted acreage and global oilseed supplies rose, said
 Dorab Mistry , a Godrej International Ltd. director who has
traded the commodity for more than 30 years. The expansion of
estates will increase output, while bad weather that disrupted
soybean supplies in 2012 will prompt farmers to ramp up
harvests, said Mistry.  Soybean oil  also fell for a fifth day.  “Mistry’s comments would have contributed to additional
bearish sentiment,” Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance
Investment Bank Bhd., said in Kuala Lumpur. “Production numbers
haven’t dropped off very significantly, so there’s not a lot of
confidence inventories would drop significantly.”  Stockpiles in Malaysia held near a record in January, the
palm oil board said. While  production  fell 10 percent, it was
still 24 percent higher than the same month last year.  World soybean harvests will reach a record 278 million tons
in 2013,  Aaron Brown , an oilseed merchandiser and trader for
Alfred C. Toepfer Ltd., said yesterday. U.S. farmers will expand
sowing, taking the harvest to an all-time high of 3.4 billion
bushels, and doubling inventories by Aug. 31, 2014 to 250
million bushels, the Department of Agriculture said Feb. 22.  Soybean oil for May delivery fell 0.9 percent to 49.98
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Its  premium  to palm
oil was $312.35. They are the most consumed oils. Soybeans for
May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $14.255 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September was little
changed at 6,786  yuan  ($1,089) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 0.4
percent to 8,390 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
