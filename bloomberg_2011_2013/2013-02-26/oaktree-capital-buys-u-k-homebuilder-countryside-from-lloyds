Oaktree Capital Management LLC (OAK)  has
bought U.K. homebuilder Countryside Properties Plc using debt
provided by seller Lloyds Banking Group.  Countryside got loans totaling 165 million pounds ($250
million) from the bank, Chairman Andrew Carr-Locke said in a
telephone interview. The five-year facilities include a 125
million-pound term loan and a 40 million-pound working capital
facility, he said.  Lloyds took control of Brentwood, U.K.-based Countryside in
2009 as part of a refinancing deal, according to a statement
from parent Copthorn Holdings Ltd. Countryside then raised 363
million pounds of three-year loans with the bank, Copthorn said.  Oaktree Capital will have a majority stake in the business
while the family of founder Alan Cherry will have a holding,
Carr-Locke said.  The transaction includes a “significant capital
injection” that will reduce its debt, Countryside said in a
 statement  on its website. The investment is expected to complete
in the next few weeks, it said.  Oaktree, the world’s largest distressed-debt investor,
plans to raise a fund in the range of 250 million euros ($326.2
million) to 500 million euros to lend to European companies,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Oaktree
was founded by Howard Marks, Bruce Karsh and three other
partners from investment firm TCW Group Inc. in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
