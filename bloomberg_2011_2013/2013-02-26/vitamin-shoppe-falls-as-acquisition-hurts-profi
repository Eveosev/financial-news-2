Vitamin Shoppe Inc. (VSI)  fell the most
since its 2009 market debut after the supplements retailer
reported fourth-quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates
and said a recent acquisition will hurt earnings this year.  The shares tumbled 19 percent to $51.44 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day drop since October 2009. The North
Bergen, New Jersey-based company had  gained  10 percent this year
through yesterday, while the Standard & Poor’s Smallcap 600
Index advanced 5.2 percent.  Vitamin Shoppe, with more than 580 company-operated stores,
said today in a statement that transaction and integration costs
related to the $50 million acquisition of Seattle-based retailer
Super Supplements Inc., which closed this month, will reduce
profit by 3 cents a share this year.  Fourth-quarter profit rose 2.8 percent to $9.68 million, or
32 cents a share, from $9.41 million, or 32 cents, a year
earlier. The average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 40 cents. Sales advanced 1.9 percent to $218.9
million. Analysts estimated $223.8 million, on average.  Results in the quarter included 8 cents a share in costs
related to  Hurricane Sandy , startup costs in  Canada  and the
Super Supplements takeover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
