Chinatrust Commercial Bank has sold
the first yuan-denominated bonds in Taiwan.  Chinatrust Commercial, a unit of Taipei-based Chinatrust
Financial Holding Co., sold 1 billion  yuan  ($161 million) of
three-year notes at a yield of 2.9 percent yesterday, according
to a company statement to the Taiwan stock exchange. That
compares with the 1.17 percent secondary-market rate on the
lender’s 2.14 percent Taiwan dollar securities due May 2016.  The debut yuan sale follows an August pact on cross-strait
currency clearing with  China ’s central bank, which allowed the
island’s lenders to offer yuan deposits onshore from Feb. 6.
BNP Paribas SA and Deutsche Bank AG have approached Taiwan’s
Financial Supervisory Commission about possible Chinese-currency
offers, according to two people familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the details are private.  The bonds will start trading on the Gretai Securities
Market in Taipei on March 12 and the funds raised will be used
for the bank’s loan operations and to replenish mid- to long-
term liquidity, according to Chinatrust’s statement.  Taiwan 
Depository & Clearing Corp. will be responsible for payments and
settlements for the notes, according to its website.  Yuan deposits at Taiwanese lenders’ domestic and offshore
units rose to 33.84 billion yuan as of Feb. 22, still far below
the 603 billion yuan of savings at Hong Kong banks at the end of
2012, data from their respective central banks show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
