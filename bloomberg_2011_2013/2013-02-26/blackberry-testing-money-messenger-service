BlackBerry (BBRY)  is testing whether the
money-transfer business will help  Canada ’s smartphone maker keep
users hooked on its instant-messaging service.  BlackBerry is beginning a pilot project with  PT Bank
Permata (BNLI) , the Indonesian bank partly owned by  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN) , to allow users to transfer money to their contacts over the
BlackBerry Messenger service, executives of both companies said
in interviews.  BlackBerry is looking to Indonesia, a country of 249
million people where it’s the leading smartphone brand, to
develop a feature it hopes can protect the messenger service
from losing customers to WhatsApp Inc. and other rival services.
The plan could lead the Waterloo, Ontario-based company into an
industry dominated by  Western Union Co. (WU)  and  MoneyGram
International Inc. (MGI)   “It’s tough to get into the market as you’ve got a lot of
competition and there are a lot of compliance and logistics
issues,” said Larry Berlin, an analyst at First Analysis Corp.
in  Chicago . “Could it be the right play if people like the
phones? Yeah, but it’s not going to be easy.”  Bianto Surodjo, head of electronic channels at the Jakarta-
based bank, said he believes BBM Money will have “a few hundred
thousand” users at Permata within 12 months. The application is
designed to be as simple as repaying a friend for lunch if she
picks up the tab, he said.  “If they want to do the payment, they just go into BBM
Money and they transfer in a simple way as if they were
chatting,” he said yesterday in a telephone interview from
Jakarta. “We want to put financial activities into customers’
habits because BlackBerry Messenger is becoming like the culture
here for people to communicate.”  Losing Subscribers  The number of BlackBerry subscribers worldwide dropped from
80 million to 79 million at the end of last quarter, after a
decade of steady growth, as sales fell 47 percent from a year
earlier. The company doesn’t provide figures for its Indonesian
subscriber base.  There are more than 60 million BBM customers worldwide,
meaning about three out of every four BlackBerry subscribers,
use its free instant-messaging service, which allows users to
see when the recipient has read a message.  BlackBerry’s stock  fell  1.4 percent to $13.06 at the close
in  New York . BlackBerry shares are down about 90 percent from
their peak in 2008, a situation the company aims to remedy with
its BlackBerry 10 devices.  Older Devices  BBM users who want to send or receive money have to
download BlackBerry Money from BlackBerry’s app store. Sending
money to another BBM user with a Permata account will be free,
while transfer to a contact who banks elsewhere will incur a
charge of 5,000 rupiah (52 cents). Permata has about 2 million
customers and operates 289 branches across Indonesia.  The trial is limited to those with an Indonesian mobile-
phone number who have a BlackBerry 5, 6 or 7 generation device.
It isn’t available for the new BlackBerry 10 devices that are
being introduced this month in  Asia , the company said. No date
has yet been announced for the flagship Z10 model in  Indonesia .  T.A. McCann, vice president of BlackBerry Messenger, said
BBM Money is one of an array of features being added to the
messaging service to boost its appeal.  “BBM was traditionally thought of as just a chat client,”
McCann said in a telephone interview . With the addition of
video to the messaging service and now BBM Money, “we’re really
trying to work hard to show clear examples of how we’re
expanding BBM well beyond just chat,” he said.  Larger Makeover  The trial is limited to one bank in Indonesia for now given
the complexity and regulatory issues involved, McCann said.  “Assuming the trial goes well, you could assume all kinds
of different expansion whether it be additional banks, addition
countries, additional devices and of course all kinds of
functionality,” he said.  BBM Money is just one feature in a larger makeover of the
company’s messaging service, and McCann said he doesn’t expect
the financial service alone to draw new customers or win back
those that had abandoned BlackBerry.  “Is somebody going to buy a BlackBerry in the  United
States  because it potentially has got BBM Money? No,” he said.
“Would they buy it in Indonesia because of BBM Money? Maybe,
but in that case we have lots of reasons why they want to have a
BlackBerry, and BBM is one of them.”  Permata’s Surodjo said he has no concerns about the
BlackBerry community shrinking in Indonesia as it’s woven into
the lives of so many Indonesians.  “We are still optimistic that usage will maintain or even
increase in coming years,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
