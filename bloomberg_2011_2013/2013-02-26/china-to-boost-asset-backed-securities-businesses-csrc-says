China  may allow more firms to
develop asset-backed securities businesses with the goal of
boosting liquidity, the nation’s market regulator said.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission will lower its
threshold for securities companies to undertake such businesses,
the CSRC  said  today on its website. Asset-backed securities
could be based on accounts receivable, credit assets, bonds,
stocks and commercial properties, it said.  The CSRC issued draft rules for the asset-backed securities
business today and asked for public feedback, according to the
statement.  China Development Bank Corp., the nation’s largest policy
bank, sold 9.27 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of asset-backed
securities, the bank said Sept. 7, in the country’s first such
sale since 2008. The difficulty of assessing risk in bonds that
are backed by loans was a major contributor to the 2008 global
financial crisis.  The CSRC will also allow more futures companies to open
business offices nationwide, according to a separate statement
posted on the regulator’s  website  today. The regulator
simplified review and approval proceedings for the office
openings, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
