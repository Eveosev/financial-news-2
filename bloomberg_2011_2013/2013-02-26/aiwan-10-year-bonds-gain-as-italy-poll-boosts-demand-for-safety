Taiwan’s government bonds rallied,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields down by the most in five
months, on demand for safety amid concern  Italy ’s elections will
worsen Europe’s debt crisis.  Stock indexes dropped across  Asia  on speculation Italy may
require a second vote after election results pointed to a
divided parliament that may complicate budget austerity efforts.
The local currency fell as global funds sold $95 million more
stocks than they bought yesterday, the most after  Thailand  among
nine Asian markets outside  Japan , according to exchange data.  “The election has caused uncertainties across the global
market,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in Taipei at
Cathay United Bank Co. “The drop in yields is especially
drastic today as people are buying back bonds cover their
positions.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 fell
more than one basis point to 1.211 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market, the most since Oct. 3. The  overnight
interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388 percent, according to
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  The island’s currency fell 0.1 percent to close at NT$29.74
per dollar, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to NT$29.625,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options,
dropped eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.05
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The island’s exports grew 18 percent in January from a year
earlier, following an 8.5 percent gain in December, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. That would be
the biggest jump since August 2010. Economists predicted a 17.6
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey.  The statistics office on Feb. 23 raised its economic growth
forecast for 2013 to 3.59 percent from 3.53 percent, as
shipments and consumption rebounded. The island’s economy grew
1.26 percent in 2012, the slowest in three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
