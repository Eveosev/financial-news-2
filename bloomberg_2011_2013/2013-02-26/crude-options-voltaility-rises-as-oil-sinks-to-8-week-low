Crude options volatility rose as oil
fell to an eight-week low before the release of a government
report that may show U.S. inventories rose.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.67 percent at 4:15 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 22.53 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped 48 cents
to $92.63 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since
Dec. 31. Prices have declined 16 percent in the past year.  U.S. crude inventories  probably  rose 2.5 million barrels
last week to 378.9 million, the highest level since July 20,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg before the Energy Information Administration report
scheduled for release tomorrow. The  American Petroleum Institute 
reported oil inventories gained 904,000 barrels last
week to 373.4 million.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $90 puts, which gained 13 cents to $1.02 a barrel on
volume of 6,674 contracts at 4:55 p.m. April $80 puts were the
second-most active with 2,534 lots. They were unchanged at 6
cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 62 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 54 percent of the
98,707 contracts traded.  April $90 puts were the most active options changing hands
yesterday, with 4,024 contracts traded. They were down 9 cents
to 89 cents a barrel. May $70 puts dropped 1 cent to 7 cents a
barrel on 2,884 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
35,663 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,301 lots and
June $90 puts at 32,331.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
