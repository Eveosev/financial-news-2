India ’s bonds fell on speculation
yields at the lowest level in 31-months will deter buyers.  The yield on the benchmark note due 2022 rose before
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram unveils the budget on
this week for the year beginning April 1. The rate dropped
earlier after the central bank announced that it will purchase
as much as 100 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) of  government
securities  due in 2014, 2016, 2022 and 2025 on March 1.  “Investors probably sold taking advantage of gains in
bonds earlier,” said Rajeev Radhakrishnan, head of fixed income
at SBI Funds Management Pvt. that manages the equivalent of $10
billion in Indian assets. “Some people also preferred to reduce
positions before the budget.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.82 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
touched 7.78 percent earlier, the lowest level since July 2010.  Chidambaram, who will present his annual budget to
parliament on Feb. 28, will seek to narrow the fiscal  shortfall 
to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the year starting
April, from this year’s goal of 5.3 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts and investors. That would be the
least since the 12 months through March 2008.  In the budget for railways presented today, Rail Minister
Pawan Kumar Bansal said he plans to link passengers fares and
freight rates with fuel prices to cut more than $4.5 billion of
losses stemming from below-cost tariffs.  Charges for shipping commodities on the network will be
linked to fuel prices starting April 1, said Bansal.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.63 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
