Hanwha Life Insurance Co. (088350) , South
Korea’s second-largest life insurer, tumbled the most on record
in Seoul trading after a shareholder sold stock at a discount.  Shares of Hanwha Life sank 9 percent to 7,250 won as of
9:56 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, the  worst performer  on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index.  Hanwha Chemical Corp. (009830)  sold about 17 million Hanwha Life
shares at 7,200 won apiece before the market opened today, Park
Jeong Hwan, who heads Hanwha Chemical’s finance team, said by
phone. That’s a 9.7 percent discount to yesterday’s closing
price. Proceeds will be used to improve finances and fund future
investments, Hanwha Chemical said in a filing yesterday.  “The discount rate was very big,” Song In Chan, an
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., said by phone today.
“Still, I think the stock price is near its bottom given its
stable earnings prospects.”  Morgan Stanley and Hanwha Investment & Securities Co.
arranged the transactions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
