President  Barack Obama  traveled to the Navy’s sole builder of aircraft carriers to drive home his argument that his political foes and their constituents will be among the hardest hit by across-the-board spending cuts that start March 1.  Obama used the backdrop of the shipyard of  Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII) . in Newport News,  Virginia , to emphasize the effect on defense industry jobs if $85 billion in automatic budget cuts for the remaining seven months of the fiscal year kick in as scheduled on March 1. With 21,000 workers, the facility is Virginia’s biggest manufacturing employer.  “The impact of this policy won’t be felt overnight, but it will be real,” Obama said today. “It’s not just restricted to the defense industry.”  House Speaker  John Boehner  staged a preemptive news conference in  Washington  earlier today where the  Ohio Republican  accused Obama of using the military as a “prop” to promote tax increases. He said the House won’t act until the Democratic majority in the Senate “gets off their ass” to pass a fiscal plan.  With three days to got before the spending reductions known as sequestration begin, there was no public sign that the White House and congressional Republicans are in negotiations on an alternative fiscal plan.  Half of the reductions will affect  defense spending , while the rest will be spread over other federal agencies. Obama and Democrats want to replace part of the cuts with higher  tax revenue , while Republicans oppose more taxes.  Economic Impact  Unless there’s a resolution in the coming weeks, the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimates that budget reductions will cause a 0.6 percentage-point reduction in growth this year. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the Senate Banking Committee today that “this additional near-term burden on the recovery is significant.”  The cuts are hitting amid signs of public optimism about the economy. The Conference Board’s consumer sentiment  index  climbed to 69.6, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, from a revised 58.4 in January. Other reports today showed  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose in the 12 months to December by the most in more than six years, and purchases of  new homes  jumped in January to the highest level since July 2008.  The House passed a proposal to avert the spending cuts last year. The measure expired when the last session of Congress ended in early January.  House Bill  “We have moved a bill in the House twice; we should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,” Boehner said. Obama is more interested in “holding rallies” than negotiating to find a way to avert the spending reductions, he said.  Virginia Republican Representative Scott Rigell, whose district includes the nearby Naval Station Norfolk and has the highest concentration of military personnel in the nation, said he disagrees with his party’s leadership on raising revenue.  Rigell, who accompanied Obama for the flight from Washington, said he’d support closing some loopholes in the  tax code  to bring more money into the Treasury.  Before Air Force One departed, Rigell said he planned to use the travel time to urge the president to offer a “specific alternative” to the sequester rather than his general call for a package that mixes new revenue with spending cuts.  “I boarded the plane knowing that some would potentially misinterpret” taking the trip with the Democratic president, Rigell said.  Mitigating Impact  While there’s little chance the sequestration can be replaced by the March 1 deadline, Rigell said there is enough time to get a compromise shortly afterward that would mitigate the impact and trim spending.  Also on the flight was Democratic Representative Bobby Scott, whose district includes the shipyard.  The Navy already has delayed the repair and overhaul of its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier  Abraham Lincoln  at the Huntington shipyard that was supposed to begin this month.  “If the Lincoln doesn’t come here by the end of March or beginning of April, we’ll be letting people go because of that,” Mike Petters, chief executive officer of Huntington Ingalls said in a Bloomberg Television interview today.  Petters introduced Obama at today’s event, saying solving the fiscal challenge like building a ship will require “all the tools in the tool bag.” Repeating a term frequently used by Obama, Petters said a “balanced” approach is needed.  Cutbacks affecting Newport News Shipbuilding would ripple across Huntington Ingalls’ suppliers in all 50 states, according to the White House.  “We’re very concerned,” said Betty Hazelwood, a pipefitter for submarines who has worked at the  Newport News  shipyard for 13 years. “We’re middle class and we really take pride in what we do. We’re all on pins and needles.”  Virginia has a high concentration of defense installations and about 90,000 civilian employees of the Defense Department would be furloughed if the full effects of the automatic cuts hit, the administration said in a statement.
