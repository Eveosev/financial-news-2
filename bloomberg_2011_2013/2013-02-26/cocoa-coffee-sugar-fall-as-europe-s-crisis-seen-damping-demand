Sugar, cocoa and coffee declined in
New York and  London  on speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will
slow demand just as producing countries may still have a lot of
the commodities to sell.  European stocks fell and Italy’s borrowing costs climbed to
a three-month high as the country’s elections stalemate spurred
concern the continent’s crisis will worsen. Coffee growers in
top producer  Brazil  had sold 67 percent of the crop by Feb. 8,
down from 79 percent a year earlier, according to researcher
Safras & Mercado. Ivory Coast, the largest cocoa grower, is
behind with sales of its crop, said  Kona Haque , an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. Brazil’s sugar millers have sold
less of their crop than usual, Rabobank International estimates.  “The general market sentiment is weighing on prices,”
 Carsten Fritsch , a commodities analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said by e-mail today. “Stock markets are lower and
risk aversion is higher as well.”  Raw sugar for May delivery slid 0.7 percent to 17.97 cents
a pound by 6:18 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, extending
a drop of 0.3 percent yesterday. Arabica coffee for delivery in
May was down 1.1 percent to $1.416 a pound and cocoa for May
delivery fell 0.9 percent to $2,123 a metric ton.  In London, white sugar for May delivery was 0.3 percent
down at $503.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe, while robusta coffee for
delivery in May fell 0.5 percent to $2,069 a ton and cocoa for
delivery in March declined 1.3 percent to 1,416 pounds ($2,150)
a ton, paring a gain of 0.7 percent yesterday.  Hung Parliament  Early results suggested  Italy ’s election would produce a
hung parliament, possibly leading to another vote. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials declined as much as 0.8
percent.  Raw sugar has fallen 7.9 percent so far this year, making
it the third-worst performer in the GSCI gauge, as supplies are
set to outpace demand for a fourth year, according to F.O. Licht
GmbH.  “In our opinion, the sugar price shouldn’t fall any
further, and is more likely to respond to negative news with
price increases,” Fritsch said.  Brazilian industry group Unica will update harvest progress
figures for the 2012-13 season later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
