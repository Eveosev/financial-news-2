Bank of  East Asia  Ltd.,  Hong Kong ’s
largest family-run lender, said 2012 profit jumped 39 percent as
trading income climbed, helping offset a decline in profit from
the mainland  China  business.  Net income rose to HK$6.06 billion ($781 million), or
HK$2.72 a share, from HK$4.36 billion, or HK$1.96, a year
earlier, the bank said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That exceeds the HK$4.91 billion average
estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Trading income and profit from securities holdings jumped
as Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng stock index rose 23 percent
last year, compared with a 20 percent decline in 2011. Pretax
profit from mainland China operations, which grew by an average
31 percent in 2010 and 2011, declined last year as the economy
slowed for the first three quarters before a rebound.  “Trading income is dependent on the market situation, it’s
difficult to tell if it will be sustained through 2013,” Grace Wu, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd., said by
telephone. “In 2013 Bank of East Asia may be under less
pressure on lending margins. Given the tighter credit supply in
China, banks in general have stronger bargaining power.”  Shares (23)  in the bank rose 1.8 percent to HK$31.45 at 1:06
p.m., their biggest intraday gain since Feb. 6, extending a 0.2
percent gain before the earnings were announced.  The third-largest Hong Kong-based lender booked a trading
profit of HK$765 million in 2012, up from HK$175 million a year
earlier. It also posted a gain on financial instruments of
HK$664 million, improving from a loss of HK$354 million the
previous year.  Bank of East Asia’s pretax income from mainland China
declined to HK$2.25 billion from a restated HK$2.37 billion a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
