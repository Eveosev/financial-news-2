Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s largest
bank, will hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting after an
investor tried to invalidate three resolutions of its regular
meeting last year.  Investors will vote April 11 in Frankfurt on approving the
use of the bank’s 2011 profit, the naming of its auditor and the
election of three persons to the supervisory board, Deutsche
Bank said today in a statement.  A Frankfurt court ruled in December that the resolutions
were invalid after a representative of a shareholder said he
wasn’t able to address all points on the May 31 meeting’s
agenda, according to a statement on the court’s  website .  The court, which didn’t identify the shareholder or her
representative, said at the time that the verdict was not
legally binding and could be appealed at a higher court.
Deutsche Bank hasn’t identified the plaintiffs and has appealed
the decision, according to the statement.  Deutsche Bank said it convened the extraordinary meeting to
“establish the required legal certainty” and ensure that the
lender can hold its annual shareholder meeting on May 23 as
scheduled. The bank will postpone the publication of its 2012
report until mid-April, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
