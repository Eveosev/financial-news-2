Deezer Inc., the French online music
service that operates in 182 countries, may expand into the U.S.
in a bid to capture more American artists.  The company is in talks with potential U.S. partners, which
may include distribution and media companies, Chief Executive
Officer Axel Dauchez said today in an interview.  “It’s definitely a big market; it’s a way to talk to a lot
of the main artists which have an international scope,” Dauchez
said in Deezer’s booth at the  Mobile World Congress  in
Barcelona.  Deezer has 26 million customers in 182 countries after a
$130 million injection from billionaire Len Blavatnik last year
facilitated a push into Brazil, Africa and the Middle East.
That’s up from 76 countries four months ago. The most
interesting places for expansion this year are in Eastern Europe
and Latin America, Dauchez said.  Deezer’s online music service, supported by ads and premium
subscriptions, competes with Spotify Ltd. and  Pandora Media Inc. (P) 
The company has grown through partnerships with social-
networking site  Facebook Inc. (FB)  as well as tie-ups with mobile-
phone operators such as  Deutsche Telekom (DTE) ’s T-Mobile,  France
Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange and EE.  The company is also preparing to announce new partnerships
with global automotive companies and to add classical music to
its offering, Dauchez said.  Deezer will probably sell shares in an initial public
offering in the future, he said, adding that the timing would
depend on market conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
