An index of U.K.  retail sales  fell
more than economists forecast to a five-month low in February,
according to the  Confederation of British Industry .  The gauge of annual sales growth dropped to 8 from 17 in
January, the London-based business lobby group said today.
Economists had forecast a decline to 16, according to the median
of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A quarterly measure
of employment also fell.  Grocers reported the largest fall in sales since November
2008, while clothing, furniture and carpet and non-store
retailers posted “strong growth,” the CBI said. An index of
expected sales for March was 9, indicating shops predict volumes
will grow at a “broadly similar” pace.  A gauge of the volume of orders placed with suppliers
plunged 34 points to minus 19 in February, the lowest since
November 2011, while a measure of sales volumes for the time of
year dropped to minus 20 from 1.  Within the quarterly report, the gauge of employment fell
to minus 7 in February from 7 in November, while an index of
selling prices climbed to 40 from 25. A measure of retailers’
outlook for the business situation in the coming three months
rose to 12, the highest since August 2010. Still, investment
intentions for the year ahead were “modestly negative,” the
CBI said.  The survey of 70 retailers was conducted between Jan. 24
and Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
