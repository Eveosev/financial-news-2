Soccer ruling body FIFA ordered
Barcelona to stop fielding six foreign players under the age of
18 because their signings don’t comply with its regulations.  South Korea’s Lee Seung Woo, 15, and Cameroon’s Patrice
Sousia, who plays in an under-13 category, are among youth-team
players who have stopped competing while Barcelona appeals the
decision, a club official said by telephone today.  FIFA didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  Under FIFA rules,  soccer clubs can only field minors
from another continent if their parents are living in the same
country for reasons not linked to soccer.  The Barcelona official didn’t provide details of the family
situation of the six children.  The six remain at Barcelona’s famed “La Masia,” or
“Farmhouse,” school, which provides education and full-board
along with soccer coaching, the official said. About one-third
of the 72 children at the school are from outside Spain. The
school developed  Argentina ’s Lionel Messi among other players
that helped Barcelona win three Champions League titles since
2006.  Messi, the four-time world player of the year, moved to
Barcelona from Argentina at age 13. Barcelona paid his metal-
worker father a salary of $50,000 for a job in the youth team
under the arrangement, El Pais newspaper reported in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
