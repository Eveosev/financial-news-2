Canadian  stocks  rose as advances by
gold producers and banks overshadowed concern  Italy ’s election
stalemate will worsen  Europe ’s debt ceiling crisis.  Bank of Montreal  added 1.3 percent after reporting higher
profit from its investment banking unit and raising its
dividend. Goldcorp Inc. and Eldorado Gold Corp. rose at least 2
percent, as the metal jumped the most in three months.  Parkland
Fuel Corp. (PKI)  lost 13 percent after an analyst with National Bank
Financial lowered his rating for the stock. Entree Gold Inc.
slid 10 percent as Mongolia’s mining ministry said it canceled
two licenses on land that forms part of the Oyu Tolgoi deposit.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  advanced 9.57
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,660.44 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
S&P/TSX has risen 1.8 percent this year. About 822 million
shares exchanged hands on Canadian exchanges today, 5.2 percent
above the three-month average.  “People are still trying to process the fact that Italy’s
vote has gone the way it is,” said  Irwin Michael ,  fund manager 
with ABC Funds in Toronto. His firm manages about C$800 million
($777.8 million). “Volatility remains and people are
skittish.”  Italian party chiefs began jockeying to forge a coalition
of rivals and head off a second vote as a political vacuum of at
least a month loomed. In the aftermath of an inconclusive
election in Italy, Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani
and ex-Premier  Silvio Berlusconi  may be seeking to avoid a
ballot that would favor populist Beppe Grillo, whose movement
was the top vote-getter in its first national contest.  Gold Rallies  Recession-scarred voters repudiated budget rigor and made
Grillo, a former comedian, a political force. Bersani won the
lower house by less than half a point while Berlusconi has a
blocking minority in the senate. No formal steps can be taken
until a new parliament convenes March 15.  Gold producers contributed most to gains in the S&P/TSX, as
five of 10 industry groups advanced. Gold jumped the most since
November as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended
the U.S. central bank’s asset purchases, boosting demand for
bullion as a hedge against stimulus-fueled inflation.  Goldcorp, the world’s second-largest gold producer by
market value, rallied 2.4 percent to C$34.44, while Eldorado
Gold Corp. added 2 percent to C$10.63.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  increased 82 Canadian cents to C$63.75
after posting adjusted earnings of C$1.52 a share, ahead of the
C$1.48 estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank,
which was the first Canadian lender to report quarterly sales,
also raised its quarterly  dividend  2.8 percent to 74 Canadian
cents a share, from 72 cents previously.  Bank Earnings  Other financial firms advanced, as  National Bank of Canada 
added 0.8 percent to C$77.89 and Bank of  Nova Scotia  climbed 0.5
percent to C$60.50. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal
Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of
Canada report results on Feb. 28.  Energy shares slumped as crude for April delivery lost 0.5
percent to $92.63 a barrel in  New York . The metal fell to its

inventories rose.  Suncor Energy Inc. dropped 1.4 percent to C$30.92 and

estimates of 36 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey. Canada’s
largest independent fuel distributor had the biggest decline in
the benchmark index.  Trevor Johnson, an analyst with National Bank Financial,
lowered his rating for the stock to sector perform from
outperform while cutting his price target to C$20 from C$21 due
to the “light” earnings.  Calfrac Well Services Ltd. slumped 5.2 percent to C$24.85.

share, missing the average analyst estimate of 32 cents.  Entree Gold tumbled 5 Canadian cents to 45 cents after

Tinto Group, its partner in Oyu Tolgoi, transfer all licenses
connected to the mine to the venture between the government and
Rio. That included Entree Gold, which is 23.6 percent owned by
Rio.  Rio controls 64 percent of the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold
deposit, the world’s biggest under construction and set to start
production in June.  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., (TRQ)  which is
developing Oyu Tolgoi and is a subsidiary of Rio, lost 1.5
percent to C$6.58.  BlackBerry (BB) , formerly Research In Motion Ltd., slipped 1.1
percent to C$13.33, paring earlier losses of up to 4.2 percent.
