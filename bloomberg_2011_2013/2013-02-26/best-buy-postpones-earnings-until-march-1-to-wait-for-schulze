Best Buy Co. (BBY) , the world’s largest
consumer electronics retailer, postponed its fiscal fourth-
quarter earnings release by one day until March 1 to see whether
founder Richard Schulze bids for the company.  Best Buy “wants to allow for the expiration of the period
of time that Schulze has to respond to the company,” Jeffrey
Shelman, a company spokesman, said today by telephone. The
retailer had planned to report earnings Feb. 28, the deadline
for Schulze to make an offer.  Schulze, who proposed a buyout of $24 to $26 a share in
August, has worked with three private-equity firms -- Cerberus
Capital Management LP, TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners
LP -- to arrange financing, people familiar with the matter have
said. In December, the company extended the period for him to
conduct due diligence through February.  David Reno, a New York-based spokesman for Schulze, didn’t
immediately reply to telephone messages and an e-mail seeking
comment.  Best Buy fell 2.9 percent to $16.50 at 3:36 p.m. in  New
York . The shares climbed 43 percent this year through yesterday
after sinking 49 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
