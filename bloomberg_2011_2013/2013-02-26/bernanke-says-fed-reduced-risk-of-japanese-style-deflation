Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said today the Fed’s record stimulus reduced for the
U.S. a deflation threat similar to the decline in prices
impairing economic growth in  Japan .  “Our policies have also had the effect of greatly reducing
any risk of deflation, which at the moment doesn’t seem like
much of a concern,” Bernanke said today in testimony to the
Senate Banking Committee in Washington. “It’s hard to explain
to people why inflation that’s too low is a problem, but if it’s
too low you run the risk of a Japanese-style situation where
prolonged  deflation  is a barrier to economic growth and
stability.”  The Fed chairman also said he supports efforts by Japan to
halt a decline in prices.  “I think that they should try to get rid of deflation,”
he said. “I support their attempts to get rid of deflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
