 The Republic of Congo is set to
increase crude exports in April to eight lots, two more than
next month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The country will ship six 920,000 barrel consignments of
Djeno grade, the same as in March, as well as two N’Kossa
cargoes, according to the plan. No N’Kossa crude is due to be
exported next month.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
