Italian voters delivered a
“catastrophe for  Europe ” by casting more than half their
ballots for two candidates opposed to an austerity-based remedy
to the debt crisis, Luxembourg Deputy Prime Minister Jean Asselborn said.  “This is a catastrophe for Europe for two reasons,”
Asselborn said today in a telephone interview. “There are a lot
of people in  Italy , in Europe, who think that Europe is at fault
for the problems in Italy. Europe is the answer to what needs to
be done. Second, I have very serious doubts that with populism,
it will be possible to find a solution to create a certain
stability in Italy.”  Italians, voting in the first general election since 2008,
withdrew support from lawmakers who backed outgoing Premier
 Mario Monti ’s 15-month program of deficit reduction. The four-
way race ended inconclusively after Beppe Grillo, a self-
described populist, and former premier  Silvio Berlusconi , built
blocking parliamentary minorities and denied a clear path to
government for Monti or Pier Luigi Bersani.  “I am not defending Monti or Bersani,” said Asselborn.
“I cannot see what the plan of Berlusconi or of Grillo is to
solve the problem.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
