Thailand ’s government bonds advanced
on speculation the improving economy will lure more funds from
overseas. The baht was steady before trade data tomorrow.  The 10-year yield fell to a two-week low after
international investors  bought  $2.1 billion more sovereign debt
than they sold this month through Feb. 22, Thai Bond Market
Association data show. Exports climbed 13 percent in January
from a year earlier, compared with a monthly average of 3.9
percent in 2012, while imports jumped 19 percent, according to
the median estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
central bank held its policy rate at 2.75 percent last week.  “Economic conditions have been improving but there’s no
scope for a rate hike any time soon, making it easier for
foreign investors to buy the bonds to bet on strong growth,”
said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for
 Economic Research  in  Tokyo . “The strong economy also means an
increase in imports, balancing demand for the baht and the
dollar and helping to keep the currency in a tight range.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.59
percent as of 8:37 a.m. in Bangkok from Feb. 22, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since Feb.
12. Onshore markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  Gross domestic product increased a record 18.9 percent in
the fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with a revised
3.1 percent gain in the previous three months, the National
Economic & Social Development Board said on Feb. 18. GDP rose
6.4 percent in 2012.  The baht was unchanged at 29.85 per dollar from Feb. 22,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, dropped eight basis points to 5.25 percent, the lowest
level in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
