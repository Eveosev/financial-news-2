The cost of insuring against default
on European bank debt surged to the highest in three months on
concern deadlock in  Italy ’s elections will trigger a flight from
risky assets as a political vacuum roils markets.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on 25 banks and insurers climbed 12 basis points to 163, at
11:30 a.m. in  London , the highest since Nov. 28 and headed for
the biggest monthly increase since May. Contracts insuring
Italy’s bonds rose 43 basis points to a 2 1/2-month high of 293,
the biggest jump since December 2011.  Italy’s inconclusive election re-ignited jitters over
 Europe ’s sovereign crisis, sparking concern a rejection of
austerity measures will spill into other heavily indebted
countries. Italy faces months of political turbulence which may
see President Giorgio Napolitano install an interim government
to write a new election law as the prelude to another vote.  “Gridlock in parliament means gridlock in the economy,”
 Alberto Gallo , the head of European macro credit research at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London, wrote in a client
note. “The longer the instability lasts, the more the recession
can deepen, pushing up unemployment, defaults and bad loans. In
the worst-case scenario, the weaker banks could see deposit
outflows re-emerge.”  Intesa Sanpaolo  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  was the worst performer in the
financial default-swaps index, with contracts on Italy’s second-
biggest lender jumping as much as 38 basis points to 327, the
highest since Nov. 19.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s No. 1 bank, was the second biggest
climber, rising as much as 34 basis points to 355, the highest
since Nov. 20. Swaps tied to  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , the
country’s biggest insurer, rose 25 basis points to 240, the
highest since Feb. 7.  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , the nation’s biggest phone company, may
be “disproportionately impacted” by the political deadlock,
according to Sam Morton, an analyst at Mizuho International Plc
in London. The company put on hold a sale of hybrid securities
that it needs to bolster finances until after the election.  Swaps insuring the Milan-based company climbed 33 basis
points to 363, the highest in five months, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. Contracts on Italy’s government bonds
pared their increase, rising 41 basis points to 291.5.  Finmeccanica Bonds  Securities issued by  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , the country’s
largest aerospace and defense company, and  Enel SpA (ENEL)  led declines
in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Non-Financial  index .
Finmeccanica’s 600 million-euro 5.25 percent bonds due 2022
slumped 1.8 percent to 98 cents on the euro, the lowest since
Feb. 12.  Italy’s largest utility’s 1 billion-euro 4.875 percent
notes due 2023 dropped 1.7 percent to 102.7 cents on the euro,
also the lowest since Feb. 12, Bloomberg data show.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on investment-grade
companies rose seven basis points to 120, the highest since Nov.
30. The  Markit iTraxx Crossover Index  of swaps on 50 companies
with mostly speculative-grade ratings climbed as much as 26
basis points to 470, the highest this year before paring the
gain to 465 basis points.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
