Brazil  may hold four auctions for
contracts to sell power from new projects this year, up from one
last year, as distributors seek to meet future energy demand,
according to a wind trade group.  The government may also revise its current auction format
so developers planning projects that produce power from
different sources and in different regions won’t compete against
each other, Elbia Melo, president of  Associacao Brasileira de
Energia Eolica , said at a conference in  Sao Paulo  today.  Lower than expected economic growth in 2012 and uncertainty
among power distributors over future  energy supply  drove down
the number of contracts sold in auctions last year, she said.  “The scenario is completely different in 2013,” Melo
said. Distributors in Brazil signed contracts for 574 megawatts
of new capacity last year, compared with 5,174 megawatts in
three auctions in 2011, according to the country’s energy
research agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica. More than half
of 2011 capacity sold was from wind farms.  Brazil hasn’t determined how many auctions to hold this
year, Altino Ventura Filho, secretary of energy planning and
development for the Ministry of Mines and Energy, said today in
an interview. In the country’s energy auctions, developers bid
down the price at which they are willing to sell power from
planned projects and the lowest prices win contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
