Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner, added  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  executive John Herron to its
board, bringing the total number of members to 16.  Herron, the chief executive officer of Entergy’s nuclear
unit, will retire from that company on March 31, Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Duke said in a statement today.  Duke agreed to add board members as part of a November
settlement with North Carolina regulators probing the company’s
change of CEOs upon the closing of its $17.8 billion purchase of
Progress Energy last year.  Herron will be appointed to the nine-member board committee
that will recommend a replacement for Chairman and CEO  Jim Rogers , who has agreed to step down by the end of the year, Dave
Scanzoni, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. The settlement
called for a board member “not previously affiliated” with
either Duke or Progress to serve on the committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
