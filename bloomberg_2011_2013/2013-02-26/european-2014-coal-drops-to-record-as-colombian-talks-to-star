European coal for next year fell to
a record as workers at Colombia’s Cerrejon mine are set to start
talks aimed at ending a strike that has reduced supply from
South America’s biggest producer of the fuel.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp dropped as much as 50 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$97.90 a metric ton, the lowest level since the contract started
trading in January 2010, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. It traded at $98.25 a ton at 2:45 p.m. London time.  Talks between striking workers and management at the mine
will start at 2 p.m. local time, Igor Diaz, head of the
Sintracarbon union, said today.  Supply disruptions in Colombia, including the strike at
Cerrejon, its largest mine, have affected 84 percent of the
country’s thermal coal exports, according to Michael Hsueh, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. The country exported 79.4 million
tons of coal last year, of which 55 percent went to European
Union countries, he said in a Feb. 15 report.  Coal for delivery in March fell for a fourth day, dropping
0.7 percent to $88.90 a ton.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
