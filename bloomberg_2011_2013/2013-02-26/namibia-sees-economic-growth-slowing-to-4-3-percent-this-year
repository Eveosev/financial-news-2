Namibia ’s economy is expected to
expand 4.3 percent this year, down from 4.6 percent in 2012,
Finance Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.  Growth of 4.4 percent is expected in 2014 and 2015,
Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said in her budget speech today in the
capital, Windhoek.  Namibia is the world’s biggest producer of offshore
diamonds. Mining and other primary industries expanded 4 percent
in 2012 and are expected to grow three percent over each of the
next three years, according the finance minister.  She expects the government to spend 47.6 billion Namibian
dollars ($5.4 billion) this year and collect 40 billion dollars,
resulting in a budget deficit of 6.4 percent of gross domestic
product. The gap was 2.8 percent last year.  “Government intends to finance the deficit through a
combination of a drawdown on accumulated cash reserves and
borrowing mainly from domestic sources,” Kuugongelwa-Amadhila
said.  Major projects the government intends funding this year
include the expansion of the Walvis Bay port and the
construction of a desalination plant in the arid Erongo region
in Namibia’s uranium belt, where water demand has surged due to
an expansion in mining.  The tax rate for non-mining companies will be cut to 33
percent this year, from 34 percent last year, and to 32 percent
in 2014 to encourage investment.  The government intends introducing legislation to
parliament this year that will limit foreign ownership of banks,
Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
