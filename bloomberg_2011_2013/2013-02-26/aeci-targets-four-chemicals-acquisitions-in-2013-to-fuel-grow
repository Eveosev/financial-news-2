AECI Ltd. (AFE) , a South African
manufacturer of explosives and chemicals, is seeking
acquisitions in the chemical industry to fuel a growth rate that
exceeds the domestic economy.  “The only way to grow above South  Africa ’s gross domestic
product is through acquisitions,” Chief Executive Officer-
designate Mark Dytor said in a phone interview from Johannesburg
today. “We are targeting four acquisitions this year.”  South Africa’s economy slowed to 2.5 percent last year from
3.5 percent in 2011 after rising unemployment and an outbreak of
labor unrest hampered growth. In January, the Reserve Bank cut
its forecast for economic growth this year to 2.6 percent from
2.9 percent.  AECI will target chemicals companies with annual earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 25
million rand ($3 million) to 150 million rand, Dytor said. He
expects to pay four times to eight times Ebitda for each
company. The segment is “very diversified,” he added, covering
industries such as mining, agriculture and food and beverages.
Deals would be financed from existing funds.  AECI’s net income declined 19 percent to 630 million rand
($71.5 million) in 2012 after labor strikes in the mining,
agricultural and transport sectors cost more than 100 million
rand in earnings, the company said in a statement today. Sales
increased 11 percent to 14.9 billion rand, with more than half
coming from chemicals.  The 2013 performance “will be better” than last year,
Dytor said, adding that 2012 was “the year where we worked the
hardest for the littlest results.”  Healthy Recovery  AECI shares were up 5.1 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, their biggest daily gain since November, and
reached an 11-month high of  94.05 rand.  More than 620,000 shares
traded, almost four times the three-month daily average.  “We will see a healthy recovery for the company as South
African platinum output is expected to rise,” David Lerche, an
analyst at Avior Research Pty Ltd., said in a phone interview.
“Fewer strikes in the mining industry will help boost volumes
at both AECI’s explosives and chemical divisions.”  Lerche expects earnings to be “significantly higher in
2013 as the company recovers off a low base” then slowing to
“more normal levels in 2014 and 2015.”  Dytor, 50, joined AECI almost 30 years ago as a sales
representative in the chemical services unit. He will replace
Graham Edwards, who is retiring, as CEO as of March 1.  Cost Reductions  AECI plans to cut costs to achieve a 10 percent trading
margin in the explosives segment this year, compared with 6.8
percent of sales in 2012, Dytor said. “We are upbeat about
Africa, with sales to countries including Zambia, Burkina Faso,
 Ghana  and  Zimbabwe  with three to four big contracts for the next
two years.”  Improved earnings for 2013, excluding acquisitions, will be
partly led by growth in the manufacturing industry and a better
performance from the group’s property division, which expects an
increase in projects, Dytor said.  AECI has a 46 percent weight in the 3-member FTSE/JSE
Africa Chemical index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The gauge has risen 9.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
