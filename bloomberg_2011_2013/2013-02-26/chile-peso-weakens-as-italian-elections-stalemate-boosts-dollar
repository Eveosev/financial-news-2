Chile ’s peso declined as the
inconclusive result of Italian elections spurred concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen, sapping global growth.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 473.5 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close in Santiago. The U.S. currency rose against most of its
major counterparts on demand for a refuge.  “It’s related to what’s happening in the international
environment, especially Europe, today and the Italian
elections,” said Sebastian Senzacqua, an economist at Bice
Inversiones in Santiago. “Lots of currencies are depreciating
and that includes ours, which isn’t a safe haven.”  European stocks fell and  Italy ’s borrowing costs climbed to
a three-month high as the country’s elections signaled the
world’s third-largest debtor may not continue with cost-cutting
reforms. The stalemate threatens to derail 15 months of
austerity under Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government,
reviving speculation the country will struggle to pay its debt.  Chile’s two-year swap rate in pesos fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.16 percent. It earlier touched a
two-month low of 5.14 percent.  The one-year breakeven inflation rate fell two basis points
to 2.98 percent after Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said the
government would temporarily cut fuel tax to ease price
increases.  Traders in the forwards market for unidades de fomento,
Chile’s inflation-linked accounting unit, are pricing in 0.24
percent price increases this month from last. That’s down from
0.25 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
