William Mejia, who worked as a
Dubai-based equities analyst at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , has left
the bank, according to two people familiar with the situation.  Mejia covered Saudi Arabian banks at Credit Suisse, the
people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because details
of Mejia’s departure haven’t been made public. Sofia Rehman, a
spokeswoman at  Credit Suisse in   London , declined to comment.  Credit Suisse is among international banks that reduced
operations in Dubai last year as equity trading hovered near a
six-year low and clients postponed initial public offerings.
Credit Suisse is shrinking its Dubai operations in favor of
Riyadh and Qatar, a person with knowledge of the plans said in
December.  Credit Suisse’s second-largest shareholder is the Qatar
Investment Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
