Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , the U.K.’s
largest electronics retailer, said it has closed all of its
Pixmania stores and reduced its online markets to 14 from 26 as
it seeks to turn around the unprofitable unit.  Pixmania  has closed about 30 outlets, including stores in
Spain, Portugal and Belgium last month and 10 shops in France
last weekend, spokesman Mark Webb confirmed by phone. Online
Pixmania operations will continue in those countries. The
company has exited 12 online markets across  Austria ,  Switzerland 
and eastern Europe, he added.  Dixons bought most of the outstanding minority of Pixmania
in August after the division reported a loss of 20 million
pounds ($30 million) in the year ended April 28. The retailer is
reducing its operating markets and scaling back the product
offering to electronics such as tablet computers and cameras and
dropping beds, jewelry and baby clothes.  Le Figaro newspaper reported today the retailer closed 10
French stores and fired 150 employees, citing Pixmania’s chief
Phil Birbeck.  To contact the reporter on this story:
