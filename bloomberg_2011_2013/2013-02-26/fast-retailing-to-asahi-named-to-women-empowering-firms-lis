Fast Retailing Co. (9983) ,  Asia ’s largest
apparel seller, and Nissan Motor Co. are among the Japanese
companies that do the most to empower female employees,
according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The world’s largest bourse outside the U.S. selected those
companies and 15 others for its list of firms that provide child
care services and career advancement opportunities for female
employees, the bourse said in a statement yesterday.  “Expectations are increasing that women will help revive
the Japanese economy,” said Hiroki Kawai, an official at  Japan
Exchange Group Inc. (8697) , which operates the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The list was compiled with the help of the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry and is the exchange’s third
specialty selection. The bourse has said it expects the rosters
to encourage trading, which plunged 58 percent on the first
section to 307 trillion yen ($3.34 trillion) in the six years
ended Dec. 31.  “We started by picking a theme that would make investors
want to cheer companies on by investing,” Kawai told reporters
yesterday in  Tokyo . He said it can be difficult for individual
investors to carefully select from the more than 2,000 companies
on the Tokyo bourse.  The exchange initially chose as many as two top companies
from each of 33  industry sub-sectors , then narrowed the
selection based on two criteria: Promoting women to management
positions and offering support allowing a balance of work and
family needs.  Patents, ESG  Last year, the bourse selected 10 firms with exceptionally
valuable patents and a roster of 15 that showed the most
awareness of environmental, social and governance issues.  The list of patent-value companies has gained 14 percent
this year as of yesterday’s close in Tokyo, compared with the
9.7 percent advance for the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.
The ESG-list companies have also risen 14 percent this year.  The women-empowerment roster includes: Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group,  Nikon Corp. (7731) ,  Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) ,  KDDI
Corp. (9433) ,  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015) ,  Kao Corp. (4452) ,  Sekisui House Ltd. (1928) , Asahi
Glass Co.,  Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. (5110) , Daido Steel Co.,
 Tokyu Corp. (9005) ,  Maruha Nichiro Holdings Inc. (1334) , Sumitomo Metal Mining
Co. and  Daikin Industries Ltd. (6367)   The exchange labeled the women-empowering companies
selection the “Nadeshiko” list, adopting the nickname for
 Japan ’s national women’s soccer team, which won the  World Cup  in
2011. Nadeshiko is also Japanese for a type of flower.  Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average had its best
performance in seven years in 2012, jumping 23 percent. That
helped double the daily trading average to 2.2 trillion yen a
month in January from 1.14 trillion yen in September, the
exchange’s statistics showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
