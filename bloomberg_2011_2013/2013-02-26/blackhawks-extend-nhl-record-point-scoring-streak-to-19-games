Marian Hossa’s overtime goal gave
the Chicago Blackhawks a 3-2 win against the Edmonton Oilers and
extended their record streak of scoring at least one point in
all 19 National Hockey League games this season.  Chicago leads the NHL with 16 wins and three overtime
losses for 35 points. The NHL’s longest previous point-scoring
streak to start a season had been 16 games, by the 2006-07
Anaheim Ducks team that went on to win the  Stanley Cup .  Hossa scored one minute, 44 seconds into overtime last
night in Chicago as the Blackhawks won their sixth straight game
and ninth of their last 10.  Patrick Kane  and Viktor Stalberg
added goals for the Blackhawks, who ended a three-game losing
streak against the Oilers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
