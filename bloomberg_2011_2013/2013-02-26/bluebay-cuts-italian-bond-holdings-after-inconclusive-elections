BlueBay Asset Management Ltd., which
oversees $47 billion, cut its holdings of Italian bonds after
inconclusive results in the nation’s elections this week,
according to Russel Matthews, a London-based money manager at
the firm.  “We were hoping for, and expecting, a more benign
outcome,” he said in a phone interview today. “This is a messy
scenario and is going to provide some volatility in the markets
over the next couple of weeks. We are now underweight on Italian
bonds, after being neutral going into the election.”  Being underweight means owning a smaller percentage of the
bonds than is contained in benchmark indexes used to monitor a
fund’s performance.  Italy’s  10-year bond yield  climbed 31 basis points to 4.80
percent as of 12:39 p.m. London time, after results showed pre-
election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won the lower house by less
than a half a percentage point, while former premier Silvio
Berlusconi gained a blocking minority in the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
