Copper climbed for a second day as
industrial metals rose amid speculation that demand in  China ,
the largest user, will increase in March.  The metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.6
percent to $7,880 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,871.25 at 11:13 a.m. Shanghai time. The May
contract on the Comex in New York gained 0.4 percent to $3.5735
per pound while futures for June delivery on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange rose 0.3 percent 57,320  yuan  ($9,198) a ton.  Consumption of metals usually rises in March as fabricators
resume operations after the Chinese New Year holidays and
temperatures rise in northern parts of the country. Refined
copper  imports  gained to 243,174 tons in January from 238,828
tons in December, customs data showed yesterday.  “Given the upcoming seasonal demand, prices should find
some support at the current levels,” He Shan, an analyst at
Galaxy Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing. “Still,
concerns over  Europe  and China’s property controls are limiting
demand.”  The government completed a draft of property-control
measures, which will be released after the central government
issues more detailed policies, Shanghai Securities News reported
today. The city of Guangzhou also plans to announce housing
curbs, the report said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
