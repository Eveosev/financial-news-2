Cocoa futures fell the most in two
weeks on concern that persistent debt woes will erode demand in
 Europe , the world’s biggest chocolate consumer. Sugar and orange
juice also slid, while coffee and cotton advanced.  Italy’s equities and bonds fell on an election deadlock,
and the cost of insuring the nation’s debt against default
climbed to the highest in 2013. Europe is heading for a second
straight year of recession.  “With Europe being such a large consumer of chocolate,
problems there are going to take any bullish ideas off the table
for the time being” for cocoa, Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview.  Cocoa for May delivery fell 1.4 percent to $2,112 a metric
ton at 11:23 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A close at
that price would mark the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since Feb. 11.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery slid 0.6 percent to
17.98 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery slumped 2.1 percent
to $1.27 a pound, heading for the first decline in a week.  Through yesterday, the price gained 11 percent this year.
 Florida ’s citrus belt will get below-normal temperatures for two
weeks starting today, potentially threatening crops, according
to MDA Information Systems Inc. in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  Brazil  is the largest orange grower, followed by Florida.  Coffee futures for May delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$1.439 a pound.  Cotton futures for May delivery advanced 0.1 percent to
81.81 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
