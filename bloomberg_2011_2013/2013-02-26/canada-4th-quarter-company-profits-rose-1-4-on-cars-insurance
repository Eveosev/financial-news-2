Canadian corporate profits increased
1.4 percent in the fourth quarter, led by gains by insurance
firms and car manufacturers.  Operating profits rose to C$72.5 billion ($70.6 billion) in
the October-December period from a revised C$71.5 billion in the
previous quarter,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Profits are down 1.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011.  Thirteen of 22 industries reported higher earnings in the
quarter, with car manufacturing recording a 33.2 percent gain,
Statistics Canada said. Profits for the oil and gas industry
fell 22.7 percent, while mining profits were down 18 percent.
Operating profits for petroleum and coal products manufacturers
declined 26.5 percent.  Earnings for all non-financial companies rose 2.1 percent
to C$53.1 billion in the fourth quarter, according to the
report. Financial company profits declined 0.4 percent to C$19.4
billion, as a 29.7 percent gain by insurance companies didnâ€™t
offset a drop in profits at banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
