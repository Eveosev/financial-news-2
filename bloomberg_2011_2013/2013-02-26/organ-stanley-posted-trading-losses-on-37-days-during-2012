Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
biggest brokerage, lost money in its trading businesses on 37
days last year, down from 64 days in 2011 and the fewest since
2007.  The bank’s traders lost money on 10 days in the fourth
quarter, up from eight in the third quarter, the New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. Morgan Stanley made
more than $100 million on 23 days in 2012.  Trading revenue at the 10 largest global investment banks
rose 13 percent last year, according to data from industry
analytics firm Coalition Ltd., as concerns about  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis faded and the U.S. economy grew. Still,
Morgan Stanley’s trading revenue dropped 10 percent as clients
shied away from dealing with the firm during the second quarter
amid a debt-ratings downgrade from Moody’s Investors Service.  In January, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54,
announced plans to cut annual expenses by $1.6 billion over the
next two years and reduce the amount of capital used by the
fixed-income trading business as he seeks to double return on
equity even without improvement in markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
