Peru’s bond yields rose to match
their highest level this year as the election stalemate in Italy
renewed concern about  Europe ’s ability to deal with its debt
crisis, diminishing demand for higher-yielding assets.  “It’s external events and the volatility caused by the
outcome of the Italian elections,” Felipe Hernandez, an
economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said by phone
from  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Foreign investors hold more than
half of the total amount outstanding of the local bonds, so
while those holdings have been resilient, they are more
vulnerable to changes in global sentiment than others in the
region.”  Yields on Peru’s 7.84 percent bonds due in 2020 increased
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 3.89 percent,
matching the high for 2013 touched on Jan. 8. Foreign investors
held 69 percent of the  Peru  bonds due in 2020 at the end of
January, according to Finance Ministry  data .  Peru will auction tomorrow at least 800 million soles ($310
million) of bonds due in 2023 and 2042, the Finance Ministry
said today on its website. The ministry may sell as much as 1.3
billion soles of bonds and has the option of selling extra bonds
in a second round should demand exceed the amount offered by 25
percent or more. If investors place orders for more than twice
the amount of bonds offered, the government may increase the
offering by 50 percent to 1.95 billion soles.  In a decree published yesterday in its official gazette,
Peru said it would pay back as much as $1.68 billion of debt it
owes the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. The
repayment will be offset by new borrowing in soles.  The sol depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 2.5845 per
U.S. dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dollar climbed on demand for a refuge after  Italy ’s
deadlocked elections signaled the world’s third-largest debtor
may not continue with cost-cutting reforms. The stalemate
threatens to derail 15 months of austerity under Prime Minister
Mario Monti’s government, reviving speculation the country will
struggle to pay its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
