Rwandan President  Paul Kagame 
swapped his finance minister and central bank governor to help
accelerate his plan to develop the East African nation’s
economy, Cabinet Affairs Minister Protais Musoni said.  Finance Minister John Rwangombwa will become head of the
National Bank of  Rwanda , whose governor, Claver Gatete, will
take over the Treasury portfolio, the Rwandan presidency said in
a statement e-mailed today from the capital, Kigali. He also
appointed ministers in the infrastructure, refugee and disaster
management, and family and gender promotion departments.  “The president can change his team to speed-up his
agenda,” Musoni said in a phone interview.  Kagame, who has been president of Rwanda since 2000, plans
to transform the tea- and coffee-growing country into a middle-
income economy by 2020 and is targeting annual economic growth
of 7 percent. The plan includes lifting all Rwandans out of
poverty by 2017, developing infrastructure such as transport
links and energy supplies, and promoting regional integration.  The new ministers should “bring their unique abilities to
their jobs,” Kagame told lawmakers in Kigali today.  Rwanda’s economy, which is still recovering from a 1994
genocide in which about 800,000 died, doubled in size in the
nine years through 2010, according to the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
