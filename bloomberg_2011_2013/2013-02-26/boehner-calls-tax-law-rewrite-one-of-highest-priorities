U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  said
one of his “highest” priorities is to overhaul the U.S. tax
system.  In remarks prepared for a speech to the Credit Union
National Association in Washington today, Boehner said Congress
should curtail tax breaks “as part of tax reform that lowers
rates and helps create jobs.”  “It’s time we shift the balance of power from the tax
collector to the taxpayer,” Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said
in prepared remarks. The speaker said he supported efforts to
rewrite the  tax code  by Michigan Representative  Dave Camp ,
chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.  Boehner reiterated his opposition to higher tax revenue.  “The president has a different view: The first thing he
wants to do about taxes is have more of them,” Boehner said,
adding that Congress passed higher taxes for top earners in
January as part of a deal to avert tax increases for all income
levels.  “Higher tax rates are not the answers to our problems.
Spending is the problem, and spending cuts are the solution,”
Boehner said.  Boehner is reserving the bill number H.R. 1 for the rewrite
of the U.S. tax system, said  Kevin Smith , a spokesman for the
Ohio Republican. In the last Congress, that bill number was used
for Republicans’ attempt to cut discretionary spending. In 2009,
then-Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat, reserved H.R.
1 for the economic stimulus law.  To contact the reporters on this story:
