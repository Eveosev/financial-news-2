The Swiss franc rose to a six-week
high against the euro as speculation  Italy  will require a second
vote after inconclusive elections boosted demand for the
relative safety of Switzerland’s currency.  The franc advanced for a fifth day versus the euro as
Italy’s pre-election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won the lower
house by less than a half a percentage point while Silvio Berlusconi, the former premier fighting a tax-fraud conviction,
won a blocking minority in the Senate.  “The Swiss franc is the obvious ‘victim’ to the risk-
aversion trade,” said Peter Rosenstreich, chief foreign-
exchange strategist at Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva. “The
Italian story is the only story that is driving markets right
now. The franc is the risk-off trade.”  The Swiss currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.2169 per
euro at 9:08 a.m. Zurich time after climbing to 1.2120, the
strongest level since Jan. 10. The franc gained 0.1 percent to
93.08 centimes per dollar.  The Swiss National Bank imposed a ceiling on the franc of
1.20 per euro in September 2011 to help exporters and fend off
deflation after it surged toward parity with the common
currency.  “As long as the fiscal and structural problems of the euro
region are unresolved, the threat of sudden, returning upward
pressure on the franc isn’t over,” central bank President
Thomas Jordan said last week.  The euro weakened against all except two of its 16 major
counterparts on speculation political turmoil in  Europe  will
prompt investors to sell the bonds of the region’s most-indebted
nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
