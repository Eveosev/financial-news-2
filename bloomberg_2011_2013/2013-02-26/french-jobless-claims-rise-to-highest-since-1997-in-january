French jobless claims rose for the
21st straight month as the economy failed to grow and the Labor
Ministry changed how it calculates its data.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
43,900, or 1.4 percent, in January to 3.169 million, the
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. Without
the new accounting method, the number rose by 22,800 or 0.7
percent to 3.148 million.  Economists predicted an increase of 17,500, according to
the median of four forecasts gathered by  Bloomberg News .  With the changes in calculation, the increase brings
jobless claims to their highest since July 1997. Under the
previous way of counting, itâ€™s the highest since October 1997.  The European Commission last week estimated that the French
economy will grow 0.1 percent this year, compared with a
government estimate of 0.8 percent that several ministers had
already said  France  would have to be cut. The French economy was
unchanged in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
