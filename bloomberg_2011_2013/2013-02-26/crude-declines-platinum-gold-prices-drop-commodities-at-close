0.6 percent to 1,551.526.  CRUDE OIL  West Texas Intermediate oil fell to a seven-week low before
a report that may show U.S. crude stockpiles rose. Prices slid
with stocks and the euro as Italy’s election spurred concern

metals declined as investors weighed the implications of an
inconclusive election in Italy and the possibility of stronger
demand from  China  in March.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.6
percent to $7,880 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,848 at 2:18 p.m. Shanghai time. Nickel
dropped 0.6 percent to $16,610, falling for a second day.  PRECIOUS METALS  Platinum declined for a fifth day, narrowing its premium to
gold, on reduced concern that South African supplies will be
disrupted, and as political deadlock in  Italy  after elections
hurt commodities and equities. Gold fell.  Spot platinum lost as much as 1.5 percent to $1,583.50 an
ounce, the cheapest since Jan. 9, and was at $1,594.62 at 3:48
p.m. in Singapore. A fifth day of losses would be the longest
slump since December. One ounce of platinum bought as few as
0.9945 ounce of gold, the least since Jan. 22, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Gold snapped three days of gains, losing 0.3
percent to $1,588.75 an ounce.  Cash silver fell 0.8 percent to $28.775 an ounce, taking
this month’s loss to 8.5 percent. Spot palladium lost 0.3
percent to $734.20 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat declined to an eight-month low, trading below $7 a
bushel for the first time since June, as a second major
snowstorm brings relief to drought-stricken U.S. winter crop.
Soybeans also declined.  The contract for May delivery lost as much as 1.1 percent
to $6.9775 a bushel, the cheapest price for the most-active
contract on the  Chicago  Board of Trade since June 25. It traded
at $6.985 a bushel at 2:36 p.m. in Singapore on a trading volume
that was 57 percent more than the 100-day average.  Wheat’s decline for four straight days narrowed its premium
to corn to 15.25 cents a bushel, the smallest since May 2012.
The two grains maybe used interchangeably in feed rations for
pigs and chickens.  Corn for May delivery fell 0.6 percent to $6.83 a bushel in
Chicago, while soybeans slid 0.8 percent to $14.2375 a bushel.
That puts the price of soybeans at 2.08 times the cost of corn,
compared with a 10-year average of 2.43 times. The crops compete
for acreage.  Rubber futures slumped to a two-month low as concerns grew
that Italy’s elections will lead to renewed turmoil in Europe,
boosting Japan’s currency as a haven and cutting the appeal of
the yen-based contracts.  The contract for August delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange lost 2.9 percent to 289.8 yen a kilogram ($3,162 a
metric ton), the lowest settlement for a most-active contract
since Dec. 21. Futures have lost 4.2 percent this year.  Palm oil  dropped to the lowest level in four weeks as
global production of palm and soybeans is set to climb this year
on increased acreage.  The contract for May delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent
to 2,448 ringgit ($789) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest price for the most active month since Jan.
29, before trading at 2,451 ringgit by the end of the morning
session. Futures declined for a fifth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
