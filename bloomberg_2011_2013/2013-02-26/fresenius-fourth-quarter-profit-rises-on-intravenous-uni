Fresenius SE (FRE)  said it expects profit
will exceed 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in 2013, one year
earlier than forecast, as its Kabi intravenous drugs and devices
unit contributes to growth.  Sales will probably rise 7 percent to 10 percent this year
in constant currencies, while adjusted net income is set to
increase 7 percent to 12 percent, the Bad Homburg, Germany-based
company said in a statement today. The average  estimate  for 2013
profit was 1.03 billion euros, based on 15 forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares rose the most since Jan. 16.  The German health company is depending on Kabi, which sells
therapies and drugs administered intravenously to hospital
patients, after last year’s failed attempt to buy German
hospital operator  Rhoen-Klinikum AG. (RHK)  Fresenius also owns health-
care services unit Vamed and Helios, a German private hospital
provider. Fresenius agreed in July to buy Fenwal Inc., a
provider of blood and plasma collection technology, to expand
Kabi’s U.S. reach.  ‘Decent Performance’  Fresenius turned in “a decent performance,” somewhat
ahead of expectations and will probably meet the expectations of
investors with its forecast, Sven Kuerten, a Frankfurt-based
analyst for DZ Bank AG, wrote in a note to investors today.
Kuerten has a buy recommendation on the stock.  Fresenius also said its fourth-quarter earnings before
interest and tax rose 9.3 percent to 766 million euros. Sales
climbed 18 percent to 5.19 billion euros. The stock rose 2.8
percent to close at 93.50 euros in  Frankfurt .  The company also owns about 30 percent of Fresenius Medical
Care AG, the world’s biggest provider of kidney dialysis.
Fresenius Medical Care said today fourth-quarter Ebit fell 4.7
percent to $559.1 million. Sales increased 13 percent to $3.71
billion.  Fresenius Medical Care shares rose 1.5 percent to close at
53.09 euros.  This year sales will probably exceed $14.6 billion, while
net income will be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, the dialysis
unit said. The company said it expects to spend about $300
million on acquisitions.  ‘Tough’ Market  “Importantly, the guidance in 2013 looks to be in line
with estimates,” said Lisa Bedell Clive, a London-based analyst
for Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Clive rates Fresenius Medical
Care’s shares outperform. The company’s forecast includes any
potential impact from U.S. spending cuts scheduled to start
March 1, she said.  “This is a company that is used to operating in a tough
reimbursement environment, so we think they’re well-placed to
weather the storm,” Clive said.  Fresenius Medical Care’s revenue per treatment, a measure
of profitability, increased to $368 in U.S. clinics from $351 a
year earlier. North American sales rose 19 percent to $2.43
billion.  Outside the U.S., Fresenius Medical Care’s international
revenue rose 4 percent to $1.27 billion.  Fresenius Medical Care proposed a dividend increase of 9
percent to 75 cents for ordinary shares. Parent company
Fresenius proposed a dividend boost of 16 percent to 1.10 euros,
its 20th consecutive increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
