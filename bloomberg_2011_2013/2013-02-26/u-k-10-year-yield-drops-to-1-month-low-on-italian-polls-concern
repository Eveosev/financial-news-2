U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
10-year yields below 2 percent for the first time in a month, as
inconclusive elections in  Italy  boosted demand for the relative
safety of British sovereign debt.  Benchmark gilts advanced for a second day as pre-election
favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won Italy’s lower house by less than
half a percentage point while former premier  Silvio Berlusconi 
gained a blocking minority in the Senate. Italian and Spanish
bonds slumped on concern the political uncertainty would deepen
 Europe ’s debt crisis. Gilts have risen for two days even after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the U.K.’s AAA credit rating last
week. The pound dropped against the dollar and euro.  “Gilts, despite the downgrade, clearly remain in the club
of safe-haven assets,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “When
you have panic in the euro-region periphery, gilts are going to
be a beneficiary of that.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.97 percent at 4:27 p.m. London time after
reaching 1.96 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 24. The 1.75
percent bond maturing in September 2022 rose 0.93, or 9.30
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,513) face amount, to 98.085.  Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  said today that
while threats to the U.K. from the euro-region have receded, it
still remains a major concern.  Tucker, along with fellow Monetary Policy Committee members
 Charles Bean , David Miles and  Ian McCafferty , was speaking
before the U.K. legislature’s Treasury Select Committee.  Moody’s lowered the U.K.’s credit rating one level to Aa1
on Feb. 22, citing weakness in the nation’s growth outlook and
challenges to the government’s plan to cut the deficit.  Spread Narrows  Gilts have traded in line with German bunds since the
downgrade. The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Britain’s
10-year benchmark securities instead of bunds was 52 basis
points today, little changed from at the end of last week.  The U.K. sold 3.75 billion pounds of inflation-linked gilts
maturing in March 2052 through banks, the Debt Management Office
said on its website. The bonds were priced at 105.312, for a so-
called real yield of 0.111 percent, the office said.  Index-linked gilts advanced, pushing the yield on the 10-
year securities down to a  record-low  minus 1.16 percent.  The U.K.’s 10-year break-even  rate , a measure of future
inflation expectations, narrowed as much as eight basis points
to 3.12 percentage points, the least since Jan. 30.  U.K. government bonds lost 1.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds dropped 1.1 percent and Treasuries fell 0.2 percent.  Pound Drops  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5132 after weakening to
$1.5073 yesterday, the lowest level since July 2010. Sterling
slid 0.2 percent to 86.31 pence per euro after depreciating to
88.15 pence yesterday, the weakest level since October 2011.  The U.K. currency has lost 5.3 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 2.6
percent and the euro rose 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
