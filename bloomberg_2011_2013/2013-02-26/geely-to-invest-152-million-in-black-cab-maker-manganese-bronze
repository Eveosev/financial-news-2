Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.
will invest 100 million pounds ($151.7 million) in London black
cab maker Manganese Bronze Holdings Plc in the next five years
as part of plans to turn the company profitable.  Chairman  Li Shufu  announced the investment plan, which will
see Manganese Bronze export its black cabs to other countries,
according to Victor Yang, a spokesman for the company. The  China
Daily  reported the plan earlier today.  Zhejiang Geely agreed to buy Manganese Bronze, which
entered administration last year, for 11.04 million pounds on a
debt-free basis, the Chinese automaker said Feb. 1. The purchase
will help the closely held automaker headed by Li speed up its
expansion following the purchase of Volvo Cars in Sweden.  Manganese Bronze will become profitable in one year instead
of the previous target of three years, as the cab maker expands
sales to overseas markets, Yang said by phone. The company has
sold 200 cabs each to  Australia  and Saudi Arabia, he said.  The cab maker will also sell its taxis in China, though no
sales targets have been set, Yang said. About 500 of the black
cabs are already operating in Chinese cities such as Beijing,
Guangzhou and Ningbo, he said.  Manganese Bronze has said it will continue to build its
taxis in Coventry,  England .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
