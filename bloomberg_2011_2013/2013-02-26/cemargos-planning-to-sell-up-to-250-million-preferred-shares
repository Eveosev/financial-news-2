Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) ,  Colombia ’s
largest cement maker, is planning a preferred stock sale that
will include as many as 250 million shares, Chief Executive
Officer Jorge Velasquez said.  “We’re watching developments in the market, and depending
on that we’ll determine the best moment to launch the eventual
offer,” Velasquez said today on a  conference call  with
investors.  Cemargos is seeking to raise cash through its initial sale
of preferred shares to “increase the company’s financial
flexibility to allow it to maximize growth opportunities,”
Velasquez said. The board will determine the final size of the
offering, he said.  The company’s  common shares  fell 0.9 percent to 9,400 pesos
at 1:40 p.m. in Bogota and have dropped 10 percent since Feb.
15, when the company said it was planning to sell preferred
shares in local and international markets.  Cemargos has 1.2 billion common shares outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
