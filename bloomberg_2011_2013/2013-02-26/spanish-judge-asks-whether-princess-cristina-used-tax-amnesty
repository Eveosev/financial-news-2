A judge probing corruption
allegations involving Inaki Urdangarin, the son-in-law of
 Spain ’s  King Juan Carlos , sought information on whether he and
his wife Princess Cristina made use of a tax amnesty last year.  Judge Jose Castro asked the  tax authorities  to disclose
whether the Royal Couple had made use of the amnesty last year
either personally or through a company, according to a statement
from the high court of justice in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.  Urdangarin faced questioning from Castro on Feb. 23 as the
judge probes allegations into his involvement in running the
Noos Insitute, a non-profit organization aimed at making Spanish
companies more competitive. Urdangarin, a former Olympic
handball player, has been named as an official suspect on six
counts including fraud, embezzlement and money laundering.  The government offered citizens with undeclared offshore
funds the chance to put their affairs in order last year before
passing a law that requires residents to declare assets held
outside the country to the tax authorities before the end of
April.  A spokesman for the Royal Family, who asked not to be named
in line with its policy, said Princess Cristina had no comment.  Urdangarin’s lawyer, Marius Pascual Vives, wasn’t
immediately available when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  The case is a private prosecution filed by groups including
Clean Hands, a Madrid-based public workers union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
