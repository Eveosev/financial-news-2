  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) , the developer
of the Cobre Panama copper project, reiterated its rejection of
a C$5.1 billion ($5 billion) offer from  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM)  for being too low.  Inmet granted First Quantum full access to carry out due
diligence, the Toronto-based company said today in a statement.
Inmet said it will continue to seek a sale of a minority stake
in Cobre Panama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
