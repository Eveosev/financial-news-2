The sixth-ranked University of
 Kansas  Jayhawks pulled out a 108-96 overtime win last night
against Iowa State, giving Bill Self his 500th career college
basketball coaching victory.  Kansas guard Elijah Johnson scored 39 points, including
eight in the final 32 seconds of the second half, to help the
Jayhawks erase a five-point deficit and force overtime. He had
12 more points in extra time as Kansas outscored Iowa State 18-6
to end the Cyclones’ 22-game winning streak in Ames, Iowa.  Kansas won its fifth straight following a three-game skid
to improve its record to 24-4. Iowa State fell to 19-9.  The Jayhawks are 12-3 in the Big 12 and remain tied atop
the conference with 13th-ranked Kansas State (23-5), which
rolled past Texas Tech 75-55 yesterday in Manhattan, Kansas.  Eight Division I men’s basketball coaches have reached the
500-win milestone in fewer games than the 50-year-old Self, who
has a 500-162 record over 20 seasons, including a 293-57 mark at
Kansas. Duke University coach  Mike Krzyzewski  has won a National
Collegiate Athletic Association-record 950 games.  Marquette University, ranked 22nd, beat No. 12 Syracuse 74-
71 yesterday in Milwaukee behind 26 points from Davante Gardner.
Marquette improved to 20-7 overall, including an 11-4 record in
the  Big East  to move into second place in the conference behind
seventh-ranked Georgetown.  Syracuse (22-6, 10-5 Big East) lost for the third time in
five games to drop into a tie for fourth place with  Notre Dame .  To contact the reporter on this story:
