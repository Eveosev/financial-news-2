Gasoline in New York tumbled the
most since November as Brent crude and refined products in
Europe declined. Crack spreads narrowed.  March futures fell as much as 3.1 percent. The April  crack
spread , or premium of gasoline over West Texas Intermediate
crude on Nymex, declined $1.48 to $42.48 a barrel. The spread
versus Brent crude on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London
shrank $1.05 to $21.58 a barrel. Brent slipped as Italy’s
borrowing costs rose to a three-month high on concern political
stalemate will worsen the country’s debt crisis.  “People are realizing the spike we saw in gasoline may be
unjustified,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “We’re seeing the European fear play
come back into the market.”  Gasoline for March delivery fell 6.91 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.992 a gallon at 9:54 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on volume that was 78 percent above the 100-
day average. Prices have dropped five of the past six days after
reaching a four-month high on Feb. 15.  The March contract, which expires Feb. 28 and is for
winter-grade fuel, widened its discount to April futures by 2.81
cents to 23.06 cents. The April contract represents summer-grade
gasoline, which is more expensive to refine. April’s premium
over September futures shrank 1.5 cents to 26.72 cents a gallon.  Second-Best  Gasoline has gained 6.4 percent this year and is the
second-best performer after cotton this year on the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 commodities. Prices have risen on
concern refinery shutdowns will tighten supply as demand picks
up in April.  Retail gasoline, averaged nationwide, rose 0.5 cent to
$3.782 a gallon, the highest level since Oct. 14, AAA said today
on its website. The fuel has jumped 15 percent this year to
within 15.4 cents of last year’s high of $3.936, according to
AAA data.  Heating oil for March delivery fell 3.32 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.0657 a gallon on the exchange. Volume was 30
percent above the 100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
