Italy’s  10-year bond yields  may rise
to the highest level in four months after breaking above a key
level of so-called resistance, Credit Suisse Group AG said,
citing trading patterns.  The yield climbed above December’s high of 4.90 percent
today, opening the way for an increase to 5.08 percent, the 38.2
percent retracement of its decline from July to January,
technical analyst David Sneddon said, citing Fibonacci analysis.  “The big support level now for Italy is coming in around
5.08 percent,” London-based Sneddon said. The next resistance
level is the 200-day moving average at 5.16 percent and a move
above that “would start to open a door to a more worrying
deterioration for Italian bonds,” he said.  Italian  10-year yield  rose 27 basis points, or 0.27
percentage point, to 4.76 percent at 11:16 a.m. London time
after climbing to 4.93 percent, the highest level since Nov. 20.
The last time it reached 5.16 percent was Oct. 11.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates an asset may
move to the next level.  Resistance refers to an area on a price graph where
analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered. Support is
where there may be orders to buy.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, currency
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
