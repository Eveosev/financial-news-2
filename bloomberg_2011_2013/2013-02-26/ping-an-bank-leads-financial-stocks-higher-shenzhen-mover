Ping An Bank Co. (000001) , the first lender
to report earnings next week, led a rally for financial stocks
on speculation a slump that sent valuations to the biggest
discount in a month compared with a broader index was excessive.  Ping An jumped 9.2 percent at the 11:30 a.m. break in
Shenzhen, poised for the biggest gain since Jan. 28.  China
Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016)  advanced 4.6 percent, the most since Feb.
1. The CSI 300 financial index of banks, brokerages, developers
and insurers increased 2.2 percent, the most among 10 industrial
groups on the CSI 300 Index. The CSI 300 rose 0.8 percent.  “The rebound for banks is more like a technical one after
they have fallen a lot recently,”  Zhang Ling , general manager
at  Shanghai  River Fund Management Co., said by phone.  The  financial gauge  had dropped 6.6 percent this month amid
concern the government will curb mortgage lending to prevent
housing prices from rising further. That compared with a 3.1
percent slide for the CSI 300. The financial sub-index traded at
8.1 times 12-month projected profit yesterday, 22 percent lower
than the CSI 300, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest discount since Jan. 21.  “As the economy improves, there are expectations of better
earnings,” Yayun Tang, an analyst at Northeast Securities Co.,
said by phone today from Shanghai. “Concern about property
tightening affecting loans has also been priced in.”  Ping An Bank and China Minsheng Bank have stopped mortgage
lending in Beijing, Beijing Morning Post reported today, citing
unidentified people from banks. Ping An Bank and China Minsheng
bank spokesmen said they couldn’t immediately comment on the
report when contacted by Bloomberg by phone.  Profit Outlook  Ping An Bank is scheduled to release earnings on March 7,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The lender will
probably report full-year  net income  of 13.87 billion  yuan  ($2.2
billion), according to 11 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank reported profit of 10.28 billion yuan in
2011, when it was named Shenzhen Development Bank Co.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank estimated a 25 percent
jump in 2012 profit on Jan. 4, prompting Ping An Securities Co.
to issue a report saying more banks will post results that beat
market expectations. Banking valuations will be “repaired” as
fundamentals improve, Ping An Securities analysts wrote.  China’s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
two years in the fourth quarter. The median estimate of
economists surveyed from Feb. 15 to Feb. 20 by  Bloomberg News 
was for GDP growth of 8.1 percent in 2013. Expansion was 7.8
percent in 2012, statistics bureau data showed in January.  China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s biggest
mortgage lender, gained 1.1 percent today. Its  mortgage loans 
accounted for 20 percent of the total loan portfolio at the end
of June, according to earnings reports.  Property Curbs  Some ministries and local governments may announce detailed
rules to control the  property market  soon, the China Securities
Journal reported yesterday, citing an unidentified person. Some
of the measures will likely be announced before the National
People’s Congress and the  Chinese People’s Political
Consultative Conference  in March, according to the report.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  called for home-purchase restrictions in
cities with “excessively fast” price gains last week, as a
Feb. 22 government report showed new  home prices  climbed in
January in 53 of the 70 cities that are tracked, compared with
the previous month’s 54, which was the most since April 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
