Bank of America Corp.  hired Olivier Thiriet from  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  Group AG to head Asia-Pacific
equities in Hong Kong, replacing Peter MacDonald, according to a
memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  MacDonald, who was named to the newly created post of vice
chairman of international equities, will move to  London  in
April, according to the document. Thiriet, who headed Asia-
Pacific cash equities at the Zurich-based bank, will join later
in the year. Mark Tsang, a Bank of America spokesman in Hong
Kong, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Bank of America is expanding banking, fixed-income and
equities in Asia and hired investment bankers Margaret Ren from
BNP Paribas SA and Stephen Gore from UBS AG last year to help
build and integrate the businesses. Thiriet will report to Loh Boon Chye, who was lured by the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
bank from Deutsche Bank AG in October to head Asia global
markets.  MacDonald will report to Fabrizio Gallo, global head of
equities, the memo said. Thiriet, who was also president of
Credit Suisse  Japan , will become a member of Bank of America’s
Asia-Pacific executive committee, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
