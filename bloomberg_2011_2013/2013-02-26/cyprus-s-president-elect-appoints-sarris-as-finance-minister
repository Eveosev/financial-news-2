Cypriot president-elect Nicos Anastasiades appointed Michael Sarris as finance minister and
European Parliament lawmaker Ioannis Kasoulides as foreign
minister.  Nobel economics laureate Christopher Pissarides will head
the nation’s economic policy council, Anastasiades said late
yesterday, in comments posted as a video on  ANT1 TV’ s website.  Anastasiades, who won the presidential vote on Feb. 24 and
is backed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has to revive
talks with European partners on aid that could equal the size of
its 18 billion-euro ($24 billion) economy, to rescue banks and
finance government over the next three years.  “Priority was given to issues relating to the economy and
managing the crisis,” Anastasiades said, adding that the other
cabinet members will be appointed in the coming days. Sarris,
who as finance minister in 2008 supervised Cyprus’s adoption of
the euro, has the experience needed to tackle the island’s
economic problems, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
