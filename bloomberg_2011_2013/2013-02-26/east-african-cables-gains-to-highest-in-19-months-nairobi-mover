East African Cables Ltd. (EACL) , the
region’s biggest cable manufacturer, rose to the highest level
in more than 20 months after it increased a dividend payout by
25 percent.  The stock rose 2.2 percent to 13.75 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi, the strongest since June 10, 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than double the three-month
daily average volume of shares were traded.  The company’s board recommended a dividend of 1 shilling
($0.01) a share compared with 0.80 shilling a year earlier,
according to a statement yesterday.  The increase “is a motivation to some investors,” Ted Macharia, a research analyst at Nairobi-based AIB Capital Ltd.,
said by phone.  East African Cables’ profit in the 12 months through
December surged to 440.7 million shillings from 291.6 million
shillings a year earlier, it said yesterday. Revenue slipped 13
percent to 4.3 billion shillings because of a fall in prices on
the London Metal Exchange, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
