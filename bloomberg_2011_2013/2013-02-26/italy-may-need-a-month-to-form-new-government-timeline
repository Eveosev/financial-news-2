Here’s a timeline for the formation
of the new Italian government and details on the process of
choosing the new president of the republic.  The Democratic Party leader won a majority of seats in the
Chamber of Deputies in elections yesterday, though fell short of
a majority in the Senate, raising the specter of some kind of
“grand coalition” or a new election.  *What happens now? -- Italy’s new parliament is not scheduled to
meet for the first time until March 15. In the meantime, the
various political parties will likely hold informal discussions
on possible post-election alliances.  *How long will it take to install a new prime minister? -- It
may take a month before a prime minister is formally nominated
and a government formed.  *What will the new parliament do? -- The first order of business
for the new legislature when it meets on March 15 will be to
elect presidents for both the Senate and the Chamber of
Deputies. This normally takes 3 or 4 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
