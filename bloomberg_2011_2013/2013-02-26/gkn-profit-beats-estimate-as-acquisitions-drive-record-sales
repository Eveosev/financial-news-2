GKN Plc (GKN) , a supplier of parts to
 Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS jetliners, said it’s open to further
purchases as last year’s 633 million-pound ($962 million)
takeover of Volvo AB’s aerospace unit begins to lift earnings.  The Volvo Aero acquisition, which closed on Oct. 1,
contributed fourth-quarter sales of 191 million pounds and is 
on course to meet first-year revenue and profitability targets, 
Redditch, England-based GKN said today.  “If we felt something good were to come along in the not
too distant future we would be ready,” Chief Executive Officer
Nigel Stein said on a conference call, adding that a 62 percent
jump in net debt to 871 million pounds is no bar to expansion.  GKN’s adjusted pretax profit rose 19 percent to 497 million
pounds in 2012 and the manufacturer will rely on aerospace
growth to sustain earnings as its automotive unit comes under
pressure. A drop in European light-vehicle output will weigh on
the car-parts business in the first half, GKN said today,
sending the stock down the most in four months.  CEO Stein said that production of components for Boeing’s
787 Dreamliner continues even after the model was grounded on
Jan. 16 over battery faults. GKN has around 100 million pounds
in annual sales linked to the aircraft.  A350 Schedule  Development glitches with a major wing structure that GKN
is supplying to Airbus for the A350 long-range jet are in the
past and should not impact the plane’s first flight, which is
due midyear, or first deliveries planned next year, Stein said.  Group-wide revenue advanced 13 percent to 6.9 billion
pounds last year. Analysts had predicted a pretax profit of 468
million pounds, on average.  Sales growth at the aerospace business, which had a trading
profit of 170 million pounds in 2012, should broadly offset the
end of a supply contract with Airbus worth 100 million pounds a
year that GKN had inherited with the 136 million-pound takeover
of the planemaker’s Filton site in 2008, the company said.  With the European autos market unlikely to recover for some
time, GKN will restructure its Driveline and Metallurgy units in
the first quarter at a cost of 16 million pounds and 5 million
pounds respectively, with job cuts in Germany and  Japan .  GKN fell as much as 5 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since Oct. 16, before recovering to trade 0.4 percent lower at
251.40 pence as of 9:59 a.m. in  London . The stock has gained 9.8
percent this year, valuing the business at 4.1 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
