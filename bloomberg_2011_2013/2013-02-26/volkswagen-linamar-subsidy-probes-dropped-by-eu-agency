European Union probes of aid
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Linamar Corp. (LNR)  receive from Germany were
dropped after the government reduced the planned subsidies for
the companies, the European Commission said today.  Germany will cut the aid for both companies below
thresholds requiring EU authorization, according to the EU’s
official publication today. It didn’t quantify the subsidies the
government now plans to grant the firms.  In 2011, the EU started investigating Germany’s planned
83.7 million-euro ($109.5 million) payment to Volkswagen to help
the company cover the cost of changing vehicle production at a
plant in the eastern German state of Saxony. About the same
time, regulators also started probing 26.7 million euros in
German government grants and tax breaks to help Guelph, Ontario-
based Linamar build a car-parts factory in the country.  EU regulators review large government payments to companies
to ensure rivals aren’t harmed by unfair state help. The EU was
critical of the aid to Volkswagen at the time, saying it may
boost capacity for a market with falling demand.  A similar probe into Volkswagen’s Audi unit was dropped
after the Hungarian government withdrew a request for the EU to
approve 49.5 million euros in subsidies to upgrade an engine and
car assembly plant, regulators  said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
