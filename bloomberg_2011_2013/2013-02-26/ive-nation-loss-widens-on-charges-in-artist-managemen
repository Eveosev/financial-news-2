Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest concert promoter and ticket retailer, rose the
most in almost two months after reporting fourth-quarter sales
that beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares advanced 2.9 percent to $10.41 at 1:35 p.m. in
 New York  after gaining as much as 4 percent, the most since Jan.
2. Through yesterday, the  stock  had climbed 8.7 percent this
year.  Sales rose 21 percent to $1.44 billion,  Beverly Hills ,
California-based Live Nation said yesterday in a statement. That
exceeded the $1.29 billion average of four analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s Ticketmaster unit performed
better than expected,  Benjamin Mogil , an analyst with Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a research report.  The loss widened to $159.7 million, or 85 cents a share,
including $68.2 million in costs tied to its artist-management
unit and the exit of Live Nation’s former chairman, Irving Azoff. The Artist Nation unit recorded $5.5 million in costs
from Azoff’s departure and $62.7 million to write down some
client-vendor relationships, the company said.  Adjusted operating income of $62.5 million missed the $63
million estimate of Mogil, who rates Live Nation hold. The
figure excludes acquisition costs, asset sales, depreciation,
amortization and stock-based compensation.  Chief Executive Officer Michael Rapino is revamping
Ticketmaster, opening offices in  Asia  and  Latin America , and
adding festivals to Live Nation’s lineup with a goal of boosting
operating income by 35 percent through 2015.  Ticket Sales  “Looking forward to 2013, I am confident that we will
continue the successful growth of the core business,” Rapino
said in the statement.  Live Nation has sold 9 million concert tickets for shows
this year, a 58 percent increase from a year ago, Rapino said.
The revamp of Ticketmaster will be complete this year, producing
new products, he said.  During the quarter, company hosted 6,280 events attended by
11.9 million people, according to the statement. That compares
with 6,671 events that drew 11.3 million people a year ago, Live
Nation said.  The concert division narrowed its fourth-quarter operating
loss to $77.1 million, from $80.7 million, on revenue that rose
32 percent to $915.8 million. The Ticketmaster unit posted an
operating profit of $22.4 million, up 40 percent, on sales that
gained 5.6 percent to $372.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
