Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index erasing this year’s gains, amid concern  China 
may tighten monetary policy and introduce more measures to curb
property prices, and as Italian elections renewed concern over
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the world’s No. 2 lender by
value, dropped 2.4 percent after a report China may tighten
monetary policy.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , the Chinese
developer controlled by billionaire Hui Wing Mau, sank 4.8
percent after Shanghai Securities News reported Beijing drafted
new property control measures.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier
that gets 79 percent of its sales from Europe, slid 1.4 percent.  The Hang Seng Index slid 1.3 percent to 22,519.69, its
lowest close since Dec. 21. Almost six stocks retreated for each
that rose on the gauge, which is heading for its first month of
decline since August. Trading volume was about 9.1 percent below
the 30-day average. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies dropped 2 percent to 11,104.10.  “Markets have moved a great deal in the past six months as
investors overcame a lot of pessimism,” said Sandy Mehta, Hong
Kong-based chief executive officer of Value Investment
Principals Ltd. “You will see some more property measures from
Hong Kong and China’s authorities. They are trying to walk a
tightrope where they want to continue to stimulate growth but
are concerned about property and commodity prices.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 9.5 percent from the end of
September through yesterday, amid signs of economic recovery in
the U.S. and China as central banks added stimulus to boost
growth. The gauge traded at 11.1 times average  estimated
earnings  yesterday, compared with 13.5 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Excess Liquidity  Chinese banks declined after a front-page commentary in
China Securities Journal said the nation may tighten monetary
policy because of excessive liquidity in the market and rising
property prices.  A measure of financial companies had the  biggest drop  among
the Hang Seng Index’s four industry groups. China Construction
Bank declined 2.4 percent to HK$6.17. Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd. fell 2.3 percent to HK$3.91.  Chinese developers declined after Shanghai Securities News
said Beijing has completed a draft of property control measures,
which will be released after the central government issues more
detailed policies. The report cited an unidentified person.  Shimao dropped 4.8 percent to HK$14.94.  Evergrande Real
Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , which gets all its revenue from China,
retreated 4.3 percent to HK$3.58.  Earnings Drop  Anta Sports Products Ltd. (2020)  fell 6.6 percent to HK$7.06 after
the Chinese sportswear maker’s rating was cut to underperform
from neutral at CCB International Securities Ltd. The company
yesterday reported full-year earnings that missed analyst
estimates.  Power Assets Holdings Ltd. rose 1.1 percent to HK$70.95,
leading gains among utilities. Hong Kong & China Gas Ltd.
advanced 0.5 percent to HK$21.50.  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) , Hong Kong’s
biggest electricity supplier, rose 0.5 percent to HK$66.85. CLP
dropped the most since Jan. 3 yesterday after its full-year
profit missed analyst estimates.  Italy may require another vote after partial election
results suggested the four-way race may end in a divided
parliament, an aide to Democratic Party candidate Pier Luigi
Bersani said. Bersani, who led in opinion polls throughout the
race, campaigned to maintain the budget rigor of outgoing Prime
Minister  Mario Monti .  Esprit slid 1.4 percent to HK$10.18.  AAC Technologies
Holdings Inc. (2018) , which supplies speakers for Apple Inc.’s iPhone
and gets more than a quarter of its revenue from Europe, sank
1.3 percent to HK$31.05. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., an owner of
retail chains and ports that counts Europe as its biggest
market, dropped 3 percent to HK$82.05.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index dropped 1.3 percent to
