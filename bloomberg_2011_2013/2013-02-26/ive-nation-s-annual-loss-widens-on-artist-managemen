Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest concert promoter and ticket retailer, posted a
wider annual loss on a $68.2 million charge related to the exit
of its former chairman and the artist-management unit he ran.  The loss of $163.2 million, or 87 cents a share, compares
with a loss of $83 million, or 46 cents, in 2011,  Beverly Hills ,
California-based Live Nation said today in a statement. The
company didn’t break out fourth-quarter net income.  Sales in the fourth quarter rose 21 percent to $1.44
billion, exceeding the $1.29 billion average estimate of
analysts polled by Bloomberg. Adjusted operating income of $62.5
million missed the $63 million estimate of  Benjamin Mogil  with
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. The figure excludes acquisition costs,
asset sales, depreciation, amortization and stock-based
compensation.  Chief Executive Officer Michael Rapino is revamping the
Ticketmaster service, opening offices in Asia and  Latin America 
and adding festivals to its lineup with a goal of boosting
operating income by 35 percent through 2015. The management
business was led by Irving Azoff, who resigned from the company
in December.  The Artist Nation unit recorded $5.5 million in costs
related to Azoff’s departure and $62.7 million to write down
certain client-vendor relationship assets.  Live Nation fell 1.9 percent to $10.12 at the close in New
York. The  stock  has climbed 8.7 percent this year.  (For register for the conference call webcast at 5 p.m. New
