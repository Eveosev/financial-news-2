Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-largest U.S.
department-store chain, rose after forecasting annual profit
that was higher than analysts’ estimates amid a surge in online
sales.  The shares  advanced  2.8 percent to $39.59 at the close in
 New York . They’ve gained 1.5 percent this year, compared with a
6 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Retailing Index.  Earnings per share for the fiscal year ending January 2014
will advance to as much as $3.95, the Cincinnati-based retailer
said in a statement today. Analysts projected $3.84, the average
of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Terry Lundgren  has focused on
tailoring merchandise to suit local tastes and benefited from
exclusive  Tommy Hilfiger , Sean John and Madonna products.
Fourth-quarter revenue climbed 7.2 percent to $9.35 billion
while online sales soared 48 percent, Macy’s said today.  Net income in the quarter ended Feb. 2 fell 2 percent to
$730 million, or $1.83 a share, from $745 million, or $1.74, a
year earlier, when it booked one-time gains from the sale of
store leases, Macy’s said.  Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after the
cost of goods sold, narrowed to 40.6 percent from 41 percent a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
