Indonesian bonds gained, pushing the
two-year yield to a one-year low, as speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain a loose monetary policy bolstered demand
for higher-yielding assets. Rupiah forwards fell.  Global funds have  bought  6.14 trillion rupiah ($633 million)
of local-currency sovereign debt this month through Feb. 21,
taking foreign ownership to 34 percent, finance ministry data
show. That’s near a record 36 percent reached on Sept. 12, 2011.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will testify to lawmakers today and
tomorrow, with all 74 analysts predicting the U.S. benchmark
rate will not exceed 0.25 percent for the rest of the year,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Foreign holdings of  Indonesia ’s bonds may surpass the
previous record as the Fed is likely to signal continued low
interest rates,” said Suriyanto Chang, the head of treasury at
PT Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “Bonds maturing in less than
five years are more attractive as the longer tenors may be at
risk of volatile fund flows.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds due October
2014 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.31
percent as of 9:27 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since Feb.
21, 2012, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The yield reached an all-time low of 4.18 percent
on Feb. 15, 2012.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards declined
0.1 percent to 9,725 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The contracts traded at a 0.2 percent discount to the spot rate,
which was steady at 9,708, prices from local banks show. A daily
 fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at 9,713 yesterday,
from 9,711 on Feb. 22, by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.40 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
