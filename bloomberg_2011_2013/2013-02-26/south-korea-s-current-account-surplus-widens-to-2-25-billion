(Corrects exports in fifth paragraph of Feb. 27 story.)  Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- South Korea ’s current-account surplus
widened in January on higher exports of electronics and
petrochemical goods.  The surplus was $2.25 billion, compared with a revised
surplus of $2.14 billion in December,  Bank of Korea  said in a
statement in Seoul today. The current account is the broadest
measure of trade, tracking goods, services and investment
income.  Today’s figure may give a boost to President Park Geun Hye,
who pledged on her first day in office Feb. 25 to revitalize the
economy as declines in the yen cloud the outlook for South
Korean exports. Growth pickups in China and the U.S. are
boosting the outlook further for South Korean shipments.  “Korea is well poised to benefit from stronger external
conditions over the year, especially in  China ,” Ronald Man, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, said before the
release. “In turn, stronger exports will lift employment and
household income.”  South Korea’s exports rose 10.9 percent in January, the
most in 11 months, as the timing of a Lunar New Year holiday
distorted the comparison with the same period from a year
before. Park may adjust currency trading rules if needed to
protect local companies, her spokesman Park Sun Kyoo said in an
e-mail last week.  The won weakened 0.2 percent to 1,088 per dollar at the
close yesterday in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Kospi index of stocks declined 0.5 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
