Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) ,
 Asia ’s largest software-services provider, agreed to pay $29.8
million to settle a wage dispute in  California  with workers who
were sent to work in the U.S. from India.  Terms of the settlement are described in a Feb. 21 filing
with U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland, California.
The judge in April certified the case as a class, or group,
lawsuit for all non-U.S. citizens employed by Tata in California
from Feb. 14, 2002, to June 30, 2005.  “This was an extraordinarily hard fought case and we are
proud of the result for the employees,” Kelly M. Dermody, a
lawyer for the workers, said in an e-mail.  The settlement also includes Tata Sons Ltd., the software
maker’s closely held parent, whose businesses include  India ’s
largest vehicle maker and steel producer.  Workers who weren’t U.S. citizens claimed Tata forced them
to sign over their federal and state tax refunds to the company
and wrongfully deducted Indian salaries from their U.S.
compensation.  ``TCS believes that it always acted appropriately 
notwithstanding the allegations in this case,'' Michael McCabe, 
a spokesman for Tata, said in an e-mail. ``The company has 
admitted no wrongdoing and none has been found by the court. It 
agreed to settle this matter to eliminate any on-going 
distraction to its associates and management.''  The case is Vedachalam v. Tata America International
Corp., 06-cv-00963, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
