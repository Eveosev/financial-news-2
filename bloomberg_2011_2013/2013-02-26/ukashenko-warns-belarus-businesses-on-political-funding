Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said businessmen who fund political opponents of his
regime will be deemed enemies of the state.  Business owners should step up efforts to help the
government modernize industry and should help provide social
benefits, he said today during a meeting with entrepreneurs in
the capital, Minsk.  “Participating in social-welfare programs should be the
norm for businessmen,” the president’s press service cited
Lukashenko as  saying .  Lukashenko, who’s regime has been called a dictatorship by
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, secured his fourth term in
2010, triggering protests and a police crackdown. Belarus has
used its economic ties with  Russia  to secure financial aid over
the past two years as it grappled with fallout from a balance-
of-payments crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
