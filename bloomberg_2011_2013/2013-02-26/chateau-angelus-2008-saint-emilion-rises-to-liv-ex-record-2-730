The 2008 vintage of Saint-Emilion
wine producer Chateau Angelus climbed to a record high of
1,800 pounds ($2,730) a case on the London-based Liv-ex wine
market this week, according to data on its Cellar Watch website.  The price was 15 percent up from a transaction last month
and 61 percent above a trade conducted last August, according
to Cellar Watch data. It was also higher than the HK$19,600
(1,570 pounds at the time) paid for each of two cases in a
 Sotheby’s (BID)  sale in  Hong Kong  in October, according to Sotheby’s
online auction data. Angelus was promoted to the ranks of one of
the four top growers in the appellation in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
