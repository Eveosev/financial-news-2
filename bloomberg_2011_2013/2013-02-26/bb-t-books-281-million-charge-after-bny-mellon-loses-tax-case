BB&T Corp. (BBT) , suing to recoup $892
million in tax payments, said it will take a $281 million charge
this quarter after another bank lost a similar court fight.  The charge will boost BB&T’s reserves in case it doesn’t
prevail in its own lawsuit, according to a statement today from
the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based lender. The move follows
a legal setback for  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , which said
this month it will take an $850 million charge after a U.S. tax
court blocked it from claiming foreign-tax credits.  “Management recorded the charge as a result of its
consideration of this adverse opinion,” BB&T said. Still, the
firm “has confidence in its position in the dispute because,
among other reasons, BB&T will raise arguments and issues in its
case that were not considered by the tax court.”  BB&T is seeking to recover payments made after the  Internal
Revenue Service  objected to the bank’s use of foreign tax
credits and other deductions from 2002 to 2007. The lender
initially complied with the 2010 IRS demand for $892 million in
taxes, penalties and interest. The bank then sought to recover
money in court and booked some of the anticipated proceeds as a
receivable, according to a November filing, meaning the bank
expects to recoup the money.  As the litigation continues, it’s possible BB&T will cut
tax reserves by as much as $496 million or increase them by as
much as $328 million, according to today’s statement.  The IRS’s demand for $892 million represents about 44
percent of BB&T’s reported  annual profit  of $2.03 billion in
2012. The stock gained 3 percent in the past 12 months, trailing
the 24 percent gain the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
