Nigeria ’s naira retreated to the
lowest in three months against the dollar on demand for the U.S.
currency to fund gasoline imports.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer declined 0.3
percent, to 157.90 a dollar as of 3:33 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the weakest since Nov. 27, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria relies on imports to meet 70 percent of its fuel
needs because of inadequate refining capacity, according to the
Petroleum Ministry. Fuel imports have been a source of pressure
on the naira, according to the central bank.  The currency’s decline is “a result of heightened demand
for dollars by oil importers, despite increased supply by the
central bank,” Oladipupo Adekanmbi and Denis Okolie, analysts
at Lagos-based Greenwich Trust Group Ltd., said today in an e-
mailed note to clients.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $150 million at an auction
yesterday, compared with $120 million at the previous sale on
Feb. 20, according to data on its website. The regulator, which
sells dollars to lenders on Mondays and Wednesdays, aims to keep
the currency within a 3 percent band around 155 per dollar.  The Abuja-based bank held the benchmark  interest rate  at a
record high 12 percent for an eighth straight time on Jan. 21 to
control inflation and stabilize the naira.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 fell seven basis points to 10.49 percent, according
to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 rose five basis points to 4.482 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for the seventh day, dropping less
than 0.1 percent to 1.9155 per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
