Using storage-friendly electric
heaters in homes could double the amount of energy that can be
stored in the European Union by 2050, according to a report.  The study, commissioned by British utility  SSE Plc (SSE)  and
Dublin-based Glen Dimplex Group, found that switching to so-
called smart electric thermal storage systems in the 27-member
European Union bloc could provide 54 gigawatts of additional
capacity by 2050 and cut emissions.  There are currently 51 gigawatts of storage in the region,
mainly from pumping water for hydroelectric power, the study by
Dutch consultancy DNV KEMA Energy & Sustainability showed. The
smart electric thermal system allows excess renewable
electricity to be stored in people’s homes in the form of heat
for use during the day when demand outstrips supply, according
to the SSE statement.  The European Union wants to boost storage technologies that
allow for more of the intermittent wind and solar plants its
relying on to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 20 percent by the end
of the decade. While storage technology can accommodate sudden
changes in renewable output, reduce pressure on the grid and
allow excess supply to be used later, it has received only
limited attention from policy makers, the report said.  “No matter what the energy supply mix looks like in the
future, it is clear that there will be more renewables on the
system, which means it will be crucial to find new ways to
balance the variability of supply in a smarter electricity
grid,” Ian Marchant, chief executive of Perth, Scotland-based
SSE, said in the statement.  SSE and Dimplex developed a model, on sale since January,
that reduces heating energy use by as much as 20 percent and
results in cost savings of about 25 percent compared with
traditional versions that charge during the night and release
heat in the day. SSE’s and Dimplex’s Quantum model charges at
anytime and allows customers to control the release of heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
