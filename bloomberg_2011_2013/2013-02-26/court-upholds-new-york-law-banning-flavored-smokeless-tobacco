Altria Group Inc. (MO)  lost a bid to
block a 2009 New York City law banning the sale of flavored
smokeless tobacco products except in tobacco bars.  The U.S. appeals court in New York today upheld a lower-
court ruling which rejected arguments by two Altria units, U.S.
Smokeless Tobacco Manufacturing and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco
Brands, that the city’s measure is pre-empted by federal law.  The Altria units, which make and distribute the Copenhagen
and Skoal brands of smokeless tobacco, had argued that the
ordinance imposed manufacturing standards on their products, in
conflict with federal law.  U.S. District Judge  Colleen McMahon  in November 2011 denied
their request for an order blocking the law, finding in favor of
the city. New York has only eight tobacco bars, none of which
sells flavored smokeless tobacco, the appeals court said today.  “We’re disappointed with the court’s decision and are
considering our options,” said Brian May, a spokesman for
Richmond, Virginia-based Altria, the biggest U.S. tobacco
company.  New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  is the founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  The case is U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Manufacturing Co. v.
City of New York, 11-cv-5167,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
