DuPont Co. (DD) , the second-largest seed
company, has begun developing hybrid wheat varieties to
accelerate yield gains in the world’s most planted crop.  Hybrid wheat technology has been added at the first phase
of a five-step research and development pipeline at DuPont’s
Pioneer seed unit, Jim Borel, executive vice president of the
Wilmington, Delaware-based company, said today in a webcast from
a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference.  Creation of hybrid wheat, which would be formed by cross-
breeding two varieties, is a new effort for DuPont, which has
previously announced plans to try to boost yields through
genetic modification of the crop. Dow Chemical Co. and  Monsanto
Co. (MON)  are also attempting genetic modifications. Yields in wheat,
which is self-pollinating, have trailed hybrid corn, which is
the progeny of two parents.  “Wheat is planted on more acres globally than any other
crop but productivity improvements have lagged the other major
crops,” Borel said in the presentation.  Agriculture accounted for 30 percent of 2012 sales for
DuPont, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Monsanto is the
largest seed company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
