Spark Capital, an investor in
Twitter Inc. and Tumblr Inc., raised $450 million for its
largest fund dedicated to consumer-focused Web companies.  The firm is betting that even after the shares of companies
such as Facebook Inc., Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. declined
after their public offerings, there’s money left to be made in
consumer-oriented websites. That’s particularly true in
industries such as health care and education that were slower to
adopt online technologies, said Todd Dagres, a founder and
general partner.  When the firm started in 2005, “there wasn’t as much
competition, there weren’t as many VCs investing in the target
area we were,” Dagres said in an interview. “Back then we had
no brand. Now we’re much more competitive.”  Spark Capital, which raised $360 million for its previous
fund, raised more money to follow through on investment rounds
as early-stage companies matured, Dagres said. Boston-based
Spark prefers to take on about 30 companies per fund, with its
investments ranging from Warby Parker, an online eyeglasses
shop, to Adap.tv Inc., a marketplace for video advertising, he
said.  “In order to build a company like Tumblr, it takes a lot
of capital, and we’ve been able to participate in every round,”
Dagres said, referring to the New York-based blogging platform.
“We like having enough money to follow our deals through the
entire life cycle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
