Axt Inc. (AXTI)  rose the most in five
months after the maker of semiconductor components projected
first-quarter revenue that was higher than analysts’ estimates.  The shares climbed 6.4 percent to $2.98 at 3:07 p.m. in  New
York  after jumping as much as 11 percent for the biggest
intraday gain since Sept. 21.  Sales in the current quarter will be $20 million to $21
million, Chief Financial Officer Raymond Low said yesterday on a
conference call. Analysts projected $19 million, the average of
five  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company forecast a
loss of as much as 8 cents a share in the quarter.  Still, Axt’s profitability is poised to rise this year,
driven by an increase in demand for light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and mobile phones, which use Axt’s  gallium -based
components, said Dave Kang, an analyst with B. Riley & Co. in
San Francisco.  In the “second half of this year we do expect LEDs and
wireless handsets to turn” higher, Kang said in a telephone
interview. “When they turn, they should drive gallium prices
higher and that in turn should drive the company’s gross margin
to expand.”  Kang has a buy rating on the shares and has a 12-month
price target of $4.60.  Axt had  dropped  51 percent in the last 12 months through
yesterday, compared with a gain of less than 1 percent for the
Russell 2000 Technology Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
