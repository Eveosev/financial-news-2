E.W. Scripps Co. (SSP)  fell the most in
three months after the owner of more than a dozen newspapers and
19 television stations said revenue from TV ads will drop this
year after a boost in 2012 from political campaigns.  The  shares  slid 5.5 percent to $10.73 at the close in  New
York , the biggest drop since Nov. 14. They have declined less
than 1 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
has risen 5 percent.  The percentage drop in 2013 revenue from TV ads will be in
the “high single digits,” the Cincinnati-based company said
today in its fourth-quarter earnings statement. Televised
campaign-ad sales surged more than 16-fold from a year earlier
to $56.9 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to net
income that more than quadrupled to $27.2 million.  Television stations benefited during 2012 from the
presidential-year election campaigns as well as the  Summer
Olympics , making for tough comparisons this year.  The company said its newspaper revenue will fall “at a low
single-digit rate” in 2013. For all of last year, television
accounted for 55 percent of the company’s $903.5 million in
 sales , while newspapers were 44 percent. E.W. Scripps added four
TV stations at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
