Serbia  expects to pay 700 million
euros ($916 million) by 2020 in incentives for electricity made
from renewable sources, the energy minister said.  The estimate is based on revised feed-in tariffs,
incentives to purchase electricity from renewables at higher
rates, which took effect earlier this month in the Balkan
country, Energy Minister Zorana Mihajlovic told a business forum
in Belgrade today.  “It’s a considerable burden for Serbia, but we have to,”
Mihajlovic said, adding that under the agreement with the
Vienna-based  Energy Community  Serbia is obliged to increase the
share of renewables in its energy mix to 27 percent by the end
of the decade from 21.2 percent.  Serbia has 19 megawatts in facilities eligible for the
feed-in tariffs and expects 1,092 megawatts of additional
capacity in seven years through the incentives for energy
investors, Deputy Energy Minister Dejan Trifunovic said Feb. 6.  Serbia made hydro plants of up to 30 megawatts eligible for
the support, compared with 10 megawatts previously, and
increased the tariff by about a third to between 7.4 euro cents
and 13.7 euro cents per kilowatt hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
