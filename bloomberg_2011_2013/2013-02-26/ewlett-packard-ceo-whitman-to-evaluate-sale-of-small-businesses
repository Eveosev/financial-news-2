Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  Chief Executive
Officer Meg Whitman said the world’s largest personal-computer
maker will evaluate selling small businesses or projects that
don’t fit its plans while keeping its main operating divisions.  Whitman’s remarks came in an on-stage interview with Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, at the securities firm’s
technology conference today in San Francisco. They echoed
comments she made on the company’s quarterly earnings call on
Feb. 21. In a regulatory filing Dec. 27, Hewlett-Packard said it
would consider disposing of “assets and businesses that may no
longer help us meet our objectives.”  At the Morgan Stanley conference today, Whitman said
Hewlett-Packard would consider divesting “small businesses” or
technology projects such as the Halo videoconferencing product
that it sold to  Polycom Inc. (PLCM)  in 2011.  “But nothing at the level of our core operating
divisions,” she said, referring to the big units she aims to
keep.  Yesterday, Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard said
it is selling the WebOS operating system and associated
engineering staff to  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , which plans to use the
technology in Internet-connected televisions. Today, Whitman
reiterated that the company is committed to its five-year
turnaround plan and will return to  revenue  growth in fiscal
2014.  Hewlett-Packard  shares  rose 3.8 percent to $19.79 in at the
close in New York. They have  gained  39 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
