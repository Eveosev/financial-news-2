(Corrects headline and story to say De Lima decided not to
run for president.)  Panama Finance Minister Frank De Lima wonâ€™t try to succeed President Ricardo Martinelli as leader
of the Central American nation in 2014 elections.  De Lima, an economic adviser to Martinelli during his
campaign for president, took over as finance minister in
September 2011 after a split in the ruling coalition. The 41-
year-old economist will remain at his post, the government said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
