American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. water company, said fourth-quarter
income fell 14 percent because of increased costs and reduced
sales after Hurricane Sandy.  Net income fell to about $55 million, or 30 cents a share,
from $65 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier, the
Voorhees, New Jersey-based company said in a statement today.
That was three cents less than the average of eight estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Income for all of 2012 increased 16 percent to $358.1
million, or $2.11 a share, as “sales were increased by the
abnormally hot, dry weather in the summer,” Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Sterba said in the statement.  American Water Works reiterated that it expects 2013
earnings per share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25.  The company said last month that earnings in the fourth
quarter would be affected by  Hurricane Sandy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
