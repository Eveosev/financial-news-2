The rate of violent crimes committed
against women in  Canada ’s three northern territories was far
higher than the national average in 2011, according to a report
by the country’s statistics agency.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows violent crimes committed against
women and reported to police occurred 12.8 times more often in
Nunavut than the national average,  Statistics Canada  said
yesterday. The  Northwest Territories ’ rate is about nine times
the average while Yukon’s is almost quadruple, according to the
report.  “As with violent crime overall, the territories have
consistently recorded the highest rates of police-reported
violence against women in the country,”  Maire Sinha , the
report’s editor, said.  Demographics are probably a factor, according to the
report. The three territories, home to about 113,000 of Canada’s
34.9 million people, have a population that’s significantly
younger and more likely to be single, identify as aboriginal,
and have less than a high school education than the rest of
Canada. Women in all of those groups are more likely to be
victims of violent crime, the data show.  Violence against women, which remains a “significant
barrier” to equality, may also affect the country by lowering
output and productivity for employers and increasing the costs
of health care and correctional services, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
