Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near the lowest level in more than a month as
the Chinese government prepared property-control measures.  Rebar for October delivery fell as much as 1.1 percent to
3,971  yuan  ($636) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the lowest price since Jan. 17 for the most active contract. It
traded at 4,019 yuan at 10:58 a.m. local time.  The government has completed a draft of property controls
designed to cool the real estate market, Shanghai Securities
News reported today.  China  may also tighten monetary policy
because of excessive liquidity in the market and rising home
prices, China Securities Journal said in a commentary today.  “There’s expectations that the government will introduce
more measures to curb real estate investments after the National
People’s Congress, which will reduce demand for rebar,” Shenyin
& Wanguo Futures Co., said in a report today.  New home prices rose in most cities the government tracked
in January. Cities that have had “excessively fast” price
gains should impose home-purchase restrictions if they’ve not
done so already, according to a statement released Feb. 20 after
a State Council meeting headed by Premier  Wen Jiabao .  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.7 percent to 3,840
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery fell
1.1 percent yesterday to $151.90 a ton, according to data
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
