Nokia Siemens Networks, the phone-
equipment venture that may be losing its German partner, agreed
to guarantee jobs for three years for its 250 employees in
Berlin, the  IG Metall  labor union said.  The manufacturer pledged to withhold from any mass firings
at its sites in the city during the period, the union  said  on
its website.  “An important tenet of the wage accord is a commitment to
the further development of business areas here in Berlin,”
Astrid Diebitsch, head of the Berlin works council at Nokia
Siemens, said in the statement. “We now finally have three
years of security and time to devote ourselves to the business
rather than restructuring.”  The future of the network-manufacturing partnership of
Espoo, Finland-based mobile-phone maker  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and Munich-
based  Siemens AG (SIE)  remains in doubt as an agreement keeping both
investors in the venture expires in April. Siemens has
intensified efforts to exit the project, with options including
a stake sale or initial public offering, people familiar with
the situation said this month.  The six-year-old venture sold its business-support systems
unit to  Redknee Solutions Inc. (RKN)  and its optical-networks business
to Marlin Equity Partners in December to reduce costs and focus
on mobile broadband. The two disposed units have a combined 700
employees in Berlin, IG Metall said today.  Nokia Siemens Networks Chief Operating Officer Samih Elhage
was appointed chief financial officer a week ago following the
departure of Marco Schroeter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
