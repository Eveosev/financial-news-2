Parkland Fuel Corp. (PKI) ,  Canada ’s
largest independent fuel distributor, slumped the most intraday
in five months after reporting earnings short of estimates that
led an analyst at National Bank Financial to lower his rating.  Parkland plunged as much as 14 percent to C$16.52 and was
down 7.1 percent to C$17.91 at 10:59 a.m. in Toronto, the most
intraday since Sept. 26. The stock had  risen  1.9 percent in 2013
through yesterday and was the top performer in the S&P/TSX
Energy index in 2012  The Red Deer, Alberta-based company reported fourth-quarter
adjusted  earnings  of 18 Canadian cents a share, 49 percent lower
than the 36 cent average estimate of two analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Trevor Johnson, analyst with National Bank Financial,
lowered his rating to sector perform, the equivalent of a hold,
from outperform, the same as a buy. He also cut his price target
to C$20 from C$21.  “Given the light quarter and 2014 valuation headwinds we
are downgrading to sector perform,” he said in a note to
clients today. “The challenge now is that as we roll forward
our valuation to 2014 we lose the refining margins provided
alongside the Suncor contract, which we estimate totaled upwards
of C$40 million in EBITDA in 2012.”  Top Stock  Parkland  has been reaping the rewards of a supply contract
with  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  in place since 1997 in which it shares a
portion of Suncor’s refining margins. That contract expires at
the end of this year.  Parkland’s fuel gross profits in its wholesale, supply and
distribution division jumped 70 percent in 2012 to C$119.4
million due to high refiners’ margins. The company will host an
investor day in Toronto on March 18 to provide “a detailed
forecast” guidance for 2014 to 2016, after expiry of the Suncor
contract.  Parkland’s commercial fuel volumes declined 20 percent to
382 million liters compared with 476 million liters a year ago,
due to lower industrial activity and the reallocation of some
supply to its other divisions, Johnson said.  “The company intends to continue diversifying its customer
base and simplifying operations to drive margins in order to
combat headwinds facing its exposure to tempered oil and gas and
construction sectors,” Johnson said.  Bob Espey, chief executive officer of Parkland, said in a
statement the company experienced “softness” in its core
commercial markets due to weaknesses in the natural resource
sector.  “We are well-positioned for growth when the industries we
support pick up again,” Espey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
