Carlyle Group LP (CG) ’s  David Rubenstein 
said he expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates
low as it continues to boost the economy.  Low rates have “been a very good fuel for economic growth
in the United States,” Rubenstein, Carlyle’s co-chief executive
officer, said today in an interview in Berlin with Bloomberg
Television. “The greatest fortune to be made in the U.S. in the
next two or three years is going to be made by somebody who
explicitly determines when the interest rises will occur,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
