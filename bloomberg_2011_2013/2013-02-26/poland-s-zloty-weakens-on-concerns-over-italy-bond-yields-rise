The Polish currency weakened against
the euro for the first time in three days as investors pulled
back from Central European currencies on concern that
 Italy ’s election will result in political deadlock.  “What happened in Italy is a risk-off, which results in a
decline of the euro against the dollar, strengthening of the yen
and a retreat from regional currencies,” including the zloty,
the  Czech Koruna  and the forint, Karol Zaluski, chief foreign
exchange dealer at ING Bank Slaski in Warsaw, said by phone.  The zloty weakened 0.4 percent to 4.1637 against the euro
at 12:04 p.m. in Warsaw, the biggest decline among more than 20
emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The Koruna also
fell 0.4 percent and the forint dropped 0.2 percent.  The yield on the Polish government’s  10-year zloty bonds 
fell for the first time in three days, declining as much as six
basis points to 3.99 percent today, the lowest level in three
weeks.  “Polish bonds followed core markets today, mainly
German bonds,” said Marek Kaczor, head of fixed income
and derivatives trading at PKO BP SA. “What catches the eye is
that any rise in prices is immediately used to sell papers. The
market opened quite optimistically today and there was a flood
of offers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
