Apax Partners LLP Chief Executive
Officer Martin Halusa said he expects the number of “mega
deals” to increase as fundraising by private equity firms
rebounds and debt financing for dealmaking increases.  “The great recession in terms of fundraising is really
over and heading towards a period perhaps more like 2004, 2005
in terms of amounts of money raised,” he said at the
SuperReturn International conference in Berlin today. “Larger
commitments will be made to fewer firms.”  Investment banks may be able to provide debt financing of
as much as 15 billion, he added, without specifying which
currency he was referring to.  “That would seduce private equity firms into looking at
very large deals again,” he said. “However, I believe the
recession has taught most of the firms that would do mega deals
to be much more careful particularly on the debt side.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
