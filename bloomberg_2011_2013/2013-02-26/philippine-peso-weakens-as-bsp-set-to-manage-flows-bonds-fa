The Philippine peso fell the most
this month as the central bank studies measures to curb
speculation in the currency, which is trading near a five-year
high.  Government bonds  dropped.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas “is looking at an array of
instruments including  reserve requirements , special-deposit
accounts and a rediscounting facility, which may be changed
operationally,” assistant Governor Cyd Amador said Feb 22.
Imports, which increased 13 percent in December from a year
earlier, will help curb volatility in the peso, she said.  “There could be tighter rules on inflows to discourage
speculation,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at  China Banking
Corp. (CHIB)  in Manila. Authorities may also take a more liberal
approach on outflows, he said.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 40.757 per dollar in
Manila, data from Tullett Prebon Plc show. The currency reached
40.55 on Feb. 14 and Jan. 14, the strongest level since March
2008, and has appreciated 0.7 percent this year. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, was unchanged at 3.9 percent.  The central bank cut the  interest rate  it pays on special-
deposit accounts to 3 percent from 3.5 percent last month, while
keeping the benchmark overnight borrowing rate at a record-low
3.5 percent.  The yield on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.92 percent in
Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
