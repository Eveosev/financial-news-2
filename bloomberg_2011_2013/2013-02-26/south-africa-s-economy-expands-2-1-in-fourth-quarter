South Africa ’s  economy , the
continent’s largest, grew at a faster pace in the final quarter
of last year than the previous three months as manufacturing and
agricultural output expanded, the statistics agency said.  Gross domestic product rose an annualized 2.1 percent from
1.2 percent in the third quarter, Statistics South Africa said
in a report released today in  Pretoria , the capital. The median
 estimate  of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for growth
of 1.7 percent. The economy grew 2.5 percent for the whole of
last year, down from 3.5 percent in 2011.  South Africa’s economy is expanding at less than half the
pace President  Jacob Zuma  says is necessary to slash a 24.9
percent jobless rate, the highest of more than 30 emerging-
market nations tracked by Bloomberg. Work stoppages that began
at platinum mines in August spread to gold shafts, while
thousands of truck drivers went on strike last quarter over
higher pay, disrupting output.  “While better than expected, overall growth remained
sluggish over the final quarter,” Adenaan Hardien, chief
economist at  Cadiz Holdings Ltd. (CDZ)  in Cape Town, said in e-mailed
comments. “The manufacturing sector performed better than was
expected. Although mining remained a drag on overall GDP, it was
less so than over the third quarter. Transport and financial
services also performed better. We expect growth to continue its
recovery through 2013.”  Strike Cost  Mining strikes cost the economy more than 10 billion rand
($1.1 billion) in lost output and exports and shaved about 0.5
percentage point off GDP last year, according to estimates from
the National Treasury.  Mining fell an annualized 9.3 percent in the fourth
quarter, while electricity slumped 2.2 percent, the statistics
agency said. Manufacturing expanded by 5 percent, agriculture by
10 percent, finance by 2.9 percent and transport by 1.9 percent.  The rand strengthened as much as 0.9 percent against the
dollar and traded 0.4 percent higher at 8.8264 at 1:45 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10.5 percent
bonds maturing in March 2026 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 7.23 percent.  In January, the  Reserve Bank  cut its forecast for economic
growth this year to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent, while Zuma
told Parliament on Feb. 14 that the economy is likely to expand
2.5 percent this year.  GDP needs to increase an average 7 percent a year through
2020 to cut the jobless rate to 14 percent, according to
government estimates.  The Reserve Bank has kept the benchmark  repurchase rate  at
5 percent since a surprise cut in July, concerned that a weaker
rand and higher wages will push inflation above the 3 percent to
6 percent target band.  To contact the reporters on this story:
