Bank of Montreal , which bought
Marshall & Ilsley Corp. in 2011 to double its U.S. presence,
doesn’t see much opportunity for U.S. consumer bank
acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer William Downe said.  “We don’t see much on the horizon,” Downe said today in a
telephone interview from Toronto where the bank is based. “I
think there’s an expectation on the part of owners that
valuations are going to rise.”  Canada ’s fourth-largest bank announced U.S. banking profit
climbed 14 percent to C$182 million ($177.3 million), helping
the lender top analyst estimates. Overall profit fell 5.5
percent to C$1.05 billion, or C$1.53 a share.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  may continue to look at  acquisitions 
outside of the U.S. in areas including  wealth management , Downe
said. Any purchase would have to be “strategically well-
aligned” with the bank’s strategy, he said.  “There are many other things for sale that just don’t have
those characteristics,” Downe said. “I think it’s just a
question of probably one in 10, or one in 20 assets would be a
good match for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
