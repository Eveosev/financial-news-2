Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Hungary’s largest
refiner, fell after reporting a smaller-than-expected fourth-
quarter profit as the recession hit fuel sales, Syrian
production ceased and gas trading in  Croatia  suffered a loss.  The shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and slid 1.6 percent
to 17,210 forint by the close in Budapest, the lowest level
since Dec. 20. The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which Mol has a
31 percent weighting, dropped 1.8 percent.  Net income was 7.7 billion forint ($34 million), compared
with a restated net loss of 29.1 billion forint a year earlier,
the company said in a filing to the Budapest Stock Exchange
today. The median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a profit of 26.1 billion forint. Net income
adjusted for special items amounted to 11.2 billion forint,
compared with 20.8 billion forint a year earlier.  “Mol underperformed even the most pessimistic analyst
forecasts with its earnings report this morning,”  KBC Groep
NV (KBC) ’s Equitas unit said in an e-mailed research report today.  Fuel sales fell in Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia because of
struggling economies and high fuel prices in the region, Mol
said.  The year “could be just as challenging as 2012 was, taking
into account the slow economic growth in  Europe  or the
tightening regulatory environment in many countries,” Mol
Chairman  Zsolt Hernadi  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
