Commerzbank AG (CBK) ’s debut issue of
covered bonds backed by loans to small- and medium-sized
companies is eligible for inclusion in a benchmark index
operated by  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Pacific Investment Management Co. said this month that
admission to indexes was “key” to the success of the 500
million euros ($653 million) of bonds the Frankfurt-based bank
issued Feb. 21.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , which oversees $3.79 trillion as
the world’s largest money manager, said using SMEs to back the
securities rather than safer real estate or public-sector debt
may devalue the asset class.  The notes will be included in Barclays’s Global and Euro
Covered Bond indexes, according to an e-mailed statement from
Jodie Gray, a spokeswoman for the U.K. lender in  London .  Banks are starting to seek alternatives to the real estate
and public-sector debt traditionally used to collateralize the
securities pioneered in 18th century Prussia. They’re running
out of these safer assets to package into covered bonds, a
process hastened by the meltdown of Europe’s property market.  Fitch Ratings said this month that at least two other
lenders are preparing to follow Commerzbank with SME-backed
issues.  Separately, Markit Group Ltd. said in a  statement  on its
website that Commerzbank deal will be “provisionally”
classified as collateralized in the company’ indexes.  The
company, which manages the Iboxx indexes, may consider including
the deal in other performance benchmarks.  Karsten Swoboda, a spokesman for Commerzbank, referred
questions to Barclays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
