Former  BTA Bank (BTAS)  Chairman  Mukhtar Ablyazov , accused of embezzling from the Kazakh lender before
its default four years ago, was denied permission by the U.K.
Supreme Court to appeal a contempt ruling and prison sentence.  BTA previously won judgments against Ablyazov for about
$2 billion in two claims against him, and is in the process of
seeking a judgment for $1.55 billion more, the Almaty-based bank
said today in an e-mailed statement. Ablyazov fled the U.K. in
February 2012 after being sentenced to 22 months in prison for
contempt of court. His whereabouts are unknown.  “Today’s decision marks the end of Mr. Ablyazov’s legal
maneuvering and will expedite the enforcement of the significant
judgments we have won,” Pavel Prosyankin, the managing director
overseeing BTA’s asset-recovery process, said in the statement.  Ablyazov, accused of helping embezzle more than $5 billion
in fraudulent loans, was found in contempt of a U.K. court for
violating a 2009 asset-freeze order by lying about his assets
and moving money. Two months before BTA’s 2009 default on its
debt,  Kazakhstan ’s sovereign wealth fund took over the bank,
then the central Asian nation’s biggest bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
