Italy ’s government bonds slumped,
leading declines among securities from  Europe ’s high-deficit
nations, as inconclusive election results triggered renewed
concern that the region’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen.  Italian  10-year yields  climbed the most in 14 months as
results showed pre-election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won the
lower house by less than a half a percentage point, while Silvio Berlusconi, the former premier fighting a tax-fraud conviction,
gained a blocking minority in the Senate. Spanish and Portuguese
securities also slid, while German and Finnish bonds advanced
for a fourth day. Italy sold 8.75 billion euros ($11.4 billion)
of six-month bills at the highest yield since October.  “There are huge moves in Italian bonds because of the
uncertainty,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist
at Rabobank International in  London . “The Italian election
result hasn’t gone as the market anticipated. We could be in a
stalemate in Italy for a while and that’s dragging all the
peripheral spreads wider compared with  Germany ,” he said,
referring to the yield difference between bunds and securities
from Europe’s high deficit nations.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed 40 basis points, or 0.4
percentage point, to 4.89 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time after
rising as much as 44 basis points, the biggest increase since
Dec. 19, 2011. The 5.5 percent bond due November 2022 fell
3.165, or 31.65 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 105.08.  Spread Widens  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Italian 10-year securities instead of similar-maturity bunds
widened 50 basis points to 344 basis points after expanding to
347 basis points, the most since Dec. 11.  Berlusconi and former comedian Beppe Grillo, the candidates
running to reverse the austerity measures implemented by Premier
Mario Monti to contain the country’s financial crisis, won about
55 percent of the popular vote.  Bersani’s coalition polled 29.54 percent in the lower house
compared with 29.18 percent for Berlusconi’s group and 25.55
percent for Grillo. Bersani and his allies got 31.63 percent of
votes in the Senate, versus 30.72 percent for Berlusconi and
23.79 percent for Grillo, according to the Interior Ministry. An
Italian government requires a majority in both houses.  Berlusconi acknowledged Bersani’s narrow victory in the
lower house and said he’s open to a broad alliance to avoid a
second election.  “Everyone needs to think what good can be done for Italy
and this will take some time,” Berlusconi said in an interview
with Canale 5, a station owned by his  Mediaset SpA (MS)  broadcaster.
The country can’t be left without a government, he said.  ECB Pledge  The market may use the Italian election results to test the
European Central Bank’s pledge to backstop the euro region,
 Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in
London, wrote in a note to investors. Ten-year yields may climb
to 5.50 percent in an “adverse scenario,” he said.  Italy sold the 183-day bills at a yield of 1.237 percent,
the highest since October. Investors bid for 1.44 times the
amount of securities allotted, down from 1.65 times on Jan. 29.
The Rome-based Treasury plans to sell as much as 6.5 billion
euros of five- and 10-year bonds tomorrow.  The nation last auctioned the securities maturing in
November 2017 on Jan. 30 at an average yield of 2.94 percent.
The same day, it sold benchmark 10-year bonds at 4.17 percent.  “Italy’s election results suggested a hung parliament, the
most unfriendly outcome for financial markets,” Giuseppe Maraffino, a strategist at Barclays Plc in London, wrote in a
note to clients. “Pressure on Italian yields is likely to
increase in the next few days, also fueled by supply pressure
ahead of the auctions.”  Bond Movers  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Spain and  Finland , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two-year and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Spanish 10-year yields jumped 20 basis points to 5.36
percent, after rising as much as 43 basis points, the most since
Aug. 2.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield climbed 39 basis points to 6.56
percent, while its  two-year rate  surged 28 basis points to 3.53
percent after reaching 4.29 percent, the most since Dec. 3.  German 10-year yields fell 10 basis points to 1.45 percent,
the lowest level since Jan. 3. The rate on similar-maturity
Finnish bonds declined eight basis points to 1.66 percent.  French and Belgian government bonds underperformed their
German peers. The  additional yield  investors demand to hold
French 10-year bonds over similar-maturity German bunds widened
four basis points to 71 basis points, after reaching 75 basis
points, the most since Nov. 21. The Belgian-German 10-year
 spread  expanded five basis points to 92 basis points.  Italian government bonds returned 11 percent in the past
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish securities gained 6 percent, while German
bunds rose 3.5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
