 Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying
said the government will send immigration officers to  Egypt 
after a hot-air balloon accident there killed at least 18
people, including several from the city.  Government departments will connect with the Chinese
Embassy in Egypt after the accident, Leung said, according to a
statement from his office today. The embassy set up a four-
member team to respond.  Leung expressed his condolences to the families of the
victims. Nine people from  Hong Kong  were among the dead from the
balloon crash, Badawi Masry, the head of media department in
Luxor Province, said by phone from the crash site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
