The Syrian army killed at least 141
people in attacks this month with ballistic missiles on three
populated areas in Aleppo and one town nearby,  Human Rights
Watch  said.  The strikes during the week of Feb. 17 killed 71 children
and caused “immense” physical destruction, the New York-based
human rights group said in an e-mailed statement. There were no
signs of opposition military targets in the areas, which would
mean that the strikes were “unlawful,” it said.  Syrian rebels have been trying to oust President Bashar al- Assad from power since March 2011. The conflict has killed about
70,000 people, according to United Nations estimates, and
crippled the Syrian economy as fighting curbs power, oil and
agricultural production across the country.  The extent of the damage in Aleppo and the lack of aircraft
in the area at the time “overwhelmingly suggest” that the
Syrian army fired the ballistic missiles,  Human Rights Watch 
said. In each site, the attack destroyed 15 to 20 houses and
damaged many more, the group said.  In the Ard al-Hamra neighborhood in eastern Aleppo, a
missile attack killed at least 78 people, including 38 children,
the group said. In Aleppo’s Jabal Badro, 47 people were killed,
it said.  “I have visited many attack sites in  Syria , but have never
seen such destruction,” said Ole Solvang, emergencies
researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Just when you think things
can’t get any worse, the Syrian government finds ways to
escalate its killing tactics.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
