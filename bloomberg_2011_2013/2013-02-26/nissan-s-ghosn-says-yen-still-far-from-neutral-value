Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn , who has called 100 yen to the dollar the
“neutral” value for the Japanese currency, said the yen should
weaken further.  The yen is “still far from neutral territory,” Ghosn told
reporters today in Yokohama, Japan.  Nissan, which gains about 20 billion yen ($216 million) in
operating income for every one-yen drop against the dollar, has
shifted some production out of Japan because the currency held
near its postwar high for the past two years. The yen has
weakened by about 13 percent since Nov. 15, when Shinzo Abe,
frontrunner at the time to be elected Japan’s Prime Minister,
called for “unlimited” monetary stimulus.  Nissan fell 2 percent to 921 yen at the 11:30 a.m. trading
break in Tokyo, trimming its  gain this year  to 14 percent. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average is up 11 percent in 2013.  The yen fell 0.6 percent to 92.37 per dollar as of 12:06
p.m. in Tokyo.  Ghosn also said today that demand for Japanese cars in
 China  is “getting there” after declining last year because of
anti-Japanese sentiment related to a territorial dispute.  The carmaker’s sales fell 5.3 percent in China, the world’s
biggest vehicle market, last year.  Nissan is more affected than other Japanese automakers by a
slump in China because it sells about one in four of its
vehicles in the country, the largest proportion of sales there
among its peers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
