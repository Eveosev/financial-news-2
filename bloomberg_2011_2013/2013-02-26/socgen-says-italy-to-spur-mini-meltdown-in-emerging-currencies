Developing-nation currencies will
extend declines as Italy’s election stalemate spurs concern that
the euro-area’s debt crisis will deepen and weaken global
economic growth, according to  Societe Generale SA. (GLE)   “For the time being, emerging-market assets have been
rather insensitive to the trouble brewing elsewhere,”  Benoit Anne , the London-based head of global emerging markets strategy
at SocGen, wrote in a client note yesterday. “This worries me
as this could actually trigger some painful catching-up down the
road,” and a “mini-meltdown” in currencies, he wrote.  Russia’s ruble and the Indian rupee led declines in
emerging-market currencies yesterday as the lack of a clear
result in Italy’s election prompted investors to sell higher-
yielding assets. JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Emerging Market
Volatility Index, which reflects investors’ expectations of
currency fluctuations, rose to 7.71 percent yesterday, the
highest level since October.  Investors should sell more volatile currencies, such as the
Hungarian forint, South African rand,  Mexican peso  and South
Korean won, Anne wrote. Investors can also bet greater currency
swings, he wrote.  There’s a 75 percent chance of a “serious sell-off” in
developing-nation assets, and a 25 percent chance of a
“strong” rally, Anne wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
