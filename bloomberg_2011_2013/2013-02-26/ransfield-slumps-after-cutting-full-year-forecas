Transfield Services Ltd. (TSE) , an
Australian engineering company, fell the most in 18 months in
Sydney trading after cutting its full-year profit forecast by as
much as 37 percent because of weak demand.  Transfield slumped as much as 15 percent and was headed for
the biggest decline since August 2011. Shares of the Sydney-
based company fell 5.7 percent to A$1.825 at 1:37 p.m. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index slipped 0.7 percent.  The company posted a record half-year loss today and said
falling earnings at the Easternwell mineral exploration business
and the Timec oil-refinery unit would lead to profit excluding
one-time items of between A$85 million ($87 million) and A$90
million in the 12 months ending June. That’s less than its Aug.
29  forecast  of A$125 million to A$135 million, and the A$107
million average of 14  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect investors to remain concerned about the future
earnings ability, and therefore continued carrying value, of
Easternwell,” Anthony Passe-de Silva, an analyst with JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in Sydney, wrote in a note Feb. 19. A recovery is
“unlikely to come through in the near term” at Easternwell, as
mineral companies scale back spending plans, he wrote.  The net loss in the six months ended Dec. 30 totaled A$247
million, driven by A$275 million in impairments to Easternwell
and Timec, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
