American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) 
reported a $904 million net loss for December in the first
monthly operating report during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  AMR said $713 million of the net loss was related to
writing down the value of some of its Boeing Co. 757 airplanes.
Excluding interest expense, reorganization costs and other
items, the deficit was $728 million, the Fort Worth, Texas-based
carrier said today in a  regulatory filing .  Cash and short-term investments totaled $4 billion, little
changed from the $4.1 billion the company reported as of Nov.
25, just before filing for court protection.  AMR’s total disbursements for December were $2.19 billion,
and liabilities were $8.63 billion. Revenue was $2 billion. The
company didn’t give comparisons for the year-earlier period.  The third-largest U.S. carrier, which traces its roots to
1920s air-mail operations in the Midwest, listed $24.7 billion
in assets and $29.6 billion in debt in Chapter 11 papers filed
Nov. 29 in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
