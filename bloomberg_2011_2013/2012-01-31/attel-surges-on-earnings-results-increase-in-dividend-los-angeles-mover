Mattel Inc. (MAT) , the world’s largest
toymaker, rose the most in five months after increasing its
dividend and reporting fourth-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates.  The manufacturer of the Barbie brand advanced 5 percent to
$31 at 4 p.m. in New York. That’s the largest gain since Aug. 9
and the highest price since Dec. 8, 1998.  Mattel boosted its quarterly dividend by 35 percent to 31
cents a share from 23 cents, the El Segundo, California-based
company said today in a statement. Net income for the quarter
ended Dec. 31 rose 14 percent to $370.6 million, or $1.07 a
share, from $325.2 million, or 89 cents a year earlier. Analysts
projected $1, the average of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company also increased prices in the mid-single digits
this month to help combat the rising costs of plastic, labor and
transportation that narrowed profit margins last year. Gross
margin, or the percentage of sales left after cost of goods,
declined 0.3 percentage points in 2011 to 50.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
