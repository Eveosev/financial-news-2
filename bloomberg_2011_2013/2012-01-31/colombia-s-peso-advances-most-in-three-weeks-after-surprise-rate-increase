Colombia’s peso jumped the most in
three weeks and bond yields rose after the central bank
unexpectedly raised  interest rates  in a bid to keep inflation in
check.  The peso advanced 1 percent to 1,800 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:07 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,817.75 yesterday, the biggest gain
on a closing basis since Jan. 10. The currency market closed
yesterday before the central bank raised the overnight interest
rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent, a move forecast by only
one of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest predicted
no change in rates.  Yields on the government’s peso bonds due May 2014 rose 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.21 percent,
according to data from the country’s stock exchange.  The rate increase is the eighth since the beginning of last
year as  Colombia ’s central bankers seek to cool the fastest
economic growth in five years and prevent an inflation pickup,
even as their counterparts from  Brazil  to Indonesia trim
interest rates to fend off the effects of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The surprise move follows a 25-basis-point increase in
November, when the seven-member board, led by central bank chief
Jose Dario Uribe, cited the need to bolster credibility amid
rising inflation expectations. Policy makers kept the rate on
hold in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
