The  Federal Reserve ’s decision to
set a numeric inflation goal over the longer run may raise
communication issues, former  European Central Bank Executive
Board (EURR002W)  Member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  wrote in the Financial Times.  Monetary policy  produces its effects with two or three-year
lags, meaning a longer-term inflation objective makes the
inflation forecasts and the policy decision “unclear,” as the
long-run isn’t a “policy-relevant” time frame, Bini Smaghi
wrote in an article posted on the newspaper’s website today.  The publication of the 17 Federal Open Market Committee
members’ expectations of the Fed funds rate over the next few
years may also raise “several questions,” he said. The market
needs to know what forecasting model is used by FOMC members to
update their  interest-rate  expectations, as they are conditional
on the state of the  U.S. economy , he wrote.  “The suspicion may arise that the interest rate forecasts
are ultimately dictated by the members’ short-term policy
preferences, rather than by their ability to predict prices over
the long-term,” Bini Smaghi said.  The concept of a conditional interest-rate forecast may
also not be understood by the public and politicians, which may
lead to misunderstandings, the Italian economist wrote.  “To be effective, central bank communication needs to be
well understood not only by sophisticated market participants
but also by the public,” Bini Smaghi said. “As they are
currently designed, the new tools might turn out to be too
complex, and risk creating confusion, for both groups.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
