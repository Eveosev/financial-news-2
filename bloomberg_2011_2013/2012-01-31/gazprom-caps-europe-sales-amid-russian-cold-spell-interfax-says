OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural gas
export monopoly, is limiting exports of the fuel to  Europe  as
unusually cold weather increases domestic demand, Interfax
reported, citing an unidentified person in the industry.  The company didn’t meet 8 percent of today’s requested
volume from  Italy , the Moscow-based news service reported,
citing the person. Volumes delivered through the Yamal-Europe
pipeline were about 10 percent lower today compared with the
level in recent days, according to Interfax.  Sergei Kupriyanov , a spokesman for Gazprom, declined to
comment when reached on his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
