U.S. gasoline demand rose 0.4
percent in the seven days ending Jan. 27, the third consecutive
week-over-week increase,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said.  Drivers bought 8.51 million barrels a day of gasoline, up
from 8.48 million the prior week, according to MasterCard’s
SpendingPulse report.  Fuel demand fell below year-earlier levels for the 22nd
consecutive time last week, declining 5.5 percent from 2011.  “With the average price for a gallon of gasoline for the
month of January the highest January price in SpendingPulse
history, gasoline demand continues to post increasingly severe
year-over-year declines,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and
director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the
report.  Gasoline use over the previous four weeks was 4.6 percent
below the 2011 period, the 45th consecutive decline in that
measure. MasterCard’s data goes back to July 2004.  The average pump price was unchanged a second week at $3.39
a gallon. Prices were 9.4 percent higher than a year earlier.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
