BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest
asset manager, says the  Federal Reserve  will refrain from
conducting a third round of debt purchases as the economy grows.  The outlook contrasts with that of  Bill Gross , who runs the
world’s largest bond  fund  at Pacific Investment Management Co.
and says the Fed may buy several more times. The central bank
has purchased $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of
quantitative easing known as QE1 and QE2 as it seeks to support
the world’s biggest economy. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Jan.
25 that he’s considering another program of purchases.  “QE3 will be seen only if the U.S. economy flags,”  Bob
Doll , chief equity strategist at BlackRock, which oversees $3.51
trillion, said today on Bloomberg Television’s “First Up” with
Susan Li. “ Ben Bernanke  will use it if we have a rainy day and
only then,” said Doll, who is based in Princeton, New Jersey.  Gross wrote that a third, fourth and fifth round of easing
“lie ahead,” in a Twitter post last week.  Increasing strength in the U.S. economy is damping the need
for further debt purchases, with the pace of expansion
accelerating in the fourth quarter to 2.8 percent, the fastest
since the three-month period ended June 2010, from 1.8 percent
the previous quarter. The growth still isn’t strong enough to
push down an  unemployment rate  that has been at 8.5 percent or
higher for 34 months.  “As long as the  U.S. economy ’s growing 2 1/2, 3 percent
and unemployment in the U.S. is falling, that’s not an
emergency,” Doll said. “QE is saved for emergencies.”  Policy Extended  The Fed also said last week that it plans to keep its
benchmark interest rate near zero until at least the end of
2014.  Treasuries rallied following the announcements, with the
five-year yield falling to a record 0.7157 percent yesterday.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.86 percent today as of 6:31 a.m. in
London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security maturing in November 2021 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 1/4.  The rate slid to 1.81 percent yesterday, approaching the
record low of 1.67 percent set Sept. 23.  Gross, who runs the $244 billion  Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX)  in
 Newport Beach , California, said in an interview Jan. 6 that the
strengthening U.S. employment market still faces a “tough
slog.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
