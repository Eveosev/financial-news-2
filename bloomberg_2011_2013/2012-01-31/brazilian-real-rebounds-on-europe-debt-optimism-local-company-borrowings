Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts climbed for the first time in more than a week
after a report showing industrial production rose at the fastest
pace in seven months spurred speculation policy makers will
shorten a cycle of borrowing-cost cuts.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.53 percent. The
real rose 0.1 percent to 1.7468 per  U.S. dollar .  Traders pared bets on deeper interest-rate reductions after
industrial output increased 0.9 percent in December, up from a
revised 0.2 percent rise in November. Analysts predicted a
December increase of 1 percent, according to the median forecast
of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The December number was
the biggest jump since May 2011, when output rose 1.2 percent.  “The industrial output numbers show a trend of
recuperation that supports the view for a shorter rate-cut
cycle,” Mauricio Nakahodo, senior economist at CM Capital
Markets in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview. “That’s
influencing the DIs, on top of a more optimistic international
environment.”  Production in December fell 1.2 percent from a year ago,
the national statistics agency said in  Rio de Janeiro  today.  Brazil  posted a budget deficit of 18.6 billion reais ($10.6
billion) in December, the central bank said in a report
distributed today in Brasilia.  The currency has appreciated 6.9 percent this month, the
best performance since October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
