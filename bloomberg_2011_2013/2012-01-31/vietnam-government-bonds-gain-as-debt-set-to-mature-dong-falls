Vietnam ’s government bonds gained on
speculation investors will reinvest funds from maturing debt and
push prices higher. The dong dropped.  “About 17 trillion dong ($809 million) of bonds will
mature next month, adding funds to banks that hold the notes,”
said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research at Ho Chi
Minh City Securities Corp. “Bond yields will move down on
expectations of lower  interest rates  at banks.”  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes declined two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.40 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
dropped 15 basis points this month.  Vietnam’s central bank expects interest rates at lenders to
be reduced given month-on-month inflation has slowed every month
since August 2011, according to a statement on the government’s
website late yesterday, citing  State Bank  of Vietnam Governor
Nguyen Van Binh.  The dong fell 0.6 percent to 21,018 per dollar as of 4 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg,
after rising by the same magnitude yesterday as markets reopened
following the weeklong Lunar New Year. The currency climbed 0.1
percent this month.  The State Bank of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side
of that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact reporter on this story:
