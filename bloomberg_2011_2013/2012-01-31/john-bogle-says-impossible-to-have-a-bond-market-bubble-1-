John Bogle , the founder of mutual
fund company Vanguard Group Inc. who popularized index
investing, said it’s impossible to have a bond market bubble
because investors can expect to receive their money back when
the bond matures.  Buyers of Treasuries at the current low  interest rates 
merely agree to a smaller return for the duration of the bond,
Bogle said today at the John C. Bogle Legacy Forum hosted by
Bloomberg Link. Bogle said his comments didn’t refer to Europe,
where some sovereign issuers are probably unable to meet their
interest payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
