United Arab Emirates , the largest
market for U.S. beef in the  Middle East , will allow imports of
from cattle over 30 months of age, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  “This progress was the result of close cooperation between
officials of both countries,” Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the
USDA, said today in an e-mail to Bloomberg News. “Currently, we
are working with Emirate authorities to finalize the export
documentation requirements.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
