The Czech  Finance Ministry  cut its
2012 economic-growth forecast to 0.2 percent from a previously
estimated 1 percent.  The outlook for 2013 gross domestic product was reduced to
1.6 percent from 2 percent, the Prague-based ministry said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The Finance Ministry expects the public-finance deficit,
the fiscal yardstick for assessing a European Union member’s
readiness to adopt the euro, would account for as much as 3.8
percent of GDP this year if “measures” are not taken, compared
with the target of 3.5 percent of GDP as set in the budget law.  Government-sector debt in 2012 will probably rise to 43.1
percent of GDP from an estimated 40.7 percent last year, the
ministry said.  The economy will expand 2.7 percent and 3.6 percent in 2014
and 2015, respectively, according to the forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
