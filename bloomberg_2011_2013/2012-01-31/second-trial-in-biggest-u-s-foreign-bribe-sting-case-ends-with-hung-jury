The second trial in the biggest U.S.
prosecution of individuals accused of foreign bribery ended with
acquittals of two defendants and a mistrial for three security
industry executives.  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in  Washington  yesterday
declared a mistrial after jurors said they couldn’t agree on
charges alleging the three remaining defendants planned to make
payments to a federal agent posing as a representative of the
west African country of Gabon.  The ruling came one day after the same jury acquitted two
others in the case, including a former deputy assistant director
of the U.S. Secret Service.  The three remaining defendants in the trial were John
Mushriqui and his sister, Jeana Mushriqui, and Marc Morales.
Each was charged with two to three counts of violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which has a maximum penalty of
five years in prison. They pleaded not guilty.  Laura Sweeney , a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the ruling or whether prosecutors plan to retry
Morales and the Mushriquis.  Lawyers for the three defendants didn’t immediately return
e-mail messages yesterday seeking comment on the case.  The trial, which opened Sept. 28, was the second in a 22-
defendant kickback conspiracy case stemming from a fake
$15 million weapons deal. A trial of four others arrested in the
sting ended in a mistrial in July after a jury failed to agree
on a verdict.  The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
