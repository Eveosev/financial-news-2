Cooley LLP (1160L)  hired Danish Hamid, a
partner at  Winston & Strawn LLP , as the Washington-based firm of
more than 650 lawyers expands its global reach.  Hamid, 36, who was in Winston’s Washington office, has
experience in international business transactions and compliance
matters, Cooley said in a statement. He will join Cooley as a
partner and will advise clients on U.S. domestic and cross-
border matters.  “His arrival could not be more timely as Cooley increases
its international focus to address our clients’ increasing
global business needs,” Chief Executive Officer Joe Conroy said
in the statement.  Cooley, which operates nine offices across the U.S., opened
one in  Shanghai  in December 2011. The firm was  ranked  the 57th-
highest-grossing  law firm  in 2010 by the American Lawyer, a
trade magazine, with more than $517 million in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
