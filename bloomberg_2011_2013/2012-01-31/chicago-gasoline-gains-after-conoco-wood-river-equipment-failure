Chicago gasoline strengthened after
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  reported a compressor failure at the Wood River
refinery in Illinois.  The plant began flaring sulfur dioxide as a result of the
malfunction Jan. 26, according to a filing with the Illinois
Emergency Management Institute. The company said in the filing
that the unit will be repaired.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 3 cents to 19 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel has increased
five consecutive days. Prompt delivery rose 4.35 cents to
$2.6962 a gallon.  Regular gasoline in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3, strengthened
1.75 cents to a discount of 18 cents a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  held at a discount to
futures of 1.8 cents a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  has postponed maintenance for February
at its Houston refinery,  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail. The turnaround will be rescheduled, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
