Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  and six
other Japanese nuclear operators reported losses of 463.89
billion yen ($6 billion) in the first ninth months of the
current financial year, highlighting the cost of thermal
generation to replace atomic plants idled after the Fukushima
disaster.  Kansai Electric Power Co. today reported a loss of 118
billion yen for the nine months to Dec. 31, compared with a 108
billion yen profit a year earlier.  Chubu Electric Power Co. (9502)  had
a loss of 71 billion yen for the same period, the company also
said today.  Kansai Electric, the main power supplier to  Japan ’s second-
largest industrial area, and other regional electricity
suppliers are paying higher fuel bills as their reactors were
shut for checks following the meltdowns and radiation leaks at
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. All
but three of the country’s 54 reactors are idled.  Japan’s liquefied natural gas imports rose 12.1 percent to
a record 78.53 million metric tons in 2011 as utilities imported
more of the fuel to generate electricity.  Tokyo Electric hasn’t decided when it will report earnings
for the first nine months, Naoyuki Matsumoto, a spokesman for
the company, said by phone today.  The following table shows the reported losses for April to
December last year among nuclear power operators except Tokyo
Electric and  Shikoku Electric Power Co. (9507) , which reported a
profit, and their forecasts for the full financial year. Figures
are in billions of yen.  COMPANY                  EARNINGS                 FORECAST -----
