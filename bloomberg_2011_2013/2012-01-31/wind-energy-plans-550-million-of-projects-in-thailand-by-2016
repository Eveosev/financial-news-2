Wind Energy Holding Co. , a Bangkok-
based developer, plans to add 270 megawatts of wind-power plants
in  Thailand  costing as much as $550 million as the nation seeks
to boost its clean-energy production.  Wind Energy will develop three projects each with a 90-
megawatt capacity in the Korat province north of Bangkok, said
Aaron Daniels, vice president of business development.  Thailand, hoping to rebound from its worst floods in 70
years last year, is aiming to get 25 percent of its energy from
renewables by 2022 to curb dependence on fuel imports. The
nation, which offers premium payments for wind power, imports
about 80 percent of its oil, according to the Ministry of
Energy.  Wind Energy  is looking for lenders and equity investors in
the projects, Daniels said today by phone from Bangkok. The
company plans to open a bidding process for the turbine supplier
late this quarter or early the next, Daniels said. The projects
should be connected to the grid in 2016, he said.  The company was founded by Nopporn Suppipat and has about
35 employees, Daniels said. Daniels formerly worked at  Vestas
Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the biggest turbine maker, in  North America 
and  China .  ‘First of Kind’  Wind Energy has started work on a separate $400 million
wind farm at a site nearby. The company obtained 12-year loans
from  Kasikornbank Pcl (KBANK)  and  Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB)  accounting
for about 70 percent of the cost, Daniels said.  “They’re a first of a kind project,” he said. “No one
has done utility-scale turbine projects in Thailand before.”  Siemens AG (SIE)  is supplying 90 turbines each with a 2.3-
megawatt capacity for the 207-megawatt project developed in
equal portions called “FKW” and “KR2.” The company expects
FKW to go into commercial operation in October this year and KR2
in February 2013, Daniels said.  Thailand, which grants an incentive for wind power
produced, aims to install 1,200 megawatts of wind by 2021.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
