Serbia ’s economy grew 0.8 percent in
the fourth quarter from a year ago, less than a central bank
forecast, suggesting the Balkan nation is being hurt by a
slowdown in exports and investments.  Economic output accelerated from 0.5 percent in the
previous three-month period, the statistics office said in a
flash estimate today, without providing additional data about
the structure of growth. That missed a National Bank of Serbia
forecast for growth of 1.1 percent made on Jan. 23.  The government and the central bank have estimated the
economy to expand 1.5 percent this year, even as the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development cut its outlook for
Serbia to 1.1 percent from 2.1 percent, as southeastern European
nations are hurt by  Europe ’s debt crisis through declining trade
and investment.  The data paints a  “gloomy picture,” said Ljiljana Grubic, an analyst at Belgrade-based Raiffeisen Bank, in a note
to clients today. The GDP data, along with other new economic
indicators, point to no “encouraging developments in the first
half of 2012.”  Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, who faces re-election by
midyear and trails opposition parties in recent polls, is
battling a surge in unemployment to 23.7 percent in 2011 and the
Jan. 27 decision of  United States Steel Corp. (X)  to sell its plant
in Serbia back to the state for $1.  Indicators released today “point to inertia that started
in May last year,” said Ivan Nikolic, research analyst at the
Belgrade-based Economics Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
