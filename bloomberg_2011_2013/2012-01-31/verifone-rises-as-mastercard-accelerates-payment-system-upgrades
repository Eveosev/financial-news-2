VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) , the largest
maker of credit-card terminals, rose the most since November
after  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said it’s seeking to accelerate upgrades
to merchants’ electronic point-of-sale payment systems.  VeriFone jumped 8.4 percent to $42.70 at the close of New
York trading. Shares of the  San Jose , California-based company
fell 1.5 percent in the 52 weeks through yesterday.  MasterCard said yesterday it has a “comprehensive road
map” for shifting U.S. electronic payments away from systems
that rely on the magnetic stripes on the back of credit and
debit cards to so-called EMV technology, cards embedded with
microchips. VeriFone “stands to benefit the most” as merchants
would have to upgrade five million of the company’s terminals to
meet MasterCard’s new requirements, Tien-tsin Huang, an analyst
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, said in a note to clients.  “This announcement is clearly a positive for the POS
terminal manufacturers, as it gives merchants another reason to
upgrade their terminals,” Huang said.  Ingenico SA (ING) , a Neuilly-sur-Seine, France-based point-of-
sale equipment maker, rose 3.8 percent in Paris trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
