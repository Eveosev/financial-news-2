Coal shipments from  Indonesia , the
world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, rose 12 percent in
2011 from a year earlier to 312 million tons, according to data
released by the nation’s trade ministry.  Shipments of copper ore and concentrate fell 44 percent in
2011 to 1.17 million metric tons from the previous year, the
ministry’s data showed.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. declared force majeure
Oct. 26 on copper shipments from its Grasberg mine in
Indonesia’s Papua, which holds the world’s largest recoverable
reserves of copper, after about 8,000 workers went on strike
Sept. 15, demanding higher wages. The company and the employees
agreed on pay increases Dec. 14, ending a three-month work
stoppage.  The ministry didn’t offer an explanation for export results
nor did it identify buyers. The figures which come from
surveyors’ reports before shipment, are subject to change.  The following table shows exports of coal and metals in
2011 and in the previous year. Metal exports are in the form of
ore and concentrates. Volumes are given in metric tons.
