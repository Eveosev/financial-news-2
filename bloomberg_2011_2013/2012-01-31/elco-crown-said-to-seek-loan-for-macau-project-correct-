between Lawrence Ho and  James Packer .)  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) , the
casino venture between Lawrence Ho and Australian billionaire
James Packer, approached banks seeking a loan to fund the
development of a new project, four people familiar with the
matter said.  Proceeds will be used to fund Melco Crown’s Studio City
project in Macau, the people said, asking not to be identified
as the details are private. The loan may be about $1.25 billion,
two of the people said.  Studio City will be an integrated resort with a “ theme and
demographic focus ” aimed at differentiating it from the
company’s existing portfolio of assets, according to Melco
Crown’s website. Details of the loan including its maturity and
pricing have yet to be set, the people said. The company is
about three to four weeks away from hiring banks, they said.  Melco Crown’s main asset in  Macau  is City of Dreams, a
property which includes a casino, hotels and restaurants. The
company last borrowed from banks in June, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The $1.2 billion facility matures in 2016
and was arranged by Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
Bank of America Corp., Bank of China Ltd., Commerzbank AG and
Deutsche Bank AG, the data show.  Melco Crown met with its existing lenders to discuss the
new facility, one of the people said, declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
