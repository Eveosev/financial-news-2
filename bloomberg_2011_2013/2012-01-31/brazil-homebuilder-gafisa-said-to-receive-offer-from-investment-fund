Gafisa SA (GFSA3) ,  Brazil ’s third-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, received a bid from an investment fund
to buy all of the company’s shares, a person familiar with the
matter said.  The proposed deal will be announced soon, the person said
without identifying the bidder. The person declined to be named
because the talks are private.  Gafisa jumped 6 percent to 4.77 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day advance since Jan. 2,
after earlier rising as much as 9.8 percent. It was the best
performer on the benchmark  Bovespa (IBOV)  index, which gained 0.5
percent.  The shares rose after Relatorio Reservado reported that
Gafisa would be sold to U.S. investors who plan to buy all of
the homebuilder’s outstanding shares, citing an unidentified
employee.  “Earnings have disappointed, so an acquisition could be a
good thing for shareholders, depending on the price offered,”
Erick Hood, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage, said by phone
from Sao Paulo.  An official at an external press relations firm
representing Gafisa, who asked not to be identified in
accordance with company policy, said the homebuilder doesn’t
comment on market rumors.  Gafisa’s consolidated new projects fell 21 percent in 2011
and came at the bottom of its forecasted range of 3.5 billion
reais ($2 billion) to 4 billion reais, according to a regulatory
filing on Jan. 19. Contracted sales dropped 16 percent from a
year before.  To contact the reporters on this story:
