The seeds of a housing recovery are
“being planted” even as residential real-estate prices fell
more than forecast in November, according to  Karl Case , co-
creator of the  S&P/Case-Shiller index  that measures property
values.  “Housing is becoming more affordable” and efforts are
underway to deal with a backlog of foreclosed properties, Case,
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg
Surveillance,” with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene .  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
declined 3.7 percent from November 2010 after decreasing 3.4
percent in the year ended in October, the group said today in
New York. Economists projected a 3.3 percent drop, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “It’s a bit like a sump pump,” said Case, who created the
index with fellow economist  Robert Shiller . “Water starts
climbing up and then you got this back log of order that keeps
things under wrap.”  Shiller, speaking with Keene on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday,” said today buying real estate right now
as an investor doesn’t “strike me as a clever move.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
