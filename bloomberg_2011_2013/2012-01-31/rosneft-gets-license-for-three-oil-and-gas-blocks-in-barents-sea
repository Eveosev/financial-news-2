OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, received a license to explore and develop three
offshore oil and natural-gas blocks in the  Barents Sea .  The fields have combined potential resources of as much as
3.3 billion metric tons, or 24.2 billion barrels, of crude and
gas condensate and 2.8 trillion cubic meters of gas, the company
said today in a  statement  on its website.  The blocks are located in the western section of the
Barents Sea in an area bordering Norway’s economic zone,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
