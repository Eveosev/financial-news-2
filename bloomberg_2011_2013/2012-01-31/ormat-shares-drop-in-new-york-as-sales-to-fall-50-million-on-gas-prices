Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a U.S.
developer of geothermal energy, dropped the most in more than
five months after saying that revenue will decline by almost $25
million in 2012 and 2013.  Ormat  slumped  7.3 percent to $16.25 at the close in  New
York , the most since Aug. 8. Revenue for this year will decline
by an estimated $24.8 million after forecasted natural-gas
prices used in several power-purchase agreements were cut, the
Reno, Nevada-based company said in a statement yesterday.
Revenue next year is estimated to fall by $24.9 million.  The 2012 cut “represents approximately 5.9 percent of the
company’s forecasted 2011 total revenues,” the company said in
the statement. Ormat expected sales of $415 million to $425
million for the year, according to a statement in November.  The company will provide guidance for 2012 when it issues
its 2011 fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for Feb. 22.  Ormat’s contracts for its Heber 1 and 2, Ormesa and Mammoth
power plants in  California  were affected by a decrease in gas-
price forecasts and the delay of the state’s greenhouse-gas cap-
and-trade program, which is now expected to begin in 2013,
according to the statement.  Ormat is a unit of Yavne, Israel-based  Ormat Industries (ORMT) 
Ltd., which fell 4 percent to close at 17.25 shekels in  Tel Aviv 
today, its lowest price since October 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
