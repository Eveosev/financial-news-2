Iran ’s judiciary said it will put on
trial about 30 people it accuses of being involved in a $2.6
billion banking fraud, the biggest in the country’s history, the
state-run  Press TV  news channel reported.  Twenty-four people have been indicted and there will be
more indictments this week, Prosecutor-General Golamhossein
Mohseni-Ejei said yesterday, according to Press TV; the channel
added that the first session of the trial may take place as
early as mid-February.  The former managing director of Iran’s Bank Melli, one of
the suspects in the case, has left Iran and now lives in  Canada ,
the report said.  Seven state and private banks are alleged to be connected
with the fraud, which involved forging letters of credit from
the partly state-owned Bank Saderat to secure loans for buying
state-owned companies, Iranian media have reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
