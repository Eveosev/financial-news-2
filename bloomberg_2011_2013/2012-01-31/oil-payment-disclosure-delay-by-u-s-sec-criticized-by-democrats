The Securities and Exchange
Commission was criticized by Senate Democrats for delaying a
rule requiring energy companies to disclose what they pay to
foreign governments for access to oil.  Oil companies including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , based in The
Hague, are lobbying to limit what they must reveal, asking for
exemptions for nations whose laws demand secrecy. Shareholders
including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and
billionaire George Soros support the planned rule, saying it
would help reduce the risk of fraud, bribery, nepotism and
mismanagement.  The SEC rule, part of the the Dodd-Frank Act overhauling
financial regulation, was due in April 2011. Democratic Senators
Benjamin Cardin of Maryland,  Charles Schumer  of New York,  John
Kerry  of Massachusetts, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Carl Levin
of Michigan sent a letter today complaining of the delay.  “We urge the SEC to resist pressure to release a weak
rule,” the senators said. “The final rule should apply to all
countries and companies with no exemptions.”  -- Editors: Daniel Enoch, Steve Geimann  To contact the reporter on this story:
