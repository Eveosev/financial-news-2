President  Barack Obama  entered his
re-election year with more money to spend than he had four years
ago when he defeated  Hillary Clinton  to win the Democratic
nomination.  Obama reported a bank account balance of $81.8 million as
of Dec. 31 as he took in $128 million last year for his re-
election campaign, including $40 million from October to
December.  The figures include transfers from a joint fundraising
effort with the  Democratic National Committee . Four years ago,
he had raised $104 million through Dec. 31 and had $18.6 million
in the bank.  Obama has maintained a strong base of small donors; $58.5
million, or 46 percent, came in through contributions of $200 or
less. He had 1.3 million donors last year, the campaign said.  Obama also reported that the number of fundraisers bringing
in at least $50,000 increased to 445, from 351 at the end of
September. He named 61 bundlers, supporters who tap their own
networks to help generate donations to the campaign, who raised
more than $500,000, up from 41 in September. Obama is the only
presidential candidate to publicly identify backers who are
bundling donations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
