Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said
it is rationing  mortgage insurance  for lenders as the country’s
housing agency approaches the legal limit of its ability to
backstop the loans.  “CMHC has recently received an unexpected level of
requests for large amounts of CMHC portfolio insurance,”
Charles Sauriol, a spokesman for the Ottawa-based agency, said
in an e-mailed statement. “To ensure equitable access to
portfolio insurance within CMHC’s annual limits, an allocation
process is being established which has caused some delays.”  The agency said that lenders have increased their demand
for insurance of their mortgages amid “liquidity needs” since
the 2007 financial crisis.  “This does not affect the availability of CMHC’s mortgage
loan insurance for qualified home buyers and will not impact the
cost of buying a house,” Sauriol said in the statement.  Portfolio insurance allows lenders to insure mortgages that
aren’t already backstopped by the housing agency. Under Canadian
law, homebuyers who put down less than 20 percent of the cost
must insure the mortgage. Banks also buy insurance for other
home loans before securitizing them.  CMHC said it had C$541 billion ($539 billion) of insurance
in force as of Sept. 30. The organization’s legislated limit is
C$600 billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
