Hong Kong  stocks rose, pushing the
Hang Seng Index to its biggest monthly gain since October, after
Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said progress had been made
in talks with the country’s creditors, easing concern  Europe 
won’t be able to manage its debt crisis.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an operator of retail chains and
ports that gets more than half its sales in Europe, rose 1.7
percent. Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. led developers higher
before the announcement of a city budget tomorrow expected to
include property-rate waivers.  China  Mobile Ltd. and China
Telecom Corp. rose on speculation they will become distributors
of Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  “We’ve seen some positive signs in Europe,” said  Angus
Gluskie , who oversees about $350 million as managing director at
White Funds Management in Sydney. “We’re on a cusp of a Greek
bond restructuring. They will agree on it but there will be some
debate in the meantime.”  The Hang Seng Index gained 1.1 percent to 20,390.49 at the
close in Hong Kong. The gauge has gained 11 percent this month
amid speculation China will ease lending curbs and on signs the
 U.S. economy  is weathering Europe’s crisis. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in the city rose
1.4 percent to 11,299.05 today.  Greek Prime Minister Papademos, speaking in Brussels after
a European summit, said he was “strongly committed” to
reaching an agreement with bondholders by the end of the week. A
deal is crucial to lowering the Greece’s debt burden and freeing
up another round of international aid before the country faces a
14.5 billion-euro ($19.1 billion) bond payment on March 20.  Cosco, Hutchison  Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.7 percent to HK$73.75. Foxconn
International Holdings Ltd., a contract maker of mobile
telephones, advanced 4.9 percent to HK$5.34.  Hong Kong stocks also rose after the  Securities Times 
reported China may announce methods for local pensions to invest
in the stock market as soon as the first quarter. As much as 30
percent of pension assets, or about 580 billion yuan ($92
billion), may be allowed for stock investment, the newspaper
said, citing a person it didn’t identify.  China Mobile (941)  climbed 2.3 percent to HK$79.30. China Telecom
added 3.6 percent to HK$4.36. Apple may add the carriers as
iPhone distributors, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in
a note to clients.  Tomorrow’s Budget  Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang may hand out as
much as HK$40 billion ($5.2 billion) in his last budget tomorrow,
from tax rebates to property-rate waivers, as an economic
slowdown starts to bite, according to estimates by KPMG Tax Ltd.
Small and medium-sized businesses will get one-time tax rebates,
Sing Tao Daily reported today, without citing anyone.  Property companies advanced. Cheung Kong rose 2.5 percent
to HK$104.40. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the world’s biggest
developer by market value, increased 0.2 percent to HK$107.40.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  tumbled 20 percent last year amid
concern China would continue to curb lending and Europe would
fail to resolve its debt crisis.  Futures on the gauge advanced 0.5 percent to 20,357 today.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  dropped 4.4 percent to 23.62 today,
indicating traders expect a swing of 6.8 percent on the
benchmark over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
