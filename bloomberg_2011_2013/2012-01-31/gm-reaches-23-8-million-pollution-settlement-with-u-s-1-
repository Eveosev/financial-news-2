General Motors Corp. (GM)  agreed to pay
as much as $23.8 million to settle liability for environmental
cleanup costs in New Jersey, Maryland and Missouri, the U.S.
said.  The agreement resolves Detroit-based GM’s pre-bankruptcy
liability for U.S. claims filed under the federal Superfund
statute, according to a statement today by the office of U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. Under the settlement, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will receive allowed claims
of $20.9 million in GM’s bankruptcy proceeding, plus $2.89
million of cleanup work at the sites.  GM, which filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, sold assets to
a new company that went public as General Motors Co. The allowed
bankruptcy claim will be paid in stock and warrants of “New
GM.” The cash value of the allowed claim probably will be less
than $20.9 million, the U.S. said.  The three polluted sites covered by the agreement include
the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which comprises parts of the
Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, Newark Bay, the Arthur Kill and
the Kill Van Kull in  New Jersey . Also covered are the Kane &
Lombard Superfund Site in Baltimore County, Maryland, and the
Hayford Bridge Superfund Site in St. Charles, Missouri.  The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
