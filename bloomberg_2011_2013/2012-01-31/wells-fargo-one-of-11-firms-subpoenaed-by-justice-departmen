Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
mortgage lender, was among at least 11 firms to receive a
subpoena from the  Justice Department  as President Barack Obama
formed a unit to investigate wrongdoing in the housing market.  Tom Goyda, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based lender,
confirmed the bank’s receipt of the subpoena and declined to
comment further. Wells Fargo is the second-largest U.S. mortgage
servicer, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry
publication.  Obama announced last week that the new unit will
investigate misconduct in the bundling of mortgage loans into
securities. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Jan. 27
that the Justice Department had subpoenaed 11 financial
institutions in related investigations.  The unit will “streamline” and “strengthen” current
efforts to investigate fraud in residential mortgage-backed
securities, Holder said at a news conference in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
