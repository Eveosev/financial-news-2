Record industrial demand for silver
and resurging investor interest is diminishing a supply surplus,
driving the metal used in everything from solar panels to
batteries into its best start to a year in almost three decades.  Manufacturers will use 15,415 metric tons, 2.5 percent more
than in 2011 and reducing the glut by 41 percent to 3,297 tons,
 Barclays Capital  estimates. Investors may buy 2,000 tons through
exchange-traded products, after selling 1,300 tons last year,
Morgan Stanley predicts. Prices will average $37.50 an ounce in
the fourth quarter, 13 percent more than now, the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts shows.  The metal rallied 22 percent since closing at an 11-month
low in December, entering a  bull market  on mounting confidence
that another global  recession  will be avoided even as the  World
Bank  and  International Monetary Fund  cut their growth forecasts.
Prices had plunged 44 percent in eight months, making it the
most volatile of any metal tracked by Bloomberg, as expansion
slowed from  Europe  to  China , crimping demand for commodities.  “Silver got hammered and now we’re into a phase where it
will do quite well,” said  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc in London, and the second-most accurate price
forecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings in the past eight
quarters. “Appeal comes from its widespread use in both
industry and investment. I think it’s relatively cheap.”  Standard & Poor’s  The commodity advanced 19 percent since Dec. 31 to $33.15,
the best start to a year since 1983. The  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI
Total Return Index of 24 commodities rose 2.3 percent and the
 MSCI (MXWD)  All-Country World Index of equities 5.6 percent. Treasuries
returned 0.3 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  This year’s anticipated gains in silver will mean record
profit for  Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. (CDE)  and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Economies may still pose the biggest threat to the rally.
The IMF cut its 2012 forecast on Jan. 24 to 3.3 percent from 4
percent and warned that Europe’s debt crisis threatened to
derail the world economy. The World Bank reduced its estimate by
the most in three years on Jan. 18, to 2.5 percent from 3.6
percent. Global industrial production will expand 2.3 percent,
from 4.9 percent in 2011, Macquarie Group Ltd. predicts.  The 0.5 percent contraction in the 17-nation euro region
seen by the IMF may curb demand for imported goods. Chinese
exports rose 13.4 percent in December from a year earlier, the
slowest pace since February, according to customs data. The
nation imported 235 tons of silver in December, 36 percent less
than the average over the past two years, the data show.  Industrial Demand  “In the face of weak industrial demand, the short-term
investment argument is not entirely convincing,” said David
Jollie, an analyst at Mitsui & Co. Precious Metals Inc. in
 London  and the most accurate forecaster in the London Bullion
Market Association’s 2011 price survey. “It’s much more
difficult to get people to invest for the long term in times of
economic uncertainty.”  For now,  speculators  are getting more bullish.  Hedge funds 
and other money managers more than doubled wagers on higher
prices this year, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. They held 16,034 futures and options in the week ended
Jan. 24, the most since mid-September. The most widely held
option gives the owners the right to buy silver at $40 by June,
data from the Comex in  New York  show. The three biggest holdings
are all  call options  at 21 percent or more above prices today.  Investors added 196 tons to their ETP holdings this month,
taking the total to 17,492 tons valued at $18.64 billion, within
7 percent of the record reached in April, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They also bought 6.082 million ounces
(189 tons) of American Eagle silver coins, the most in a year,
data on the U.S. Mint’s website shows.  Kodachrome Film  Those sales are whittling away the supply glut as
industrial consumption strengthens. Global solar-panel
installations increased capacity by 70 percent last year,
creating enough generating power to supply about 20 million
homes, according to the European Photovoltaic Industry
Association. The metal is also used in electrical conductors,
wood preservatives and alloys, compensating for a slump in
photographic film demand.  Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) , based in Rochester, New York, said in
2009 it would stop making Kodachrome film after more than seven
decades and on Jan. 19 filed for bankruptcy. Demand for silver
from photographic-film makers slid at least 66 percent in the
past decade, the Washington-based Silver Institute estimates.  Gold Ratio  Silver may still be cheap relative to gold, with a price
ratio of 52.2, down from 57.4 in December. It averaged 32.4 in
1980, when silver reached a record $50.35 in New York trading.
Nelson and William Hunt of  Dallas  were convicted eight years
later of conspiracy for attempting to manipulate prices and were
ordered to pay $130 million.  In inflation-adjusted terms, that peak would be equal to
$138.31 as of last year, according to a calculator from the
Federal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis .  Crystalline silicon solar panels use as much as 0.12 grams
of silver per watt, and as much as 40 grams go into a 32-inch
plasma television, according to VM Group, a London-based
research company. Electronic-equipment manufacturing will expand
5 percent this year, according to  Los Altos , California-based
researcher Henderson Ventures in a December report.  Coeur d’Alene , which gets about 69 percent of its revenue
from silver, will report profit of $241.50 million this year,
compared with an estimated $120.25 million in 2011, according to
the mean of four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Shares of the Idaho-based company gained 16 percent since the
start of January.  Most Accurate Forecaster  Fresnillo will report net income of $988.7 million this
year, compared with an estimated $945 million in 2011, the mean
of six estimates shows. Shares of the Mexico City-based company
jumped 14 percent in London this year.  “Silver is a hybrid,” said  Bart Melek , the head of
commodity strategy at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto and the most
accurate forecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings in the past
eight quarters. “It benefits from being precious. Later on in
the year we’re going to see a bit of a recovery in industrial
demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
