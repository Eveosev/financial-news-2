German  retail sales  unexpectedly
declined in December as consumers’ Christmas-shopping frenzy was
damped by uncertainty about the economic outlook.  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, declined
1.4 percent from November, when they fell 1 percent, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a
gain of 0.8 percent, the median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey  showed.  Sales (GRFRINYY)  fell 0.9 percent from a year ago. The
statistics office said retail sales were 0.9 percent higher in
2011 than in 2010.  Metro AG (MEO) ,  Germany ’s largest retailer, said on Jan. 17
fourth-quarter revenue fell 1.3 percent amid a “disappointing”
Christmas season. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said last
week the German economy,  Europe ’s largest should return to
robust growth this year after a “temporary weak phase.”  “The economy should pick up in the second quarter,” said
Gerd Hassel, an economist at BHF Bank AG in  Frankfurt , who
forecasts a 0.5 percent expansion in 2012. “Private consumption
will continue to boost growth this year, albeit at weaker pace
than in 2011 because increases in employment and wages will be
more moderate.”  The decline in German unemployment to its lowest since 1992
may slow as companies struggle to find workers for 1 million
open jobs amid a shrinking population, Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview on Jan. 25.  Germany’s statistics office said on Jan. 11 the economy
probably shrank “roughly” 0.25 percent in the final three
months of last year. While growth slowed to 3 percent in 2011
from 3.7 percent in 2010, the contribution of private
consumption doubled, adding 0.9 percent to gross domestic
product last year, up from 0.4 percent.  Consumer confidence  will rise for a fifth month in February
as unemployment holds at a two-decade low, boosting the economic
outlook and households’ willingness to spend,  GfK SE (GFK)  said on
Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
