What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade
and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that cold
weather in parts of  Europe ,  Russia  and Ukraine and dry weather
in the southern U.S. Great Plains may reduce yields, Greg Grow,
the director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that export demand will rebound
following the 1.6 percent price decline yesterday, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that demand will climb after the
price fell yesterday by the most in four months, Grow said.
 Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a
pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open $1.50 to $2.50
higher per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
