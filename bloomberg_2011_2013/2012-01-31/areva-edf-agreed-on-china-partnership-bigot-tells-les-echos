Areva SA (AREVA)  and Electricite de  France 
SA have reached an agreement on working with the Chinese on a
mid-range nuclear facility, Bernard Bigot, Areva’s vice-chairman
of the supervisory board, told  Les Echos  in an interview.  The formal accord must still be signed and then the
companies and their Chinese partner will have six months to
agree on a basic design and decide whether to continue, said
Bigot, who’s also chairman of the French atomic energy
commission.  He was interviewed ahead of today’s publication of a study
on the costs of nuclear energy in France by the country’s state
auditor the Cour des Comptes.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
