Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d.,
Slovenia’s biggest drinks company, said it expects net income to
climb to 49 million euros ($65 million) in 2012.  Revenue at the Lasko-based company is forecast at 292
million euros in 2012, down 10 percent from an estimated 323

377 million euros in 2011 to 187 million euros by the end of the
year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
