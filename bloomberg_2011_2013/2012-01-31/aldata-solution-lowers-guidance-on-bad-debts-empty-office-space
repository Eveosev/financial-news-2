Aldata Solution Oyj (ALD1V) , the Finnish
developer of software for the retail industry, cut its full-year
guidance on “bad” debts.  Aldata sees a “significant” operating loss for 2011 due
to costs incurred on provisions for “bad and doubtful debts”
and empty  office space , the Vantaa, Finland-based company said
today in a statement. It had previously forecast a loss for the
full year.  Aldata climbed 16 percent last year as  Palo Alto ,
California-based Symphony Technology Group LLC, offered to
purchase all issued and outstanding shares. Symphony now holds
90 percent of Aldata shares, according to the Finnish company’s
website.  The costs come on top of expenses announced earlier. Net
sales will fall “somewhat” from last year, Aldata said. The
company will publish earnings on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
