Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla’s approval rating fell to an all-time low over her
proposed tax increases aimed at trimming budget deficits, a poll
published today showed.  Only 23 percent of Costa Ricans approve of Chinchilla’s
performance, according to a Jan. 4-10 poll of 1,200 people aged
18 to 79 conducted by regional public opinion and market
research firm Unimer in a quarterly survey. The president’s
approval rating was 29 percent in the September survey  The poll found 75 percent disapprove of the proposed reform
that would replace the current national 13 percent sales tax
with a 14 percent value-added tax. The poll showed 13 percent
approved of the package while 12 percent had no opinion. The
Legislative Assembly is reviewing the proposal.  “It is evident that the fiscal reform plan is harming
Chinchilla’s popularity,” said Catalina García, vice president
of Unimer, in a phone interview from San José. “It is perceived
that she is not doing a good job managing the funds of the
state.”  Since taking office as the country’s first female president
in May 2010, Chinchilla’s popularity has steadily declined. She
won the February 2010 election with 47 percent of the vote.  The Unimer poll has a margin of error of 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
