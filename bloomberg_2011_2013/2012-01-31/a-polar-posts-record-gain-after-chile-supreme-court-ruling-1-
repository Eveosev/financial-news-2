Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , seeking to
avert its second bankruptcy in 13 years, rose by a record after
a Chilean court cleared the department-store chain to
restructure overdue client debt.  La Polar surged 26 percent, the biggest gain since the
shares started trading in 2003, to 218.4 pesos at the close in
Santiago, recovering ground lost in the previous seven days.  The  Supreme Court  rejected an appeal by consumer protection
agency Sernac to prevent La Polar from negotiating new credit
terms with all clients that the company had previously modified
unilaterally in a $1 billion fraud case. Shares tumbled earlier
this month after La Polar said it may have to set aside an
additional $34.5 million in provisions because of a lower court
suspension of all client debt restructuring. That ban was
subsequently limited to 1,000 clients involved in a class action
lawsuit against the company.  “We are unaware of special circumstances that would
explain the variation other that those opportunely informed by
the company to the respective authorities and the market in
general,” La Polar said in a written response to a Santiago
stock exchange query on today’s share price surge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
