Erste Group Bank (EBS)  AG’s Hungarian unit
“unambiguously rejected” a call from the Hungarian city of
Hodmezovasarhely to share losses on the town’s foreign-currency
debt, Mayor Janos Lazar said.  The bank offered to change the repayment terms of the
city’s Swiss-franc denominated bonds only if it repays 10
billion forint ($45 million) of debt in one sum, according to an
e-mailed statement from Lazar, who is also the head of the
ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group.  “Erste Bank’s ultimatum is unrealistic and unfeasible,”
Lazar said today.  The politician asked Erste on Dec. 29 to share losses on
bonds worth 69.4 million Swiss francs ($74 million), issued in
2006 at an exchange rate of 173.4 forint per franc. The current
 exchange rate  is above 243.55 forint per franc.  The municipality, which is servicing its debt, will make a
decision on future proceedings on Feb. 2, according to the
statement.  Erste doesn’t wish to comment on the content of the letter
as that includes business and banking secrets, spokeswoman Emese
Danks said over the phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
