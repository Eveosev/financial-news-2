MannKind Corp., (MNKD)  a biotechnology
company with a diabetes drug in late-stage testing, fell the
most in almost a year after saying it will sell more shares to
raise money.  MannKind dropped 15 percent to $2.70 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since Feb. 11, 2011. The company will
offer $50 million worth of units that consist of one share of
MannKind and a warrant to purchase 0.6 percent of a second
share, the Valencia, California-based drugmaker said today in a
statement. Also planned are as much as $161 million of 7-year
convertible notes to repay or repurchase debt, MannKind said in
a regulatory filing.  “It’s diluted financing,” said  Joshua Schimmer , an
analyst with Leerink Swann in  New York . “They had a $370
million proposed debt offering in September of last year, and
instead of updating us on that, they’re doing an equity offering
which suggests that they weren’t making enough progress.”  MannKind’s lead drug candidate, Afrezza, needs to complete
the last phase of clinical trials, file for U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval and then be introduced in the market,
Schimmer said. Unless MannKind can find a commercial partner, it
would have to fund product’s introduction, he said.  MannKind shares have fallen 43 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
