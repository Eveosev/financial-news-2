Boston Properties Inc. (BXP) , the biggest
U.S. office real estate investment trust, said fourth-quarter
funds from operations almost doubled as costs associated with
restructuring debt a year earlier went unrepeated.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, was $179.3 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $89.9
million, or 64 cents, a year earlier, the Boston-based company
said today in a statement. It was expected to have FFO of $1.19
a share, the average estimate of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg
 survey . Debt redemptions in the fourth quarter of 2010 cost the
company about $81.7 million in early payment charges.  Boston  Properties depends largely on rents from its office
buildings in  New York (CWRR1NDT)  and the  Washington , Boston and  San
Francisco  metropolitan areas. Chairman  Mort Zuckerman  has said
such high-end properties as the company’s General Motors
Building in  Manhattan  and John Hancock Tower in Boston perform
better than other buildings in a slow economy.  Zuckerman’s faith in trophy towers is being tested in New
York, where job cuts by financial firms may temper office
demand, and on the West Coast, where technology company leases
signed a decade ago are expiring, according to  Alex Goldfarb , an
analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP.  “The question for Boston Properties is what progress
they’re making on getting tenants to sign up” for those
buildings, Goldfarb, who has a “buy”  rating  on the REIT, said
in an interview before the earnings report. “Those are brand-
new buildings, so you need brand-new-building-type rents.”  New Manhattan Tower  In  New York , Boston Properties is marketing space at 510
Madison Ave., an office building it purchased in 2010, and 250
West 55th St., a tower under construction near Eighth Avenue.  Fourth-quarter  revenue  rose 15 percent to $452.8 million,
of which $432.4 million was from rents, the company said.  Boston Properties raised the lower end of its 2012 FFO
forecast to $4.65 a share, from $4.58 in October. The high end
remained $4.78. The company also projected first-quarter FFO of
$1.12 to $1.14, lower than the average estimate of $1.15 from 15
analysts surveyed.  Occupancies at the company’s 39.6 million square feet of
in-service properties fell to 91.3 percent from 93.2 percent a
year earlier. An increase in New York, where the company earns
more than a third of its net operating income, to 97.8 percent
from 96.9 percent didn’t offset declines in Boston, San
Francisco and Washington.  Fourth-quarter results were announced after the close of
regular U.S. trading. Boston Properties rose 1.5 percent to
$104.05 today in New York. The shares gained 16 percent in 2011,
the best performance in the 17-member  Bloomberg REIT Office
Property Index (BBREOFPY) , which declined 3.9 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
