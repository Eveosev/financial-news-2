The governors of three Greek
prisons, among them the high-security Korydallos jail in
southwest  Athens , are refusing to take more inmates as
overcrowding is at dangerous levels,  Kathimerini  reported.  Cramped conditions at the three jails, which also include
Tripoli in southern  Greece  and Halkida in the north, pose a
health and security risk and mean even temporary prisoners can’t
be accepted, the Athens-based newspaper said, citing a letter to
judicial authorities from the three governors.  Most Greek jails are filled to at least double their
capacity, with more than 12,700 people behind bars throughout
the country, almost half of them foreigners, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
