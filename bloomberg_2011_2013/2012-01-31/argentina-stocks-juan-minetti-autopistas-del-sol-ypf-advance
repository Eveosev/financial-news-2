The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 12:50 p.m. in  Buenos
Aires .  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index fell 0.2 percent to 2,765.01.  Autopistas del Sol SA  (AUSO AF), the Argentine highway
operator, rose 3 percent to 1.03 pesos. The government said it
was cutting toll-road subsidies to long-distance bus companies.  Juan Minetti SA (JMIN)  (JMIN AF), the cement producer, increased
7.2 percent to 4.45 pesos. Juan Minetti rose before today’s
release of  Argentina ’s December construction activity report by
the national statistics agency.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , Argentina’s largest oil company,
increased 1.2 percent to 166 pesos after tumbling 11 percent
yesterday. Argentina’s government can’t afford to buy YPF SA and
is unlikely to do so, Santander analysts led by Maria Eugenia
Fernandez Pouchan said in a report today. “The market
overreacted to the risk of nationalization,” Santander said.  Pagina/12 newspaper reported on Jan. 29 that government
officials had discussed a takeover of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
