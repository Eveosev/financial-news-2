Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS) 
asked a court to throw out a consumer fraud lawsuit by the
Nevada attorney general that accuses the company of falsifying
foreclosure documents.  The complaint by Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto fails to allege any document executed by subsidiaries was
incorrect or caused any borrower financial harm, Lender
Processing Services said in a statement today.  The state’s claims “are a collection of suppositions,
legal conclusions and inflammatory labels,” the company said in
the court filing. The document couldn’t be immediately verified
in court records.  Lender Processing Services, based in Jacksonville, Florida,
provides mortgage processing services and says about half of all
U.S. mortgages by dollar volume are serviced using its loan-
servicing platform.  Nevada  sued the company in December, claiming that it
engaged in a pattern of “falsifying, forging and/or
fraudulently executing” foreclosure documents, requiring
employees to execute or notarize as many as 4,000 foreclosure-
related documents a day, according to a statement from the
attorney general. Lender Processing Services also demanded
kickbacks from foreclosure firms, the office said.  The case is Nevada v. Lender Processing Services Inc.,
A-11-653289-B, District Court,  Clark County , Nevada ( Las Vegas ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
