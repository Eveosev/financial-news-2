Ethanol futures gained in  Chicago ,
paring a third monthly decline, as corn rose on signs of
increased export demand.  Futures advanced after the Agriculture Department reported
that export sales of corn jumped 26 percent last week from the
previous week. Ethanol in the U.S. is made mostly from the
grain.  “Ethanol and corn always have a big link but we just don’t
have a compelling story right now,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery increased 0.1 cent
to $2.167 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices fell
1.6 percent this month.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago advanced 3.5
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.155 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive jumped 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.275,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.245 a gallon and in  New York , the fuel added 2.5 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.27.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 7.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $6.39 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
