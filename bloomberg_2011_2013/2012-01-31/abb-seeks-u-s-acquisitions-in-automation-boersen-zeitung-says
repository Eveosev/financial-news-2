ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  is seeking further
acquisitions in the U.S. after the company yesterday said it
will buy  Thomas & Betts Corp . for $3.9 billion,  Boersen-Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Financial Officer
Michel Demare.  ABB seeks to expand in the U.S. automation market and is
seeking to buy “top companies” rather than those who may need
restructuring, the newspaper cited Demare as saying.  There is room to improve the company’s profitability in the
U.S., ABB seeks to maintain an investment grade credit rating,
and is also eying potential targets in Brazil and  China , Demare
said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
