 The U.K. government will announce
plans to reduce subsidies for solar energy at routine and
predictable intervals as part of an effort to curb a boom in
installations, a person familiar with the plan said.  The plan will include a mechanism called a deployment
trigger that would ensure above-market rates for power from
solar cells is automatically cut once a certain level of
installations is reached, said the person, who declined to be
identified before the official announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
