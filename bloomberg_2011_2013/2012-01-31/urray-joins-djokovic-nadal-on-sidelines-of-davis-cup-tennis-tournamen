Andy Murray  pulled out of Britain’s
Davis Cup matchup against Slovakia with an injury, joining
Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic and runner-up  Rafael Nadal  on the sidelines.  Murray, who pushed Djokovic to five sets in an Australian
Open semifinal that lasted almost five hours, has been advised
to take a few weeks off by doctors after picking up “a few
injuries,” the U.K.’s Lawn Tennis Association said in a
statement on its website today.  Britain, which last won men’s tennis’s top team competition
in 1936, plays Slovakia in Glasgow on Feb. 10-12 in the first
round of  Europe /Africa Group I, one tier below the elite World
Group. Without Murray, fourth in the ATP Tour rankings,
Britain’s highest-rated player is James Ward at No. 155.  “I’m gutted to miss out on the Davis Cup having really
enjoyed playing last year, but as it’s only the start of an
important season, which includes the Olympics in  London , it’s
probably a sensible decision,” Murray said in the statement.  Nadal said last month he wouldn’t be playing Davis Cup this
year for  Spain , which opens defense of its title against
Kazakhstan. Top-ranked Djokovic said two days ago after beating
Nadal in the longest Grand Slam final in Open era history --
five hours, 53 minutes, -- he wouldn’t play for Serbia against
Sweden to give himself time to recover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
