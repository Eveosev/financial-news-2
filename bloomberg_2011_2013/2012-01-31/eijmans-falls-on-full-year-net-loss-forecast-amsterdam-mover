Heijmans NV (HEIJM) , the second-biggest
construction company in the Netherlands, dropped the most in
more than two months after saying it may report a 2011 net loss
of as much as 40 million euros ($53 million).  Heijmans fell 7 percent to 8.57 euros, the most since Nov.
22. The Rosmalen-based company said today that it may write down
as much as 45 million euros on its property investments. It also
said the outlook for the housing market remains poor.  “Heijmans’s profit warning is disappointing,” Edwin de Jong, an Amsterdam-based analyst at SNS Securities, said in a
research note today. “Although we already anticipated some
writedowns on property positions, this is more than we
expected,” said De Jong, who has a “hold” recommendation on
the stock.  Heijmans was down 4.1 percent at 8.80 euros as of 10:27
a.m. in Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 149
million euros. Full-year results will be published March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
