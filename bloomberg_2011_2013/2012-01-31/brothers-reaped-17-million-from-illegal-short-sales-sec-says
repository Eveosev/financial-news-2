The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission accused two brothers of reaping more than $17 million
from improper short sales of stocks without having borrowed the
securities they were betting against.  Jeffrey Wolfson and Robert Wolfson made so-called naked
short sales from July 2006 to July 2007 in stocks including
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd.,
and NYSE Group, the SEC said in an order filed today.  In a short sale, an investor borrows shares and sells them
with the goal of profiting from a price decline by repurchasing
at a lower price and repaying the loan. SEC rules require
sellers to locate shares before selling them short, and require
that the borrowed securities be returned by a specified date.  Michael Wise, an attorney for Jeffrey Wolfson, and Thomas
McCabe, a lawyer for Robert Wolfson, declined to comment.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
