Yuan deposits in  Hong Kong  declined
by the most in three years as trade settlements with  China 
increased, intensifying competition among banks in the city for
the currency.
       Savings (HKRDTTL)  denominated in the Chinese currency fell 6.2
percent to 589 billion yuan ($93 billion) at the end of
December from the previous month, according to a statement from
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority today. That’s the biggest
monthly drop since December 2008.  A shrinking yuan deposit base is spurring Hong Kong banks
to offer higher  interest rates  to attract customers, as lenders
sought to bolster their reserves. The HKMA, seeking to promote
the city as China’s main offshore currency center, this month
relaxed yuan  capital requirements  for local banks after a jump
in funding costs for the currency.  “Last month’s yuan deposit decline is most likely due to
the increased remittances into China for trades, which means
less yuan stays in the city,” said  Frances Cheung , a strategist
at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. “That’ll lead to higher
rates as banks have to compete for yuan liquidity.”  The six-month  interbank rate  was 2.05 percent today, up
from 0.78 percent a year earlier, after reaching a record 2.9
percent on Dec. 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Rates  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS)  raised interest rates on yuan
savings today, offering 2.26 percent on 12-month deposits of
100,000 yuan or more to its high net-worth clients. HSBC
Holdings Plc also said it offered as much as 1.5 percent
for three-month deposits on new funds of at least 20,000 yuan.  The city’s total remittance of cross-border trade
settlement advanced 29 percent to 239 billion yuan in December,
from 185 billion yuan in the previous month, HKMA data show.
Yuan deposits rose 87 percent in 2011 from a year ago, slower
than the 400 percent surge in 2010.  Shanghai will allow “significantly more” foreign
participation in its financial markets as part of plans to
become a global center for yuan trading by 2015, according to a
plan jointly published by the National Development and
Reform Commission and the municipal government yesterday.  The yuan advanced 0.36 percent to close at 6.3085 per
dollar today in  Shanghai , paring this month’s decline to 0.23
percent, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.17
percent to 6.3025, extending this month’s gain to 0.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards rose 1.6 percent to 6.2835 in January, the
most since August. The contracts, which were little changed
today, are at a 0.4 percent premium to the onshore spot rate.  -- With assistance from Marco Lui in Hong Kong. Editors: Tan Hwee Ann, Chua Kong Ho  To contact the reporter on this story:
