Thailand  recorded a current-account
surplus in December as the nation started to recover from its
worst floods in almost 70 years.  The surplus was $1.94 billion, compared with a $136 million
shortfall reported earlier for November, the Bank of Thailand
said in a statement today. The median estimate of five
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a $1 billion
deficit.  The current account is the broadest measure of trade,
tracking goods, services and investment income. Trade makes up
more than 60 percent of the nationâ€™s current account, and
tourism contributes most of the remaining component under the
service industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
