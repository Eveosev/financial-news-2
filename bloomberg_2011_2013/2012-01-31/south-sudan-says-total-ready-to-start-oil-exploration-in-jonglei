Total SA (FP)  has agreed to begin oil
exploration in the South Sudanese state of Jonglei where it
holds a concession, the newly independent nation’s chief
negotiator said.  “Total has already committed themselves to start the
exploration this year, actually this month,”  Pagan Amum  told
reporters today in the capital, Juba. The media desk at Total’s
offices in Paris said a spokesman wasn’t immediately available
to comment.  Total holds a 32.5 percent stake in Block B, which covers
most of Jonglei, an eastern state bordering Ethiopia that has
been wracked by tribal violence. The  United Nations  said more
than 1,000 people were killed in battles between the Murle and
Lou Nuer ethnic groups in 2011.  South Sudan  took control of about three-quarters of Sudan’s
output of 490,000 barrels a day when it gained independence from
its northern neighbor in July. The crude is pumped mainly by
 China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPZ) , Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional
Bhd. and India’s ONGC Videsh Ltd.  In December, Total’s chief executive officer, Christophe de Margerie, said that South Sudan and Uganda could share a
pipeline to transport oil to the Indian Ocean, either to the
Kenyan or Tanzanian coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
