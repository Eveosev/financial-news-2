AVI Ltd. (AVI)  headed for its highest
close in at least 21 years as  South Africa ’s second-largest
consumer-goods company by market value said first-half profit is
expected to be higher than previously estimated.  The stock advanced as much as 4 percent to 41.59 rand and
traded at 41.33 rand as of 2:01 p.m. in Johannesburg. A close at
that level would be the highest since at least August 1990, when
Bloomberg started compiling the data.  Per-share earnings from continuing operations increased 36
percent to 195.1 cents in the six months through December, the
company said in a trading statement today. That’s higher than
the 22 percent to 32 percent advance the group estimated in a
Dec. 13 update. Earnings excluding one-time items climbed 32
percent to 194.4 cents, it said.  “What it tells me is that they had a very good December
period,” Jiten Bechoo, an analyst at Cape Town-based Avior
Research Pty Ltd., who has a “buy” recommendation and a price
estimate of 50.89 rand for the stock, said by phone. “There is
some seasonality, but over and above that it was driven by the
fashion division, which includes personal care and footwear and
apparel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
