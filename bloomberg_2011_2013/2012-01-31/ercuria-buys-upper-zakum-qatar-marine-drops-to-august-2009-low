Mercuria Energy Trading SA bought a
cargo of Abu Dhabi’s Upper Zakum crude through the oil-pricing
system operated by publisher Platts for a second month,
according to a survey of traders who monitor the market.  The Geneva-based energy trader purchased 19 Dubai partial
contracts for March loading from  SK Innovation Co. (096770) , the survey
showed. Under Platts rules, the deals must be consolidated into
one cargo when the same buyer and seller agree to trade 19 or
more of the 25,000-barrel lots during a month. The seller can
choose to supply 475,000 barrels of Dubai, Upper Zakum or Oman
to the buyer.  Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. today bought nine partial cargoes;
seven from SK and two from China International United Petroleum
& Chemical Co., known as  Unipec (QRAHVZ) , the survey showed. SK sold 35
lots during January, accounting for 875,000 barrels of Dubai.  Middle East crude prices have weakened as refining profits
have fallen. The  premium  of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude
dropped 30 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $18.63 a barrel, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker.
This crack spread narrowed for the first time in five days.  Two Mideast crude grades were assessed today at the lowest
level since August 2009.  Qatar Marine (PGCPQRMR)  fell for a third day,
dropping 2 cents to a discount of 85 cents below its official
selling price.  Upper Zakum (PGCPUPZK)  declined 2 cents to a discount of 50
cents to its official level, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sokol Offer  Japan ’s  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  is offering to sell a 100,000
metric-ton cargo of  Russia ’s Sokol crude for loading in late-
March, according to three traders who participate in the market,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. Earlier this month, BP Plc bought a cargo of the
sweet, or low-sulfur, oil from  ONGC Videsh Ltd. (ONGC)  at a premium of
$9 a barrel to benchmark prices.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when the price for deliveries
now is greater than for shipments later, narrowed by 5 cents.
Swaps for February were 93 cents a barrel more than April,
according to PVM data. The  exchange  for swaps for March, which
gauges North Sea Brent crude’s premium over Dubai, rose 11 cents
to $2.80 a barrel today.  The March official selling price for Oman oil will be
$110.63 a barrel, based on the average of daily futures
settlement prices on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. That makes
the medium-sulfur crude 3 percent more expensive than February’s
price of $107.41. Today’s settlement at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time
was $110.08, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
