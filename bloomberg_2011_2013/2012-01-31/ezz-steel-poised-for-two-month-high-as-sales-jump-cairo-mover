Ezz Steel (ESRS)  headed for the highest
close in more than two months after  Egypt ’s biggest publicly
traded producer of the metal reported a 22 percent increase in
nine-month sales.  The  shares  of the Cairo-based company climbed 6.1 percent
to 5.71 Egyptian pounds, poised for the highest close since Nov.
13, at 1:30 p.m. in Cairo. A gain of 53 percent this month has
lifted the company’s market value to 3.1 billion Egyptian pounds
($514 million). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index  advanced 2 percent
today, bringing the gain this month to 28 percent.  Sales in the period that ended Sept. 30 advanced to 14.2
billion pounds from a year-earlier, the company said in a
statement today. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose 20 percent to 1.9 billion pounds.  “Operations are as healthy as ever with a 15 percent
increase in volumes sold and the 1.8 billion pounds in  cash flow 
from operations,” said Omar Taha a research analyst at Beltone
Securities Brokerage in Cairo. “What has dragged down profits
has mostly been an accounting treatment for deferred taxes
during the first quarter.”  Profit for the period declined to 179 million pounds from
242 million pounds a year earlier on a higher  tax rate , it said.  Shares of Ezz Steel, which had two of its production
licenses stripped by court order last year because of
irregularities in the awarding process, plunged  81 percent  last
year. The Egyptian government will honor the licenses in
exchange for 660 million pounds, an amount determined by the
court, to be financed over five years, Minister of Industry and
Foreign Trade Mahmoud Issa said Jan. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
