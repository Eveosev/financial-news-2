Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s 2011 profit beat analyst
estimates as  Italy ’s biggest power company boosted revenue by 8
percent.  Preliminary earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose to 17.7 billion euros ($23 billion) from
17.5 billion euros a year earlier, the Rome based-company said
in a statement today. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had
estimated Enel’s 2011 Ebitda at 17.4 billion euros.  Enel said the “positive contribution” from its
infrastructure and networks division and renewable energy
business helped offset the decline in margins of the generation
and energy management unit and Iberia and Latin American
divisions.  Net financial debt at the end of 2011 was 44.6 billion
euros, down from 44.9 billion euros in the previous year.  The company said the utility’s board decided that no
interim dividend for 2012 would be distributed this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
