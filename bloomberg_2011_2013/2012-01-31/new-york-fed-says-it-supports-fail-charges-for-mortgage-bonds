The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
said it supports an industry group’s initiative to penalize
dealers and investors that fail to complete trades in mortgage-
backed securities at agreed-upon times.  The standard, which starts tomorrow, was created by the
Treasury Market Practices Group, formed in 2007 with
the help of the New York Fed to offer advice on debt markets.  “The New York Fed supports the TMPG’s efforts to reduce
settlement fails in the agency debt and agency MBS markets, as
it believes that prolonged, elevated settlement fails negatively
impact market functioning and increase systemic risk,”  Brian Sack , executive vice president and head of the New York Fed’s
markets group, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The New York Fed will adopt the practices in its own
operations, the central bank said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
