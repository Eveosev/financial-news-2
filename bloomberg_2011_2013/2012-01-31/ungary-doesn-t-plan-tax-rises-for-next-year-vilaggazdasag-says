Hungary doesn’t plan tax increases
for next year to compensate for the extraordinary industry taxes
that are in place until the end of this year and the halving of
a special levy on banks from 2013, Vilaggazdasag  reported .  The  International Monetary Fund , which criticized the
government’s flat personal income tax for hurting growth and
investment, “doesn’t understand in full the new, proportional”
fiscal regime, Economy Ministry Deputy State Secretary Adam
Balog told the Budapest-based business newspaper.  The government is “unlikely” to amend the personal income
tax regime as it’s “an important part of our economic policy,”
Balog was quoted as saying by Vilaggazdasag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
