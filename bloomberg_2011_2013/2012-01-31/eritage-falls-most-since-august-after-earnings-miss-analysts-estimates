Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) , a builder of
homes in the southern and western U.S., fell the most in five
months after reporting a larger-than-expected loss because of
costs related to winding down its business in Las Vegas.  The company fell 11 percent to $24.20 at the close in  New
York , the biggest decline since Aug. 8.  Meritage, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, had a fourth-
quarter loss of $11.8 million, or 36 cents a share, it said
today in a statement. The builder was expected to lose 5 cents a
share, the average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Meritage booked $9.2 million in charges related to
closing its operations in Las Vegas, the largest part of $13.9
million of impairments.  U.S. homebuilders have struggled to profit as  home prices 
continue to decline. The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of values in 20
cities fell 3.7 percent in November from a year earlier,
according to a report released today. Builders sold 302,000 new
single-family homes last year, the fewest in Commerce Department
records dating to 1963.  At Meritage, other measures improved, with home-sales
revenue rising 14 percent to $245.7 million, home-closing
earnings climbing 16 percent to $39.4 million, and new orders
increasing 5 percent to 749 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
