JPMorgan Chase & Co.  named Pranav
Thakur as head of fixed income for the Asian region excluding
Japan and  Australia  to replace Tarun Mahrotri, according to an
e-mailed statement.  Thakur will report to James Kenny, London-based head of
global emerging markets and regionally to Gaby Abdelnour,
chairman and chief executive officer for Asia Pacific, according
to the statement.  After joining JPMorgan in 2007, Thakur was appointed head
of trading for emerging Asia fixed income last year, the New
York-based bank said. Previously Thakur was head of trading for
Southeast Asia at Barclays Plc, according to the statement.  Mahrotri had served concurrently as the global co-head of
emerging markets alongside Kenny, who has now become the sole
head, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
