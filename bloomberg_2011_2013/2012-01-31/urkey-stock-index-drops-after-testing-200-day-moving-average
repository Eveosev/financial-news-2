Turkey ’s benchmark stocks gauge
retreated after breaking through its 200-day moving average as a
key technical indicator showed the index may be “overbought.”  The  ISE National 100 Index  fell 1.1 percent to 57,171.34 at
the close in Istanbul after breaking through its 200-day moving
average of 58,361.37 earlier in the day, climbing as much as 1.1
percent. An index’s rise above its 200-day average is a signal
to some traders who use technical analysis that a sustained
rally is beginning.  The plunge was led by banks, with the banking index
dropping 2.9 percent, snapping four days of gains.  The Turkish stock market had “the global wind in its
sails” and showed signs of being overbought before the plunge,
Isik Okte, strategist at Halk Invest in Istanbul, said by e-
mail. “If we don’t get any immediate results on the Greek
issue, then profit-taking will ensue.”  The relative strength index for the gauge was at 73. A
reading above 70 indicates shares are overbought and prepped for
a drop, according to technical analysts.  Greek Premier  Lucas Papademos  said today he would try to
meet German-led demands for a bigger debt writedown by investors
and deeper budget cuts as his government tries to prevent the
collapse of a second rescue package from creditors.  More Liquidity  The Turkish banking index has added 3.7 percent since U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  signaled on Jan. 25 that
 interest rates  will remain low through 2014.  Turkiye Halk
Bankasi AS (HALKB) , a state-run bank, has surged 18 percent this year.
 Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , the lender part-owned by Citigroup Inc., has jumped
11 percent. The ISE National index fell 22 percent last year.  Liquidity operations like the Fed’s will be the
“underlying theme of 2012” for Turkish equities, Okte said.
Any retreat in the Turkish index is “a buying opportunity for
me because the theme is constant - liquidity and more liquidity
by central banks to come.”  “Since the market rallied after the Fed’s commitment to
more liquidity, a lot of Turkish equities including Akbank and
Halkbank started trading above their 200-day moving average,
which is considered a long-term bullish signal,” Mahmut Dermancioglu, a trader at BGC Partners in Istanbul, said in
response to e-mailed questions. “Whether it breaks through or
falls back will set the tone.”  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  has gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
