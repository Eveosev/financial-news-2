Korean Air Lines Co. (003490) , South Korea’s
largest carrier, may more than double  profit  this year as it
starts new routes, boosts frequencies on Asian services and adds
more fuel-efficient planes.  Unconsolidated  operating profit , or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, may climb to 820 billion
won ($730 million) this year from 394 billion last year, the
Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales
may rise 9 percent to 12.8 trillion won.  The carrier expects a 5.2 percent jump in passengers as it
bolsters services to Asian cities such as  Hong Kong  and Beijing,
and begins new routes including to  London Gatwick  and Nairobi,
Kenya.  Korean Air  will also get its sixth Airbus SAS A380 plane
this year as it challenges Singapore Airlines Ltd. and  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  for business flyers.  “Adding Asia routes may help win passengers as demand is
high in the region,” said Park Eun Kyung, an analyst at Samsung
Securities Co. in Seoul. “However, there will also be an
increase in competition.”  Korean Air expects to receive 14 new planes this year, when
it plans to spend 1.56 trillion won on aircraft purchases, 35
percent less than in 2011. The carrier received five A380s last
year.  Profit Jumps  The airline’s consolidated fourth-quarter net income rose
almost sixfold to 146.1 billion won from a year earlier. That
was lower than the 168.4 billion won average of 12  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The carrier booked a 226.6
billion won foreign-exchange gain compared with a 151.2 billion
won loss a year earlier.  Operating profit in the period dropped 35 percent to 76.6
billion won and sales rose 8.5 percent to 3.19 trillion won.  The  carrier  rose 0.6 percent to 50,900 won in  Seoul 
trading, its highest level since Oct. 28. The benchmark Kospi
index advanced 0.8 percent.  The airline also plans to begin services from South Korea’s
Incheon airport to Danang in Vietnam and Urumqi, China this
year. It made its 2012 projections based on an expected oil
price of about $121 a barrel and assuming that the won will
average about 1,080 won against the  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
