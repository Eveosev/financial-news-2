Micromet Inc. (MITI)  was sued by a
shareholder who said  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s $1 billion takeover offer for
the drugmaker undervalues his stock.  Micromet’s board failed in its duty to get the best price,
the investor, Bernard Passes, said in a complaint filed
yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. Amgen, based
in  Thousand Oaks ,  California , announced a deal on Jan. 26 to buy
Micromet for $11 a share to gain an experimental leukemia drug.  “Given the company’s growth prospects and potential for
significant income,” the transaction is inadequate, Passes said
in his complaint. He said Micromet stock is worth at least $12 a
share  Jennifer Neiman, a spokeswoman for Rockville, Maryland-
based Micromet, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  Micromet, which closed at $8.28 the day before the takeover
was announced, fell 1 cent to $10.95 at 12:04 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Amgen, the world’s largest
biotechnology company, declined 31 cents to $68.02.  The case is Passes v. Micromet, CA7198, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
