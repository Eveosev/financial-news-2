Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Ltd. headed for the
lowest close in more than seven years after its U.S. unit said
2012 revenue will drop following cuts to forecasted natural-gas
prices used in several power-purchase agreements with utilities.  The shares of Ormat, a developer of geothermal  power
plants , slumped 2.7 percent to 17.47 shekels at 10:31 a.m. in
 Tel Aviv , poised for the lowest close since October 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
