Samsung Heavy Industries Co. will
base its first European 100 million-pound ($158 million)
offshore wind project in  Scotland , creating more than 500 jobs
in the country.  Samsung Heavy, the world’s second-largest shipbuilder, will
build its new seven-megawatt offshore wind turbine at the Fife
Energy Park in Methil, the Scottish government said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Clyde Blowers Plc (CBW) ’s David Brown Gear
Systems will co-locate a gearbox assembly plant at Methil.  Samsung’s “choice of Scotland is testament to the fact
this country is fast becoming the European center for research
and development in new offshore wind technologies,” Scottish
First Minister Alex Salmond said in the statement.  Salmond’s ruling Scottish National Party wants Scotland to
generate all its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. The
country is the  windiest  country in  Europe , according to the
Glasgow-based ScottishPower Renewable Energy Group.  Billionaire  Donald Trump  is fighting plans to build 11
offshore  wind turbines , each 640-feet (195 meters) high, in
Aberdeen Bay in view of a golf course he is constructing north
of Aberdeen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
