E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  posted
its biggest monthly gain in January as speculation policy makers
will take steps to sustain growth in the world’s fastest growing
major economy lured investors to 2011’s biggest decliner among
Chinese stocks traded in the U.S.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  of the most-traded Chinese
companies in New York climbed 0.7 percent to 103.33 yesterday,
bringing its advance in January to 7.8 percent, the most since
July 2010. E-Commerce, China’s largest Internet bookseller,
soared 67 percent in New York last month, the most since its
initial public offering in December 2010.  Renren Inc. (RENN)  surged 56
percent, leading a rally in Internet companies.  Known as Dangdang, E-Commerce sank 84 percent last year as
short sellers bet against some U.S.-listed stocks amid fraud
allegations directed at Canada-traded Sino-Forest Corp. After
government data showed  China ’s economy grew at the slowest pace
in 10 quarters in the last three months of 2011, China’s Premier
 Wen Jiabao  reiterated on Jan. 31 that the government plans to
“fine tune” economic policies.  “China is taking measures such as tax cuts with an
increasing focus on ensuring growth and a greater emphasis on
internal consumption,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst in Lisle,
 Illinois  at Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which invests $700
million in China, said by phone yesterday. “Investors are
bottom fishing some stocks which have dropped a lot last year.
Dangdang lost so much last year making it a very cheap buy.”  Tax Relief  China’s government raised the personal income tax threshold
in September by 75 percent to 3,500 yuan per month, reducing the
number of taxpayers by 60 million, according to official
estimates. The  Finance Ministry  said in November it would raise
the threshold for payment of value-added and business taxes so
that fewer small companies would be subjected to the levy.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 0.3 percent to
2,292.61 yesterday, posting a 4.2 percent gain this month, the
best January performance since 2009. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index retreated 0.1 percent to 1,312.41 yesterday after reports
showed that U.S. consumer confidence trailed economists’
projections and business activity cooled.  Dangdang declined 9.8 percent yesterday to $7.35, after
reaching a five-month high of $8.34 on Jan. 27. The stock is
trading 54 percent below its IPO price of $16 on Dec. 7, 2010.  Two analysts maintained their recommendations of “buy” or
“outperform” on Dangdang in January, while two maintained
ratings of “neutral” or “market perform”. The stock may
reach $8.01 in the next 12 months, according to the average
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Renren Climbs on Facebook  Renren, which owns a social-networking website in China,
jumped 56 percent in January amid reports Facebook Inc. will
file for an initial public offering as early as this week.  A Facebook IPO may increase investor willingness to buy
stock in Chinese companies that offer similar services, Echo He,
an analyst at Maxim Group LLC in  New York , said on Jan. 27.  Renren’s shares retreated 12 percent yesterday to $5.55.  The iShares  FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.9 percent yesterday
and 11.4 percent in January to $38.83.  American depositary receipts of  China Unicom (Hong Kong)
Ltd. , the nation’s second-largest mobile phone operator and the
only carrier offering Apple Inc.’s iPhones with a service
contract, advanced 1.3 percent to $18.47 in New York yesterday.
The ADRs, each representing 10 common shares of the company,
traded at a 0.3 percent premium over stocks in  Hong Kong , the
most since Jan. 19.  The company said on Jan. 19 that users of its third-
generation service topped 40 million in 2011, after it added 3.5
million subscribers in December. That compared with 36.3 million
3G users at China Telecom Corp. and 51.21 million for  China
Mobile Ltd. (941)  China Telecom may offer iPhones from this month, the
China Daily newspaper reported yesterday.  The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is due to
release a manufacturing index for this month today. The gauge
may fall to 49.6 from 50.3 in December, according to the median
estimate of 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The level 50 is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
