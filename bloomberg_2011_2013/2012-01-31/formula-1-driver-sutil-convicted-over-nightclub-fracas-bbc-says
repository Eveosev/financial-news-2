Formula One driver Adrian Sutil was
given a suspended 18-month prison sentence and fined 200,000
euros ($264,000) by a Munich court for causing grievous bodily
harm to an executive on another team, the  BBC  reported.  The 29-year-old German, then a driver with Force India, had
apologized after wounding Renault team executive Eric Lux in a
Shanghai nightclub in April last year, the BBC said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
