Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ,  Brazil ’s second-
largest bank by market value, declined in Sao Paulo trading
after reporting a smaller increase in fourth-quarter profit than
analysts estimated.  Bradesco, based in Osasco, fell 3.1 percent to 31.40 reais
($17.98), the second-biggest decline on the 70-company benchmark
 Bovespa (IBOV)  index and the largest loss for the stock since Nov. 17.
That compares with a 0.4 percent gain for the gauge.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time items, rose
3.2 percent to 2.77 billion reais, or 2.93 reais a share, from
2.68 billion reais, or 2.61 reais, a year earlier, the lender
said today in a  statement . That missed the 2.88 billion-real
 average estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Bradesco’s results are quite disappointing,” analyst
 Marcelo Telles , who has a “neutral” rating for the lender,
wrote in a Credit Suisse Group AG report today. “Bradesco’s
weaker results could be a prelude for what is yet to come during
this earnings season.”  Bradesco’s costs rose as it opened 1,009 branches last year
and purchased state-controlled Banco do Estado do  Rio de
Janeiro , or Berj, a deal that lets the company process payrolls
for about 400,000 public servants. Bradesco lost to  Banco do
Brasil SA (BBAS3)  the right to offer banking services in the nation’s
post offices in May. The lender said payroll and management
expenses rose 18 percent to 6.82 billion reais on expansion
costs.  Fell Short  “After consistently meeting or exceeding consensus
estimates since 2Q09, results fell short of expectations in
4Q11, which could pressure the stock in the short-term,”  Mario Pierry , an analyst at Deutsche Bank Corretora de Valores SA,
wrote in a note to clients today. He has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock.  Bradesco will slow network expansion in 2012 as it did
“strong work” opening branches last year, Chief Executive
Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi said in a conference call with
journalists today. The bank will open about 70 branches this
year, he said.  Provisions for loan losses rose to 2.66 billion reais at
the end of December from 2.3 billion reais a year earlier as
write-offs for loans at least 90 days overdue increased to 3.9
percent in the fourth quarter from 3.6 percent a year before and
3.8 percent in the preceding three-month period.  The bank said its portfolio of loans expanded 17 percent to
345.7 billion reais in the fourth quarter, compared with its
2011 guidance of 15 percent to 19 percent. Bradesco said it
expects loan portfolio growth to accelerate to 18 percent to 22
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
