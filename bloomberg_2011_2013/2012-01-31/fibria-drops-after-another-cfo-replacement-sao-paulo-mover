Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
biggest pulp producer, headed to the lowest price in three weeks
after the company said it is replacing Chief Financial Officer
Joao Elek Jr.  Shares fell 1.5 percent to 14.36 reais at 1:13 p.m in Sao
Paulo, headed for the lowest closing price since Jan. 9. The
benchmark Bovespa Index gained 0.3 percent.  Fibria said Guilherme Perboyre Cavalcanti will replace Elek
as chief financial officer, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. Cavalcanti is Vale SA’s former CFO.  “Investors could disapprove the company’s frequent
management re-shuffle,” analysts Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro from Banco Itau BBA SA said in a note sent to clients
today. “According to our calculations, Fibria has had six
different CFOs in the past three and a half years.”  Cavalcanti will have “limited room to maneuver” when he
begins the job “since Fibria’s priority continues to be the
reduction of the current  leverage ,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
