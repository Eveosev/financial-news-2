Polypore International Inc. (PPO) , the
maker of a key component in electric-car batteries, fell the
most in more than three years after a customer announced plans
to produce in-house the separators it currently purchases.  The shares  decreased  30 percent to $38.08 at the close in
New York. That’s the biggest drop since October 2008.  Avinash Kant, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. in Bend,
Oregon, today reduced his  rating  on Polypore to “neutral” from
“buy” on concern that  LG Chem Ltd. (051910)  would begin production this
year on the product used to separate chemicals within batteries.  LG Chem’s move may cut into Polypore’s sales to producers
of lithium-ion batteries for General Motors Co.’s  Chevy Volt  and
other electric cars, Kant said.  Robert Toth,  chief executive officer of Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Polypore, remains “confident in the premises
used to justify battery-separator expansions associated with
accelerating industry demand for electric drive vehicles,” he
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
