U.S. financial stocks are hardly a
bargain as they wrap up their best start to a year since the
1990s, according to  Brian Belski , Oppenheimer & Co.’s chief
investment strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index has done in each January since 1997, the last
time that the industry gauge beat this month’s 7.5 percent gain
through yesterday.  “Longer-term investors should not be fooled by what appear
to be attractive valuations for financials,” Belski wrote in a
Jan. 27 report. Anyone looking ahead three to five years ought
to invest less money in these stocks than their  S&P 500  weight
would suggest, he added. They account for about 14 percent of
the index’s value.  The financial index was valued at 12.4 times earnings
yesterday. The ratio was about twice as high two years ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Most of these companies operate in a ‘whole new world’ of
increased scrutiny and regulation,” wrote Belski, based in  New
York . He added that more restrictive  capital requirements ,
imposed as part of that shift, will hurt profitability.  This month’s gains in the shares resulted largely from
buying to capitalize on a rising stock market, he wrote. S&P’s
industry indicator swung by an average of 1.4 percent for every
1 percent move in the S&P 500 during the past 12 months, based
on Bloomberg’s data. This reading, known as beta, was higher for
financials than for any of the index’s nine other main industry
groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
