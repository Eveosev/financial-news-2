The trade deficit in  Kenya ,  East
Africa ’s largest economy, widened in November as import growth
outpaced exports, the country’s  statistics agency  said.  The gap increased 29 percent from a year earlier to 81.8
billion shillings ($968 million), the Nairobi-based Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics said on its website today. Exports
rose 13 percent to 44.5 billion shillings, compared with a 23
percent expansion in imports to 126.3 billion shillings. Import
costs rose for food, fuel and industrial products, it said.  The volume of tea exports from Kenya, the world’s biggest
producer of the black variety of the leaves, fell 5.1 percent in
November to 33,352.5 metric tons, while earnings rose 15 percent
to 9.3 billion shillings, the statistics bureau said.
Horticulture exports climbed 9 percent to 17,274 tons, while
coffee sales retreated 39 percent to 1,989.9 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
