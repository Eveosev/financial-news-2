Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GNP)  fell
the most in almost six months in Mumbai trading after the Indian
drugmaker reported a 58 percent drop in third-quarter profit
because of foreign exchange losses.  Glenmark  tumbled  as much as 7.6 percent, the biggest drop
on an intraday basis since Aug. 5, before trading 7 percent
lower at 290 rupees as of 12:19 p.m. local time. The stock was
the biggest  loser  on the BSE200 Index.  Profit fell to 461.2 million rupees ($9 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31 after recording a loss of 1.02
billion rupees on foreign currency loans, the Mumbai-based
company said yesterday. After adjusting for the one-time loss,
operating income still fell as slower growth in  India  and the
U.S. put pressure on profit margins and that will continue,
brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities said today.  “We remain disappointed with its quality with high margin
regions of India and U.S. not growing as per our expectations,”
Kotak analyst Priti Arora wrote in a note to clients. She cut
her  rating  on the stock to “reduce” from “add” and lowered
her 12-month price target by 9.3 percent to 340 rupees.  Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group also cut their 2012
earnings estimates for Glenmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
