Asian currencies had the best start
to a year since 2006 after investors poured money into the
region to take advantage of higher  interest rates  and a faster
pace of economic growth than in developed nations.  Five-year benchmark bonds in Taiwan, Thailand and South
Korea yielded 0.94 percent, 3.07 percent and 3.49 percent,
respectively, compared with 0.74 percent for similar-maturity
Treasuries. Malaysia’s central bank will probably leave
borrowing costs at 3 percent later today, according to all 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, more than the near-zero rates
available in the U.S.  “Funds are flowing into stocks and bonds amid some
improvement in liquidity,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader
on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd. in Tokyo. “There’s yield advantage as the  Federal Reserve 
is likely to keep its rate near zero for a while.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, climbed
1.8 percent this month to 117.23 as of 4:22 p.m. in  Hong Kong .
 India ’s rupee jumped 7.2 percent in January to 49.4788 per
dollar, leading gains in the region, and South Korea’s won rose
2.6 percent to 1,123.26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas investors purchased $9.1 billion more South Korean,
Indian and Taiwanese equities than they sold this month,
according to exchange data.  IMF Outlook  The Fed signaled last week it will keep interest rates near
zero through late 2014. That compares with benchmark rates of
8.5 percent in India and 6 percent in  Indonesia .  Foreign funds  boosted  holdings of Indonesia’s government
debt by 7.6 trillion rupiah ($844 million) to 230.4 trillion
rupiah this month through Jan. 27, a four-month high, after
Southeast Asia’s largest economy won an investment-grade rating
of Baa3 from Moody’s Investors Service on Jan. 18.  Developing Asia may expand 7.3 percent this year, compared
with 1.8 percent in the U.S. and a contraction of 0.5 percent in
the euro area, according to estimates by the  International
Monetary Fund  on Jan. 24.  Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 4.2 percent in January to
3.0465 per dollar, the best month in almost two years. The
central bank said yesterday it would relax rules on interest-
rate derivatives, debt and foreign-exchange trading.  “The decision to further liberalize the foreign-exchange
market is positive for the currency,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja ,
a senior currency analyst in  Singapore  at Malayan Banking Bhd.
“Foreign interest in Malaysian assets is quite healthy.”  China Manufacturing  The yuan had a monthly decline on speculation  China  will
limit gains to protect exporters as global economic growth
falters. The currency fell 0.23 percent to 6.3085 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  China is scheduled to release a manufacturing  purchasing
managers’ index  for January tomorrow. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate the gauge will be at 49.6, compared with 50.3
in December. Fifty is the dividing line between contraction and
expansion. People’s Bank of China adviser  Li Daokui  said there
are signs the yuan is near its equilibrium level, Xinhua News
Agency reported last week.  “Investors are worried about China’s export outlook as the
European debt crisis lingers,” said Banny Lam, a Hong Kong-
based economist at CCB International Securities Ltd., a unit of
China’s second-largest bank. “Possible capital outflows also
add to the concern.”  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso appreciated 2.3 percent
this month to 42.875 per dollar,  Thailand ’s baht climbed 2.1
percent to 30.92 and Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.7 percent to
9,008. Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 2.3 percent to NT$29.62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
