Entergy Corp. (ETR) , the second-largest
operator of U.S. nuclear plants, declined the most in more than
five months after warning that pension costs may drag 2012
earnings to the bottom end of the company’s forecast.  Shares fell 2.2 percent to $68.88 at 2:19 p.m. in  New York 
after dropping as much as 3.1 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since Aug. 18.  Pension expenses of 24 cents a share and volatile wholesale
electricity prices may steer 2012 results to the bottom end of
the $5.40 to $6.20 a share range originally provided in
November, Leo Denault, chief financial officer of New Orleans-
based Entergy, said during a fourth-quarter earnings call today.  “The pension impact was a little more than some people may
have expected,”  Paul Patterson , a New York-based utilities
analyst with Glenrock Associates LLC, said during a telephone
interview. About 75 percent of the pension expense occurred at
Entergy’s regulated utilities and may eventually be recovered
from customers, said Patterson.  Entergy was also hurt by falling  gas prices  today, said
Patterson. Natural-gas futures dropped 7.2 percent to $2.517 per
million British thermal units at 2:26 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Fourth-quarter profit fell 32 percent to $154.1 million, or
87 cents a share, from $228.3 million, or $1.26, a year earlier,
according to a statement today. Excluding costs for spinning off
its transmission business, per-share profit was 5 cents more
than the average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
