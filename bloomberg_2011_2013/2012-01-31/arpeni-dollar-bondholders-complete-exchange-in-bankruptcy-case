 U.S. dollar bondholders involved in
 PT Arpeni Pratama Ocean Line (APOL) â€™s bankruptcy case received new
notes or cash in exchange for their $141 million in debt,
according to Robert Schmitz, Asian head of debt advisory and
restructuring at NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd. said.  The Jakarta-based shipping company has been in a $640
million two-year long bankruptcy, said Schmitz, who is advising
the firm on the case. Arpeni also completed a $75 million rights
offer yesterday, according to Schmitz.  A call to Arpeni company secretary Ronald Nangoi today
seeking comment on the exchange went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
