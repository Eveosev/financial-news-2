Gentex Corp. (GNTX)  had its biggest drop
since Aug. 8 after the maker of rearview mirrors and driver-
assistance cameras reported profit that was lower than analystsâ€™
estimates because price cuts hurt margins.  Gentex  fell  as much as 8.5 percent. It slid 8 percent
percent to $27.70 at 11:10 a.m. New York time after touching
$27.57. The shares, which gained 1.8 percent this year before
today, rose 0.1 percent in 2011.  Fourth-quarter profit rose to $40.5 million, or 28 cents a
share, from $36.9 million, or 26 cents. The average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 30
cents a share. Gross margin narrowed to 35 percent of sales from
36 percent, mostly because of yearly customer price cuts, the
company said.  Gentex sales rose 17 percent to $260.3 million, the
Zeeland, Michigan-based company said in a statement. The average
of five estimates was for revenue of $273.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
