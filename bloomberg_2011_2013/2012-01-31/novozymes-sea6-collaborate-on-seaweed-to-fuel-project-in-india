Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the world’s biggest
maker of enzymes for biofuels, will collaborate with Sea6 Energy
to convert seaweed into ethanol.  During the one-year partnership, Novozymes will develop
enzymes to convert carbohydrates from seaweed into sugars, which
can be fermented to produce ethanol, Adam Monroe, president of
Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novozymes’ North American unit, said in
a telephone interview. The sugars can also be processed into
chemicals and proteins for food and fertilizers.  Sea6, based in  Chennai ,  India , is developing technology to
cultivate seaweed on a large scale in offshore structures,
Monroe said.  “Seaweed contains a lot of sugar per drymass, and most of
the things you make from crude oil, you can make from sugar,”
Monroe said. “Once we’ve sorted out the optimal cocktail, we’ll
work with Sea6 on the best processes to make fuel.”  Novozymes said last week that 2012 sales growth probably
will be at the top end of its forecast range. The company fell
0.4 percent to 157 kroner in Copenhagen yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
