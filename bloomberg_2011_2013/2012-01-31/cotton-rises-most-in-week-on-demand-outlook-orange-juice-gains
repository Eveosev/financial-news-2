Cotton rose the most in a week as
signs of progress by European governments to ease their debt
crisis bolstered prospects for global economic growth and demand
for some commodities. Orange juice also gained.  Global equities rose, the euro strengthened, and most raw
materials gained after countries in  Europe  agreed to tighter
budget controls and Greece made progress on debt talks with
creditors. Gains in wheat, crude oil and cocoa led a gain of as
much as 1.6 percent in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  “We are getting some help from outside markets,”  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at Penson Futures in Atlanta, said in
a telephone interview.  Cotton futures for March delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
94.4 cents a pound by 10:24 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , which would be the biggest gain since Jan. 23. Before
today, the price was up 2.6 percent since the end of December,
heading for the biggest monthly gain since August. The fiber
plunged 37 percent in 2011.  Orange-juice  futures for March delivery advanced 0.5
percent to $2.108 a pound on ICE. Before today, the price surged
24 percent in January, heading for the biggest monthly rally
since October 2009. On Jan. 23, the contract touched a record
$2.2695.  To contact the reporter on this story:
