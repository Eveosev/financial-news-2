Chile’s peso rebounded from the
biggest drop among major Latin American currencies as the price
of its biggest export, copper, rose and  unemployment  reached the
lowest level in at least 34 months.  The peso gained 0.5 percent to 487.92 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:19 a.m. in Santiago, from 490.35 yesterday. Interest-rate
swap yields and breakeven inflation climbed.  Copper for March delivery increased as much as 1.2 percent
and the euro, frequently used as a benchmark for peso traders,
appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3214. The peso extended
its gains after data showed Chilean unemployment fell to 6.6
percent, the lowest since the National Statistics Institute
changed its methodology in March 2009. The median estimate of 11
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for the  unemployment rate 
to remain unchanged at 7.1 percent.  “The employment numbers helped,” said Cristian Donoso, a
currency trader at Banchile Inversiones in Santiago. “Copper’s
rising, New York stock futures are up and the euro was a bit
stronger, though we’re starting to lose some of that move.
Everyone’s watching the Greek debt negotiations. If there’s a
solution there, the dollar should fall further.”  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed short positions in the currency to $4.2 billion on Jan.
27, the lowest since Nov. 2 and a reduction of $1.9 billion so
far this year.  Six-month interest-rate swaps in pesos rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.67 percent while the two-
year rate rose four basis points to 4.44 percent at 10:24 a.m.
Two-year breakeven inflation rose four basis points to 2.91
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
