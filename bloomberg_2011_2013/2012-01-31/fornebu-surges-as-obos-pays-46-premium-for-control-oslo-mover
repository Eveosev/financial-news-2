Fornebu Utvikling ASA (FBU)  rose the most
on record in Oslo trading after Oslo Bolig- og Sparelag bought
shares at a 46 percent premium to gain control of the developer
of Norway’s largest housing project.  Fornebu shares rose as much as 46 percent, the most since
the 2007 listing, and were up 45 percent at 2.44 kroner at 11:03
a.m. local time. The shares dropped 28 percent last year, after
rising 50 percent in 2010. The shares were bought from  Orkla
ASA (ORK) , among others.  OBOS, a cooperative building association owned by its
members, agreed to buy about 494 million shares at 2.45 kroner
apiece, raising its stake to 77.5 percent. That was a 46 percent
premium above yesterday’s close, valuing the company at 2
billion kroner ($340 million). OBOS must make a mandatory offer
for the remainder four weeks after the completion of the deal.  Fornebu Utvikling, which is developing  Norway ’s biggest
housing project on the site of Oslo’s former airport, said in
its third-quarter report that had completed a financial
restructuring and had a “solid” financial platform. The
company’s third-quarter net loss narrowed to 32.5 million kroner
from 113.6 million kroner a year earlier.  “This gives OBOS members an increased supply of attractive
housing in Oslo’s finest residential area,” Martin Maeland,
chief executive officer of OBOS, said in a statement. “We
consider Fornebu development as a long-term investment and want
to work closely with current management in Fornebu Development
to help the company to achieve its long-term goal.”  OBOS manages and develops real estate properties and
manages more than a third of all residential real estate in
Oslo, according to its website.  Orkla, which is selling off assets to focus on its consumer
brands business, sold its 32 percent stake, while Canica AS, the
investment company of Orkla Chairman Stein Erik Hagen, sold its
5.97 percent stake. In addition, funds managed by QVT Financial
LP sold 163 million shares, or 19.6 percent of the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
