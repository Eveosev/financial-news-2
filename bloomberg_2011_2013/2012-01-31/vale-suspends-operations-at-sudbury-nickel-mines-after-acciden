Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, shut its mines in Sudbury, Ontario, to assess
safety conditions after a worker was killed in an accident on
Jan. 29, according to a regulatory filing.  “There is no impact on refined nickel production at the
mines in the short term because the smelter, the processing
plant and the refinery are operating normally,” Vale said in a
filing with Brazilian regulators.  In July 2009, about 3,000 workers at Vale’s operations in
Sudbury and Port Colborne, Ontario, went on strike to protest
pay and conditions. The industrial dispute ended in July 2010.  -- Editors: Jasmina Kelemen, Susan Warren  To contact the reporter on this story:
