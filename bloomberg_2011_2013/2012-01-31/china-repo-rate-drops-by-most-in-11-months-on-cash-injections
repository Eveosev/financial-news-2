China ’s money-market rate had its
biggest monthly drop since July after the central bank added the
most cash to the financial system in almost four years.  The People’s Bank of China  injected  477 billion yuan ($75.6
billion) this month through Jan. 19, the most since Bloomberg
began collecting the data in March 2008. The PBOC surprised many
economists by not lowering lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios
ahead of last week’s Lunar New Year holidays to boost supply.  “The reverse repo being done from Jan. 17 to Jan. 19 eased
liquidity conditions in the system,” said  Frances Cheung , a
Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “The central
bank might want the repo rate to drop to around 3 percent to
ensure there’s enough money in the system to support growth. It
can achieve that by cutting the reserve ratio.”  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, dropped 127 basis points
this month to 4.33 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The rate fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, today.  As the 352 billion yuan of 14-day reserve-repurchase
agreements will mature this week, it will create pressure on
liquidity conditions again, Credit Agricole’s Cheung said.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained 22 basis
points in January to 3.14 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose three basis points today.  The yield on the 3.41 percent government bonds due June
2020 fell eight basis points this month to 3.42 percent,
according to the National Interbank Funding Center. The rate
rose two basis points today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
