Lawsuits filed against the  National
Football League  over damages allegedly caused by repeated
traumatic head injuries will consolidated in federal court in
Philadelphia, a panel of judges ruled today.  The decision by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District
Litigation consolidates the cases before U.S. District Judge
Anita Brody. The panel’s three-page ruling was filed today in
Philadelphia. The NFL and a majority of the plaintiffs support
the venue, according to the ruling.  “The subject actions share factual issues arising from
allegations against the NFL stemming from injuries sustained
while playing professional football,” the panel said in its
ruling.  Hundreds of former players, including former quarterback
Jim McMahon, have sued the NFL in more than a dozen complaints
over allegations that the league ignored the consequences of
head injuries in order to promote the sport. In addition to
Philadelphia, lawsuits have been filed in  California ,  New York ,
 New Jersey , Georgia and  Florida . The NFL has denied the claims.  Last year, the league imposed a protocol on team doctors
and trainers to assess players who have sustained concussions
during games.  The panel’s ruling focused on four lawsuits, one filed in
Philadelphia and three in California. An additional 16
complaints have been filed, the panel said.  The case is In re National Football League Players’
Concussion Injury Litigation, MDL 2323, U.S. District Court
Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
