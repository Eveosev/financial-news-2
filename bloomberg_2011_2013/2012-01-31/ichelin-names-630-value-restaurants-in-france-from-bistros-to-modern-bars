Michelin (ML)  today released its
selection of all the 630 restaurants in  France  that will be
recognized next month for serving good, inexpensive meals.  The Bib Gourmand label indicates a restaurant serving
three-course meals offering good value for the money, defined as
less than 35 euros ($46) in Paris and 29 euros elsewhere. The
selection has increased by 140 percent in six years, with more
than 120 additions in 2012 alone.  “These restaurants never fail to delight Michelin guide
readers with their wide range of styles, from traditional
terroir to trendy gastro-bistro, from ethnic adventure to
extremely creative,” Michelin said in an e-mailed release.  Michelin’s guide to France is scheduled to be announced on
Feb. 27. The Clermont-Ferrand, France-based company is the
world’s second-biggest tiremaker, after Bridgestone Corp. It
produced its first guide in August 1900, distributed free of
charge (until 1920) and intended for chauffeurs.  Here are the new 2012 Bib Gourmand restaurants, with the
locality first, followed by the department in parentheses and
the restaurant name:       (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
