The New Zealand dollar climbed
against most of its major peers after  Greece â€™s Prime Minister
 Lucas Papademos  said progress was being made in debt-swap talks,
spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called kiwi climbed 0.3 percent to 82.21 U.S. cents
as of 2:16 p.m. in Wellington. It rose 0.4 percent to 62.79 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
