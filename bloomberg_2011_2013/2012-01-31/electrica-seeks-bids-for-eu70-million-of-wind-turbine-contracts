Electrica SA,  Romania ’s state-owned
power distributor, will reopen a tendering process for wind-
turbine contracts worth 70 million euros ($92 million), as it
implements plans for two wind parks.  The company, which may start work on a 45-megawatt wind
park in Galati county in June, canceled an initial tender for
the turbines, citing “complex technical details set out under a
public-procurement law,” according to an e-mailed statement
today. It plans to restart the process as soon as possible.  China ’s  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)  and  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 
put in bids to supply the turbines before the cancellation,
according to  Mediafax  news service.  Electrica said it also plans to build a wind park in
Constanta county. It didn’t disclose details, citing
confidentiality reasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
