Italy’s bonds led gains by the
securities of Europe’s most-indebted nations after European
Union leaders signed a fiscal-discipline treaty, fueling
optimism a solution to the debt crisis is getting nearer.  German 10-year bond yields climbed from the lowest in
almost two weeks as stocks rose and Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said he was committed to debt-swap talks with
bondholders, reducing demand for the debt of Europe’s largest
economy as a haven.  Belgium ’s two-year notes advanced as the
country auctioned 2.58 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of treasury
bills. Portuguese bonds advanced, pushing 10-year yields down
from a record.  “The deal that they did on the fiscal rules was good and
that is supporting risk sentiment,” said Niels From, chief
analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “What’s been decided
won’t help with the current crisis but will prevent future
crises, so it might have a positive short-term impact but I
don’t think that will be sustained.”  The Italian 10-year yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 6.02 percent at 1:27 p.m. London time,
after jumping 20 basis points yesterday, the most since Dec. 12.
The 5 percent bond due March 2022 gained 0.515, or 5.15 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 93.  German 10-year yields rose two basis points to 1.81
percent.  That pushed the extra yield, or spread, that investors get
for holding Italian 10-year bonds instead of German counterparts
down by nine basis points to 4.21 percentage points, after
jumping yesterday to 4.38 percentage points, the most since Jan.
23. Spanish 10-year bonds yielded 3.21 percentage points more
than bunds, down from 3.25 percentage points yesterday.  Greece ‘Committed’  Papademos told reporters after the EU summit in Brussels
that he is “strongly committed” to reaching a debt-swap
agreement with creditors.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 1 percent, while futures
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent.  Italian bonds have returned 4.9 percent this year, after
dropping 5.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese bonds tumbled 16 percent in January, while
Greek securities declined 1.4 percent, the indexes show. German
bonds are little changed this month.  Gains by  Portugal (GSPT10YR) ’s bonds pushed the 10-year yield down by
56 basis points today to 16.84 percent, after climbing to 18.29
percent, the most since the euro’s creation.  Finnish bonds underperformed their German counterparts as
the country said it planned to sell new 15-year benchmark bonds.
The extra yield that investors get for holding Finnish 10-year
bonds instead of bunds climbed four basis points to 48 basis
points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
