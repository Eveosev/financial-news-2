U.S. stocks  erased  early gains,
while the dollar and Treasuries reversed declines, as reports
showed American  consumer confidence  trailed estimates and
business activity cooled in January.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 1,312.58 at 10:09 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as
0.6 percent earlier. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  was little changed at
79.148 after tumbling as much as 0.5 percent. The euro slipped
0.2 percent to $1.3116, reversing a 0.5 percent increase. Ten-
year Treasury yields lost one basis point to 1.83 percent.     Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly dropped in
January as gasoline prices picked up and more Americans said
jobs were hard to get. The Conference Board’s confidence index
fell to 61.1 from a revised 64.8 reading in the prior month. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for a rise to 68. The figure was lower than the most pessimistic
projection.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer declined to 60.2 from 62.2 in December.
Readings above 50 signal growth. Economists forecast the gauge
would rise to 63, according to the median of 57 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
