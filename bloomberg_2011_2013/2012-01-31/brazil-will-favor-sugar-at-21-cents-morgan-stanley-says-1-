Sugar millers in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, will favor production of sugar over ethanol
with prices at or above 21 cents a pound, Morgan Stanley said.  Producers in the South American country can make either
sugar or ethanol from the raw material sugar cane. The raw
sweetener traded in New York was up 1.2 percent to 24.13 cents a
pound at 11:04 a.m. London time on ICE Futures U.S.  “Strong gasoline demand in Brazil has also led to an
increase in anhydrous ethanol demand, though economics still
support sugar production over ethanol down to a sugar price of
21 cents a pound,”  Hussein Allidina , head of commodities
research at the bank, wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Sugar supplies will exceed demand by 7.7 million
metric tons in the 2011-12 season ending Sept. 30, with more
production in the Northern Hemisphere and output in Brazil
ending “stronger” than initially anticipated, he said.  “We remain bearish on sugar given our estimates for a
global surplus in 2012,” Allidina said. “Sugar
fundamentals should soften in the first half of 2012.”  The global supply outlook for coffee is “bearish,” with
slowing economies weighing on demand for arabica beans in
 emerging markets , according to the report. Arabica coffee is
harvested mainly in  Latin America  and used in specialty drinks
favored by Starbucks Corp.  “With increased arabica production slated to come out of
Brazil and robusta production out of  Vietnam , the impending
supply outlook is bearish,” Allidina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
