The U.K.  Financial Services
Authority  will encourage central clearinghouses to conduct daily
stress tests as part of reviews of how they manage the risk of
members defaulting on derivatives contracts, the watchdog said.  The scenarios used to test central counterparties should be
“subject to senior management sign-off,” the FSA said in a
statement on its website. The watchdog said it would use the
standards to assess applications for new clearing services, as
well as the robustness of existing central counterparties.  Clearinghouses operate as counterparties for every buy and
sell order executed by their members, who post collateral to
reduce the risk of loss in the event of one party defaulting.
The FSA said in the statement that “stress testing analysis on
a daily basis” for clearinghouses was “good practice.”  Global supervisors at the  Financial Stability Board , the
regulatory body set up by the Group of 20 Nations following the
2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., said earlier
this month they may expand the definition of a too-big-to-fail
financial firm to cover clearinghouses. Regulators should decide
by June on the “appropriate form” of central clearers dealing
with derivatives, the FSB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
