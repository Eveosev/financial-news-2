Holly Energy Partners (HEP)  said it’s
cleaning an  oil spill  from a six-inch pipeline that gathers
crude from wells in the Permian Basin in Texas.  The line is part of a network that gathers oil for delivery
to nearby refineries or Midland, Texas, the Dallas-based company
said in a statement.  Holly uses the system to deliver feedstock to the 115,000-
barrel-a-day  Navajo refinery  in Artesia,  New Mexico , according
to the company. The leak isn’t expected to affect production at
the plant, as it has other means of receiving oil, the company
said.  “Remediation of the affected soil is expected to commence
shortly,” Holly said in the statement. “Once the soil
remediation is complete HEP does not anticipate any material
environmental impact from the spill or safety risk to the
public.”  About 1,100 barrels of oil have been recovered from the
spill and more was absorbed in the soil at Holly’s Wood Station
pump complex, where the leak occurred, the statement shows.  The pipeline that leaked is shut, while the rest of the
gathering system continues to operate, the company said. The
line is expected to be repaired and returned to service within
days, according to Holly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
