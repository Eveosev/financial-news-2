Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, rose to its highest level since September after
saying it obtained an injunction to block a court decision in a
Brazil tax dispute.  The company’s preferred shares  gained  2.6 percent to 42.69
reais in Sao Paulo, their highest close since Sept. 21. Vale has
risen 13 percent since the beginning of the year, beating the 11
percent increase of Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa  Index. (IBOV)   Vale obtained an injunction blocking an unfavorable court
decision related to taxes over net income generated by its
foreign subsidiaries, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a
regulatory filing late  yesterday . The case will return to
Brazil’s board of tax appeals, an administrative office know as
CARF, and may reverse previous rulings it must pay about 9.8
billion reais ($5.6 billion), according to the filing.  Other companies have won similar cases at the CARF, Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro, analysts at Itau Corretora de
Valores SA, said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
