South Korean banks’ combined profit
slipped 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter as earnings from
equity trading declined, according to preliminary figures from
the country’s financial regulator.  Net income at the 18 lenders totaled 1.6 trillion won ($1.4
billion) for the three months ended Dec. 31, down from a revised
1.7 trillion won a year earlier, the  Financial Supervisory
Service  said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with
a 2.7 trillion-won profit in the previous quarter.  Earnings from  stock trading  fell to 100 billion won from
900 billion won a year earlier, the regulator said. The nation’s
benchmark Kospi index lost 11 percent in 2011, its first drop in
three years, as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis led to a rout in
global equities.  South Korean regulators are urging lenders to keep
sufficient buffers for losses as economic growth decelerates,
reaching 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace in
two years.  Net new provisions against bad debt declined to 2.6
trillion won from 3.1 trillion won. Total credit costs,
including items that are deducted after net income, rose to 4.9
trillion won from 3.4 trillion won a year earlier as lenders set
aside more funds by applying stricter rules to classify bad
loans, the regulator said today. The costs include bad-debt
provisions, credit-loss reserves and expenses from selling
soured loans.  Net interest margin, a measure of profitability on lending,
narrowed to 2.23 percent in the period, compared with 2.31
percent a year earlier and 2.32 percent in the previous three
months, the FSS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
