Polish bond yields dropped to a
four-month low and the zloty gained after the government said it
met a third of this year’s financing needs and  Greece  made
progress on debt-swap talks with creditors.  The yield on notes maturing in October 2021 declined six
basis points to 5.60 percent, the lowest since Sept. 8, as of
11:15 a.m. in Warsaw. The yield has slumped 29 basis points in
January, the biggest monthly drop since August 2010. The zloty
appreciated 0.6 percent to 4.2285 per euro today, the steepest
gain among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said he’s “strongly
committed” to reaching an agreement with creditors, helping the
euro rebound from its biggest decline versus the dollar
yesterday in two weeks. Poland had a “significant” inflow of
foreign capital to its bond market in January as the government
sold debt in zloty, euros and dollars,  Piotr Marczak , head of
the Finance Ministry’s public debt department, said yesterday.  “We have a bit of euphoria going,” Mateusz Milewski,
senior fixed-income trader at Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej SA,
said by phone from Warsaw. “There is more optimism about  Europe 
and the ministry has made a lot of progress in financing its
needs so the sentiment is positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
