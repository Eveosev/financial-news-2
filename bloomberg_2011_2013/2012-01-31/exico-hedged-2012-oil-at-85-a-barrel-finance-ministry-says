Mexico , the third-largest supplier
of oil to the U.S., has locked in prices for 2012 oil exports at
$85 a barrel, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The state purchased an unspecified number of options at an
unspecified price to sell oil, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement last night.  The nation normally hedges oil exports to cover a possible
revenue shortfall if prices fall. About a third of Mexicoâ€™s
annual budget is funded by oil revenue. The budget for this year
estimates oil will sell for $84.90 a barrel.  Mexico exported about 1.34 million barrels of crude a day
in 2011, according to statistics from Petroleos Mexicanos, the
state-owned  oil company . About 85 percent of that went to the
U.S.  Canada and Saudi Arabia are the two largest suppliers to
the U.S., according to the  Energy Information Administration .  To contact the reporters on this story:
