Portugal’s government plans a second
wave of asset sales after it finishes selling stakes in  REN-
Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA (RENE)  and oil company  Galp Energia SGPS
SA (GALP)  early this year, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said.  Portugal is in the final stages of choosing a buyer for
REN, which operates the national power grid and gas pipelines,
Passos Coelho said.  “I hope that very quickly we will reach a positive result
regarding Galp,” he said at a press conference late yesterday
following a European Union summit in Brussels.  “That means we will have the conditions to start working
on a second wave of privatizations that was scheduled for this
year,” the prime minister said. “We will advance swiftly on that
dossier.”  Portugal’s government is selling as much as 40 percent of
REN and a 7 percent stake in Galp to comply with the terms of a
78-billion euro ($102 billion) bailout requested last year from
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  The asset-sale plans also include the state’s whole or
partial stakes in airline TAP SGPS SA, airport management
company ANA and rail freight company CP Carga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
