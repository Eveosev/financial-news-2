Switzerland  plans to hand over
copies of 4 million to 6.5 million e-mails from  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  and seven other Swiss banks to U.S. tax authorities,
 Swiss Radio DRS  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The e-mails are encrypted so the authorities can’t
currently read the content, which includes correspondence
between clients and their advisers, DRS said. Switzerland will
help decode the messages once the two countries reach an
agreement, the radio service reported.  Credit Suisse declined to comment while a spokesman for
Switzerland’s State Secretariat for International Financial
Matters wasn’t immediately available for comment when called by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
