A 24-year-old man was arrested today
for defrauding people he met on an online dating website,
 London ’s Metropolitan Police Service said.  One victim, a 69-year-old American woman, gave him 140,000
pounds ($221,000) after he claimed he needed the money for a
business supplying police transportation for the London  Olympic
Games , the police said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Remember that just because they show you an official
looking document, that still does not mean they are who they say
they are,” Detective Superintendent Nick Downing said in an e-
mailed statement.  The police made the arrest as part of Operation Podium,
which investigates crimes such as ticket fraud and  money
laundering  centered on the Olympic Games in London this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
