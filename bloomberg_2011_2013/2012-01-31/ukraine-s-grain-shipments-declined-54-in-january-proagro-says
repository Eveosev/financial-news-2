Ukraine’s grain exports declined
about 54 percent in the first 25 days of January to 780,760
metric tons, ProAgro said, citing preliminary ports information.  That compared with 1.68 million tons a month earlier, the
Kiev-based agricultural researcher said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Corn shipments declined to 588,440 tons in January compared
with 1.24 million tons in December, according to the statement.
Wheat exports fell to 120,900 tons from 393,360 tons a month
earlier.  The country’s wheat exports will probably decline in the
short term, ProAgro said, and may rebound in the medium term
should Russia start limiting grain shipments from April 1, the
researcher said. All market participants expect wheat prices to
rise in the near future, according to the statement.  Sunflower oil exports in the period rose to 195,500 tons,
ProAgro said. Rapeseed exports declined about 21 percent to
41,500 tons.  Rapeseed exports for the marketing year that started July 1
are estimated at 1.3 million tons and the country will probably
be able to export the oilseed for another three months, the
researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
