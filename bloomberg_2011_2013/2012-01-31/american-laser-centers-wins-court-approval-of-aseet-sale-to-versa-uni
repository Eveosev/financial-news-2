American Laser Centers LLC, a
provider of hair-removal, cellulite-reduction and skincare
services at 156 clinics in 27 U.S. states, won court approval to
sell virtually all its assets to an affiliate of Versa Capital
Management.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath approved the sale at
a hearing today in Wilmington,  Delaware , court records show.  Versa, a Philadelphia-based private-equity firm, will buy
the company through affiliate Bellus ALC Investments 1 LLC,
which provided American Laser with $59.8 million in financing to
help support operations during bankruptcy, according to court
documents.  To buy the assets, Bellus will use about $30 million in
debt forgiveness and the new capital left over from the
bankruptcy financing after paying off lenders owed about
$40.3 million.  The closely held company, based in Farmington Hills,
 Michigan , listed assets of $80.4 million and unsecured debt of
$105 million in court papers filed last month in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Wilmington.  Chief Financial Officer Andrew Orr blamed the bankruptcy on
the slumping economy, saying in court papers that it “had a
severe negative impact on the overall demand for aesthetic
procedures.”  The case is In re ALC Holdings LLC, 11-13853, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
