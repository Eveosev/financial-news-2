National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) 
posted a 1 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit, missing
analyst estimates, as expenses rose and the lender set aside
more money to cover bad loans. It raised dividend payouts.  Net income dropped to 724 million dirhams ($197 million)
from 732 million dirhams a year ago, the  United Arab Emirates ’
second-biggest bank said in an e-mailed  statement  today. The
 median estimate  of three analysts was for a profit of 897
million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank was hurt “by the Arab Spring, low  interest rates 
and the Euro crisis,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Tomalin
said. “Net earnings have remained steady” despite higher
provisions for loan losses, he said.  U.A.E. banks are recovering from the global credit crisis,
which slowed lending, hurt investment banking and led to rising
loan defaults.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , a lender controlled by  Abu
Dhabi ’s ruling family, reported an 18 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit, beating analysts’ estimates.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi’s operating expenses rose 20
percent to 758 million dirhams, it said. Net impairment charges
increased 14 percent to 482 million dirhams, taking the
proportion of bad loans to gross lending to 2.94 percent from
2.31 percent in 2010.  The shares  have fallen 2.3 percent this year compared with
a 2.3 percent increase in Abu Dhabi’s  ADX Banks Index. (ADBF)  The stock
was suspended from trading today.  The board proposed a cash  dividend  of 30 fils a share and
30 free shares for every 100 held. National Bank of Abu Dhabi
paid a cash dividend of 25 fils a share and 20 free shares for
every 100 held in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
