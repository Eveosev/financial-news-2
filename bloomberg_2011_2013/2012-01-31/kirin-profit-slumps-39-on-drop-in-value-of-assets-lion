     Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) ’s annual profit
dropped 39 percent on a preliminary basis as the value of its
Sydney-based Lion unit and investments declined.  Net income  fell to 7 billion yen ($92 million) in 2011 from
11.4 billion yen the previous year, the Tokyo-based company
reported today in a preliminary earnings statement. The brewer,
 Japan ’s second-largest by volume, had forecast 2011 profit of 27
billion yen.  Kirin’s earnings fell for a second year after it bought
Lion in 2009 in a deal that valued  Australia ’s second-biggest
brewer at about A$8.2 billion ($7.5 billion at the time),
including debt. Industrywide beer sales in Japan fell 3.7
percent to 442 million cases last year, the lowest level since
records began in 1992.  “There are still concerns that sales at the company’s
Australia business may decline,” said  Hiroshi Saji , an analyst
at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo with a “neutral” rating on
Kirin shares. “We still can’t say Kirin has bottomed out.”  The maker of Ichiban-Shibori beer fell 2 percent to 933 yen
at 1:18 p.m. in Tokyo, compared with the 0.2 percent gain in
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Index. The beverage maker is
scheduled to brief the press in Tokyo at 4:30 p.m. today.  Kirin booked 6.6 billion yen of charges for impairment of
fixed assets for Lion and 2.2 billion yen for its Chinese
subsidiary Kirin Brewery (Zhuhai) Co., Hajime Kawasaki, a
spokesman for the Japanese company, said by phone today.  The brewer left its planned 2011 year-end dividend
unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
