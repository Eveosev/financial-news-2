Musician Neil Young said he worked
with  Steve Jobs  on a high-fidelity music service before  Apple (AAPL) 
Inc. shelved the project.  While chief executive officer of Apple, Jobs sought to
offer uncompressed music digitally, Young said today at an
AllThingsD.com media conference in Dana Point,  California . Apple
“pretty much” has stopped working on the project, said Young,
a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who is known for the
songs “Harvest Moon” and “Heart of Gold.”  Digital music purchased through Apple’s iTunes or other
online retailers contain a fraction of the original recording
quality, Young, 66, said. Full versions of songs, which take
about 30 minutes each to download, could be sent to devices with
larger storage overnight, he said.  “The convenience of the digital age has forced people to
choose between quality and convenience,” Young said. “They
shouldn’t have to make that choice.”  Tom Neumayr , a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment.
The Cupertino, California-based company has released a limited
number of albums with higher-quality audio, including recordings
by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Wilco.  Jobs, who died Oct. 5, listened to records even though he
pioneered the sale of digital music, Young said.  Apple gained 0.6 percent to $455.75 at 2:54 p.m. in New
York trading. The  stock  climbed 26 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
