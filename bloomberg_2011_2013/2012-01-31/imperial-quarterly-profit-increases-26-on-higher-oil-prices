Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
company that’s 70 percent-owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , said
fourth-quarter net income increased 26 percent, as rising  oil
prices  offset a decline in production.  Net income rose to C$1 billion ($1 billion), or C$1.18 per
share, from C$799 million, or 94 cents, a year earlier, the
Calgary-based company said in a statement on CNS Newswire today.
Per-share profit was 30 Canadian cents more than the average of
three analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Average output fell 3.6 percent to the equivalent of
291,000 barrels of oil a day from 302,000 barrels a year
earlier. Scheduled maintenance reduced production at Syncrude
Canada Ltd., in which Imperial owns a 25 percent stake.  Oil gained 10 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
during the quarter, averaging $94.06 a barrel compared with
$85.24 a year earlier. The company sold oil for an average of
$89.06 a barrel during the quarter.  Sales rose 17 percent to $8.12 billion.  The company reported that it processed an average of
433,000 barrels a day in its refineries, a 7.3 percent drop from
the same period a year earlier. Imperial’s refineries ran at 85
percent of capacity in the fourth quarter, down from 93 percent.  Imperial expects its Kearl oil-sands project to begin
operating in late 2012. The project is expected to have initial
capacity to produce 110,000 barrels a day, rising to 345,000
barrels by the end of this decade, according to the company’s
website.  Imperial  rose  2 percent to C$47.78 at the close in Toronto.
The stock, which has gained 5.3 percent this year, has three
buy, 10 hold and three sell ratings from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
