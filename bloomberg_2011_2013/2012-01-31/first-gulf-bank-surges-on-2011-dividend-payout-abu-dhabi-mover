First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  led Abu Dhabi’s
stock index to the highest level in more than a month after the
United Arab Emirates lender said it would distribute a 2011
dividend that exceeded expectations.  The shares soared 9.9 percent, the most since December
2009, to 17.15 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi. The
bank, controlled by the emirate’s ruling family, recommended a
 cash dividend  of 1 dirham a share and a free stock for every one
held. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 1.3 percent to 2,453.98, the
highest since Dec. 12.  Union National Bank PJSC (UNB) , a state-
controlled lender, had the  third-biggest gain  on the gauge,
rising 1.7 percent.  “Retail investors are considering the positive news of the
dividend payout as more important than net income,” said
Sebastien Henin, who helps oversee $100 million at The National
Investor in  Abu Dhabi . “The news will encourage investors to
buy shares now, especially as valuations are attractive.”  Banks in the U.A.E., the second-largest Arab economy, are
starting to recover from a slowdown in credit growth after the
2008 financial crisis triggered a slump in real estate prices,
slowed tourism and investment banking revenue plunged. First
Gulf yesterday said that fourth quarter profit rose  18 percent  
to 1.02 billion dirhams ($278 million). The  median estimate  of
three analysts was for net income of 865 million dirhams,
according to Bloomberg data.  First Gulf trades at 6.5 times estimated earnings. That
compares with 7.9 times for  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , the
U.A.E.’s third-largest lender. First Gulf shares advanced 11
percent this month, compared with a 2.4 percent gain in the  ADX
Banks Index. (ADBF)  The index rose 2.3 percent today to the highest
level since Sept. 14.  Seventeen analysts  recommend investors “buy” the bank’s
shares, while none have a “sell” rating, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
