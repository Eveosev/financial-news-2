Singapore’s  unemployment rate  held
near a three-year low last quarter after companies in the
services and construction industries added jobs in 2011.  The seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate  was 2 percent in
the three months through December, the  Ministry of Manpower  said
in a statement today, citing preliminary data. That compares
with the 2.1 percent median estimate of nine economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The economy added 36,300 jobs last quarter,
compared with 31,900 reported earlier for the third quarter.  The government has cut taxes in recent years to encourage
companies to set up operations or expand in the Southeast Asian
nation as it faces competition from neighbors including
Indonesia and  Malaysia  in attracting investment.  Singapore ’s
economy shrank for the second time in three quarters in the
three months ended December as manufacturing eased, increasing
pressure on policy makers to spur growth.  “Singapore is one of the most vulnerable economies in  Asia 
to the deterioration in world trade,” Sukhy Ubhi, an economist
at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London , said before the report.
“We expect global trade and growth to continue to disappoint,
which suggests that the unemployment rate will rise further in
coming quarters.”  The services industry added 95,100 jobs last year, while
manufacturing companies increased payrolls by 2,900, the report
showed.  Construction (SGDPCSTY)  employment rose 22,200. The jobless rate 
averaged 2 percent in 2011, a 14-year low.   Singapore said it aims to attract as much as S$15 billion
($11.9 billion) of investments in manufacturing and services
this year to boost economic growth and spur employment. The
S$13.7 billion of projects that were committed in 2011 will
create about 20,300 skilled jobs, while the investment that
comes in this year should help generate 18,000 to 21,000 jobs,
the  Economic Development Board  said Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
