     Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) --The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1 basis point to 187 as of 8:35
a.m. in  Hong Kong , BNP Paribas SA prices show. The measure is
set for its third straight daily increase, up from a three-month
low of 180.4 marked on Jan. 26, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 2 basis points to 165 as
of 9:32 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge
fell 12.9 basis points last week, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was up 2 basis points at
162 as of 11:38 in Sydney, BNP prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
