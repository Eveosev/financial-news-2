Consumer confidence  unexpectedly
dropped in January and a gauge of business activity fell,
underscoring forecasts that the  U.S. economy  will cool after
expanding at the fastest pace since the second quarter 2010.  The New York-based Conference Board’s  confidence  index
decreased to 61.1, lower than the most pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists, from a revised 64.8 reading
the prior month. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc. said its  business barometer  declined to 60.2 from 62.2 in
December. Readings above 50 signal growth.  Employers aren’t hiring fast enough to drive bigger gains
in wages and consumer spending, while higher gasoline prices are
cutting into household budgets. Another report today showed  home
prices  fell more than forecast in November, eroding the wealth
of families as they seek to rebuild savings.  “This quarter will be a bit slower,” said  Stuart Hoffman ,
chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in
Pittsburgh, who had the lowest sentiment estimate. “Consumer
confidence appears to have leveled off, as job growth isn’t
quite as good and gasoline prices have moved back up.”  Stocks fell for a fourth day and Treasuries gained. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined less than 0.1 percent to
1,312.41 at the close in  New York . The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note fell to 1.8 percent from 1.85 percent late
yesterday.  German Unemployment  In  Europe  today, German unemployment dropped more than
economists forecast to a two-decade low in January, bolstering
growth in the continent’s largest economy.  The number of people out of work fell a seasonally adjusted
34,000 to 2.85 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency
said today. Economists predicted a decline of 10,000, the median
of 32 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey showed. In December,
 Italy ’s jobless rate rose to the highest since 2004, while in
the euro area it stayed at a 14-year high of 10.4 percent.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S.
cities  declined  3.7 percent from November 2010 after decreasing
3.4 percent in the year ended in October, the group said today
in New York. Economists projected a 3.3 percent drop, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The consumer confidence figure was projected to rise to 68,
according the median forecast of 74 economists surveyed. The
measure averaged 53.7 during the recession that ended in June
2009.  Jobs Hard to Get  The share of consumers who said jobs are currently
plentiful fell to 6.1 percent from 6.6 percent. Those who said
jobs are hard to get increased to 43.5 percent, the highest in
three months, from 41.6 percent.  The proportion expecting incomes to rise over the next six
months dropped to 13.8 percent from 16.3 percent. Still, the
percent of respondents expecting more jobs to become available
in the next six months increased to 16.2 from 14 the previous
month.  Employers added 145,000 jobs in January after payrolls rose
by 200,000 in December, according to the median estimate in the
Bloomberg survey before the Feb. 3 data from the Labor
Department.  “Unemployment has remained stubbornly high,” Sandra Cochran, chief executive officer of Cracker Barrel Old Country
Store Inc., said at a Jan. 11 conference. “Consumer sentiment
remains weak, and this has focused the industry on price and
prompted many of our competitors to remain very focused on
discounting.”  Rebuilding Savings  Consumers are limiting their purchases as they rebuild
savings. The economy expanded 2.8 percent in the final three
months of 2011, compared with economists’ 3 percent median
forecast, according to Commerce Department data released on Jan.
27. Household purchases rose 2 percent.  Gross domestic product will expand at a 2 percent annual
rate this quarter, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists taken from Jan. 6 to Jan. 11.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  last week said its
benchmark  interest rate  will remain low at least through the end
of 2014.  “The Committee expects economic growth over coming
quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the
 unemployment rate  will decline only gradually,” it said in a
statement.  Today’s report is at odds with other figures. The Bloomberg
 Consumer Comfort (COMFCOMF)  Index steadied at minus 46.4 in the week ended
Jan. 22 after minus 47.4 the prior week. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment
jumped in January to the highest level in almost a year.  Slowing Orders  The decline in the Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago’s business barometer was led by slowing orders and
employment. Three consecutive readings exceeding 60 are still
the strongest since early 2011, signaling manufacturing remains
a mainstay of the expansion.  The Chicago group’s employment measure fell to 54.7, the
lowest level since August, from 59.2 the prior month. The
production gauge decreased to 63.8 from 64.9, and the index of
new orders declined to 63.6 from 67.1.  The measure of prices paid dropped to 62.4 from 63.8 and a
gauge of inventories decreased to 51.6 from 52.  Manufacturing payrolls  increased by 13,000 in January
following a 23,000 gain the prior month, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the Labor Department will say Feb. 3 in its
monthly payroll report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
