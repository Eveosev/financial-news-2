Egyptian “protesters” are holding
25 Chinese citizens working in a cement factory belonging to the
armed forces in central Sinai in a bid to pressure local
authorities to release a number of prisoners, the state-run Nile
News reported on its website.  The hostages won’t be released until demands are met that
include freeing five prisoners convicted in relation to bombings
in Sharm el Sheikh and Taba, as well as Egypt halting gas
exports to  Israel , Nile News said, citing an unidentified
“protester.” The gas-export pipeline in the Sinai has been
repeatedly attacked since the uprising last year that ousted
former President  Hosni Mubarak .  The 24 workers and a translator were abducted from a bus
traveling to the factory in Arish at about 11:40 a.m. local time
yesterday, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Ma Jianchun, the
commercial affairs counselor at  China ’s embassy in Cairo, who
said he was on his way to Arish.  Egyptian security forces on the scene are in talks with
local tribal leaders, China’s official news service said.
Chinese Ambassador Song Aiguo spoke to Egyptian interior and
defense ministry officials about the incident, Xinhua reported.  In a separate incident in neighboring  Sudan , 29 Chinese
workers are being held by Sudanese rebels following an attack on
their camp in the oil-rich state of Southern Kordofan. Fighting
in the area has intensified since  South Sudan  seceded in July
from its northern neighbor.  Two calls to the Chinese Foreign Ministry went unanswered
after regular office hours yesterday evening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
