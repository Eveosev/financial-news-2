Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (200) , the
casino venture between Lawrence Ho and Australian billionaire
 James Packer , dropped the most in two weeks, leading gambling
stock declines in  Hong Kong  trading.  Melco Crown lost 3.9 percent to HK$28.60 at the close, the
lowest level since Jan. 9. Rivals  Wynn (WYNN)  Macau Ltd., a unit of
Las-Vegas based Wynn Resorts Ltd., sank 4 percent to HK$19.88.  “Melco Crown is losing market share to competitors; its
market share in January is expected to drop by up to 2
percentage points on a monthly basis which may explain why it is
leading the decline,” said Victor Yip, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. Lawrence Ho is the son of Macau
casino billionaire  Stanley Ho .  Total gaming revenue for all Macau casino operators in
January may be less robust than earlier estimates of as much as
28 billion patacas ($3.5 billion), Yip said. Melco Crown’s
market share may drop to 12 percent in January from 14 percent
in December, he said.  “Through our various channel checks, the revenue is
expected to reach roughly 24 billion patacas,” Yip said.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , a unit of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , said on
Jan. 30 that visitors to its Macau casinos rose by 5 percent to
6 percent to more than 1 million during the Lunar New Year that
took place between Jan. 23 and Jan. 29.  Sands China shares  dipped  2.2 percent to HK$26.25. The
stock has jumped 19.6 percent this year, outperforming the 10.6
percent gain in the Hong Kong benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Galaxy Entertainment Group (27) , the company controlled by Hong
Kong tycoon Lui Che-Woo, dropped 0.8 percent to HK$16.92.  To contact the reporter on this story:
