SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  fell the most in
more than two weeks after China’s largest domestic carmaker said
profit growth declined last year as the market slowed.  SAIC’s Shanghai-listed shares  fell  as much as 3.4 percent
to 14.95 yuan, the biggest drop since Jan. 13, and traded at
15.12 yuan at the 11:30 a.m. break. The benchmark  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent.  Net income in 2011 rose by more than 40 percent after more
than doubling the year before, SAIC said yesterday. Reported
profit will include earnings from Huayu Automotive Systems Co.,
an acquisition announced last April, said Han Weiqi, an analyst
with CSC International Holdings Ltd. in  Shanghai . The forecast
means profit from existing operations grew by 15 percent to 20
percent, short of Han’s 25 percent estimate, he said.  “ China ’s car market will not see the same exponential
growth we saw in the past few years, and investors are also
selling such stocks to move into more high-growth sectors,” Han
said by telephone.  The Shanghai-based carmaker said April 6 it would pay 28.6
billion yuan to buy assets including 60 percent of Huayu from
its parent. Growth in China’s vehicle deliveries slowed to 2.5
percent in 2011, down from a 32 percent pace in 2010, after
China withdrew a two-year package of tax breaks and rebates that
had helped the country overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest
auto market in 2009.  Last year’s sales rose by 12 percent, SAIC said.  --Liza Lin. Editors: Nate Espino,  John Liu   To contact the reporter on this story:
