Mexico ’s peso completed its best
month in almost three years as the outlook for near-zero
 interest rates  to persist in the U.S. boosted demand for the
Latin American country’s higher-yielding assets.  The peso strengthened 6.8 percent in January, its biggest
monthly increase since March 2009. The currency fell 0.5 percent
today to 13.0456 per U.S. dollar at the close in Mexico City,
from 12.9776 yesterday.  The currency has rallied this month as investors buy
securities from Mexico, which kept its overnight rate at 4.5
percent this month while the  Federal Reserve  pledged to maintain
near-zero rates through at least late 2014. Concern over how
Europe’s debt crisis would affect demand for Mexican exports
helped make the peso  Latin America ’s worst-performer in 2011.  “The rhythm of the depreciation was very strong at the end
of the year and the peso is simply, for one, catching up,”
 Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Banco Base SA in Monterrey,
Mexico, said by phone. The peso has surged as investor
confidence grows that Mexico “fundamentally is in good shape
and the U.S. is growing as well,” he said.  The world’s biggest economy may expand 2.3 percent this
year from 1.7 percent in 2011, according to the median estimate
of 72 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Mexico sends about 80
percent of its exports to the U.S.  Mexico’s economy probably grew 3.7 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier and 4 percent in 2011, the  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.18
percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price of the securities rose 0.08 centavo to 133.82 centavos per
peso.  Editors: Glenn J. Kalinoski, Jonathan Roeder  To contact the reporter on this story:
