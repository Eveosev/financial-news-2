third-biggest lender by market value, rose 5 percent, its
biggest daily rise since Dec. 21, to 9.95 naira, extending its
gain this month to 12 percent, the most since October 2010, as
investors speculated on a “good dividend” payment, PAC
Securities Ltd. said.  “From the bank’s third-quarter result, we believe it will
give a good dividend, at least better than the 60 kobo per share
it paid last year,” Eugene Ezenwa, chief operating officer of
Lagos-base PAC, said by phone today.  Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc  (JAPAULOI NL), a
Nigerian oil-services company, rose 2.5 percent to 81 kobo. Oil
headed for the third monthly gain since September after  Greece ’s
prime minister said debt-swap talks have made progress, easing
concern that Europe’s sovereign debt turmoil will curb demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
