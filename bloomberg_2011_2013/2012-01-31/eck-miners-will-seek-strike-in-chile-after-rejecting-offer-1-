Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  copper miners at
the Quebrada Blanca project in northern  Chile  plan to approve a
strike today after rejecting a final wage offer, union official
Jorge Flores said.  The strike will likely begin on Feb. 6 because the
Vancouver-based company may seek to extend talks beyond Jan. 31,
when the workers’ contract expires, Flores said by telephone
today. The miners will complete voting on whether to go on
strike later today, he said.  Global copper supply was disrupted last year by a series of
strikes in Chile, Indonesia and  Peru . Teck produced 86,200
metric tons of the metal at Quebrada Blanca in 2010, about 1.6
percent of Chile’s total output. The South American country
produces about a third of the world’s copper.  In negotiations at its Andacollo copper mine, Teck used a
Chilean law that allows mining companies to extend the
negotiating period beyond the contract expiration date to reach
an agreement with workers on Jan. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
