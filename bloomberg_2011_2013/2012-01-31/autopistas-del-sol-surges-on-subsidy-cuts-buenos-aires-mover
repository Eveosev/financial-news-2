Argentine highway operator 
Autopistas del Sol SA , which defaulted on about $357 million of
bonds in 2009, rose the most in almost three weeks after the
government announced a cut in subsidies to long-distance buses.  The stock advanced 3 percent to 1.03 pesos at 1:20 p.m. in
 Buenos Aires . That was the biggest jump on a closing basis since
Jan. 12, when it gained 4.2 percent. The benchmark  Merval (MERVAL)  index
dropped 0.4 percent.  Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
yesterday announced in the official gazette the elimination of
toll subsidies for long-distance bus companies starting Feb. 1.
The move means Autopistas will no longer have to recover the
fees from the government, said Leopoldo Olivari, an analyst at
Bacque Sociedad de Bolsa brokerage in Buenos Aires.  “Making the company less dependent on the government’s
subsidies eliminates any discretionary activity in the
business,” Olivari said. “The elimination of subsidies
provides more transparency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
