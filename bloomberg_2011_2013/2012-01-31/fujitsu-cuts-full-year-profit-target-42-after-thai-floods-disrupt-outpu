Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) , Japan’s largest
computer services provider, cut its profit forecast 42 percent
as floods in Thailand disrupted output of computer components.  Net income may be 35 billion yen ($459 million) for the
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with an earlier estimate
of 60 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement
today. The average of 17 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg
was for about 54 billion yen.  The digital device maker’s weakened outlook comes after
Tokyo-based rival  NEC Corp. (6701)  said last week it will cut 10,000
jobs after slower global growth cut demand for products
including computers and wireless gear. Fujitsu President Masami Yamamoto said last month that the company may miss its target to
sell 6.6 million personal computers this fiscal year after
floods in  Thailand  delayed supplies of hard-disk drives.  Fujitsu also trimmed its sales estimate about 1 percent to
4.49 trillion yen from 4.54 trillion yen. Operating profit will
be about 100 billion yen, compared with the previous forecast
for 135 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
