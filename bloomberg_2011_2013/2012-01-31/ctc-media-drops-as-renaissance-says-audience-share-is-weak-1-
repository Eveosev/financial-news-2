CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , the owner of
Russia’s fourth-largest television channel, fell in New York
trading after  Renaissance Capital  said that its audience share
had slipped from a year ago.  The stock  declined for a second day, losing 0.5 percent to
$10.02 in New York and paring its 14 percent advance in January.
The company was the second-biggest decliner on the  Bloomberg
Russia-US 14 Index  of Russian companies traded in New York
today.  “The CTC channel’s four-week average audience share of 7.6
percent remains materially below the 8 percent delivered during
the same period in 2011,” David Ferguson and Anastasia Demidova, analysts at Moscow-based brokerage Renaissance, wrote
in a report e-mailed today. “CTC’s audience share trends remain
relatively weak.”  The average daily share of viewers for CTC’s television
channel, the company’s biggest source of advertising revenue,
was 7.7 percent in the week to Jan. 22, according to data from
 TNS Gallup Media .  To contact the reporter on this story:
