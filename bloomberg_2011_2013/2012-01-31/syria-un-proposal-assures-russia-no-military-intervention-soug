The latest draft of a Western-backed
 Arab League  resolution on Syria seeks to assure Russia that
military intervention isn’t planned to force out President
Bashar al-Assad.  “Nothing in this resolution compels states to resort to
the use of force or the threat of force,” says the draft, which
was obtained today. Supporters of the proposal, who include U.S.
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , will argue for the
resolution before the  United Nations Security Council  later
today.  The resolution, based on an Arab League plan backed by the
U.S. and the European Union, calls for Assad to hand power to
his deputy in the effort to end violence. The draft expresses
“its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity
and territorial integrity of  Syria , emphasizing the need to
resolve the current crisis in Syria peacefully.”  In another move to assure the Russians, who have backed
Assad and been critical of violence against his security forces,
the draft “condemns all violence, irrespective of where it
comes from, and in this regard demands that all parties in
Syria, including armed groups, immediately stop all violence or
reprisals, including attacks against state institutions.”  Given that the Arab League has suspended its observers’
mission in Syria, the draft says it regrets that the escalation
in violence meant the mission “was not in a position to monitor
the full implementation” of the League’s plan.  -- Editors: Larry Liebert, Leslie Hoffecker  To contact the reporters on this story:
