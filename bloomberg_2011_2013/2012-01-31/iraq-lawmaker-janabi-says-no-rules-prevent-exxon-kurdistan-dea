Iraq ’s legislation doesn’t prevent
 oil companies  from signing deals with the central government and
with semi-autonomous authorities in the North, as in the case of
Exxon Mobil Corp., said Adnan al-Janabi, chairman of the
nation’s Oil and Energy Committee.  The country’s new energy law has been under study for about
five years amid divisions among the country’s major political
factions. Al-Janabi said yesterday he expected a first reading
of the law in Iraq’s parliament next month.  “With or without the law, I don’t think there is anything
to constrain any company from operating anywhere in Iraq,”
Janabi told reporters in London today. “I don’t see any
legality in announcing anyone as being blacklisted.”  The Baghdad government has refused to recognize production-
sharing agreements signed by Kurdish regional authorities with
foreign companies without its approval. Hussain al-Shahristani,
deputy prime minister for energy affairs, said last month the
Iraqi government was “weighing measures” that may be taken
against Exxon after it signed contracts the government considers
illegal with authorities in the Kurdish region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
