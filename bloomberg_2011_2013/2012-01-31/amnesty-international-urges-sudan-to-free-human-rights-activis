Amnesty International  urged  Sudan  to
free a human rights activist detained without charge since his
June arrest in the oil-rich state of Southern Kordofan where
government forces are battling rebels.  Bushra Gamar Hussein Rahma, an X-ray technician who founded
the Human Rights and Development Organization in Southern
Kordofan state, suffers from  heart disease  and a prolapsed disc
that he developed while in Kober prison in Khartoum, the
capital, London-based Amnesty said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services re-
arrested Rahma after a judge ordered his release on Aug. 25,
Amnesty said. The Sudanese authorities haven’t allowed him
access to a lawyer “on the grounds that investigations against
him have not been concluded,” it said.  Rahma, an ethnic Nuban, has been on hunger strike twice
since September to protest his continued detention, Amnesty
said. President Umar al-Bashir’s government has been trying to
disarm fighters in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states who
fought during a two-decade civil war with the forces of  South
Sudan , which gained independence on July 9.  Sudan’s human rights record deteriorated last year with the
eruption of new armed conflicts and crackdowns on students,
rights advocates and the media, New York-based  Human Rights
Watch  said on Jan 22. At least 73 students were arrested last
month during a sit-in at Khartoum University to protest police
violence and to demand the overthrow of the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
