OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, rallied, capping its biggest monthly gain in almost two
years, after European Union leaders completed a treaty on fiscal
discipline which Hungary also accepted.  The shares jumped as much as 4 percent, before closing 0.3
percent higher at 4,013 forint by the end of trading in
Budapest, for a 25 percent gain in January, the most since March
2010.  Hungary, the EU’s most indebted eastern member, will
support a fiscal compact after modifications were made to the
text, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  told reporters in Brussels
late yesterday. The backing of the Hungarian premier, who had
previously said that Parliament would have to make the final
decision on the accord, means only Britain and the  Czech
Republic  boycotted the plan.  OTP has rallied this month as investors became more
optimistic Hungary will obtain aid from the  International
Monetary Fund  and the EU. The stock has jumped 35 percent since
Orban said on Jan. 5 he was ready to discuss conditions for a
“quick” deal on the bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
