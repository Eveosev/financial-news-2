Carlyle Group LP is selling 20
million shares in  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , valued at
about 14 billion rupees ($283 million), according to three
people with knowledge of the matter.  Enough orders have been submitted to cover the shares being
offered, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
as the details are confidential. Deutsche Bank AG is handling
the sale, said the people.  Carlyle, which invested in HDFC in 2007, will hold a less
than 4 percent stake in the mortgage lender after this sale, the
people said. HDFC shares closed at 697.85 rupees today, up 1.4
percent.  A spokesman for Carlyle didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
