A mission to Greece by the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund  wants the country’s minimum wage cut to 600 euros
($791) a month, from 751 euros, Ta Nea reported, without saying
how it got the information.  The delegation from the three institutions, known as the
troika, is setting conditions for a new financing package for
Greece that include reforms such as abolition of special labor
agreements at state enterprises and banks, the Athens-based
newspaper said.  The troika officials rejected a proposal from Greece’s
Labor Ministry to freeze private-sector salaries for three years
and is demanding that twice-yearly holiday bonus payments are
reduced or abolished, Ta Nea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
