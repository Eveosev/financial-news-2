Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest lender by market value, rose the most in almost
two weeks on speculation its fourth-quarter earnings increased.  The stock advanced as much as 1.2 percent, the most since
Jan. 18, to 12.50 shillings. It was unchanged at 12.35 shillings
by the close in Nairobi.  “There are some recoveries of loans that the bank has made
which could improve its earnings, we project earnings per share
of at least 1.55 shillings compared to 1.12 shillings” in the
previous quarter,” Vimal Parmar, head of research at Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  Barclays’ nine-month profit through to September climbed 11
percent as operating costs dropped. Net income climbed to 6.11
billion shillings ($72.7 million) in the period through
September from 5.49 billion shillings a year earlier, the
Nairobi-based lender said in November. Operating expenses fell
16 percent to 10.7 billion shillings, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
