Gasoline gained on concerns that
reduced refining capacity will limit supplies as the summer
demand season approaches.  Futures rose as much as 1.3 percent after  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
shut a fluid catalytic cracker at its Bayway refinery in  New
Jersey  for repairs over the weekend. Hess Corp. may also shut a
catalytic cracker at the Port Reading refinery for about three
weeks and is assessing repairs to the unit, the company said
Jan. 25.  “There are concerns on what’s going to happen with all
these refineries shutting down as we get closer to the summer
driving season,” said Gene McGillian, an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “It’s making the
market nervous about supplies going forward.”  Gasoline for February delivery rose 2.78 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.8985 a gallon at 9:52 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  February-delivery heating oil rose 4.51 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.0969 a gallon. Prices touched $3.104, the highest
intraday level since Jan. 12.  The unplanned outage at Bayway followed Hovensa LLC’s plans
to shut its 350,000-barrel-a-day St. Croix plant in the  U.S.
Virgin Islands  next month. Two unprofitable Pennsylvania
refineries have already been closed.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.4
cents to $3.443 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices were 11
percent higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
