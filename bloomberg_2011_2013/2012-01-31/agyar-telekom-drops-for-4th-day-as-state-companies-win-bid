Magyar Telekom Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s
former phone monopoly controlled by  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,
declined for a fourth day after a state-owned consortium won the
right to compete in the mobile market.  The shares fell as much as 2.4 percent and traded 0.9
percent lower at 535 forint by the close in Budapest, paring the
monthly advance to 3.1 percent.  Hungary’s media and telecommunications authority today
awarded the group formed by postal service Magyar Posta Zrt.,
power company Magyar Villamos Muvek Zrt. and development bank
Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank Zrt. a frequency block allowing the
development of a mobile Internet network.  The state consortium will become the country’s fourth
mobile service provider besides Magyar Telekom and the units of
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and Telenor ASA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
