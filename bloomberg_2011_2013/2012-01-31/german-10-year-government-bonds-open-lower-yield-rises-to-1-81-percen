Italy’s bonds led gains by the
securities of  Europe ’s most-indebted nations after European
Union leaders signed a fiscal-discipline treaty, fueling
optimism a solution to the debt crisis is getting nearer.  German 10-year bund yields climbed from the lowest in
almost two weeks after Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said
he was committed to concluding debt-swap talks with the nation’s
creditors, reducing demand for safer securities. Portuguese 10-
year yields dropped more than a percentage point after surging
to a euro-era record yesterday.  Belgium ’s  two-year notes  rose
even as the country’s borrowing costs climbed at a bill sale.  “The deal that they did on the fiscal rules was good and
that is supporting risk sentiment today,” said Niels From,
chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “What’s been
decided won’t help with the current crisis, but will prevent
future crises, so it might have a positive short-term impact.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 5.97 percent at 4:18 p.m.  London  time. The
5 percent bond due March 2022 gained 0.805, or 8.05 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,315) face amount, to 93.29.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of their German counterparts shrank 12 basis points to
4.18 percentage points. The spread has contracted from a record
5.75 percentage points on Nov. 9.  Spanish 10-year yields dropped six basis points to 4.98
percent, narrowing the spread over German bunds by six basis
points to 3.19 percentage points.  ‘Strongly Committed’  EU leaders signed off on key measures of the strategy to
end the financial crisis at a summit in Brussels late yesterday.
They agreed to accelerate the setup of a permanent 500 billion-
euro rescue fund and endorsed a German-inspired deficit-control
treaty. Papademos told reporters after the meeting he is
“strongly committed” to reaching an agreement with creditors.  German 10-year bonds dropped for the first time in five
days, with yields rising one basis point to 1.80 percent. They
are little changed this month.  Spanish bonds advanced before the government holds a note
auction on Feb. 2. The country will sell debt maturing in July
2015, October 2016 and January 2017.  “Markets are already focusing on the Spanish auctions on
Thursday,” said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-rate
strategy at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “The hurdle for
 Spain  is relatively high, but the domestic banks are eager to
buy the paper.”  Portuguese Bonds  Portugal (GSPT10YR) ’s 10-year yield dropped 117 basis points to 16.23
percent, after climbing to 18.29 percent, the highest in the
euro era. The price rose 2.69 to 42.58 percent of face value.  The nation’s bonds tumbled yesterday amid speculation
investors will have to take losses on their holdings in the
event of a Greek debt deal.  Volatility on Portuguese sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by France and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year spreads
and credit-default swaps.  Belgian notes declined after the nation sold 2.58 billion
euros of bills, less than the 3 billion euros it had planned.  The treasury auctioned 1.64 billion euros of three-month
bills at a weighted average yield of 0.506 percent, versus 0.429
percent in the most recent sale two weeks ago. Demand rose to
2.7 times the amount issued, from 2.24 times on Jan. 17.  Belgian  two-year yields  fell four basis points to 1.51
after dropping to 1.48 percent, the lowest since November 2010.  Monthly Return  Italian bonds have returned 4.9 percent this month, after
dropping 5.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese bonds slid 16 percent in January, while
Greek securities declined 1.4 percent.  Demand for Spanish and Italian bonds has been bolstered
after the  European Central Bank  said on Dec. 8 it would offer
unlimited three-year cash to the region’s financial institutions
to stimulate lending. Spain’s  two-year yields  have dropped more
than 2 percentage points since then amid speculation banks are
buying the securities to use as collateral with the ECB.  Banks may ask for as much as twice the 489 billion euros
the central bank supplied last month at the next refinancing
operation in February, the Financial Times reported today,
citing some of area’s biggest lenders, without naming them.  Finnish bonds  underperformed  their German counterparts as
the country said it planned to sell new 15-year bonds. The extra
yield investors get for holding Finland’s 10-year debt instead
of bunds widened four basis points to 48 basis points.  The country’s 10-year yield increased four basis points to
2.27 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
