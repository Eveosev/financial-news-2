Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the largest exporter of
power-station coal, said production of the fuel from  Australia 
rose to a record last year after the Mangoola mine started and
the Newlands underground project boosted capacity.  Xstrata produced 49.8 million metric tons of thermal and
semi-soft coal in the country, a 12 percent gain on the previous
year, the Zug, Switzerland-based company said today in a
statement. Mined nickel volumes also climbed to a record, while
copper output dropped 2.7 percent.  “The fourth-quarter coal result repeated the strong
performance of the third quarter with particularly good
performance from the Australian thermal coal operations,”
Deutsche Bank AG analysts Rob Clifford, Grant Sporre and Gaetan
De Buyer said in a report.  Xstrata, seeking to increase total mining production by 50
percent through 2014 to benefit from growing Asian demand for
coal and metals, started output from the Mangoola mine in New
South  Wales  in February. It also expanded its Newlands operation
in Queensland. Australia is the largest coal exporter.  Xstrata’s worldwide thermal-coal production advanced to
72.4 million tons last year from 65.6 million tons, while output
of coking coal, used in steelmaking, held steady at 7.6 million
tons. Total volumes rose 6.8 percent to 85.3 million tons.  ‘Performance Catalysts’  The shares  declined 0.4 percent to 1,074.5 pence at the
close in London after rising as much as 2 percent.  The company last year approved seven projects with a total
investment of $2.6 billion, it said in the statement. Xstrata
has “a number of key projects to deliver that we believe offer
a number of share price performance catalysts through the
year,” the Deutsche Bank analysts said.  The start of Mangoola helped counter the effect of floods
at the beginning of the year in Queensland and New South Wales.
In  South Africa , thermal-coal output fell 3.4 percent because of
industrial action and a transition to open-cut mines from
underground operations, Xstrata said in the statement.  Mined copper output declined to 888,979 tons from 913,469
tons. Production of copper cathode, a finished form of the
metal, dropped 9 percent to 650,917 tons. Xstrata’s share of
production from the Collahuasi venture in  Chile  fell 10 percent
to 199,400 tons because of lower copper grades, maintenance and
adverse weather in the first and third quarters, it said.  Xstrata produced a record 105,925 tons of nickel, 15
percent more than the previous year. Ferrochrome output slipped
12 percent to 1.02 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
