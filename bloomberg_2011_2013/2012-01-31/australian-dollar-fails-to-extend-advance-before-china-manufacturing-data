The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose, reversing earlier declines, after manufacturing in
 China , Europe and the U.S. expanded, signaling the global
economy is recovering.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies gained, driving the
 New Zealand dollar  to a four-month high against its U.S.
counterpart, as stocks and commodities rose amid demand for
higher-yielding assets. The  purchasing managers’ index  for
Chinese manufacturing rose to 50.5 in January from 50.3 the
previous month, above the level of 50 that marks the division
between contraction and expansion.  “We reacted to the Chinese PMI,” said  Fabian Eliasson ,
head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in
New York. “It helps the commodity currencies. The risk
currencies are reacting positively on that news.”  Australia’s dollar rose 1.1 percent to $1.0735 at 11:54
a.m. in New York after earlier falling as much as 0.5 percent.
It reached $1.0740, the highest since Oct. 27. The Aussie gained
0.9 percent to 81.71 yen.  New Zealand ’s currency strengthened 1
percent to 83.48 U.S. cents and touched 83.53, the highest level
since Sept. 9. The so-called kiwi added 0.8 percent to 63.54
yen.  Europe’s Markit Economics said its manufacturing gauge
based on a survey of purchasing managers in the euro region rose
to 48.8 in January from 46.9 in December.  In the U.K., manufacturing returned to growth in January
after shrinking in the previous three months, a report showed.  U.S. manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace since June.
The Institute for Supply Management’s  manufacturing index  rose
to 54.1 in January from 53.1 in December, the group said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
