Corn prices that averaged $6 a
bushel last year are headed for a decline as production in the
U.S., the world’s top grower and exporter, catches up with
demand, according to congressional analysts.  The average cash price will fall to $4.54 in the 2013
marketing year beginning Sept. 1, then rise to $4.82 by 2022,
the analysts from the  Congressional Budget Office  said today in
a document used as part of a government-wide estimate of federal
spending during the next decade. Corn futures closed yesterday
at $6.3175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  U.S. net-farm income may have risen 28 percent to a record
$100.9 billion in 2011 as livestock sales expanded and exports
pushed crop prices higher, the Department of Agriculture
said in November. Trade that reached a record $137.4 billion in
the year ended Sept. 30 may fall to $132 billion this
year, the USDA said. Slowing growth will keep corn-ethanol
consumption at 5 billion bushels this year, unchanged from last
year and down from 5.021 billion in 2010, according to CBO data.  Slower growth in the use of corn for ethanol is “giving
trend corn production a chance to catch up and surpass demand
growth,” Keith Collins, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture
chief economist, said in an e-mail. Yield gains may not keep
pace with CBO predictions, and year-to-year variations in supply
and demand may be greater than forecast, Collin said.  Lower Wheat Prices  Wheat, soybean and cotton prices paid to farmers by 2022
will also be lower than last year, according to the nonpartisan
CBO. The report doesn’t estimate high or low prices for the
year, only averages.  Corn prices are expected to stay low even as total use
rises 14 percent to 15.198 billion bushels by 2022. The analysts
forecast production increasing 8.6 percent to 15.19 billion
bushels, as a 12 percent gain in yields absorbs a 42 percent
jump in exports to 2.63 billion bushels and an 8.5 percent gain
in ethanol use to 5.425 billion bushels by 2022.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at a $66.7 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion.  Soybean Forecast  Soybeans will average $11 a bushel this year, then fall to
$10.46 next year before rising to a new peak of $11.05 in 2022.
Planted acreage will range from 75.2 million to 77 million acres
over the next 10 years, the CBO analysts said.  The average wheat price is forecast to rise from $6.05 a
bushel this year to $6.14 in 2022, dropping to a low of $5.63
next year. Production, seen at 2.152 billion bushels this year,
will range between 2.06 billion bushels in 2014 to 2.173 billion
bushels in 2022, as yields rise 7.7 percent to 48.7 bushels per
acre over the next decade. Wheat is the fourth-most-valuable
U.S. crop, with a 2010 value of $13 billion, following hay.  Upland cotton prices are projected to fall to 70.06 cents a
pound in 2013 from 82.42 cents this year, then peak at 71.91
cents in 2019, according to the report. The USDA valued the 2010
cotton crop at $7.3 billion.  The estimates, which include forecasts for crops that
receive government subsidies, are separate from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s annual 10-year baseline forecast for
farm production and prices. That report, scheduled for release
next month, is used to formulate the White House budget
proposal.  Crop subsidies will peak at $9.87 billion in 2014,
according to the CBO document.  The average prices cited are based on marketing years. For
corn and soybeans, the year begins Sept. 1; wheat’s year starts
on June 1 and cotton’s begins on Aug. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
