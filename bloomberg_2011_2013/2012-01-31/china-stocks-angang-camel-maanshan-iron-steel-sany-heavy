Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 7.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to
2,292.61. The  CSI 300 Index  added 0.1 percent to 2,464.26.  Steelmakers:  Angang Steel Co. (000898)  (000898 CH) slumped 4.4
percent to 4.58 yuan, its biggest slide since Nov. 30. The
steelmaker probably had a net loss of 2.15 billion yuan ($340.8
million) last year because of higher costs and lower product
prices, compared with a profit of 2.05 billion yuan in 2010.  Maanshan Iron & Steel Co.  (600808 CH), China’s fourth-
largest listed steelmaker, lost 0.8 percent to 2.56 yuan.
Nanjing Iron & Steel Co. (600282 CH) dropped 1.7 percent to 2.87
yuan. Both companies said net income for 2011 may have plunged
by more than 50 percent.  Camel Group Co. (601311)  (601311 CH) surged 9.7 percent to 21.12
yuan, the most since July 27. The manufacturer of lead-acid
batteries plans to offer 10 bonus shares and four yuan for every
10 shares held, Camel said in a statement yesterday. Camel’s net
income probably rose 21 percent from a year earlier in 2011,
according to the statement.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  (600031 CH), the biggest Chinese
machinery maker, gained 1.6 percent to 14.21 yuan. The
construction-equipment maker run by China’s richest man and a
partner will pay 360 million euros ($472 million) for German
concrete-pump maker Putzmeister Holding GmbH to add technology
and expand abroad.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
