Cyrela (CYRE3)   Brazil  Realty SA
Empreendimentos e Participacoes reduced its 2012 forecasts for
contracted sales and gross margin after considering the
country’s growth outlook, according to a regulatory filing.  Sao Paulo-based Cyrela reduced its 2012 contracted sales
guidance to between 6.9 billion reais and 8 billion reais, the
filing said. That compares with a forecast for contracted sales
of 8 billion reais to 8.9 billion reais which the company
announced on March 11 last year.  Cyrela sees its gross margin reaching 30 percent to 34
percent this year, while guidance released in March pointed to
gross margin of 31 percent to 35 percent.  Brazil’s economy shrank 0.17 percent on an annualized basis
in the third quarter, the first contraction since the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, while industrial
output has fallen for five of the last eight months.  Shares dropped 3.1 percent today to 16.18 reais while the
benchmark Bovespa index advanced 0.5 percent to 63,072.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
