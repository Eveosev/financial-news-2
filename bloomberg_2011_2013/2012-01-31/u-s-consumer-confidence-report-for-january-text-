Following is the text of
U.S.  consumer confidence  from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which had
increased in December, retreated in January. The Index now
stands at 61.1 (1985=100), down from 64.8 in December. The
Present Situation Index declined to 38.4 from 46.5. The
Expectations Index edged down to 76.2 from 77.0 in December.  The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a probability
design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by
Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics
around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the
preliminary results was January 19.  Says  Lynn Franco , Director of The Conference Board Consumer
Research Center: “Consumer Confidence retreated in January,
after large back-to-back gains in the final two months of 2011.
Consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market
conditions turned more downbeat and is back to November 2011
levels.  Regarding the short-term outlook, consumers are more
upbeat about employment, but less optimistic about business
conditions and their income prospects.  Recent increases in
gasoline prices may have consumers feeling a little less
confident this month.”  Consumers’ appraisal of current conditions was less favorable in
January. Those claiming business conditions are “good” decreased
to 13.3 percent from 16.3 percent, while those stating business
conditions are “bad” increased to 38.7 percent from 33.5
percent. Consumers’ assessment of the labor market was also less
positive. Those saying jobs are “plentiful” decreased to 6.1
percent from 6.6 percent, while those claiming jobs are “hard to
get” increased to 43.5 percent from 41.6 percent.  Consumers’ short-term outlook was slightly weaker than it was
last month. The proportion of consumers anticipating business
conditions to improve over the next six months decreased to 16.6
percent from 16.8 percent, while those expecting business
conditions will worsen increased to 15.1 percent from 13.4
percent. Consumers’ outlook for the labor market, however, was
moderately more favorable.  Those expecting more jobs in the
months ahead increased to 16.2 percent from 14.0 percent, while
those anticipating fewer jobs declined to 19.5 percent from 20.2
percent. The proportion of consumers expecting an increase in
their incomes declined to 13.8 percent from 16.3 percent.  The next release is scheduled for Tuesday, February 28,
at 10:00 AM ET.  SOURCE: The Conference Board
