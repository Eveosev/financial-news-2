A total of 63 percent of French
adults saw at least part of President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
televised interview on Jan. 29, according to a poll.  Thirty-one percent watched the whole interview and 32
percent saw at least some of it, according to the Ifop poll for
Journal du Dimanche newspaper.  Eighty-two percent said Sarkozy seemed “determined” in
the interview in which he announced that he’ll fund a decrease
in labor charges with a sales-tax increase. Only 49 percent
found him “convincing” and 41 percent found him
“reassuring.”  The poll involved 849 people, with follow-up questions for
those who watched the interview.  Sarkozy trails his Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande 
in polls ahead of  France ’s presidential elections, which will be
held over two rounds in April and May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
