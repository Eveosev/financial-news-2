Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  faced a lone challenge from the leader of a West Bank
settler faction in a primary election for the ruling Likud party
leadership.  Netanyahu, 62, is seeking re-election today as chairman of
the party, which would put him in position to run for a third
term as prime minister. Moshe Feiglin, 49, head of Likud’s
“Jewish Leadership” faction, lost to Netanyahu by a margin of
almost 50 percentage points in the 2007 primary.  About 125,000 Likud members were eligible to vote at 154
balloting sites across the country, which opened at 10 a.m. and
were scheduled to close at 10 p.m., according to the party’s
website.  Feiglin conceded that his chances of beating Netanyahu were
slim in an interview with Israel Radio after voting near his
home at the Karnei Shomron settlement. “Every extra point I get
today beyond what I got before is an advance” for the settler
movement, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
