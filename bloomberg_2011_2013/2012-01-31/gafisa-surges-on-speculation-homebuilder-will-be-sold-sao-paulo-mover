Gafisa SA (GFSA3) ,  Brazil ’s third-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, surged the most in four weeks on
speculation the company will be sold.  Shares jumped 6 percent to 4.77 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day advance since Jan. 2,
after earlier rising as much as 9.8 percent. It was the best
performer on the benchmark Bovespa index, which gained 0.5
percent.  Gafisa will be sold to U.S. investors who plan to buy all
of the homebuilder’s outstanding shares, Relatorio Reservado
reported today, citing an unidentified employee. The deal will
be announced as soon as next week, the newsletter said.  “Earnings have disappointed, so an acquisition could be a
good thing for shareholders, depending on the price offered,”
Erick Hood, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage, said by phone
from  Sao Paulo . “All we have now is speculation.”  An official at an external press relations firm
representing Gafisa, who asked not to be identified in
accordance with company policy, said the homebuilder doesn’t
comment on market rumors.  Gafisa’s consolidated new projects fell 21 percent in 2011
and came at the bottom of its forecasted range of 3.5 billion
reais ($2 billion) to 4 billion reais, according to a regulatory
filing on Jan. 19. Contracted sales dropped 16 percent from a
year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
