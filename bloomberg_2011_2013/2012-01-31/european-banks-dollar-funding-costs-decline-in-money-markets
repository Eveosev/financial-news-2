The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 72 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 1 p.m. in
 London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was minus 75
yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was at 62 basis points less than
Euribor, from 63 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell for a seventh day. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, narrowed to 76 basis points from 77 yesterday. It was at
85 basis points on Jan. 20.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits  at the  European Central
Bank , placing 479 billion euros ($631 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday from 489 billion euros on Jan. 27.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell for a 29th day to 1.125 percent from
1.131 percent.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  dropped to 0.401 percent from
0.404 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.542 percent from 0.547 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
