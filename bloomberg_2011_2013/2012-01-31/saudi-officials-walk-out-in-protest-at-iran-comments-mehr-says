A Saudi Arabian delegation walked
out of a conference in protest after a former Iranian parliament
speaker criticized the kingdomâ€™s policies, the state-run  Mehr 
news agency reported without citing anyone.  Former Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri said the
birth place of Islam had strayed from its principles of justice
and become a place of oppression and inequality in less than 100
years, Mehr said in a report published yesterday.  Nateq Nouri made the comments during a speech at a
conference of the Parliamentary Union of the  Organization of
Islamic Cooperation  in Palembang,  Indonesia  yesterday, Mehr
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
