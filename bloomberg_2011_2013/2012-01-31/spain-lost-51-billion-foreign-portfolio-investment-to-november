Spain  lost 38.6 billion euros ($51
billion) of foreign portfolio investment in the 11 months
through November, as the sovereign debt crisis pushed more
foreign  investors  to exit Spanish markets.  The outflow from securities such as bonds and equities
accelerated from 24.1 billion euros in the first 11 months of
2010, the Bank of Spain said in an e-mailed statement today.
Spain’s current account deficit narrowed to 36.2 billion euros
in the period from 45.8 billion euros a year earlier, the
central bank said.  The People’s Party government, in power following a general
election on Nov. 20, is trying to convince foreign investors it
can fix public finances and kick-start the shrinking  economy .
Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs have fallen to 5 percent from
more than 6 percent at the end of November, helped by three-year
loans the  European Central Bank  began offering banks last month.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Jan. 25 that
“real foreign money” is starting to flow into the country as
investors buy  government bonds . The yield on Spain’s 10-year
benchmark bond was 5 percent today, compared with 5.04 percent
yesterday and 6.63 percent on Nov. 30. The Ibex 35 main share
index, which declined 13 percent last year, is unchanged so far
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
