KPMG Baltics, the administrator for
 Latvijas Krajbanka AS (LKB1R) , called for the bankruptcy of the lender
after rejecting proposals to reopen it,  Leta  reported.  The administrator had evaluated and rejected four proposals
that would have revived the lender, which was suspended in
November over missing money, the Riga-based newswire reported.  -- Editor: Douglas Lytle  To contact the reporter on this story:
