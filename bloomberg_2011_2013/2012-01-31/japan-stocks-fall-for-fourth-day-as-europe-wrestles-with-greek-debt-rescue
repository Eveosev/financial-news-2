The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose,
snapping a three-day losing streak, after Greece’s prime
minister said progress had been made in talks with bondholders,
easing concern  Europe  will be able to handle its debt crisis.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an electronics maker that gets almost 20
percent of its sales in Europe, climbed 2.2 percent. Nissan
Motor Co., an auto manufacturer that earns about a third of its
revenue from  North America , slid 1 percent after the dollar fell
to a three-month low against the yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the
world’s biggest maker of memory-chip testers, gained the most in
the Nikkei after Daiwa Securities Group Inc. raised its rating.  The  Nikkei 225  rose 0.1 percent to 8,802.51 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, ending the month up 4.1 percent. The gauge
slipped as much as 1.3 percent earlier today amid signs  Greece 
would fail to reach an accord with creditors. The broader Topix
Index slid 0.2 percent to 755.27.  “Negotiations have been hard and that’s put investors on
edge,” said Kenji Sekiguchi, general manager at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $75 billion. “But
those concerns will ease once there’s an agreement.”  Stocks rose after Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
told reporters in Brussels he was “strongly committed” to
reaching a debt-swap agreement with bondholders by the end of
week. Shares pared gains as the dollar weakened to as low as
76.18 yen, the lowest since Oct. 31, after the announcement.  Exporters Fall  “The yen continues to strengthen, which is a catalyst for
blue-chip shares to get sold,” said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Nissan slid 1 percent to 719 yen, and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a
carmaker that gets more than 40 percent of its sales in North
America, lost 0.6 percent to 2,666 yen.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  added 0.2
percent today. The gauge slid 0.3 percent yesterday in  New York 
after a report showed U.S. consumer spending missed estimates,
and European leaders sparred with Greece over a rescue package.  Advantest soared 7.1 percent to 875 yen after Daiwa raised
the stock’s rating to “neutral” from “underperform.” The
brokerage said the company may return to profit on rising demand
from  South Korea  and  Taiwan .  Among stocks that fell,  Fujifilm Holdings Corp. (4901)  declined
the most in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , falling 6.9 percent to 1,807 yen.
The film maker slashed its full-year profit forecast by almost
half, citing the stronger yen and floods in  Thailand . The stock
also fell after Executive Vice President Shigehiro Nakajima said
the company may invest in scandal-hit Olympus Corp. as part of a
proposed partnership. Olympus gained 2.1 percent to 1,285 yen.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in  Tokyo .
