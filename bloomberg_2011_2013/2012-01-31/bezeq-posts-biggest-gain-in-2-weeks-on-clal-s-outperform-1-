Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication
Corp. (BEZQ)  gained the most in more than two weeks after Clal Finance
Brokerage Ltd. raised its recommendation on the country’s
largest telecommunications company.  The  shares climbed  2.5 percent, the biggest advance since
Jan. 16, to 6.49 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . A
35 percent slump over the  past year  has left Bezeq shares valued
at 8.1 times estimated earnings. That compares with 11.4 times
for the MSCI Emerging Markets/Telecommunication Services Index.  “At the current price, the fear of regulation and the
negative forecasts for the cellular activities are priced in,”
Tsahi Avraham, an analyst at Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in Tel
Aviv wrote in an e-mailed report today. He raised his
 recommendation  on the shares to “outperform” from “market
perform,” while lowering the price estimate to 7.40 shekels
from 7.90 shekels.  The government, seeking to boost competition, is
introducing new wireless operators and has plans to allow a
third fixed-line company into the market, while reducing the
fees Bezeq can charge for calls between networks.  Bezeq also has “strong free  cash flow  and a technological
advantage over competitors,” Avraham said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
