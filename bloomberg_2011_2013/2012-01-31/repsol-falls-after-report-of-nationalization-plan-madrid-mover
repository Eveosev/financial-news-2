Repsol YPF SA (REP)  fell the most in
almost three weeks after Pagina/12 newspaper said Argentinian
officials discussed a takeover of  YPF (YPFD)  SA, the country’s biggest
oil producer, in which Repsol holds a majority stake.  Repsol  declined  as much as 80 cents, or 3.7 percent, to
20.71 euros, the biggest intraday drop since Jan. 11, and was
trading down 0.8 percent at 2:10 p.m. in Madrid. The stock has
fallen 11 percent this year. YPF’s American depositary receipts
fell 10 percent to $35.86 yesterday, the steepest one-day
decline since Aug. 8.  Argentinian government officials, lawmakers and oil
industry specialists discussed re-nationalizing YPF, which was
bought by Repsol in 1999, Pagina/12 reported Jan. 29. YPF isn’t
aware of any developments that could explain unusual share
movements, it said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission today. Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol
in Madrid, declined to comment.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is pushing Buenos
Aires-based YPF and other  oil companies  to boost investments in
Argentina after saying they are to blame for a doubling of fuel
imports to $9.4 billion in 2011.  Fernandez’s government also is probing alleged fuel-price
fixing by YPF,  Petrobras Argentina SA (PESA)  and other producers
following a complaint from the country’s transport association.
YPF denied on Jan. 18 that it had colluded with other companies
to fix gasoline prices. Late last year Fernandez ordered oil
companies to repatriate future export revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
