International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors are due to end a mission to  Iran  today, as the
organization seeks to ease international tensions over the
country’s nuclear program.  The delegation arrived in the Iranian capital on Jan. 29
with Chief Inspector Herman Nackaerts expressing hope that the
trip would allow for a “dialogue.”  In a November report, the IAEA cited “credible” sources
as saying the country has studied how to make a nuclear bomb.
Iran has repeatedly rejected accusations that its nuclear work
is aimed at building weapons, and says documents in the IAEA’s
possession are forged.  The European Union has announced plans to ban Iranian oil
imports starting in July and to freeze the assets of the
country’s central bank, the latest in a series of sanctions by
the  United Nations , the U.S. and the EU. Iran had warned that it
may retaliate by disrupting shipping in the  Strait of Hormuz , a
conduit for 20 percent of global oil.  Iranian Foreign minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said this week
that the IAEA team would be visiting some of Iran’s nuclear
sites and could extend its stay if it needed to. Iranian
officials haven’t named the facilities or provided details of
the team’s meetings.  The press office of the  Vienna-based nuclear watchdog  said
today that the inspectors would be reporting to the IAEA’s
director-general upon their return and there would be no
briefing to journalists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
