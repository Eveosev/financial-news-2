Pork imports into Russia may triple
as the country’s membership of the  World Trade Organization 
discourages investment in the industry, the  National Pig
Breeders’ Union  said.  Inbound shipments of the meat last year were about 620,000
metric tons, or 20 percent of local consumption, a presentation
by the union at an agricultural conference in Moscow today
showed. Imports will increase to about 1.8 million tons in 2020,
meeting as much as 45 percent of local demand, the group said.  “The industry’s investment attractiveness will drop
sharply after Russia’s accession to the WTO,” Nikolay Birulin,
the union’s chief expert, said at the conference. “Only those
farm projects that are being constructed now have a chance to be
commissioned.”  Domestic pork production will decrease starting in 2014
because the industry’s low profitability will deter investment
and output at small private farms and households will be
uncompetitive, Birulin said.  Russia ’s pig-breeding industry may
face losses of at least 20 billion rubles ($662 million) under
the terms of the country’s WTO membership, he said.  The conference was organized by the Moscow-based Institute
for Agricultural Market Studies. The WTO in December accepted
Russia as a member, ushering in the last major economy after
more than 18 years of negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
