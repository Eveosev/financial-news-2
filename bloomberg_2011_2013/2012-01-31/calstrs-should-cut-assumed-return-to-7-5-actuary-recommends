The California State Teachers’
Retirement System, the second-largest U.S. public pension,
should lower its assumed annual rate of return to 7.5 percent
from the current target of 7.75 percent, its actuary said.  The board of the $144.8 billion fund is scheduled to vote
Feb. 2 on the recommendation, which would add $5.9 billion to
its $56 billion funding shortfall, according to a  report  by
Milliman Inc., the fund’s consulting actuary.  Calstrs posted a 2.3 percent investment gain in 2011,
reducing its ability to meet long-term obligations to 856,000
members and their families. The fund had only 71 percent of the
money it needs to pay benefits as of June 30, 2010, down from 78
percent a year earlier, according to a statement.  “There is a less than 50 percent probability that the
current assumption” of 7.75 percent will be met “over the long
term,” Milliman actuaries wrote in their report. Over 10 years,
the fund gained 5.4 percent, according to a statement Jan. 24.  The Calstrs board adopted the current 7.75 percent rate in
December 2010, rejecting a staff proposal to lower it to 7.5
percent from 8 percent. Calstrs is second in size to the
 California Public Employees’ Retirement System , which posted
2011 earnings of 1.1 percent.  The panel will also review a mix of higher contributions
from teachers, school districts and the state to address the
funding gap, according to its agenda.  Governor  Jerry Brown  didn’t include additional state funds
for Calstrs in a series of measures he outlined in October to
narrow pension funding gaps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
