Park Holding AS didn’t make a
downpayment to buy a  power grid  on Istanbul’s European side from
the government by a deadline of 6 p.m. local time today.  The asset sales agency in Ankara will make an official
statement following a meeting of a committee in charge of the
sale, an official at the agency said by telephone today.  Park Holding offered $2.5 billion for the grid in an
auction in 2010. Park came third in bidding and was invited to
pay for the asset after the top two bidders dropped out.  The grid would need to be re-sold by the agency because Park
was the final bidder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
