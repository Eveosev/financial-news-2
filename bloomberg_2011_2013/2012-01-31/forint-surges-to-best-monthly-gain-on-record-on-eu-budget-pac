The forint gained, extending the
biggest monthly advance on record after European Union leaders
completed a treaty on fiscal discipline which  Hungary  also
accepted.  Hungary’s currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 294.1 per
euro by 9:28 a.m. in Budapest. A close at that level would mean
a 7 percent monthly appreciation, the most since at least 1999,
the year the European common currency was launched. The
benchmark BUX stock index rose 1.2 percent to 19,306.95, heading
for a 14 percent advance in January.  Hungary, the EU’s most indebted eastern member, will
support a fiscal compact after modifications were made to the
text, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  told reporters in Brussels
late yesterday. The backing of the Hungarian premier, who had
previously said that Parliament would have to make the final
decision on the accord, means only Britain and the  Czech
Republic  boycotted the plan.  The forint has rallied this month as investors became more
optimistic Hungary will obtain aid from the  International
Monetary Fund  and the EU. The currency has jumped 8.5 percent
since Orban said on Jan. 5 he was ready to discuss conditions
for a “quick” deal on the bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
