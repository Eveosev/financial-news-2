Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, rose the most in three months after most
European Union countries agreed on tighter budget controls and
Greece made progress on bailout talks.  The stock added 5.7 percent, the most since Nov. 3, to
3,699 koruna at the end of trading in Prague. Komercni has
surged 11 percent this year, its best month since July 2009. The
Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  gauge of 14 companies, where Komercni has an
18 percent weighting, jumped 2.5 percent today.  European stocks gained today, headed for their best start
to a year since 1998, after EU leaders in Brussels yesterday
completed a treaty that speeds sanctions on high-deficit states
and Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said he’s “strongly
committed” to reaching a debt-swap pact with bondholders.  In Prague, Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , power utility CEZ
AS, coal company New World Resources Plc and phone operator
Telefonica Czech Republic AS all rose more than 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
