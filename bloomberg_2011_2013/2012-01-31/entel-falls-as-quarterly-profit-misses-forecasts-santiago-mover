Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones SA  fell the most among members of  Chile ’s
benchmark stock index after profit fell more than analysts
forecast amid rising competition.  Entel (ENTEL) , as Chile’s second-biggest mobile telephone operator
is known, lost 1.8 percent to 8,946.4 pesos, the lowest closing
price since Aug. 18. Chile’s Ipsa index gained 0.9 percent.  Fourth-quarter net income slumped 36 percent to 30.8
billion pesos ($62.7 million), from 48.2 billion pesos a year
ago, according to Bloomberg calculations based on annual results
released after the close of trading yesterday. That missed  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) ’s estimate by 30 percent as increased spending on
promotions narrowed profit margins.  “Results were below our estimates and market consensus,”
Santander analyst Francisco Errandonea wrote in an e-mailed
note. Results reflect “the competitive environment expected for
2012, with higher churn rates and higher costs due to
promotions, in line with the start of the implementation of
number portability and the entrance of new players,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
