The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index  rose 0.5 percent to 37,422.68.  Mexican stocks rose after the  Finance Ministry  said that
Mexico’s economy probably grew 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier and 4.0 percent in 2011 in an e-mailed
statement yesterday after trading hours.  Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB)  , the Mexican
producer of over-the-counter drugs, gained 3.2 percent to 28.59
pesos.  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  , Mexico’s second-

flour for tortillas, increased 2.3 percent to 28.84 pesos.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 1.5 percent to 8.83 pesos. Bank of America
upgraded Cemex’s American depositary receipts (CX) to “buy”
from “neutral” in a research note from Jan. 30. Bank of
America said Cemex “has more than a 50 percent probability” of
raising $1.5 billion or more through assets sales in the next
few months to pay its bank debt.  Grupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICOB)  , the nation’s largest mining
