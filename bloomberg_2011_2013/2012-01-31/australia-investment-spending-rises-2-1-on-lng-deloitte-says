Australia ’s business investment rose
2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, led by liquefied natural gas
projects in resource-rich Queensland, a Deloitte Access
Economics report showed.  Projects valued at A$415.4 billion ($442 billion) were
committed or in progress as of Dec. 31, up A$8.6 billion from
the previous three months and 43 percent higher than a year
earlier, the Canberra-based  research company  said in a report
released today.  “The value of projects under way provides a healthy buffer
against a potential global slowdown in 2012,” the report
showed. “Indeed, it is already providing the bulk of growth for
the Australian economy at the moment. Engineering construction
activity accounted for all of the growth in Australia’s economy
during the September quarter of 2011.”  Projects include Origin Energy Ltd.’s A$19.6 billion
Australia Pacific LNG project at Gladstone in Queensland state
that is now under way, Deloitte Access said.  Mining accounts for 46 percent of all investment projects
under construction or committed, according to Deloitte Access,
which was founded by two former Treasury economists.  “That breadth of projects helped to deliver the strongest
growth in business investment spending ever seen during the
September quarter of 2011, at a time when many other sectors of
the Australian economy were in the doldrums,” Deloitte Access
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
