Oil production this month by the
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  rose to the
highest level in more than three years, led by a rebound in
Libyan output, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production (OPCRTOTL)  increased 183,000 barrels, or 0.6 percent, to an
average 30.9 million barrels a day in January from a revised
30.717 million the prior month, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts. Output was at the highest
level since November 2008. The December total was revised higher
by 50,000 barrels a day.  OPEC decided at a Dec. 14 meeting in Vienna to increase its
production ceiling to 30 million barrels a day, the first change
in three years. The new target is for all members of the group,
including  Iraq , which had previously been exempt from monthly
targets. The group will review quotas at its next meeting,
scheduled for June 14.  Libyan output  rose 225,000 barrels to 925,000 a day this
month, the highest level since February, the survey showed.
Production in the country had tumbled to 45,000 barrels a day in
August from 1.585 million barrels a day in January 2011, the
last month before an uprising that overthrew the government of
 Muammar Qaddafi  disrupted output.  Saudi Arabia (OPCRSAUD) , OPECâ€™s biggest producer, decreased output by
50,000 barrels to 9.65 million barrels a day in January.
December production was revised 50,000 barrels a day higher.  To contact the reporters on this story:
