VEB (VNECB) , the Russian state development
bank chaired by  Vladimir Putin , said it may acquire a 10 percent
share in  OAO RusHydro (HYDR)  to help fund  capital spending  at the power
utility and curb price increases.  VEB may spend 64 billion rubles ($2.1 billion) to acquire
treasury shares in the company, Chief Executive Officer Vladimir
Dmitriev said in an interview in Davos, Switzerland.  The Russian state, the majority shareholder in Moscow-based
RusHydro, has said it will sell some of its interests in energy
companies as early as this year. Putin’s deputy, Vice Premier
 Igor Sechin , has proposed delaying some of the sales because of
low market prices, Kommersant reported Jan. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
