Peruvian dollar bonds rose, pushing
down yields the most in three months, as the outlook for low
 interest rates  in the U.S. and bets  Europe ’s debt crisis will
ease boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 dropped nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 4.77 percent. The bond’s price rose
1.5 cent from yesterday to 125.96 cents per dollar.  European Union leaders meeting in Brussels agreed to
tighter budget controls and decided to bring the region’s
permanent bailout fund into operation on July 1, a year before
schedule. The U.S. Federal Reserve pledged Jan. 25 to maintain
low interest rates through at least late 2014.  “The international context has generally been supportive”
for Peruvian government debt, said Bret Rosen, a strategist at
Standard Chartered Bank in  New York .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points to 5.70
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.6890 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6905 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru ’s central bank  bought  $53 million in the spot currency
market today to stem gains in the sol. The bank paid 2.6890
soles per dollar, according to a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
