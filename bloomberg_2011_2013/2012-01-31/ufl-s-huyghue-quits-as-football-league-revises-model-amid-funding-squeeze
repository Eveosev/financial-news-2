Michael Huyghue quit as commissioner
of the  United Football League , which said it’s revising its
business model and strategy for the 2012 season.  “The UFL has experienced significant funding issues and at
this juncture it seems most prudent that I step aside while the
owners work to raise the necessary funds to conduct a fourth
season,” said Huyghue, who had served as the league’s
commissioner since its inception in 2009.  UFL founder Bill Hambrecht said he remains committed to
taking the league forward despite “very challenging
circumstances.” The UFL had teams in Las Vegas; Omaha,
Nebraska;  Virginia Beach , Virginia; and Sacramento,  California ,
last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
