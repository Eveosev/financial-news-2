The Schlecker family has no more
money to contribute to a rescue effort for its namesake
drugstore chain,  Financial Times Deutschland said , citing Meike
Schlecker, daughter of the owner Anton Schlecker.  While several hundred of the 6,000 German stores will be
closed, a “three-digit-million-euro” sum is need to modernize
the remaining shops, the German newspaper cited Arndt Geiwitz,
the chain’s insolvency administrator, as saying.  Family members including Meike’s brother Lars and her
mother Christa already spent a three-digit-million-euro amount
to finance a restructuring and now there is nothing left, Meike
Schlecker said, according to Financial Times Deutschland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
