Polypore (PPO)  International Inc., which
makes lithium separators used in batteries, plunged 43 percent
to close at a 52-week low of $38.08 after Axiom Capital
Management initiated coverage with a sell recommendation.  Analyst  Gordon Johnson , who set a target price of $26 for
the stock, said in a note that competitor LG Chem Ltd.’s
announcement that it plans to have a separator plant operating
by the second half of this year was “detrimental” to Polypore
especially in light of Polypore’s capacity additions.  Polypore, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in a
statement it remains confident that “accelerating industry
demand for electric drive vehicles” justifies its capacity
expansions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
