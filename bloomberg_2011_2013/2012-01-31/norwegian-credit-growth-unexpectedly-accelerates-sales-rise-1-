Norwegian credit growth unexpectedly
accelerated in December as the country’s central bank cut
 interest rates  to protect the economy from the fallout of
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Credit growth  was 6.7 percent in December, up from 6.6
percent in November, the Oslo-based statistics agency said
today. It was estimated to slow to 6.5 percent, according to the
median forecast of 12 analysts.  Norway ’s central bank cut  its benchmark  by half a
percentage point last month to 1.75 percent and Governor
Oeystein Olsen has signaled he is ready to ease policy further
if growth prospects deteriorate. Central bank policy makers will
meet on March 14 to discuss interest rate setting.  A separate report showed retail sales, excluding petrol and
vehicles, rose 2.6 percent in December from a year earlier,
beating a 2.2 percent growth estimate. Sales fell 0.3 percent in
the month, the statistic office said.  The krone weakened 0.2 percent against the euro to 7.6560
by 10:10 a.m. in Oslo. It rose 0.3 percent to 5.7965 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
