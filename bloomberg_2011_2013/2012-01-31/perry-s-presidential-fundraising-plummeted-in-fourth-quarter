Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney raised $57 million last year, including $24 million in
the last three months, and entered the 2012 Republican
presidential primary season with $20 million to spend.  Romney raised almost as much money from October to December
as his chief rival for the nomination, former U.S. House Speaker
 Newt Gingrich , raised all last year, new Federal Election
Commission reports show.  Romney, the projected winner of today’s Florida primary,
outraised all his Republican opponents last year, though he
brought in less than half the $128 million haul reported by
President Barack Obama. The president, who took in $40 million
from October to December, had $81.8 million to spend entering
2012, four times Romney’s bank balance.  Gingrich raised $12.7 million for his campaign last year,
including $9.8 million in the last three months, and had $2.1
million in the bank. He also reported debts of $1.2 million,
including $351,946 to Moby Dick Airways Ltd., which arranges air
charters. Gingrich paid off his own debt to himself.  The campaign reimbursed Gingrich more than $200,000 for
travel and paid him $47,005 for a mailing list, as well as
$67,016 in compensation to Gingrich Productions for web hosting.  Daughter’s Company  From October to December, the Gingrich campaign paid the
consulting company led by his daughter, Jackie Gingrich Cushman,
$21,811 for consulting and travel. The campaign previously paid
Cushman Enterprises Inc. $34,321.  Gingrich, who won the South Carolina primary, raised
another $5 million last month, said his campaign spokesman, R.C.
Hammond.  Obama’s year-end figures include transfers from a joint
fundraising effort with the  Democratic National Committee . Four
years ago, Obama raised $104 million through Dec. 31 and had
$18.6 million in the bank.  Obama has maintained a strong base of small donors; $58.5
million, or 46 percent, came in through contributions of $200 or
less. He had 1.3 million donors last year, the campaign said.  The campaign reported spending $48 million through Dec. 31,
including almost $20 million in the last three months.  Fundraising Bundlers  Obama also reported that the number of fundraisers bringing
in at least $50,000 increased to 445, from 351 at the end of
September. He named 61 bundlers, supporters who tap their own
networks to help generate donations to the campaign, who raised
more than $500,000, up from 41 in September. Obama is the only
presidential candidate to publicly identify backers who are
bundling donations.  New $500,000 bundlers include Bruce Heyman, a managing
director of New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; Tom Carnahan, chairman of Exelon Corp.’s St. Louis-based Wind
Capital Group LLC, an alternative-energy company and brother of
Missouri Secretary of State  Robin Carnahan  and U.S.
Representative Russ Carnahan; and Kirk Dornbush, president of
Iconic Therapeutics Inc., an Atlanta-based biopharmaceutical
company.  Bundlers of more than $500,000 previously identified by the
campaign include onetime New Jersey Governor  Jon Corzine , the
former chairman of New York-based MF Global Holdings Ltd., which
filed for bankruptcy after making bets on European sovereign
debt;  Robert Wolf , chairman of UBS Americas; and Hollywood
producer  Jeffrey Katzenberg .  ‘Different Vision’  Obama raised at least $2.15 million at two separate
fundraisers today. At the first event he told approximately 50
people who paid at least $35,800 per couple that he offers a
“fundamentally different vision” from Republicans, who he said
want to strip away protections for consumers, disregard
environmental concerns and lower taxes for the wealthy.  He spoke later at a dinner in  Chevy Chase ,  Maryland , a
Washington suburb, with almost 70 guests with ticket prices
starting at $35,800 per couple.  The president also is using administration officials to
raise money across the country as his re-election efforts go
into high gear. Vice President  Joe Biden  hosted a fundraiser
today with about 200 guests in  Fort Worth , Texas. Tickets
started at $5,000, and on Feb. 2 he will host an event in
DeKalb, Texas, that could raise at least $716,000.  Texas Governor  Rick Perry , who dropped out of the
Republican race on Jan. 19 and endorsed Gingrich, reported
earlier that he had raised $2.9 million in the fourth quarter,
down from $17 million in the previous three months. He raised
$20 million last year, and had $3.8 million in the bank at the
end of 2011.  Santorum, Bachmann  Former U.S. Senator  Rick Santorum  of  Pennsylvania  raised
$2.2 million last year, including $920,428 in the fourth
quarter. He entered 2012, where he continues to campaign after
winning the Iowa caucuses, with $278,935 in the bank and debts
of $204,836.  Minnesota Representative  Michele Bachmann , who ended her
campaign Jan. 4, took in $1.7 million in the fourth quarter,
bringing the total for her campaign to $9.3 million. She raised
$4.8 million in amounts of $200 or less. Bachmann had $1.1
million in debt -- more than half of owed to a telemarketing
firm -- and $358,725 in cash at the end of 2011.  Former Utah Governor  Jon Huntsman , who withdrew from the
race Jan. 16, had $3.8 million in debts at the end of 2011,
including $2.5 million he lent his campaign. Huntsman raised
$3.3 million, including $1.1 million from October to December,
and had $110,965 in the bank on Jan. 1.  Cain, Pawlenty  Georgia businessman  Herman Cain  raised $11.2 million in the
fourth quarter and $16.9 million for his campaign, which he
terminated in early December. He had almost $1 million left over
and owed $580,200.  Former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty , who withdrew from
the Republican race in August after finishing third in the Iowa
Straw Poll, raised more than $400,000 from October to December,
whittling his campaign debt to $102,911 -- little more than
double the $46,268 he had in the bank as of Dec. 31. He raised
$5.9 million last year for his campaign.  Pawlenty received financial help from Romney, whom he
endorsed in September, and Romney’s wife, Ann. They contributed
the maximum $2,500 each, as did 11 other Romney family members.
In addition, Pawlenty received $2,500 from J.W. Marriott Jr.,
the chairman of Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott International
Inc., who also gave $500,000 to a pro-Romney super political
action committee, Restore Our Future.  Super-PAC Contributions  The other candidates also getting help from super-PACs,
which can take in unlimited donations from corporations, unions
and individuals though are forbidden to coordinate with the
candidates they are supporting. Political action committee
filings are also due today.  “This is going to be a long haul; we’ll get through it,”
said  Rick Tyler , a strategist with Winning Our Future, a pro-
Gingrich political action committee, in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. Tyler said his group would keep
supporting Gingrich “every step of the way.”  Winning Our Future earlier this month received $10 million
from  Sheldon Adelson , head of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., and his
wife, Miriam, according to a person close to the casino
executive.  Super-PACs are playing a role in a presidential race for
the first time after a series of court and regulatory rulings
cleared the way. Huntsman, who endorsed Romney on Jan. 16,
benefited from the support of a super-PAC called Our Destiny.  Our Destiny  Our Destiny brought in $2.7 million last year, with $1.9
million coming from the candidate’s father, Jon Huntsman Sr.,
according to the group’s FEC report. Huntsman made seven
separate donations to the group, giving almost half of the total
in December, before the first nominating contests.  Make Us Great Again, a pro-Perry super-PAC, raised $5.5
million last year. Dallas-based Contran Corp. donated $500,000;
its chairman, Harold Simmons, is Perry’s second-largest
individual contributor, according to Texans for Public Justice,
an Austin-based watchdog group.  Texas  homebuilder Bob Perry, the biggest lifetime donor to
Perry’s gubernatorial campaigns in Texas, gave $100,000 to Make
Us Great Again. Perry, who isn’t related to the governor, also
gave $502,500 to Romney’s presidential campaign and a super-PAC
that backs his candidacy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
