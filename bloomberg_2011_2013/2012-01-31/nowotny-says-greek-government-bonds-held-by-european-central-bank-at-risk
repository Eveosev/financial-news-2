European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that Greek government bonds
the ECB acquired in the secondary market are “of course” at
risk, according to an interview with Austrian state radio ORF.  “One off course has to say openly that there’s a risk
regarding  Greece , however the current discussion is about a
participation of the private sector and that of course doesn’t
include the ECB,” Nowotny told ORF.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
