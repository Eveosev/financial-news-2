Eike Batista , who became  Brazil ’s
richest person by selling shares in commodities and logistic
startups, is considering entering the coffee market after
setting up catering and sports management ventures last year.  EBX Group Co., the holding company for most of Batista’s
assets, said it is studying “business opportunities” in the
coffee industry in an e-mailed statement distributed by its
press office late yesterday. It didn’t provide further details.  Batista, 55, is expanding into new segments after setting
up energy, mining and logistics companies. In December, EBX
entered the catering services market through NRX-Newrest, a
joint venture with Newrest Group Holding. EBX also last year
started IMX, a partnership with IMG Worldwide Inc. focused on
sports and arena management in Brazil.  Batista is buying coffee farms in Brazil’s southeastern
state of  Minas Gerais  and plans to produce and export the beans,
Veja magazine columnist Lauro Jardim reported Jan. 28, without
saying where he got the information.  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA , Batista’s oil and
natural-gas unit, on Jan. 28 began procedures to produce its
first oil from a well offshore Brazil. The company sold shares
in an initial public offering less than four years ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
