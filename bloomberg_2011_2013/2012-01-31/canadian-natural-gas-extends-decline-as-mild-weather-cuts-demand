Canadian natural gas fell, extending
its decline this month to 29 percent, as mild weather across the
U.S. pared demand for home-heating fuels.  Alberta  gas fell 8.7 percent. Demand for heat in the U.S.
Midwest, the biggest market for Canada’s gas, will trail normal
by 29 percent through Feb. 7, according to Weather Derivatives.
It will be the 14th consecutive week of below-normal demand, the
Belton, Missouri-based forecaster said.  “At these temperatures we’re not anticipating much
demand,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at
INTL FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.  Alberta gas for March delivery fell 19.25 cents to C$2.025
a gigajoule ($1.91 per million British thermal units) at 3:05
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 21 cents, or 7.7 percent, to settle at $2.503 per
million Btu. The futures dropped 16 percent this month, the
largest January decline in three years.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago 
dropped 21.79 cents, or 7.7 percent, to $2.6181 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas tumbled 19.68 cents, or 7.5 percent, to $2.446,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 17.86 cents, or 6.6
percent, to $2.5449.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 179 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.68 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 573 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.87 billion cubic feet today, or 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.88
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
