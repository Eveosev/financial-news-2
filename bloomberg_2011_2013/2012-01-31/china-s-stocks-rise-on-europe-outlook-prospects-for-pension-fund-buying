China’s stocks  rose on speculation
the government may encourage pension funds to invest in the
nation’s equities and  Europe ’s debt crisis is easing.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 5.3 points, or 0.2
percent, to 2,290.29 at 9:33 a.m. local time, driving valuations
to 9.4 times estimated earnings, near the record low of 8.9
times reached on Jan. 6. The  CSI 300 Index  rose 0.2 percent to
2,466.07. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, retreated 1.5 percent
in  New York .  China may announce methods for local pensions to invest in
the stock market as soon as the first quarter, the  Securities
Times  reported today, citing an unidentified person. As much as
30 percent of pension assets, or about 580 billion yuan ($91.6
billion), may be allowed for stock investment, according to the
newspaper, which is operated by the People’s Daily.  “The hope lies in government support measures such as
encouraging more local pensions to invest in stocks and the
market believes these measures will materialize soon,” said
Wei Wei, an analyst at West  China  Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“Corporate earnings are slowing but most of this looks
like they are being priced into equities now.”  The Shanghai Composite has gained 3.9 percent in January,
its best start to the year since 2009, on speculation slowing
growth will prompt the central bank to relax monetary policies
and the government will take measures to support stocks.  Chinese insurers have invested between 10 percent and 12
percent of their assets in equities, lower than the 25 percent
cap, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing company
data. Insurers’ equities investment continued to drop in the
fourth quarter, it said.  Europe Outlook  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said major progress
had been made in debt-swap talks with bondholders. He spoke to
reporters in Brussels after a European Union summit. Europe
accounts for 18 percent of Chinese exports, according to
Shanghai-based Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Chinese listed companies have started to announce annual
earnings reports and will finish before the end of April. Forty-
five companies in the Shanghai Composite have released annual
profits so far, gaining 19 percent on average and trailing
estimates by 3.2 percent, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. That compared with an increase of 38 percent in the
previous year.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) , China’s largest carmaker, advanced 0.1
percent to 15.50 yuan after it estimated 2011 net income jumped
more than 40 percent from the previous year’s 13.7 billion yuan
as sales climbed 12 percent.  The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is due to
release a manufacturing index for this month tomorrow. The gauge
may fall to 49.6 from 50.3 in December, according to the median
estimate of 17 economists in a survey by Bloomberg News. The
number of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
