Global food prices fell last quarter
and may continue declining this year as supplies increase,
according to the  World Bank .  The bank’s food-price index decreased 8 percent in the
three months through December, led by staples including wheat
and corn, the lender said today in  Washington . By the end of
2011, the index was 7 percent below its year-earlier level, the
World Bank said.  The data follow a similar index published by the United
Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization earlier this month
that touched a 14-month low in December. Falling prices may give
central banks greater scope to ease monetary policy as the
European financial crisis hurts global growth.  “Prospects for a decline in 2012 prices are favorable on
account of increasing supplies,” the World Bank said in its
Food Price Watch publication. “Yet, global prices remain high
and volatile, markets tight, and  oil prices  uncertain.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
