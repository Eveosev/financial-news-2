Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, plans to sell about $6 billion of
dollar-denominated bonds, matching last year’s record offering.  Petrobras, the biggest emerging-market issuer of overseas
debt in 2011, plans to sell new three- and five-year debt while
issuing more of its bonds maturing in 2021 and 2041 as soon as
tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the plan. The
three-year debt may yield about 280 basis points above similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries while the five-year notes may yield 295
basis points more, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  Petrobras is  raising funds  outside of Brazil to help
finance $224.7 billion of investments in the five years through
2015 and more than double output by 2020. The Rio de Janeiro-
based company sold $6 billion of notes in last January in the
country’s largest-ever debt sale. Petrobras also sold bonds in
euros and pounds last year, raising about $9.6 billion in
international  capital markets  in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Execution Risk’  “Petrobras is a very well known name, a benchmark name,
and the markets are doing well with a lot of inflows, so there’s
no reason it shouldn’t do well provided the company’s not too
aggressive on the pricing,” said Paul Marty, an analyst at
Spread Research.  The company may sell about $6 billion in dollar bonds,
 Fitch Ratings  said in a report today. A Petrobras official in
 Rio de Janeiro  declined to comment.  Petrobras may sell the bonds due in 2021 and 2041 to yield
about 300 basis points more than Treasuries, the person said.  The  average yield  of investment-grade companies in  emerging
markets  has fallen 31 basis points, or 0.31 percentage point,
over the past two months to 4.92 percent, according to a
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s CEMBI Index. Yields on Petrobras’s
securities due January 2021 climbed one basis point today to
4.66 percent, Bloomberg data show.  Petrobras is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, four
steps above junk, and BBB by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings, the second lowest level of investment grade.  BB Securities, Citigroup Inc., Itau BBA, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Morgan Stanley and  Banco Santander  are managing the sale
for Petrobras, said the person familiar with the company’s
plans.  The company’s shares were unchanged today at 24.57 reais.
The stock is up 14 percent this year, compared with a gain of 11
percent for  Brazil ’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Petrobras announced Jan. 23 plans to name Maria das Gracas Foster to replace Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
