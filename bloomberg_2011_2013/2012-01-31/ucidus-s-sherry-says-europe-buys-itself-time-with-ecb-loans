Geoffrey Sherry, co-founder of
Lucidus Capital Partners LLP, a London-based hedge fund, said
the  European Central Bank ’s injection of 489 billion euros ($644
billion) of cash into the financial system hasn’t made banks
solvent.  “They have not fixed the problem of bank insolvency,”
Sherry said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InsideTrack” today. “They haven’t fixed anything, but they
have bought themselves some time.”  Lucidus became a separate firm in 2009 as a joint venture
with Caxton Associates LLC, the New York-based hedge fund
founded by  Bruce Kovner . Credit Suisse AG bought a minority
stake in Lucidus last year.  Sherry, a former co-head of credit trading at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., formed Lucidus with Darryl Green. Green previously
served as chief investment officer for Donaldson Lufin &
Jenrette’s fixed-income proprietary trading group.  Lucidus is “long bank credit risk” and is shunning
illiquid investments, Sherry said. He said he expects the market
to turn at some point this year, which means hedge funds should
be holding assets they can easily sell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
