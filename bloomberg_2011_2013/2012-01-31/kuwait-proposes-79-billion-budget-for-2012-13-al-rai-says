Kuwait’s cabinet proposed a budget
of 22 billion dinars ($79 billion) for the 2012-13 fiscal year,
 Al-Rai  reported today, citing people it didn’t identify.  The budget, for the fiscal year beginning April 1, is based
on an average oil price of $65 a barrel, the Kuwait-based
newspaper said, without providing a figure for projected
revenue. The draft budget has been referred to the Supreme
Council for Planning and Development, according to Al-Rai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
