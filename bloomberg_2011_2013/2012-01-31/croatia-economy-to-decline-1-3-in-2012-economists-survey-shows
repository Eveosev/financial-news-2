Croatia ’s economy will probably
contract 1.3 percent this year on the euro-area’s sovereign debt
crisis and domestic spending cuts, according to a survey of
economists conducted by the  Croatian Banking Association .  Decline in capital investment will push the economy into
another recession, after last year’s brief recovery, said the
survey based on the average estimate of economists from
Croatia’s six biggest banks in terms of assets. The banks
include  Zagrebacka Banka d.d. , the Croatian unit of  Unicredit
SpA (UCG)  and  Privredna Banka d.d. , a unit of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)   Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  last week proposed to cut
spending by 4.6 billion kuna ($795 million) to narrow the  budget
deficit  to 4.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year
from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2011. The economy will expand 0.8
percent this year as competition and domestic demand increase,
Milanovic said. Annual fourth-quarter GDP grew 0.7 percent.  The chief economists of the banks, which also included the
Croatian units of Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , Hypo Alpe-
Adria-Bank International AG,  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
and  Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d . said the forecasts were based on
their personal opinion and do not represent the official opinion
of their banks, the association said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
