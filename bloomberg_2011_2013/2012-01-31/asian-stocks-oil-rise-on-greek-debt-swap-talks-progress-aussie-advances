U.S. stocks fell for a fourth day,
the longest slump for the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  since
August, while Treasuries rose as reports showed American
 consumer confidence  trailed estimates and business activity
cooled in January. Equities  pared early losses  as banks rallied.  The Dow slipped 20.81 points to 12,632.91 and the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,312.4 at 4
p.m. in  New York , trimming its  monthly  gain to 4.4 percent. The
MSCI All-Country World Index rose 0.3 percent to extend its
January advance to 5.7 percent, its best start to a year since
1994. The Dollar Index rose 0.2 percent as the euro fell 0.5
percent to $1.3081. Ten-year Treasury yields fell five basis
points to 1.80 percent. Oil erased a 2.5 percent early gain.  Stocks, the euro and commodities  retreated  from their highs
of the day as lower-than-forecast readings in the Conference
Board’s  confidence  index and the Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago Inc.’s business barometer cast doubt on the
strength of the  U.S. economy . Earlier gains were triggered after
most countries in Europe agreed to tighter budget controls and
 Greece  made progress on debt talks.  “It’s unsettling,”  Peter Sorrentino , a senior  fund
manager  who helps oversee $14.5 billion at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. “The
weakness in the consumer sector adds to fears that, if Europe
slips into a recession, that could limit growth in the U.S.”  Losing Streak  The S&P 500’s four-day drop is its longest losing streak
since November. The index is still up 19  percent  from its 2011
low in October. Losses today were led by energy and industrial
companies, while financial shares erased an early drop to help
lead gains as Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley increased at
least 1.6 percent.  The  S&P 500  is up 19 percent from its 2011 low in October.
The index’s average level over the past 50 days today rose above
its average from the past 200 days after slumping below since
August. The pattern, known as a “golden cross,” may signal the
rally will continue, according to technical analysts and
investors whose decisions are influenced by price charts.  The Conference Board’s confidence index fell to 61.1 from a
revised 64.8 reading in the prior month and trailed the most
pessimistic projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists as
gasoline prices rose and more Americans said jobs were hard to
get. The ISM-Chicago’s  business barometer  declined to 60.2 from
62.2 in December, trailing the median forecast of 63.  Earnings Season  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s largest energy company, led
declines in the Dow after reporting fourth-quarter sales that
 trailed  estimates as oil and natural-gas production decreased.
Alcoa Inc., Merck & Co. and  Intel Corp . fell at least 1.2
percent for the next-biggest losses in the 30-stock Dow.  Profits have topped analyst estimates at about two-thirds
of the 192 companies in the S&P 500 that released results since
Jan. 9, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Earnings-per-share have
increased 2.5 percent for the group and sales have risen 7.8
percent.  European stocks rose, capping their best start to a year
since 1998. BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc tracked gains in
crude prices. ThyssenKrupp AG added 2.7 percent after selling
its stainless steel unit to Outokumpu Oyj. ARM Holdings Plc
jumped 2 percent after fourth-quarter revenue topped estimates.
European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. climbed 1.7 percent
after UBS AG advised buying the shares.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.8 percent and rallied 4
percent  this month . The euro strengthened 0.9 percent in
January, its first monthly increase since October.  European Union leaders, meeting in Brussels yesterday,
completed a fiscal-discipline treaty that speeds sanctions on
high-deficit states. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said
he’s “strongly committed” to reaching a debt-swap pact with
bondholders.  European Bonds  The German  10-year bund  yield fell less than one basis
point, a fifth straight decline, while the yield on the Greek
10-year bond yield jumped 28 basis points to 34.31 percent. The
two-year Belgian note yield declined three basis points,
dropping for the fifth consecutive day, after the government
sold 2.58 billion euros of treasury bills.  The Portuguese 10-year bond yield dropped 99 basis points
to 16.40 percent after reaching a euro-era record yesterday,
with the equivalent maturity Italian yield declining 14 basis
points to 5.95 percent.  Emerging Markets  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index gained 1.2 percent, capping
its best January since 2001. The index rose 11 percent this
month after falling 20 percent in 2011. The BSE India Sensitive
Index, or Sensex, climbed 2 percent. Benchmark indexes in Russia
and  Taiwan  added more than 1 percent. In Taiwan, global funds
bought $1.7 billion more stocks than they sold in January, the
most in three months, exchange data showed.  Japan ’s factory production rose 4 percent in December as
manufacturers made up for disruptions caused by  Thailand ’s worst
floods in 70 years, according to a trade ministry report today.
The median estimate of 30 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg (SPX)  was
for a 3 percent gain.  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities slipped 0.1 percent after
rallying 1.6 percent earlier. Oil erased gains and fell 0.3
percent at $98.48 a barrel after surging as much as 2.5 percent.  Gold futures rose 0.3 percent to $1,740.40 an ounce and
surged 11 percent this month, capping the biggest January gain
since 1983. Silver climbed 19 percent in January, also the best
start to a year in almost three decades.  To contact the reporters on this story:
