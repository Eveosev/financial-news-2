Romania boosted its natural-gas
imports in the past week after consumption reached a record
because of freezing temperatures, Deputy Economy Minister
Claudiu Stafie said.  Gas-consumption increased 20 percent to 69 million cubic
meters yesterday and will rise further to about 70 million cubic
meters a day by Feb. 3, Stafie said during a televised speech in
Bucharest today. That compares with consumption of about 57
million cubic meters now, according to Stafie.  “We are facing record gas consumption and we can’t extract
more from our fields, that’s why we increased imports,” Stafie
said. “We imported 17.5 million cubic meters of gas today and
we’ll secure about 20 million cubic meters for tomorrow.”  Worsening weather and blizzards that blocked roads and cut
electricity to dozens of towns since Jan. 26, boosted heating
consumption. The temperature is expected to drop to about minus
27 degrees Celsius (minus 16.6 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 3 in some
areas, the  national meteorological administration  said.  Romgaz SA, the country’s natural-gas company, said it is
currently producing the maximum output from the operating fields
in the country and delivers gas to  E.ON AG (EON) ’s and  GDF Suez’s (GSZ) 
Romanian units, according to a statement on its website.  Gas prices  fell about 5 percent today to $2.571 per million
British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
they posted the biggest weekly gain in more than one year last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
