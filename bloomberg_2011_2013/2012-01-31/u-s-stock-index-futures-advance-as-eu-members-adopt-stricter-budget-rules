U.S. stocks fell for a fourth day,
the longest streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since
August, as reports showed  consumer confidence  trailed
economists’ projections and business activity cooled.  Stocks pared earlier losses as  financial  shares rallied.
Morgan Stanley and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  added at least 1.5
percent.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest energy company by market
value, dropped 2.1 percent on lower-than-forecast sales. Archer
Daniels Midland Co. tumbled 3.6 percent as the world’s biggest
grain processor reported an  89 percent  plunge in earnings.
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  tumbled 9.2 percent at 5:18 p.m. New York time
as sales at the largest Internet retailer missed estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1 percent to
1,312.41 at 4 p.m. New York time. The benchmark gauge fell as
much as 0.5 percent and rose 0.6 percent earlier today. The Dow
retreated 20.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,632.91.  “People are on the fence with respect to whether we
accelerate in economic terms or slow down again,”  John Carey , a
Boston-based  money manager  at Pioneer Investments, said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees about $220 billion.
“We’d like to see better economic growth for sure.”  Stocks erased early gains as reports showed that consumer
 confidence  unexpectedly dropped in January and a gauge of
business activity fell, underscoring forecasts that the  U.S.
economy  will cool after expanding at the fastest pace since the
second quarter 2010. Earlier gains were triggered after most
countries in  Europe  agreed to tighter budget controls and Greece
made progress on debt talks.  Earnings Season  A four-day drop  trimmed  the S&P 500’s monthly rally to 4.4
percent. The index still capped the best January gain in 15
years amid the  Federal Reserve ’s plans to keep  interest rates 
low through at least late 2014 and better-than-estimated
earnings. Of the 196 S&P 500 companies that reported results
since Jan. 9, 131 posted per-share  earnings  that beat
projections, Bloomberg data show.  “We’re moving closer to relief from the European problem
becoming one of catastrophe,” Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
which manages $54 billion, said in a telephone interview. “The
market is recognizing that European officials are working
towards solutions. As more of that fades, what takes prominence
is the fact that the corporate picture remains pretty decent.”  Exxon Mobil dropped 2.1 percent, the biggest decline in the
Dow, to $83.74. Revenue rose 16 percent to $121.6 billion during
the quarter, less than the $124.4 billion average of five
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  ADM Falls  ADM sank 3.6 percent to $28.63. The company, led by
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz, has missed
analysts’ estimates for three straight quarters. Operating
profit at the agricultural-services unit, the company’s largest
 segment  by revenue in fiscal 2011, fell 63 percent to $158
million after U.S. grain exports declined because of a smaller
domestic crop and “adequate” global supplies, ADM said.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  lost 0.7 percent to $75.65,
paring a drop of as much as 1.7 percent. The world’s largest
package-delivery company forecast a 2012 profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as shipping demand increases. Fourth-quarter
revenue rose 5.6 percent to $14.17 billion, which missed the
$14.45 billion average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  plunged 30 percent to $7.18 after the
consumer-electronics retailer suspended share repurchases and
reported preliminary fourth-quarter earnings that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  Amazon’s Results  Amazon.com tumbled 9.2 percent to $176.61 after the close
of regular trading. The company also reported a 57 percent
decline in  profit , dragged down by shipping costs and the money-
losing Kindle Fire.  The S&P 500 Diversified Financials Index rose 0.8 percent,
the most among 24 groups.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  advanced 2.5 percent to
$18.65. Goldman Sachs climbed 1.6 percent to $111.47.  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  gained 5.1 percent to $30.19. The
country’s largest producer of the metal by volume forecast
improved prices and shipments at its biggest division.  Mattel Inc. (MAT)  rallied 5 percent to $31. The world’s largest
toymaker increased its dividend and reported fourth-quarter
profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  “Seems like markets are at a crossroad,”  Larry Peruzzi ,
senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc. in Boston,
wrote in an e-mail. “Investors are concerned about growth
slowing down and European issues lingering but at the same time
do not want to miss a rally that many feel is slowly
developing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
