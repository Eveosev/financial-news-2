2Co Energy Ltd., a British
emissions-reduction company, enlisted  Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT)  to work
on its 5 billion-pound ($7.9 billion) carbon-capture and storage
project in northern  England .  Foster Wheeler Energy Ltd., the Reading, England-based unit
of the global engineering group, was appointed project
management consultant for the 3 billion-pound power plant at the
Don Valley project, 2Co said today in an e-mailed statement.  The planned 650-megawatt project in South Yorkshire will
use carbon-capture technology to siphon away about 90 percent of
the plantâ€™s emissions for storage underground. The U.K. is
touting the technology to meet emissions-cutting targets and
says it will make 1 billion pounds in funding available in a
contest for new projects.  The power plant near the Hatfield coal mine with carbon-
capture technology will cost 3 billion pounds. The balance of
the 5 billion-pound total investment will cover the pipeline
transporting the carbon-dioxide emissions for injection
underground, work offshore and additional enhanced oil recovery,
according to 2Co. Work at the plant may begin in 2013, and
operations in 2016, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
