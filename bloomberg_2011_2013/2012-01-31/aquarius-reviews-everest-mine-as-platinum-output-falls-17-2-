Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP) , the world’s
fourth-largest producer, is reviewing its Everest mine in  South
Africa  after a strike and safety stops curbed output and
compounded the effect of lower metal prices.  A two-week strike at Everest cost 13 production days and
Aquarius is reviewing its agreement with the contractor, the
London-based company said in a statement today. “Near-term poor
ground conditions” and delays in permitting the open-cast
reserves added to the decision, it said.  Aquarius reported a 17 percent retreat in platinum group
metals output to 105,629 ounces for the quarter ended Dec. 31
from a year earlier, including a 26 percent drop at Everest to
18,712 ounces. The company’s shares extended yesterday’s 6.7
percent decline, falling 4.9 percent to 171 pence at the close
of trade in  London .  Platinum fell 9.8 percent to an average $1,533 an ounce
during the quarter from $1,700 a year earlier. Copper and other
metals also declined as the outlook for global economic growth
dimmed, damping prospects for demand for metals like platinum,
used in car emission devices and jewelry.  Aquarius will limit production at Everest to 10,000
platinum group metals ounces a month for the next 12 to 18
months while the review is completed, the company said.  Second-quarter output missed the 120,000 ounce estimate of
Credit Suisse Securities ( Europe ) Ltd., which said in a note
today that an 87 percent cost increase at the Kroondal mine was
a “big disappointment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
