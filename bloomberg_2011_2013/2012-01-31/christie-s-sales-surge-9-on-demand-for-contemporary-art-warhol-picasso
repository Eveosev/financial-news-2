Christie’s International (CHRS)  said there
was a surge in demand for contemporary art as an investment,
after its sales climbed 9 percent in 2011.  The London-based auction house sold 3.6 billion pounds
($5.7 billion) of art and collectibles last year, a pound-
sterling record for the company, it said in an e-mailed release
sent last night. Contemporary works -- led by  Roy Lichtenstein ,
 Andy Warhol  and Mark Rothko -- were the most lucrative category,
contributing 735.7 million pounds at public sales, an increase
of 22 percent.  Diminished returns from stocks and other financial
investments have encouraged wealthy individuals to turn to art,
particularly classic contemporary works, as an alternative asset
class.  “Investors are entering the market and existing collectors
are buying more,” Steven Murphy, Christie’s chief executive,
said in an interview. “The ease with which information and
images can be accessed through the Internet is also helping
create a fundamental increase in demand.”  Equivalent auctions for Impressionist and modern pieces --a
powerhouse of record results since the 1980s -- declined 28
percent to 548.6 million pounds, behind Asian art at 552.9
million pounds, which increased 13 percent in 2011.  This is only the second year that contemporary art has
topped auctions at Christie’s. Catalogs featuring works by
artists such as Warhol,  Damien Hirst  and  Jeff Koons  generated a
record 772 million pounds of sales in 2007.  Lichtenstein, Rothko  Lichtenstein’s 1961 canvas “I Can See the Whole Room!… And
There’s Nobody in It!” was the most expensive individual lot at
Christie’s in 2011, fetching a record $43.2 million in New York
on Nov. 8. Paintings by Warhol and Rothko sold for $38.4 million
and $33.7 million respectively in May.  Pablo Picasso’s 1939 painting, “Femme assise, robe
bleue,” was the top Impressionist and modern seller at 18
million pounds in  London  in June.  “I wouldn’t attribute trends to one year of sales,”
Murphy said. “Great works by Picasso and Modigliani emerged
from collections in 2010. There’s always an ebb and flow of
quality appearing at auctions.”  Private transactions increased 44 percent to 502 million
pounds in 2011. These include an undisclosed amount of sales at
 Haunch of Venison , a London-based gallery wholly owned by
Christie’s, which said that 20th-century art and jewelry were
the main contributors to the overall total.  Elizabeth Taylor  Christie’s 2011 figures were boosted by the five-catalog
sale in  New York  in December of  Elizabeth Taylor ’s collection.
All 1,778 lots found buyers, raising a total of $157 million. An
inaugural online auction of lower-value items that had belonged
to the Oscar-winning actress, who died last year, contributed
$9.5 million.  Collectors are still reluctant to buy big-ticket art via
the Internet. Just two of the 719 works Christie’s sold for more
than $1 million in 2011 were bought using online bidding.  New York remains the company’s biggest auction center, with
1.2 billion pounds of sales in 2011, 6 percent down on 2010.
London, which hosts three series of contemporary-art auctions
each year, was up 20 percent to 871.6 million pounds.  Growth in  Hong Kong  slowed to 11 percent with 519.1 million
pounds of transactions. In 2010, auctions in  Asia  rose 114
percent.  China , Hong Kong and  Taiwan ’s share of client
registrations from increased just 2 percent last year.  International Clients  New clients represented 12 percent of the value of
Christie’s international sales, the auction house said.  Christie’s is a private company owned by the French
billionaire  Francois Pinault . The auction house was bought by
Pinault’s holding company, Artemis SA, for $1.2 billion in May
1998. Christie’s doesn’t report revenue or profit, though it
gives sale totals twice a year.  Christie’s said its policy, in line with U.K. accounting
standards, is to convert non-U.K. results using an average
 exchange rate  weighted daily by sales throughout the year. This
would make the 2011 total of 3.6 billion pounds come to $5.7
billion. In 2010, it had sales of 3.3 billion pounds.  Sotheby’s (BID)  said that it will release its consolidated total
of private and auction sales for 2011 at the end of February. It
raised $4.8 billion in 2010.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
