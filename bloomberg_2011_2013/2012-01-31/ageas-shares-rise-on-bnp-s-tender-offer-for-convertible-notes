Ageas (AGS) , the majority owner of
 Belgium ’s biggest life insurer, rose as much as 6 percent in
Brussels trading after announcing that BNP Paribas SA’s tender
offer for undated convertible notes closed successfully.  The shares climbed as much as 9.1 cents to 1.616 euros and
traded at 1.59 euros, or 4.3 percent higher, at 9:41 a.m. local
time. The stock is up 28 percent this year.  BNP Paribas got acceptances for more than 50 percent at an
offer price of 47.5 percent of face value in its tender offer
for undated convertible notes, or so-called CASHES, sold by
Fortis Bank that can be converted into Ageas shares, Ageas said
today in a statement.  The offer by BNP Paribas is part of a settlement of some
remaining liabilities from Ageas’s Fortis legacy and will reduce
the credit risk on Fortis Bank SA/NV and will make Ageas’s
earnings less volatile, according to Ageas.  Ageas will announce more details, including the impact on
earnings, after BNP Paribas discloses how many tendered CASHES
it will convert into Ageas shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
