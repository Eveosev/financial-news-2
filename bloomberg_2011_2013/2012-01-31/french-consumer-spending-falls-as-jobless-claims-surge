(Corrects decline in second paragraph.)  French  consumer spending  fell in
December as surging joblessness and concern about looming tax
increases prompted households to cut back.  Spending fell 0.7 percent from November, when it fell 0.1
percent, national statistics office Insee said today in an e-
mailed statement. Economists expected an increase of 0.2
percent, according to the median of 18 estimates gathered by
Bloomberg News.  Household purchases have hovered around zero since August
and were down 3.1 percent in December from a year earlier,
underlining consumer pessimism as  Europe ’s second-largest
economy tips into  recession . Jobless claims jumped to as 12-year
high of 29,700 in December as President  Nicolas Sarkozy  prepared
to implement the second-round of tax increases and spending cuts
in less than half a year.  “Consumers are being pressured by the growing unemployment
and the coming austerity,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief
economist at Exane BNP Paribas in  London .  The nation’s gross domestic product probably shrank in the
fourth quarter and may do so again in the three months to March,
Insee estimated last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
