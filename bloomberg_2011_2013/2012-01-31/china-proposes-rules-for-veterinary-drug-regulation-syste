China’s Ministry of Agriculture
published a draft proposal to sort veterinary drugs into
prescription and non-prescription categories to enhance
supervision and promote clinical use.  Prescription and non-prescription drugs will be sold
separately, according to the draft, posted on the  website  of the
State Council’s Legislative Affairs Office Jan. 29. The public
has until Feb. 29 to send feedback.  County-level veterinary departments will set prescription
rules for veterinary drugs, according to the draft.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
