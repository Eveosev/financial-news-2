A gauge of Swiss consumer demand
rose in December, suggesting the economy is stabilizing.  The  consumption indicator , which signals developments about
three months ahead, advanced to 0.92 from a revised 0.78 in the
previous month, UBS AG in Zurich said in an e-mailed statement
today. It had previously reported a November reading of 0.81.  “The UBS economists are confident that the consumption
indicator has bottomed out and believe it could rise over the
course of the year,” UBS said in the statement. “The
persistently high immigration of  labor force  is likely to
continue to support domestic consumption.”  The consumer indicator is based on new car sales, retail
sales, the number of domestic overnight stays by Swiss
residents, consumer confidence and credit-card transactions made
via UBS at points of sale in  Switzerland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
