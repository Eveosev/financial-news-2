The online VIP Art Fair is returning
for its second cyber outing.  The fair, whose initials stand for “viewing in private,”
invites visitors to browse the virtual booths of about 130
exhibitors from 36 countries, Feb. 3 through Feb. 8.  “The difference from a regular art fair is that your feet
don’t get tired,” said Jane Cohan, a co-founder along with art
dealer James Cohan and Internet entrepreneurs Jonas and
Alessandra Almgren.  Technical problems affected its 2011 debut, including a
jammed live-chat system between buyers and dealers.  “The system had a lot of glitches so it was easy to lose
interest quickly,” said Lenore Schorr, Los Angeles-based art
collector.  VIP 2.0, previewing on Feb. 2, has more sophisticated
technology and a simpler interface. The company also increased
its staff, hired a chief executive officer, Lisa Kennedy, and
received $1 million in investment. The chat platform is hosted
by an outside company on a separate server, which should prevent
the main website from getting overloaded.  “I think they took into account everything that didn’t
work and made it better,” said Magdalena Sawon, co-owner of
 Postmasters Gallery  in Chelsea,  Manhattan , who is participating
in the fair for the second time.  More than 50,000 people from 139 countries have registered.
Free access allows searching the website by artist or price
range, devising personal tours and sharing links to artworks on
Twitter and Facebook.  Chat Functions  It costs $50 to use the live-chat function, unless you’ve
received a complimentary pass from the exhibitors.  Like last year, prices range from less than $5,000 to more
than $1 million. More than 90 galleries have artworks priced at
less than $10,000. The biggest surprise: Gagosian gallery,
offering Hirst’s spot prints at $3,000 to $7,000.  There are 10 artworks priced at $1 million or more, down
from 50 in 2011. This group includes a 2001 Luc Tuymans
painting, “Eyes.” New York’s Van de Weghe Fine Art lists a
1990 Richard Prince joke painting at $1.3 million.  Alan Greenspan  Postmasters will devote its booth to New York artist
William Powhida. His giant 44-by-90-inch print “Griftopia,”
based on Mike Taibbi’s 2010 book, depicts  Alan Greenspan ,  Lloyd Blankfein  and other major players involved in the recent
financial crisis. It comes in an edition of 13; the first three
will be priced at $4,500.  While painting is the dominant medium, with 389 examples,
some galleries opted for more unusual choices. Elizabeth Dee
Gallery will only show video art and Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac
will stream a live, 24-hour performance-art piece by Terence Koh
on Feb. 3.  “The more transparency and the more digital opportunity
there is in the art world, the better,” said Dean Valentine, a
Los Angeles-based collector.  VIP 2.0 runs Feb. 3 through Feb. 8. Information:

devoted to works on paper and photography running from April 20-
22 and July 13-15 respectively.  To contact the reporter of this story:
