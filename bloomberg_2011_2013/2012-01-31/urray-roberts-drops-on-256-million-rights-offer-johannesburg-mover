Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. ,
 South Africa ’s second-biggest construction company, fell the
most in a month after saying it plans to sell 2 billion rand
($256 million) of stock to cut debt and fund expansion.  Murray declined 4.3 percent, the most since Dec. 14, to
26.80 rand at the close in Johannesburg.  “Many expected a turnaround in the South African
construction sector, but this shows that things are still not
rosy,” Hugan Chetty, an analyst with Johannesburg-based
Afrifocus Securities said by phone today. “There may be a 5
percent to 10 percent drop in share prices in this sector before
a turnaround.” Chetty, who has a “hold” recommendation on the
stock, will be revising his recommendation, he said.  The rights issue will boost a recovery and growth plan
aimed at restoring profit “as soon as practically possible,”
Johannesburg-based Murray & Roberts said in a statement today.  Murray & Roberts posted a fiscal loss of 5.05 rand a share
in the year through June before one-time items and resolved not
to pay dividends until its liquidity improved following a
slowdown in South African spending on infrastructure and
unresolved claims with projects in its home market and Dubai.
Murray & Roberts, which helped build the Gautrain rapid-rail
network that links Johannesburg and  Pretoria , has operations in
the  Middle East  and  Australia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
