Shanghai  plans to become a global
center for yuan trading by 2015, open its markets wider to
foreign investors and almost triple non-currency financial
transactions.  The city will allow “significantly more” foreign
participation in its financial markets, according to the  plan 
jointly published by the National Development and Reform
Commission and the Shanghai government yesterday. Shanghai aims
to have about 1,000 trillion yuan ($158 trillion) in financial
trading, excluding the currency transactions, by 2015, compared
with 386.2 trillion yuan in 2010, the plan said.  Shanghai’s currency market is now largely limited to
domestic clients because of controls on capital flows and  Hong
Kong  has been allowed to start an offshore market for trading
the yuan. Buyers of yuan still need to seek approval to bring
the currency into mainland China for investment purposes.  The Shanghai interbank offered rate will become the
benchmark interest rate for pricing yuan-denominated assets at
home and abroad, while the yuan  reference rate  will become the
key  exchange rate , according to the plan. China said in March
2009 it aimed to make Shanghai a world financial center
commensurate with the nation’s economic strength by 2020.  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
