Ukraine’s central bank will
liquidate PAT Bank Stolytsya after the lender failed to restore
financial stability following the 2008 global credit crisis.  The  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  appointed Evhen Kuno to
supervise the liquidation process, according to a  statement  on
the Kiev, Ukraine-based regulator’s website today. The central
bank took the decision yesterday, it said.  Ukrainian banks were shaken by the global financial crisis,
which dried up credit and weakened regional currencies. The
former Soviet republic was forced to seek an International
Monetary Fund bailout to support its financial industry.  Ukraine was in the process of liquidating 21 banks as of
Dec. 29, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
