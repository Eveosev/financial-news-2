Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  said new regulations for the financial system must
include regimes to handle failing banks that expose debt and
equity investors to losses.  Officials involved in international efforts to rewrite bank
rules “are determined, and are on course, to put a credible
resolution regime in place,” Tucker wrote in a chapter of the
book “Investing in Change” that the central bank released in
 London  today.  “This will ensure that, as well as equity holders, debt
holders are exposed to loss,” he said. “Wholesale creditors
will then also have a powerful incentive to monitor the risks
banks run, increasing market discipline. This is central to
reincorporating banks into a market economy.”  Efforts to strengthen the stability of the financial system
must also address the links between companies, and that should
include regulation to improve transparency in  capital markets .
Tucker said he would favor rules that impose “tighter controls
to large exposures” at the world’s largest and most
systemically important banks.  “On a second front, central banks can, and should, play a
more active role in monitoring and fostering robust practices
and infrastructure in the short-term financing markets -– repo,
 securities lending , commercial paper, and so on,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
