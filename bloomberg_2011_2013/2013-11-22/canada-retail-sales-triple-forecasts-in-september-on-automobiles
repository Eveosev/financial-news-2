Canadian  retail sales  rose more than
three times faster than economists forecast in September on the
biggest gain at new  car dealerships  in more than four years.  Sales rose 1 percent to a record C$40.7 billion ($38.6
billion), the third consecutive increase, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa. The gain exceeded all 19 economist forecasts in
a Bloomberg  survey  that had a median 0.3 percent increase.  The report adds to evidence that consumers continue to be
key driver of the economy, even with debt levels at records.
 Consumer confidence  reached a 2-1/2 year high at the end of
September as employment rose and the housing market remained
buoyant, according to the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence
Index.  The report “suggests consumers still have a bit of
optimism,” said  David Tulk , chief macro strategist for TD
Securities Inc. in Toronto.  The Canadian dollar weakened 0.2 percent to C$1.0538 per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:26 a.m. in Toronto. Statistics Canada reported
separately that Canada’s annual inflation rate slowed more than
economists forecast to 0.7 percent in October.  The  Bank of Canada  estimates that consumption will
contribute 1.3 percentage points to the 1.6 percent growth rate
it forecasts for the economy this year.  Motor vehicle and parts sales rose 4.1 percent to C$9.72
billion, a gain of 10.5 percent since September 2012. New car
dealership receipts jumped 5 percent to C$7.90 billion, the
biggest rise since January 2009.  Ex-Auto Sales  Purchases  excluding  the motor vehicle and parts category
were little changed, lagging economist forecasts they would
increase 0.2 percent.  Food and beverage store sales fell 0.3 percent in September
while gasoline  station  sales rose 0.8 percent. Sales advanced in
six of 11 categories representing 55 percent of total sales.  The August retail sales increase was reduced to 0.1 percent
from an earlier estimate of 0.2 percent.  The volume of sales rose 1 percent in September. That
measure excludes the effects of price changes and more closely
reflects the industry’s contribution to economic growth.  Sales in September were 3.6 percent higher than  a year
earlier ,  Statistics Canada  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
