Gasoline slumped from a two-month
high on speculation restart of a unit at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s New
Jersey refinery will help boost supplies from a one-year low.  Prices sank as much as 0.8 percent, reversing a 0.9 percent
rally. Phillips 66’s 238,000-barrel-a-day  Bayway site , the
closest plant to the New York Harbor delivery point for U.S.
gasoline and diesel futures, is starting a fluid catalytic
cracker today after a maintenance outage that began in October,
according to a person familiar with operations.  “Any good news on the refining front is good for the
market,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “The recent outages caused some
supply concerns for gasoline.”  Gasoline futures for December delivery dropped 1.25 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $2.7313 a gallon at 10:24 a.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 12 percent higher
than the 100-day average for the time of day.  The startup comes as Motiva Enterprises LLC carries out
maintenance in  Port Arthur , Texas, and Norco,  Louisiana , and
after fires broke out at sites in the Netherlands and  Belgium .
 U.S. gasoline stockpiles  slipped to 208.8 million in the week
ended Nov. 15, the lowest since Nov. 23, 2012, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. Supplies along the East
Coast, or PADD 1 region, sank to 52.4 million, the least since
December.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus West  Texas  Intermediate oil,
a rough measure of refining profitability, widened 78 cents to
$19.54 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to European benchmark Brent
oil slid 42 cents to $3.70.  Bayway Restart  “The reporting of Bayway restart coincided with an abrupt
turn in refined product values, particularly RBOB,” said Tom Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group Ltd. in Jupiter,
Florida. “As Bayway is one of the largest refineries in PADD 1,
this is a noteworthy bellwether for continued emergency from
turnaround season leading to increasing output.”  Prices at the pump  increased 1.5 cents to average $3.235 a
gallon across the U.S., the highest level since Nov. 4,
according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring group.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel rose 1.4 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$3.0207 a gallon, a five-week high. Volume was 94 percent above
the average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI widened $1.60 to $32.40 a barrel.
The  crack spread  versus Brent increased 38 cents to $16.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
