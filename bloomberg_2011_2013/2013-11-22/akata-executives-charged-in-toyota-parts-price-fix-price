Three  Takata Corp. (7312)  executives agreed
to plead guilty to conspiring to fix prices for seatbelts sold
to automakers including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,
the U.S. said.  The three were charged with participating in a conspiracy
to rig bids and have agreed to serve prison sentences of 14 to
19 months, the Justice Department said today in a statement.  The charges stem from an investigation into price-fixing in
the auto-parts industry. In September, nine Japanese companies
agreed to plead guilty and pay $740 million in fines for their
roles in conspiracies to fix prices of more than 30 products
sold to carmakers.  The three Takata executives -- Yasuhiko Ueno, Saburo
Imamiya and Yoshinobu Fujino -- agreed to cooperate in the
investigation. Takata, based in Tokyo, agreed to pay a
$71.3 million criminal fine in October.  Besides Toyota and Honda, the seatbelts were sold to  Nissan
Motor (7201)  Co., Subaru and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Justice Department
said.  The cases are U.S. v. Ueno, 13-cr-20869; U.S. v. Imamiya,
13-cr-20871; U.S. v. Fujino, 13-cr-20870, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Michigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
