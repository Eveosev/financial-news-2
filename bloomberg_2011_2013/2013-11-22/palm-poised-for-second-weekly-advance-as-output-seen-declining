Palm oil dropped for the first time
in three days on concern that a rally to the highest level in 14
months may weaken demand.  The contract for delivery in February fell 0.4 percent to
close at 2,642 ringgit ($819) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives, after rising as much as 1.5 percent to 2,692
ringgit, the highest level for most-active futures since
September 2012. Futures advanced 1.1 percent this week.  Palm oil’s narrowing discount to soybean oil will reduce
demand for the tropical oil and divert some Chinese and Indian
food demand to seed oils, said James Fry, chairman of LMC
International Ltd.. Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil prices
narrowed to $99.498 a ton today from $137.0355 a month ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shipments from Malaysia fell 2 percent to 1 million tons in
the first 20 days of November, data from surveyor Intertek show.
Futures entered a bull market on Nov. 1 and are heading for the
first annual advance in three years on expectation of a decline
in production in Indonesia and Malaysia, the world’s biggest
producers, due to heavy rains.  “Prices are down on profit booking ahead of the weekend
after the sharp rise earlier,” said Isha Trivedi, an analyst at
PhillipCapital India Pvt. in Mumbai. “We can expect declining
production for at least the next two months because of the
monsoon.”  Refined palm oil for May delivery gained 1.1 percent to
close at 6,440  yuan  ($1,057) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, the highest price at close for most-active futures
since March 12. Soybean oil climbed 0.4 percent to 7,302 yuan.  Soybeans for January delivery rose 0.5 percent to $12.985 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil fell 0.4
percent to 41.63 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
