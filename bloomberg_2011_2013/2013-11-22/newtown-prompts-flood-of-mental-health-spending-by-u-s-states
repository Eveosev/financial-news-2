Most U.S. states boosted spending
this year on mental-health programs as lawmakers reacted to the
slaughter of 20 Connecticut schoolchildren and six adults at the
hands of a gunman.  Thirty-seven states increased spending in 2013, while
another eight kept spending at the previous year’s level,
according to a  report  by the  National Alliance  on Mental
Illness.  Alaska ,  Wyoming ,  Nebraska , Louisiana,  North Carolina 
and Maine cut spending.  The Newtown, Connecticut, shooting in December prompted
state lawmakers to begin restoring mental-health budgets that
were reduced by $4.35 billion between 2009 and 2012 as the
recession’s aftermath sapped income- and sales-tax revenue.
Spending also is up as states bring health programs in line with
the federal Affordable Care Act.  “A tipping point on the heels of several recent mass
shootings, the Newtown tragedy shaped the debate about the lack
of access to mental  health services  and the barriers that many
families and individuals face in light of the nation’s
fragmented and grossly inadequate mental health system,” the
Arlington, Virginia-based organization said in its Oct. 28
report.  Swelling Revenue  In the shooting’s wake, legislatures began passing laws to
help better screen and identify people who are mentally ill,
particularly children and teenagers. States such as New York
passed laws that link mental-health records to background checks
for gun purchases. Arkansas now requires mental-health service
providers to warn  law enforcement  about any credible threat by a
patient.  Texas lawmakers agreed to spend $259 million more for
mental health in the current biennial budget, the single largest
such increase in the state’s history, according to the report.
California lawmakers agreed to spend $143 million more to add
2,000 beds at clinics and hire 600 triage workers to staff 25
new crisis centers.  States have been able to spend more as revenue grew an
estimated  5.3 percent  in 2013, according to the  National
Conference of State Legislatures .  The mental-health spending met with little resistance in
comparison with efforts to pass tougher gun-control laws.
Lawmakers in New York, Colorado, Connecticut Maryland and
elsewhere approved tighter restrictions on firearms, though
federal efforts stalled amid opposition from groups such as the
 National Rifle Association .  As many as 2.65 million people with mental illness in the
U.S. will qualify for subsidies to buy health insurance under
the initial enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act. The
federal law allows state to expand Medicaid, the state-federal
health program for low-income people so that more people are
covered. Medicaid already pays for about 27 percent of all
mental-health financing in the U.S.  Twenty-five states expanded Medicaid coverage in 2013,
according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
