DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA) ,
 Fresenius Medical Care AG (FME)  and other dialysis companies received
a break from U.S. regulators, who are scrapping a proposed 9.4
percent cut in Medicare payments to the companies next year.  DaVita, the second-largest dialysis provider in the U.S.,
rose 13 percent in late trading after the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services finalized a rule today that keeps payments
flat for 2014. Medicare proposed in July the 9.4 percent cut in
pay for treating patients with end-stage renal disease.  Much of the original proposal was linked to a  federal
budget  agreement that targeted overspending on anemia drugs such
as  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s Epogen. Medicare, the U.S. health plan for the
elderly and disabled, estimates it will spend $8.8 billion on
end-stage renal disease facilities in 2014, according to the
 rule .  DaVita rose 13 percent to $63.69 at 4:39 p.m. after closing
at $56.54. Shares of Denver-based DaVita and  Germany ’s Fresenius
had tumbled in July when the cuts were proposed.  About 414,000 people in the U.S. in 2010 were on dialysis,
a procedure in which waste is periodically removed from the
blood in patients with malfunctioning kidneys. Diabetes and high
blood pressure are the most common reasons for kidney failure.  Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent
company of Bloomberg News, has served on DaVita’s board since
1994.  Bad Homburg, Germany-based Fresenius is the world’s biggest
provider of kidney dialysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
