Spot metallurgical coal in the U.S.
was little changed because of sparse demand for lower-quality
grades of the steelmaking component, IHS Inc.’s Energy
Publishing said.  Low-volatility coal fell 20 cents last week to $141.05 a
ton, according to the Knoxville, Tennessee-based data provider.  “The combination of limited availability of high-quality
coals and weak demand for second-tier material continues to
result in stalled market activity,” it said.  IHS Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
