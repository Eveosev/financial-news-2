 Richard Gelfond, chief executive 
officer of  Imax Corp. (IMX) , says the company hopes to more than 
double its theater count in  China , its second largest market 
after the United States.  He also discusses the forces pushing 
the Chinese government to stricter enforcement of intellectual 
property laws, a shift that has benefitted IMAX.  Gelfond spoke 
with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hays and Vonnie Quinn in an interview 
at Bloomberg's Look Ahead to 2014 conference in Chicago which 
aired on Nov. 21 on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 08:27
