Japan  will add refueling planes and
expand its fleet of high-speed warships to boost the security of
its remote islands, the Yomiuri newspaper said, as the nation
squares off with China over islands that both sides claim.  Japan will at least double the number of refueling planes
from the current four so aircraft can stay in the air longer
while patrolling around distant islands, the newspaper said. It
also plans to introduce smaller warships that can maneuver
better, the Yomiuri said, without saying where it got the
information.  The changes, which the Yomiuri said will be included in a
new 10-year defense plan to be announced next month, reflect a
broader strategic shift by Japan as  China  expands its military
power and the two nations challenge each other over the East
China Sea islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe increased the defense budget in 2013
for the first time in 11 years.  The Defense Ministry wants another budget increase for next
year, a move that would return military spending to its highest
level since 2005. Abe also wants to reinterpret the countryâ€™s
pacifist constitution to allow Japan to defend allies and has
further loosened restrictions on arms exports.  Japan plans to boost the number of Aegis ballistic missile
defense ships in its fleet to eight from six, the paper said. In
a separate report, the Mainichi newspaper said Japan would cut
the number of tanks from 740 to 300 over the next decade, while
introducing 200 light combat vehicles by 2023.  To contact the reporter on this story:
