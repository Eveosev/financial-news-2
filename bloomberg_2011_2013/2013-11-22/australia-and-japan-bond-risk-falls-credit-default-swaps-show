The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in  Japan  and  Australia  declined, according to
traders of credit default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index retreated 1.5 basis
points to 104 basis points as of 11:46 a.m. in Sydney, according
to Citigroup Inc. The measure, which is falling for a second
day, is poised for a 1.1 basis-point rise this week, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1 basis point to 80
as of 9:40 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
gauge is falling for a third consecutive day and is on track for
a 5 basis-point decrease this week, which would be the most
since the five days ended Nov. 15, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 132 basis points
as of 8:41 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is poised for a 1.7 basis-point drop this week, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
