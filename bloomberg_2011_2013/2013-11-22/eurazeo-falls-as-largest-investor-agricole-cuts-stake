French private-equity firm  Eurazeo
SA (RF)  declined in Paris as  Credit Agricole  SA, its largest
shareholder, is cutting its stake by more than half through a
private share sale and a three-year bond issue.  Eurazeo dropped as much as 5.1 percent and was down 4.5
percent at 53.51 euros by 10:35 a.m. local time, giving the
company a market value of about 3.7 billion euros ($5 billion).
 Credit Agricole (ACA)  was almost unchanged at 8.83 euros.  Credit Agricole,  France ’s third-largest bank by market
value, is raising 174 million euros by selling 4.7 percent of
Eurazeo, the Montrouge-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement today. Credit Agricole also issued zero-coupon bonds
exchangeable in Eurazeo shares in 2016 for an initial amount of
293 million euros. The  bond issue  may increase by 15 percent to
a maximum of 337 million euros.  “The proceeds from the share placement and the bond issue
will be used for general corporate purposes,” the bank said.  The bonds have a price of 66.31 euros apiece, 22 percent
less than the shares placement’s price, Credit Agricole’s said.
The sale of Paris-based Eurazeo shares is scheduled for Nov. 27,
while the bonds are to start trading on the Luxembourg’s Euro
MTF market on Dec. 6, the lender said.  Credit Agricole owns 17.4 percent of Eurazeo, data compiled
