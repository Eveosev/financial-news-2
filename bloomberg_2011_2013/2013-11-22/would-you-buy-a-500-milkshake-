You know what would go perfectly with  a $1,954 dinner ? A $500 milkshake. Yes, that's right: we live in a world that sells $500 milkshakes.  The Powder Room , a Los Angeles cocktail bar opening on November 22, is where you'll find this pricey (spiked) pour dubbed the Velvet Goldmine. The exact recipe is still under development by award-winning mixologist Adrian Biggs, but it's said to feature premium spirits, edible gold, Belgian chocolate—and will come garnished with this blingy,  Swarovski crystal ring . Representatives of The Powder Room added that the shake is "lush and over-the-top," and that the ring is a fun takeaway, like "finding a prize at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box." (Uh, we guess…). Owner John Arakaki explained, not surprisingly, that the pricey milkshake is geared more toward diners celebrating special occasions like birthdays or bachelorette parties. Not willing to drop $500 on one drink? No matter—The Powder Room also offers other appealing alternatives that are much easier on the wallet. Spiked milkshakes like the Steel Magnolia (red velvet vodka blended with red velvet cake, cream cheese frosting, and vanilla ice cream), and the Adam's Apple (Jack Daniels blended with cinammon-caramelized apples, nutmeg, and vanilla ice cream), will only set you back $13 each.
