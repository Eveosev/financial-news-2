Mexican  consumer prices  rose more
than expected in the first half of November, deepening
expectations central bankers will refrain from additional
 interest-rate  cuts.  Prices increased 0.85 percent in the first two weeks of the
month, the national statistics agency said today, compared with
the 0.74 percent median forecast of 19 economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  Annual inflation  quickened to 3.51 percent from 3.36
percent in October. The central bank targets inflation of 3
percent.  The bank this month raised its forecast for inflation next
year to 3.5 percent, citing tax increases. Policy makers cut the
key interest rate three times this year to a record-low 3.5
percent as growth slowed, while signaling that the Oct. 25
quarter-point reduction would be the last for the foreseeable
future. That stance gained support from yesterday’s report
showing the economy expanded more than forecast in the third
quarter.  “Taking into consideration the impact of the fiscal
reform, a rate below 3.5 percent at this time is not necessary,
adequate for the convergence” of inflation to the target, bank
Governor Agustin Carstens said in an Oct. 30 interview.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 13.0203 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:02 a.m. in Mexico City. Yields on inflation-linked government
peso bonds due in June 2016 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
