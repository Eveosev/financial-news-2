Siemens AG (SIE)  will probably appoint
investor relations head Mariel von Drathen, strategy chief Horst Kayser and incoming personnel strategy head Janina Kugel to a
new executive support group below the management board,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The person asked not to be identified as the members of the
six-person group of executives, which will support the
management board by running day-to-day operations, haven’t been
announced yet. Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser
said earlier today at a conference in Berlin that the group will
start in January. He didn’t reveal the names of the executives,
while saying that “two to three will be women.” A Siemens
representative declined to comment.  The six managers will “allow the executive board to
concentrate on the company’s core competencies,” Kaeser said.  Former finance chief Kaeser became CEO this year after
predecessor  Peter Loescher  slashed a profit target five times in
his six-year tenure. To match the profitability of rivals such
as ABB Ltd. and General Electric Co., Kaeser is trying to reduce
charges for mismanaged projects that have weighed upon earnings
of Munich-based Siemens,  Europe ’s biggest engineering company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
