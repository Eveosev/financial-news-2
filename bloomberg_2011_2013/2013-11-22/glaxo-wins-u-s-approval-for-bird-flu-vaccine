GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  won approval for
the first vaccine to prevent bird flu that allows for a higher
number of doses to be made available during a pandemic, U.S.
regulators said.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared the vaccine for
H5N1 influenza for use in people 18 years of age and older at
increased risk of exposure to the virus, the agency said
yesterday in a  statement . Bird flu has caused serious illness
and death outside of the U.S. mainly among people who come in
close contact with infected and ill poultry, the FDA said.  The vaccine from London-based Glaxo isn’t for commercial
use, rather will be kept in the U.S. national stockpile, the
agency said. About 60 percent of people who become infected die
from bird flu. ID Biomedical Corp., a Glaxo subsidiary based in
 Quebec City , makes the vaccine with an adjuvant of oil-in-water
emulsion to enhance the immune response of patients, allowing
the vaccine to stretch further, the FDA said.  “This vaccine could be used in the event that the H5N1
avian influenza virus develops the capability to spread
efficiently from human to human, resulting in the rapid spread
of disease across the globe,” Karen Midthun, director of the
FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
