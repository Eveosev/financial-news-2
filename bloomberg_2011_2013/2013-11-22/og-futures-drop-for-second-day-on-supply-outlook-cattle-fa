Hog futures declined for the second
straight day as an increase in U.S. processing and fatter
animals signaled that U.S. pork supplies will increase. Cattle
prices fell.  This week, the hog slaughter has climbed 3.5 percent to
1.75 million animals from a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Carcass  weights  in the  Iowa  and
southern Minnesota region averaged a record 281.2 pounds (127.6
kilograms) in the week ended Nov. 16, up 2.7 percent from a year
earlier, government data showed Nov. 20.  “We have been running slaughter at 438,000 a day, which is
extremely strong,” Doug Houghton, a Brock Associates analyst in
 Milwaukee , said in a telephone interview. “Supplies are peaking
a little bit later than earlier years.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.4 percent to
90.25 cents a pound at 10:02 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Yesterday, the price declined 0.4 percent.  Cattle futures for February delivery declined 0.2 percent
to $1.32075 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose less than
0.1 percent to $1.6345.  To contact the reporter on this story:
