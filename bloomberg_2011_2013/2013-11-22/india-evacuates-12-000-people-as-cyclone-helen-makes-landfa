Cyclone Helen, the second storm to
hit  India  in five weeks, made landfall in southern  Andhra
Pradesh  state today, prompting authorities to evacuate 12,000
people and deploy rescue teams.  At least six districts will be affected by the cyclone,
which is packing winds as fast as 120 kilometers (75 miles) an
hour, Vinod Kumar Ekbote, additional commissioner of the state’s
 disaster management  department, said by telephone. Falling trees
killed two people in Krishna district,  Press Trust of India 
reported, citing officials it didn’t name.  “We are fully prepared and keeping our fingers crossed,”
Ekbote said, adding heavy rainfall and some damage is likely.
Four helicopters, about 500 people from the  National Disaster
Management Authority  and state government officials are prepared
to deal with the situation, he said.  Some 39 people were killed last month by cyclone  Phailin ,
the most powerful tropical storm to hit India’s eastern coast
since 1999. Phailin lashed Odisha and adjoining Andhra Pradesh
with winds of up to 220 kilometers per hour. India evacuated
about 1.2 million people, the largest such effort in the
nation’s history, to contain casualties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
