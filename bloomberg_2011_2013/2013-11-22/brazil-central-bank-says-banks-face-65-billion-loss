Brazil’s banks  may have to spend 149
billion reais ($65 billion) if the  Supreme Court  supports
consumers seeking to recover deposits lost in an economic
overhaul more than two decades ago, the central bank said.  “One quarter of the financial-system capital would be
impacted,” Isaac Ferreira, the central bank’s prosecutor, told
reporters in Brasilia today after meeting with Chief Justice
Joaquim Barbosa. Court decisions benefiting depositors would cut
about 1 trillion reais in available credit nationwide, Ferreira
said.  STF, as the Brasilia-based court is known, is set to
starting ruling Nov. 27 on a depositor lawsuits stemming from
Brazil’s efforts to stem hyperinflation from 1986 to 1994. The
government froze  bank deposits , introduced new currency and
reduced returns on  savings accounts .  Brazil’s bank association, Febraban, said lenders complied
with the law that was in effect and shouldn’t be penalized,
according to an e-mailed statement. The association declined to
comment on the central bank’s estimated losses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
