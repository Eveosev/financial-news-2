Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s Pixar studio is
eliminating jobs after deciding to delay next year’s theatrical
release “The Good Dinosaur.”  The cuts amount to less than 5 percent of Pixar’s 1,200
employees, according to a person with knowledge of the matter
who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.
That’s fewer than than 60 positions.  “We are constantly re-evaluating the creative and business
needs of our studio,” Emeryville, California-based Pixar said
in a statement, without providing specific numbers. “With the
release date change of ‘The Good Dinosaur,’ we have realigned
our production and support priorities, which includes a small
reduction in our staffing.”  The decision to delay “The Good Dinosaur” for 18 months
left the animation studio that produced “Toy Story” and
“Cars” without an annual release for the first time since
2005. Disney announced the later date in September and said in
October it would close a Vancouver facility.  “The Good Dinosaur,” about a 70-foot-tall teenage
Apatosaurus that befriends a young boy, was pushed back to Nov.
25, 2015, Disney said at the time.  Disney, based in  Burbank ,  California ,  rose  0.4 percent to
$70.20 at 4 p.m. in  New York , an all-time closing high. The
stock has gained 41 percent this year.  Pixar’s most-recent release, “Monsters University,” has
grossed $743.4 million worldwide since its June debut, according
to BoxOfficeMojo.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
