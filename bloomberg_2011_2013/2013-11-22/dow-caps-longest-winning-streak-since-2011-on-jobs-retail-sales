U.S. stocks  rose for a seventh week,
sending the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  to the longest stretch
of gains in almost three years, as improved data on employment
and retail sales offset concern over a cut in monetary stimulus.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and Union Pacific Corp. climbed at least 1.6
percent after announcing stock buybacks. Airlines advanced as
United Continental Holdings Inc. rallied 4.9 percent.  Time
Warner Cable (TWC)  Inc. jumped 10 percent on speculation the company
will be bought. Best Buy Co. and  Campbell Soup  Co. paced
declines among consumer stocks, sinking at least 7.2 percent
amid disappointing forecasts.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.4 percent to a
record 1,804.76 over the five days, extending its longest weekly
advance since February. The Dow climbed 103.07 points, or 0.7
percent, to 16,064.77.  “The big change to me looking at this week is just the
change in sentiment,” Daniel Genter, who oversees about $4.3
billion as president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital Management, said in a telephone
interview. “More and more people are discounting that the
potential tapering is not going to totally derail this market.
There is life after tapering.”  Stocks Rebound  Equities slipped during the first three days of the week as
minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting indicated the central
bank may reduce monetary stimulus in coming months. Stocks
rebounded over the next two sessions, with the Dow closing above
16,000 for the first time, as data showed weekly  jobless claims 
fell to the lowest level since September. Retail sales increased
0.4 percent in October, the most in three months, according to a
Commerce Department report.  Four out of five investors expect the Fed to delay a
decision to begin reducing its bond buying until March 2014 or
later, according to the Bloomberg Global Poll of investors,
traders and analysts who are subscribers. Just 5 percent are
looking for a move at its Dec. 17-18 meeting, the Nov. 19 poll
showed.  Three rounds of Fed bond purchases have helped push the  S&P
500  up 167 percent from a bear-market low in 2009. The benchmark
gauge for American equities is up 26.5 percent this year, poised
for the best annual gain since 1998, and is trading for about 17
times its companies’ reported earnings.  While the  valuation  reached the highest level since May
2010, it’s still below the multiples at the market’s two
previous peaks, when the ratio reached 17.5 in October 2007 and
31 in March 2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Fairly Valued’  “The market is fairly valued,” RNC’s Genter said. “With
slow growth and minimal P/E expansion, earnings will be the
focus and earnings are good and will carry us for another
year.”  Profits for S&P 500 companies will grow 9.9 percent in
2014, up from a 4.8 percent increase this year, analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX)  rose
0.6 percent for the week to 12.26. The gauge of S&P 500 options
known as the VIX trimmed its 2013 decline to 32 percent.  Four out of the 10 main S&P 500 industries gained as
financial and health-care shares climbed more than 1.6 percent
for the best performance.  Yahoo advanced 2.9 percent to $36.49. The largest U.S. Web
portal boosted its stock buyback plan by $5 billion, returning
more cash to shareholders as Chief Executive Officer  Marissa
Mayer  seeks to revive growth.  Union Pacific, the largest U.S. railroad, rose 1.6 percent
to $162.02 after announcing a buyback of as much as $9.5 billion
in stock.  Airlines Rally  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index rallied 2.4 percent to
the highest level since February 2007 as billionaire  David
Tepper  said the industry is his “big play in the market.”  United Continental Holdings climbed 4.9 percent to $38.54.
The world’s biggest airline said it would cut $2 billion in
annual spending and boost profit.  Time Warner Cable jumped 10 percent to $132.92. Comcast
Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. have discussed a joint bid
for the second-largest U.S. cable company that would divide its
assets between them, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The talks between Comcast and Charter have been preliminary,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
matter is private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. rallied 4.7 percent to $57.46. The
bank agreed to pay a record $13 billion to resolve U.S. probes
into the bank’s sale of mortgage bonds that officials said
helped feed the financial chaos of 2008.  Biogen Idec  Biogen Idec  Inc. surged 17 percent to $285.62. The
company’s multiple sclerosis drug  Tecfidera (BIIB)  won designation as a
“new active substance” in  Europe , giving the company an
additional 10 years of protection from generic copies and paving
the way for approval there.  Tyson Foods Inc. jumped 11 percent to $31.82. The largest
U.S. meat processor posted higher-than-estimated quarterly
revenue after a gain in prices and sales volumes for beef and
chicken.  Best Buy declined 9.9 percent to $39.37. The world’s
largest consumer-electronics retailer said it will keep pace
with competitors’ discounts in the holiday season, hurting
fourth-quarter profitability.  Campbell Soup lost 7.2 percent to $39.37. The company said
profit this year will be less than it previously estimated as
soup and beverage sales slow.  GameStop (GME)  Corp. slumped 12 percent to $49.86. The largest
specialty retailer of video games forecast fourth-quarter profit
of no more than $2.14 a share. That trailed the average analyst
estimate of $2.16 in a Bloomberg survey.  Home Improvement  Lowe’s Cos. declined 7.5 percent to $47.90. The second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer posted third-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates as it worked to match
Home Depot Inc.’s growth in an improving housing market.  Intel Corp ., the world’s largest maker of semiconductors,
dropped 2.7 percent to $23.87 after saying revenue next year
will be little changed from 2013 levels, short of analysts’
estimates.  Tesla Motors (TSLA)  Inc. tumbled 10 percent to $121.38. The
company’s Model S, the electric sedan marketed by the company as
“the safest car in America,” is being investigated by U.S.
auto regulators in a possible precursor to a recall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
