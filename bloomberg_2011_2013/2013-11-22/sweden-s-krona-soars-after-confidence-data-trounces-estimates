Sweden ’s krona soared after a report
showed confidence among consumers and businesses rose more than
analysts had anticipated in November.  The krona gained 0.7 percent to trade at 8.89 per euro as
of 9:37 a.m. in  Stockholm . Against the dollar, the krona also
jumped 0.7 percent and traded at 6.5891, making it today’s
biggest gainer against the euro, the dollar and the yen of the
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Sweden’s central bank in October kept its main  interest
rate  at 1 percent and signaled it will be able to start
tightening policy late next year as the outlook for the largest
Nordic economy improves. Gross domestic product will expand 2.6
percent next year after growing 0.7 percent in 2013, the
Riksbank said Oct. 24.  “Swedish consumers see that happy days are coming,”
Andreas Wallstrom, an economist at Nordea Bank AB in Stockholm,
said in a note to clients. “Households became more optimistic
both on their own economy and the overall Swedish economy.”  GDP grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter from the second,
according to the median estimate of five economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Statistics Sweden  is due to publish GDP data Nov. 29.  Sweden’s krona is also the best performer in the past week
of a group of 10 currencies tracked in Bloomberg correlation
weighted indexes, having appreciated 1.1 percent in the period.  An index measuring  consumer confidence  in November showed a
reading of 104.9 today, compared with a Bloomberg survey median
estimate of 102. The manufacturing confidence reading was 105.8,
compared with 100.6 foreseen in the Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
