(Corrects to say the Fed “might” change guidance in
second paragraph.)  Treasury  two-year  note yields will
rise to almost 1 percent by the end of 2014 as steady labor
market gains lead investors to price in a boost to the  Federal
Reserve ’s target rate by June 2015, according to Barclays Plc.  In an effort to hold down bond yields, the Fed might
ratchet down its target for the unemployment rate to 6 percent
from 6.5 percent in March, when it begins to taper its $85
billion a month in bond purchases, said  Ajay Rajadhyaksha , co-head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities research at
Barclays in  New York .  “We see rates heading higher, despite the Fed wanting to
prevent it, largely in the second half of the year,”
Rajadhyaksha said. Should data hew to Barclays’s forecasts,
“the Fed will have a hard time by the end of next year making
the case that it plans to be on hold for a long time after
2014,” he said.  Barclays predicted the two-year yield will rise to 0.95
percent next year, compared with a median forecast of 0.9
percent in a Bloomberg News survey, from 0.27 percent yesterday
in New York. It last touched 0.95 percent in May 2010. The bank
forecasts the  10-year yield  to climb to 3.5 percent, versus 3.4
percent in Bloomberg’s survey, from 2.78 percent.  Barclays also forecasts in its outlook for  interest rates 
in 2014, which it is publishing today, that the U.S. gross
domestic product will grow 2.5 percent next year, that
unemployment will drop to 6.5 percent and the Fed’s preferred
measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures
index, will rise to 2.1 percent.  ‘It’s Working’  While the  bond market  is now pricing in an increase in
December 2015, labor-market growth of 200,000 jobs per month and
the Fed’s progress toward ending  bond purchases  will lead
investors to ramp up expectations for a Fed rate increase,
Rajadhyaksha said.  By signaling that it will lower its  unemployment  goal, the
Fed has bolstered its messaging that tapering doesn’t signal
imminent rate increases, pushing the two-year Treasury yield
down to a five-month low of 0.26 percent on Nov. 20 from 0.53
percent in September. “So far it’s working,” Rajadhyaksha
said. “Sometime next year it will stop.”  The Fed will end its purchases in September and raise its
benchmark overnight rate in June 2015 for the first time since
the financial crisis in 2008, the bank predicts.  March Taper  Fed policy makers will decide to reduce the purchases to
$70 billion a month at their March 18-19 meeting, according to
the median forecast of 32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg
survey on Nov. 8.  Interest-rate futures show an 11.1 percent probability that
the Fed will raise borrowing costs by January 2015, down from
56.1 percent at the end of August.  By lowering its threshold for the  unemployment rate , the
Fed hopes to prevent a repeat of the rapid selloff that began in
May lasting into September, which pushed  10-year yields  up by
more than 1 percentage point to 3 percent for the first time
since July 2011, Rajadhyaksha said.  The 10-year yield will end June at 3 percent while the two-year Treasury note yield will rise to 0.5 percent by that time,
Barclays forecasts. The firm see five-year note yields rising to
1.85 percent in June and to 2.5 percent by the end of 2014, from
1.3x percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
