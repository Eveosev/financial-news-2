The Indonesian rupiah led losses in
Asian currencies this week after the  Federal Reserve  signaled
its monetary stimulus may be pared in the coming months, damping
inflows to emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  fell 0.3 percent
in the past five days after gaining last week. Overseas
investors sold $878 million more regional stocks than they
bought in Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in the
first four days of the week, exchange data show.  The U.S. central bank’s $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases might be reduced as the world’s largest economy
improves, according to the minutes of the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s Oct. 29-30 meeting released Nov. 20. Several Asian
emerging economies face a “key source of risk” in the eventual
tapering of stimulus in advanced nations, the International
Monetary Fund’s Deputy Managing Director Zhu Min said.  Speculation that the Fed’s “tapering will come sooner
rather than later is negative for  emerging markets ,” said  Koji
Fukaya , chief executive officer and currency strategist at FPG
Securities Co. in Tokyo.  The rupiah fell 0.9 percent this week to 11,730 per dollar
as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, after touching 11,736 earlier, the
weakest level since March 2009, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg. Thailand’s baht slid 0.8 percent to
31.84 and Malaysia’s ringgit dropped 0.4 percent to 3.2157.  Fed Tapering  Fed policy makers next meet Dec. 17-18 to weigh whether
economic growth and progress in the labor market merit a
reduction in the monthly asset purchases.  Jobless claims  in the
week ended Nov. 16 dropped by 21,000 to 323,000, the fewest
since the week ended Sept. 28, from a revised 344,000 the
previous week, the U.S. Labor Department said yesterday.  “Global growth is in low gear and downside risks
persist,” the IMF’s Zhu said in prepared remarks for a
conference in Port Vila, Vanuatu. He didn’t specify which
countries were at risk from the scaling back of policies that
the central banks of Japan and the U.S. have adopted to boost
growth.  The baht touched a two-month low of 31.85 per dollar today
amid political turmoil. Thailand’s  Constitutional Court  ruled
against the government’s attempt to establish a fully elected
Senate on Nov. 20, saying the change would undermine its role as
a check-and-balance on the lower house. Supporters and opponents
of the government called for separate rallies on Nov. 24,
according to a government  website .  Elsewhere in Asia, the Philippine peso fell 0.5 percent
this week to 43.865 per dollar and the  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1
percent to NT$29.645. The  Indian rupee  gained 0.3 percent to
62.93 and South Korea’s won strengthened 0.3 percent to
1,060.40. China’s  yuan  was little changed at 6.0934 and
Vietnam’s dong was steady at 21,098.  For Related News and Information:
