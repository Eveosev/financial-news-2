Technip SA (TEC) , which won a $730 million
contract in  Ghana , will double the size of its office in the
West African nation within two years to capture more business as
the oil exporter seeks to boost production.  Europe ’s largest oilfield-services provider employs 33
people in Ghana, Stephane Sole, country managing director, said
in an interview in the capital, Accra, yesterday. The Paris-based company opened an office in Ghana in 2009 and operates in
Angola, Nigeria and  Egypt . Sole declined to say how much Technip
has invested in Ghana or estimate what potential revenue is.  “Ghana is the fastest-growing country in  Africa  for us in
terms of local presence,” Sole said. “We have invested a lot
and we want to develop a lot more. We are here for the long
term.”  Ghana began exporting oil in 2010 from its Jubilee field
and plans to more than double production to 250,000 barrels a
day by 2021 from 102,000 barrels as the $4.5 billion offshore
TEN project comes online in 2016. London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ,
which operates Jubilee, plans to sell part of its stake in TEN
later this month.  Technip won last month a $730 million contract to install
subsea equipment at TEN, which will produce about 80,000 barrels
a day in 2016. The company started building a fabrication yard
in 2009 in the western port town of Sekondi, 240 kilometers (149
miles) from the capital. It created a joint venture with the
Ghana National Petroleum Corp. in November last year before
completing a jumper, or flowline pipe, constructed with a
majority of Ghanaian engineers, Sole said.  Currency Costs  Technip has agreements with contractors to manage the
effect of the cedi’s decline, the third-worst performing African
currency this year against the dollar, he said. The currency
dropped 0.7 percent to 2.28 per dollar at 2:16 p.m. in  Accra 
yesterday, extending the year’s decline to 16 percent.  Technip is working with two Ghanaian universities to train
engineers to help it meet a local content law Parliament
approved this week, Sole said. The regulation requires companies
in the oil industry to have 90 percent of its staff to be
citizens of Ghana within 10 years.  “We are already far above some requirements,” Sole said.
“Our staff is already 85 percent Ghanaian. For us, it will be
easy.”  Technip shares dropped 1.8 percent to 74.06 euros in Paris
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
