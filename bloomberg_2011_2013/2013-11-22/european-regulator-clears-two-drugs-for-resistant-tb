The European Medicines Agency
approved two medicines to treat the multidrug-resistant form of
tuberculosis, which afflicts about 1 in 20 people with the
ailment, the world’s second-deadliest infectious disease.  The EMA recommended that  Otsuka Holdings Co.’s (4578)  Deltyba be
conditionally approved for pulmonary infections due to resistant
TB in adults and Lucane Pharma SAS’s para-aminosalicylic acid be
approved for resistant TB in adults and children. The regulator
said Deltyba’s benefits outweigh its risks and that its approval
depends on Otsuka undertaking additional tests of the medicine’s
long-term effectiveness.  “Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is associated with a
very high  mortality rate  and poses a significant public-health
threat as individuals infected with drug-resistant strains are
unable to receive adequate treatment and can potentially spread
their infection,” EMA said in a  statement on its website .  About 450,000 people a year contract multidrug resistant TB
around the world, according to EMA. MDR-TB is defined as
tuberculosis which doesn’t respond to isoniazid and rifampicin,
two drugs that are standard therapies for TB. Much of the
disease burden is in  developing countries , and in Europe TB
struck about 2.3 in every 10,000 people in 2011, EMA said.  Tuberculosis, the world’s deadliest infectious disease
after AIDS, killed 1.4 million people in 2011, according to the
 World Health Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
