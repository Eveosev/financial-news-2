The South African Police Service
said it has arrested Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir on attempted
murder and kidnapping charges.  The police service said in a statement on its website that
it will give more information at a press conference tomorrow. A
jewelry pawn shop owned by him in the eastern Johannesburg
suburb of Bedfordview was hit by an explosion that killed two
people last week.  Krejcir is wanted in his home country on fraud and
conspiracy to commit murder charges. He is fighting a legal
battle to prevent extradition to the Czech Republic, where he
fled police while they were searching his house in  Prague  in
2005.  In South Africa police questioned him in the murder
investigation of crime boss Cyril Beeka, who was killed in a
drive-by shooting in Cape Town in 2011. He was also charged with
fraud over allegations he received 4.5 million rand ($447,000)
from an insurance company by falsely claiming that he had
cancer.  Krejcir fled to the Seychelles from the Czech Republic and
arrived in South Africa in 2007. In 2005 a number of Czech
police officials were fired or resigned after his escape,
according to iDnes, an Internet news service.  He survived an attempt on his life at the Bedfordview shop
earlier this year when a remotely controlled device fired at him
from an empty car, the South African Press Association reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
