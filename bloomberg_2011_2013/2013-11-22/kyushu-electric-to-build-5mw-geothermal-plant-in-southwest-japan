Kyushu Electric Power Co. (9508)  will build
a 5-megawatt geothermal power station in Japan’s southwestern
prefecture of Oita.  A wholly owned unit of the Fukuoka-based utility will begin
construction of the plant in March, the companies and the town
of Kokonoe, where the station will be built, said in a  statement 
today. The plant will start in March 2015.  Geothermal plants draw heat from below the earth’s surface
to produce energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
