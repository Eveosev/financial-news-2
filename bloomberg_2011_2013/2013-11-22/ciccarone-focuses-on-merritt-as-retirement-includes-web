Richard Ciccarone , chief research
officer at McDonnell Investment Management, will focus on his
other companies tracking local governments and the $3.7 trillion
U.S. municipal market when he retires from the firm at the end
of the year.  Ciccarone, 61, who’s spent more than 35 years in the
investment industry, will concentrate on his position as chief
executive officer of Merritt Research Services LLC, a municipal-bond research company. The majority owner of Hiawatha, Iowa-based Merritt, Ciccarone will work from Chicago, he said in an
interview from Oak Brook, Illinois, where McDonnell is based.  Ciccarone is also co-publisher and co-owner of
MuniNetGuide.com, a local-government finance and economics
website, with  James Spiotto , a partner in the Chicago office of
Chapman and Cutler LLP and head of the firm’s bankruptcy group.  Through the website and Merritt, “I expect to be busy and
focused,” said Ciccarone, who’s also a co-founder of the
National Federation of Municipal Analysts and served as its
chairman.  Ciccarone will be succeeded at McDonnell by Jim Butler and
Brad Mincke, who will serve as co-heads of research, the firm
said in a statement. The unit of  Natixis (KN)  Global Asset Management
L.P. supervised about $12.5 billion in assets as of Sept. 30,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
