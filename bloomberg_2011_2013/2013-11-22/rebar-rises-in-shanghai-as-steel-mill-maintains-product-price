Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced as China’s biggest producer of the building
material maintained product prices.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, advanced as much as 0.6 percent to
3,635  yuan  ($597) a metric ton, before trading at 3,622 yuan at
11:22 a.m. local time. Futures were poised for the first weekly
gain since Nov. 1.  Jiangsu Shagang Co. kept the price of its rebar products
unchanged at 3,650 yuan to 3,680 yuan, according to Shanghai
Steelhome Information Technology Co. Shagang kept its prices
unchanged for late November and mills have agreed to compensate
key distributors for any losses on price drops, said Melinda
Moore, an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London, in a report
yesterday.  “Major steelmakers maintaining their prices helps anchor
sentiment,” said Cai Yuehui, an analyst at Ruida Futures Co. in
Fujian.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
was unchanged at 932 yuan a ton.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery
at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel Index was little changed
