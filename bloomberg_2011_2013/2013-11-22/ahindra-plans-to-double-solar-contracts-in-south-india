A unit of  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,
 India ’s biggest sports utility-vehicle maker, plans to almost
triple solar capacity by adding plants in the state of Tamil
Nadu where a power deficit is spurring clean-energy investment.  The company’s Mahindra EPC Services unit expects to add 150
megawatts of solar capacity in the state over the next 18
months, Basant Jain, the unit’s chief executive officer, said by
phone yesterday. Mahindra EPC has already designed and installed
80 megawatts of photovoltaic plants in India as the contractor
for solar investors.  It comes after the unit built 3.3 megawatts of solar
projects in Tamil Nadu for a group of five auto component
makers, generating cheaper power than the electricity supplied
by the state utility, Jain said from Chennai. Power from the
solar plants will be injected into the grid and the companies
can draw down an equivalent amount of electricity at their auto
component factories.  “The structure is very innovative,” Jain said. The
projects for the auto component makers in  Tamil Nadu  are
generating power at 5 rupees (8 cents) a kilowatt-hour, compared
with the 5.5 rupees for electricity from the state grid, Jain
said.  The projects located at Aruppukottai used Chinese panels
from Chint Group Corp. The five auto component makers are M.M.
Forgings Ltd., Auto Forge Pvt. Ltd., I.M. Gears, the Rane Group
and Autotech Industries (India) Pvt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
