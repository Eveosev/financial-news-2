China , on track to overtake  India  as
the world’s largest gold consumer this year, will start
interbank swaps trading next week in a move to further open up
the domestic precious metals market.  Trading will start Nov. 25 on the Shanghai-based China
Foreign Exchange Trade System, according to a  statement  by the
National Interbank Funding Center today. The Shanghai Gold
Exchange, the country’s biggest spot gold bourse, will handle
related settlement and delivery, said the statement.  “Swaps will be one more tool for banks to manage risks
associated with bullion trading and will help broaden China’s
gold market,” said Song Qing, fund manager at Lion Fund
Management Co., China’s first asset manager to place money in
foreign exchange-traded gold funds.  Bullion consumption in the world’s second-largest economy
will surge 29 percent this year to a record 1,000 metric tons,
according to the median of 13 estimates from analysts, traders
and gold producers in China surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Bullion of 99.99  percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange dropped 0.3 percent to trade at 245.66  yuan  ($1,254.03
an ounce) at 2:30 p.m. local time. Gold for immediate delivery
was at $1,245.82 an ounce.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
