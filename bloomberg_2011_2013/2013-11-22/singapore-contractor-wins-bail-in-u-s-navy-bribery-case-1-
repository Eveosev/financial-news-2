A Singapore contractor accused of
bribing U.S. Navy commanders with cash and prostitutes was
granted bail over objections from prosecutors.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Jan Adler, at a hearing yesterday in
 San Diego , agreed to prosecutors’ request not to release Leonard Glenn Francis, the chief executive officer of Glenn Defense
Marine ( Asia ), until they appeal to the district judge
overseeing the case. The magistrate judge set bail at $1.1
million and ordered home confinement for Francis.  Francis, a Malaysian citizen, was arrested in September in 
San Diego. He’s charged with bribing two Navy commanders to 
help him win contracts for so-called husbanding services his 
company provides for Navy ships at ports in the  Southeast Asia . 
He’s also accused of bribing a Navy criminal investigator for 
information about an investigation of his company.  Francis has pleaded not guilty in the case.  Pat Swan, a lawyer for Francis, said in court that his
client isn’t a flight risk  “I know the government is going to say that the Navy was
overcharged but there is no allegation that the services for
which his company was paid were not performed and, to the
contrary, were always top-notch,” Swan said.  The case is U.S. v. Francis, 13-03782, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  California  (San Diego.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
