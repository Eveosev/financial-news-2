Indonesia ’s rupiah headed for a
fourth weekly decline and government bonds were poised for the
longest losing streak since July on concern the Federal Reserve
will bring forward a plan to cut its record stimulus.  The currency dropped to the weakest level since March 2009
yesterday as global funds pulled $366 million from Indonesian
stocks in November, exchange data show. The Fed may start
reducing the pace of its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases
in the “coming months” as the world’s largest economy
improves, according to minutes of its October meeting released
this week. Indonesia’s trade balance has been in deficit every
month bar two this year through September.  “Signals of sooner-than-expected Fed tapering are causing
riskier assets like the rupiah to weaken,” said Rully Nova, a
currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta.
“Fundamentally, Indonesia is especially vulnerable to outflows
because of its weak external balances.”  The rupiah dropped 0.8 percent this week to 11,713 per
dollar as of 10:09 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks
show. It was little changed today and reached 11,733 yesterday,
the weakest level since March 31, 2009. In the offshore market,
one-month non-deliverable forwards slumped 1.3 percent this week
and 0.1 percent today to 11,620, 0.8 percent stronger than the
onshore spot rate.  A  fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at 11,513 per
dollar yesterday, compared with 11,386 on Nov. 15, according to
the Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied
volatility in the rupiah, a measure of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, gained one basis point this
week to 14.36 percent.  The nation’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 fell for a
fourth week, the longest run of losses since July. The yield
climbed 20 basis points to 8.61 percent, the highest level since
Sept. 11, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.
The yield climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
