Malaysia’s ringgit was headed for
the worst run of weekly declines since 2005 and government bonds
fell as signs of a strengthening U.S. economy bolstered the case
for policy makers to trim stimulus.  U.S. jobless claims in the week ended Nov. 16 fell to
323,000, the least since September and lower than the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey, a report showed yesterday.
Inflation in Malaysia probably accelerated to a 21-month high of
2.7 percent in October, according to the median estimate of
analysts in another survey before data due today.  “The short-term outlook is negative toward  emerging
markets , largely due to Fed tapering speculation,” said Nik
Mukharriz Muhammad, a Kuala Lumpur-based fixed-income analyst at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., a unit of Malaysia’s second-largest
lender. “You don’t really want to go too far long on bonds
right now.”  The ringgit retreated 0.2 percent this week, the fifth
straight decline, and fell 0.2 percent today to 3.2100 per
dollar as of 11:06 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur. That’s the longest
stretch of losses since November 2005. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, fell 43 basis points since Nov. 15 and 16
basis points today to 8.2 percent.  Tapering Concern  Citigroup Inc. is neutral on the ringgit with “tapering
fears back in force,” strategists including Singapore-based
Siddharth Mathur wrote in a research note yesterday.  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard,
a voter on policy this year who has backed record stimulus, said
a strong jobs report could increase the probability of tapering
in December. The Fed will delay the first cut to its bond buying
program until March, according to the median estimate of 32
economists in a Bloomberg News survey conducted Nov. 8.  The yield on  Malaysia ’s five-year sovereign bonds rose nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, this week to 3.65
percent, the highest level since Sept. 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was little changed today. The
yield on the 3.48 percent securities maturing March 2023
advanced 18 basis points since Nov. 15 to 4.11 percent, the
highest since July 31. It climbed four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
