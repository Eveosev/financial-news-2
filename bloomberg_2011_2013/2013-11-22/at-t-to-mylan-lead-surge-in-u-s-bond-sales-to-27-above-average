AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  led bond
sales of $38.1 billion in the U.S. this week, 27 percent above
average, as issuers lock in borrowing costs at about record
lows, speculating that the  Federal Reserve  may start to curtail
stimulus early next year.  AT&T, the largest U.S. phone company, and Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania-based Mylan each raised $2 billion as offerings
topped 2013’s weekly average of  $30.1 billion , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance rose from  $26.3 billion  sold
last week, the most since $41 billion in the five days ended
Nov. 8.  As the year draws to a close, sales of $1.43 trillion are
poised to surpass the unprecedented $1.48 trillion issued in all
of 2012 as borrowers act ahead of a reduction of the Fed’s $85
billion in monthly bond purchases that could occur “in coming
months,” central bank officials said this week. The comments
increased the possibility that the Fed will act in December,
though a March tapering remains the most likely outcome,
according to Edward Marrinan at RBS Securities.  “There is limited time left in the pre-taper days,”
Marrinan, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based macro credit strategist,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s having a big pull-forward
effect on issuers. The taper decision has escalated the
stakes.”  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 206 basis points
yesterday from 208 basis points on Nov. 15, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield index.
Yields increased to 3.96 percent from 3.95 percent, and compare
with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2.  Mylan Offering  AT&T on Nov. 20 issued $1.6 billion in 2.375 percent, five-year bonds with a relative yield of 100 basis points and $400
million of floating-rate debentures paying 91 basis points more
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg
data show.  Mylan, the pharmaceutical company acquiring the injectable
medicine unit of  India ’s  Strides Arcolab Ltd. (STR) , sold four $500
million portions of debt to help fund the purchase, Bloomberg
data show. The maturities ranged from three-year notes, with a
1.35 percent coupon and an 80 basis-points spread, to 30-year
debt, paying 5.4 percent or a relative yield of 165 basis
points.  Four of five investors expect the Fed to delay a decision
to begin reducing its bond buying until March 2014 or later,
with just 5 percent looking for a move next month, according to
a Bloomberg Global Poll based on interviews Nov. 19.  Fed Purchases  Janet Yellen , who has been nominated to replace current Fed
Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke after his term ends Jan. 31, told the
Senate Banking Committee on Nov. 14 that the benefits of the
bond-buying program still outweigh the costs.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $31.4
billion, compared with  $17.3 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $22.8 billion , Bloomberg data show. Offerings of
speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.7 billion, compared
with $9 billion last week and this year’s weekly average of $7.3
billion.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
