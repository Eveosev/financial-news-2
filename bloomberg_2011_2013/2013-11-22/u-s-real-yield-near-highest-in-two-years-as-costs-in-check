Treasuries rose as 10-year note
yields at the highest levels in two months attracted buyers amid
speculation the Federal Reserve may not start reducing its
monthly bond purchases until next year.  The  yield difference  between five- and 10-year notes
narrowed from the most in two years reached yesterday. Yields
accounting for inflation were almost the highest in more than
two years as bond rates increased while consumer prices remain
subdued. The Treasury is scheduled to sell $96 billion in notes
next week.  “You’ve seen a correction here,” said  Sean Murphy , a
trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. There are “concerns over Fed
tapering and possible policy movement going forward. The reality
is it will take place. It’s a matter of what tools they add to
ensure the onset of tapering doesn’t create a lot of volatility
in the market.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.74 percent at 5 p.m. New York time. The
price of the 2.75 percent note maturing in November 2023 gained
11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 2/32. The yield
was up four basis points this week.  Futures Bets  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
net-short position in 10-year note  futures  in the week ending
Nov. 19, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 180,363 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, down 716 contracts from a week earlier.  Net-short positions in the five-year note fell to the
 lowest  since Sept. 6. Speculative short positions outnumbered
long positions by 55,118 contracts.  Treasury  trading volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 54 percent to
$193.65 billion from $420 billion yesterday. The 2013 average is
$314.5 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE Index was at 66.81 after reaching 58.31 on Nov. 18, the
lowest level since May. It touched a record low of 48.87 on May
9 and a 2013 high of 117.89 on July 5.  Market Returns  Treasuries have fallen 0.7 percent this month through
yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY) 
The yield will rise 2.91 percent by the end of March, according
to a Bloomberg survey of financial companies with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  The  extra yield  on 10-year notes versus five-year
securities was 1.39 percentage points after expanding to 1.45
percentage points yesterday, the widest since August 2011.  “We’ve had a pretty dramatic steepening of the curve,”
said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “Maybe we’ve gone a little
bit too far. The Fed can live with us in that 2.85 percent to
2.6 percent range.”  Treasury 10-year notes yielded about 1.78 percent after
subtracting the cost of living, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The figure was as high as 1.84 percent yesterday, the most since
February 2011, when the yield rose to 2.84 percent.  U.S. consumer prices rose 1 percent in October from the
year before, the Labor Department reported on Nov. 20. It was
the smallest increase since October 2009 as retailers started
discounting before the  holiday shopping season .  Yield Levels  Ten-year yields climbed to the  highest  level in two months
yesterday as a report showing U.S. jobless claims fell more than
economists forecast fueled speculation that tapering will take
place in coming months. Minutes of the Fed’s October meeting
released Nov. 20 showed officials may reduce their $85 billion a
month of bond-buying if the economy improves as anticipated.  The Fed purchased $1.57 billion in Treasuries maturing
between May 2038 and February 2043 today.  “We expect the momentum in the jobs market to continue and
that the  Federal Reserve  will start reducing bond purchases in
the first quarter of next year,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a
senior rates strategy at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. “Tapering is
just a matter of when and not if. Treasury yields have room to
rise further.”  The Fed has said it will keep short-term rates at almost
zero at least as long as unemployment is above 6.5 percent and
the forecast for inflation is below 2.5 percent. The jobless
rate in October was 7.3 percent.  Note Sales  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion in two-year
notes, $35 billion in five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-year securities on three consecutive days starting Nov. 25.  The five-year notes to be sold may be considered an
additional issue of the outstanding seven year notes sold
Nov.30, 2011 if the auction results in a high yield ranging from
1.375 percent to 1.499 percent, according to the Treasury.  A sale of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
yesterday showed not everyone is ready to abandon them. The $13
billion auction attracted the strongest demand since 2011 from a
group of investors that includes pension funds and insurers.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
orders directly with the Treasury, bought 21.5 percent of the
notes, the most since September 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt, was 2.20 percentage points, in
line with the average over the past decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
