Investors have warmed up to Bill Miller again.  Miller’s $1.7 billion  Legg Mason Opportunity Trust (LMOPX)  won $168
million in deposits in October, the most the fund has attracted
in more than six years, according to data from Chicago-based
Morningstar Inc. In the five years through 2012, shareholders
pulled $3.4 billion from the fund.  Miller, 63, is best known for beating the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index in his  Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust (LMVTX)  for a
record 15 years through 2005, luring assets to Baltimore-based
 Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  He stepped down from that fund in April 2012
after returns slumped. Miller, whose Opportunity Trust lost 65
percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 as his bets on financial
stocks went awry, is enjoying his second straight year of  top
performance  at the fund.  “Investors too often invest looking backward, not
forward,” Miller wrote in an e-mail today, adding that since
the global financial crisis in 2008, the fund has outperformed
the market in four of the past five years. “We are pleased by
our current steady inflows.”  Opportunity Trust returned  58 percent  this year through
yesterday after gaining 40 percent in 2012, better than 98
percent of peers in both years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s also beaten 90 percent of the competition in the
past three years and 98 percent in the past five years.  Stock mutual funds in the U.S. have attracted more money in
2013 than they have in 13 years, as equities trade near record
highs and most bonds have lost ground as interest rates rise.
Equity funds gathered $172 billion in the year’s first 10
months, the most since 2000, Morningstar data show.  Mortgage Stocks  Miller’s comeback has been fueled, in part, by successful
bets on a rebound in housing. His fund’s top two holdings,
Richmond, Virginia-based  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  and  MGIC
Investment Corp. (MTG)  of  Milwaukee , both insure mortgages, a business
that has benefited from the increase in  home prices  since 2009.  Genworth shares have more than doubled this year and MGIC
has tripled.  “Housing fundamentals are likely to be positive for
years,” Miller said in an October 2012 interview.  Miller’s top holdings also include Los Gatos, California-based  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , which has more than tripled this year as
original shows fuel subscriber growth in its streaming service.  Legg Mason has struggled with more than five years of net
redemptions. Clients pulled $4 billion from the firm’s stock
funds in the third quarter, the company reported last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
