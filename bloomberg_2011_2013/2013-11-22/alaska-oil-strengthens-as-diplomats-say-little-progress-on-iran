Alaska North Slope crude
strengthened to the highest level in six months relative to the
U.S. benchmark as diplomats cited little progress in
negotiations over  Iran’s nuclear program , making it less likely
Iranian oil will be added to waterborne supplies.  The Alaska crude gained $1.10 on the  spot market  to a
premium of $10.50 a barrel more than West Texas Intermediate at
10:58 a.m.  New York  time, the largest gap for the crude, which
is used by West Coast refineries, since April 29, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif
and European Union foreign policy chief  Catherine Ashton  resumed
in Geneva after failing to make progress yesterday. Zarif’s
deputy, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters yesterday that because
negotiators “made no progress,” the prospect of other foreign
ministers attending the talks had been diminished.  If the negotiations lead to easing sanctions on Iran’s oil
exports, the added supply would cut the price of Brent, the
benchmark grade used to price more than half the world’s oil, by
$12 a barrel, according to the mean of 19 trader and analyst
estimates compiled by  Bloomberg News  in October.  Brent’s premium to WTI rose as high as $16.01, the widest
since March 18.  Alaska North Slope oil  production  has averaged 558,000
barrels a day in November. Supplies at the Valdez Marine
Terminal were 3.4 million barrels Nov. 20, the highest level
since Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
