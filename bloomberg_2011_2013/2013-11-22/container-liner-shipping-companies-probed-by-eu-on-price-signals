European Union regulators opened an
antitrust investigation into container liner shipping companies,
saying they signaled pricing changes to each other with press
and website statements.  “Since 2009, these companies have been making regular
public announcements of price increase intentions through press
releases on their websites and in the specialized trade press,”
the EU said in an e-mailed statement today. “These
announcements are made several times a year and contain the
amount of increase and the date of implementation, which is
generally similar for all announcing companies.”  The pricing announcements may allow the companies to signal
future pricing plans to each other and could allow them to raise
prices on transport services to and from  Europe , regulators
said.  The European Commission didn’t identify the companies in
the probe in today’s statement.  AP Moller-Maersk A/S, owner of the world’s largest
container shipping company, CMA CGM SA and Hapag-Lloyd were
among companies raided by EU officials in 2011 over possible
collusion. EU regulators are also gathering market information
over a pact between Maersk, CMA CGM and Mediterranean Shipping
Co. to create the largest container alliance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
