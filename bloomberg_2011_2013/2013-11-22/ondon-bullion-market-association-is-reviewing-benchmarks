The  London  Bullion Market
Association, the trade group representing the gold and silver
market, said it’s reviewing its benchmarks.  “The LBMA is looking into whether our benchmarks conform
with Iosco principles,” Aelred Connelly, a spokesman for the
association, said by phone today. The review covers gold forward
offered rates benchmarks, he said.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions is
a Madrid-based group representing regulators from more than 100
countries. It set tougher guidelines for publishing benchmarks
in a July 17 report, including making prices based on
“observable” deals where possible to increase transparency.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is reviewing gold
benchmarks as part of its wider probe of how global rates are
set, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
The review is preliminary and hasn’t risen to the level of a
formal investigation, said the person, who declined to say which
gold benchmarks were under scrutiny.  More than $33 billion of bullion was traded in London each
day in 2012, according to the London Bullion Market Association.
The LBMA’s market-making members include Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc. Gold forward
offered rates, known as GOFO, show the  interest rate  at which
dealers will lend metal for dollars.  NI GLDMARKET
