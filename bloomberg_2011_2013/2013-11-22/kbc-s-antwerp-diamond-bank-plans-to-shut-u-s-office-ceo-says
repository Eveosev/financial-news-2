Antwerp Diamond Bank, a unit being
sold by  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , plans to shut its office in  New York 
within six months, as potential acquirers prefer  emerging
markets  over the U.S.  The closure, announced to clients today, is “linked to the
ongoing negotiations” with possible buyers of the diamond bank,
Pierre De Bosscher, chief executive officer of the unit, said in
an interview. The focus of these investors is on markets in
“the  Far East  and Middle East” rather than the U.S., he said.  “What this news suggests is that ADB is getting closer to
selling its diamond division, since a potential buyer is
beginning to influence the bank’s decisions,” said Anish Aggarwal, a partner at industry consulting firm Gemdax.  Antwerp Diamond Bank is the last unit of KBC set to be sold
under conditions imposed by the European Commission for the
parent receiving state aid in 2008 and 2009. After KBC missed
the end-2012 deadline to sell the unit, the commission, the
European Union regulator in Brussels, appointed a trustee to
oversee the divestment along with KBC.  KBC said on Nov. 14 that it wrote down the value of the
diamond bank by 73 million euros ($99 million) in the third
quarter, and the unit represented 1.5 billion euros in risk-weighted assets.  The U.S. office, which employs five people, will be shut
“softly,” De Bosscher said. The bank’s remaining offices are
“not in danger,” he said. Besides its home city in  Belgium ,
Antwerp Diamond Bank also has offices in Hong Kong, Mumbai,
Singapore and Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
