Murray Goulburn Cooperative Co.,
which is part of a three-way bidding contest for Warrnambool
Cheese & Butter Factory Co., appointed advisers to set up a fund
to sell shares to equity investors for the first time.  “We are considering a funding model that maintains 100
percent farmer control, but allows external investors to
invest” in Murray Goulburn, the Melbourne-based company said
today in a statement on its website. It plans to implement the
unit trust by July 1 and list it on the Australian stock
exchange, subject to shareholder approval, the company said.  The proposed  capital structure  is similar to one
implemented by  New Zealand ’s  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FSF) ,
Murray Goulburn said. Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy
exporter, raised NZ$525 million ($430 million) last year.  Murray Goulburn, Australia’s biggest milk processor,
earlier this month raised its cash offer for Australia’s
Warrnambool Cheese & Butter to A$9 a share, valuing the company
at A$505 million ($464 million), only to have that bid matched
three days later by Canada’s  Saputo Inc. (SAP)   The share sale proposal is separate from the bid, which is
funded by its existing bank syndicate, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
