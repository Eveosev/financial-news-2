Barclays Plc (BARC)  will boost fixed pay
for some employees next year in advance of European Union rules
that will cap bonuses.  Britain’s second-largest bank will introduce what it calls
“role-based pay,” according to a person familiar with the
plan. The new payments to certain bankers, traders and
salespeople of the London-based firm will come on top of their
base salaries and variable bonuses, said the person, who asked
not to be named because it’s a personnel matter.  The EU brokered a draft deal in February to outlaw banker
bonuses that are more than twice fixed pay, a move lawmakers
said would curb irresponsible risk-taking. Reuters reported
Barclays’s plans earlier, citing an internal memo.  Erica Chase, a spokeswoman for Barclays in  New York ,
declined to comment.  The European Banking Authority, which coordinates the work
of supervisors in the 28-nation group, is deciding which
employees will be covered by the curbs after the EU said they
would apply to risk-takers. Banks are trying to have the rules
apply to fewer workers by recommending that the definition of a
risk-taker be made stricter, people familiar with that process
said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
