The World Bank said today it
increased its post-typhoon aid package for the  Philippines  to
almost $1 billion.  “In a telephone call with Philippine President Benigno S.
Aquino today, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim expressed
sympathy to the government and people of the Philippines for the
devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), and offered U.S.
$480 million in additional financial assistance to help
communities lead the reconstruction effort,” the World Bank
said in a statement released in  Washington . “This followed the
U.S. $500 million emergency loan announced earlier this week,
bringing the total package close to U.S. $1 billion.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
