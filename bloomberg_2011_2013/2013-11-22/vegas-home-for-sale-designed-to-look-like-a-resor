295 E Cactus Ave, Las Vegas, NV  For sale: $1.99 million When these Las Vegas homeowners began building a custom home, they decided it couldn’t look like a house. “They lived in and managed a hotel for many years, and they decided when they wanted to build a house, they wanted to build a resort, not a house,” explained listing agent  Paula Burlison of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty . “If for any reason it looked like a house, [the owner said] he was doing something wrong.” For that reason, the home has no hallways or corridors — he didn’t want it to look like a “mousetrap,” Burlison says. Rather, the home is built in a circular pattern with rooms jutting off to each side like spokes of a wheel. At the center is an indoor pool with a 20-foot stone waterfall feature. Above, a blue-tiled ceiling frames the 15-foot skylight that opens for optimum views of the night sky. The house has 8 rooms, including a movie room, an entertainment room and an office, as well as traditional spaces such as a master bedroom, 2 secondary bedrooms and a very modern kitchen. Additional nontraditional features include automated sliding doors at the entrance to the master bedroom. The stainless steel front doors don’t have doorknobs and are opened by remote control. All together, the house measures 3,966 square feet and was built, according to Burlison, to the highest engineering standards possible. Outside, the 2-acre parcel includes a 7-car garage, space for up to eight horses or even a helipad. Although nestled in among luxury homes, it’s one of the few with a larger lot within Las Vegas city limits. The Strip is just three miles away. The property’s size, location and unusual features make it the ideal entertainer’s home, Burlison says. “It’s an estate for someone who wants to be in the fun part of Vegas, a home to definitely entertain in, a fun, fantastic place.” Related items from  Zillow Blog :  Erika Riggs ,  a real estate writer for Zillow Blog, covers celebrity real estate, unusual properties and home design trends.
