Petoro  Iceland  AS will team up with
 China ’s CNOOC International Ltd. and Eykon Energy ehf to search
for oil off Iceland’s northeast coast, Iceland’s National Energy
Authority said.  The decision of Petoro must be approved by Norway’s
parliament before the licence is awarded, the authrity said in a
statement on its  website  today. The authority expects the
license to be issued by the end of the year.  Norway, through state-owned Petoro AS, in January signed
agreements with Iceland as a follow up to a 1981 accord between
the two nations. The company has previously taken a 25 percent
interest in Iceland’s first two exploration licenses.  Iceland is opening up its waters to explorers as it
recovers from the 2008 banking meltdown that plunged the nation
into its worst recession in six decades. The first two licenses
were awarded last year and will be operated by  Faroe Petroleum
Plc (FPM)  and Valiant Petroleum Plc. The companies will search for
petroleum off the Jan Mayen islands, which are about 600
kilometers (373 miles) northeast of Iceland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
