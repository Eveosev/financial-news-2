A U.S. government plan to spend $20
million in climate aid to  kickstart  clean-energy projects may
unlock $1 billion for solar and geothermal installations in
Africa, according to the country’s climate envoy.  The initial outlay for feasibility studies and
environmental impact reports would generate about $500 million
in funding from the Overseas Private Investment Corp., the U.S.
government-owned development finance organization, Todd Stern
told reporters in Warsaw today. In turn, that may spur another
$500 million of private investment, he said.  “OPIC felt that a lot of the projects that it could have
done in Africa were not getting done” because of the lack of
seed funding, Stern said. “If we’re lucky, our $20 million to
start investment will lead to $1 billion of funding in  Africa .”  Developing nations are seeking compensation from richer
countries for climate damage. The African Group of countries
want at least $70 billion a year by 2016, according to a
 submission  on the website of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change in Bonn. Representatives from
almost 200 nations are seeking to seal a deal for climate
finance at UN talks that conclude today in the Polish capital.  Six projects have been approved so far from more than 100
proposals under the Africa program, Stern said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
