Ethanol fell for the first time this
week on concern that higher prices will reduce demand.  Futures dropped 0.6 percent as the biofuel’s discount to
gasoline narrowed to 69.11 cents, the tightest differential
since Sept. 30. Prices have gained 14 percent this month and
yesterday touched the highest level since Sept. 5 on speculation
that supply would tighten.  “Be careful,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL
FCStone Group in Des Moines,  Iowa . “Any commodity that’s had
this type of run without any sort of correction can drop.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery slid 1.2 cents to
settle at $2.035 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
are down 7.1 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery decreased 1.77 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.7261 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol prices have fallen just two days since Nov. 6 and
that makes it less attractive to blenders, Blackford said.  The additive is made from corn in the U.S., with one bushel
making at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  A record corn crop has helped companies boost ethanol
production. Output has risen 17 percent to 904,000 barrels a day
last week from an all-time low in January, data from the Energy
Information Administration show.  Inventory Levels  Stockpiles were at 15 million barrels last week, up 0.8
percent from the historic low on Oct. 25, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical unit.  “Plants are producing, we just haven’t gotten the pipeline
refilled,” Blackford said. “It just doesn’t happen
overnight.”  Corn for December delivery slipped 0.75 cent to $4.2225 a
bushel in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the difference
between the cost of a bushel of the grain and the price of
ethanol, was 48 cents, down from 51 cents yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 17.5 cents to $3 a
gallon on the Gulf Coast, 3.5 cents to $3.01 in New York, 9.5
cents to $2.97 in Chicago and 2.5 cents to $2.775 a gallon on
the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed by 6 cents
to 4 cents, while the Gulf’s premium to the West Coast swelled
15 cents to 22.5 cents.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforces the
nation’s biofuel consumption mandate with tracking certificates
called Renewable Identification Numbers. They are attached to
each gallon of the fuel and can be traded among refiners.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs rose 1.5 cents to 21.5 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, advanced 5.5 cents to 24.5 cents, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
