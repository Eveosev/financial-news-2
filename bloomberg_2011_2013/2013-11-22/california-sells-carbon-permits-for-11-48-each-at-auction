California, the second-largest
carbon-emitting state in the U.S., sold 16.6 million carbon
allowances at auction for $11.48 each, roughly in line with
analysts’ expectations.  Units of  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  were among the companies that qualified
to buy permits in the Nov. 19 auction, a  report  posted on the
state Air Resources Board’s website today showed. The agency
doesn’t disclose the names of winning bidders. The state
received 1.82 offers for every permit put up for sale.  The credits, each approving the release of a metric ton of
carbon, are traded as part of the world’s second-largest carbon
market, established by California last year in an effort to cut
greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Futures based
on the permits have declined 22 percent this year on speculation
that the market will remain over-allocated for at least another
four years.  The auction results were “kind of right in line with
expectations,” Mark Struk, senior vice president of
environmental trading and advisory for Alpha Inception LLC, a
Houston-based consulting firm, said by telephone. “The market
is seeing this as a non-event. Prices are basically exactly the
same as before.”  Futures linked to 2013 allowances for December delivery
were unchanged yesterday at $11.75 a metric ton, according to
data compiled by  CME Group (CME)  Inc. The contract slumped to $11.70 a
ton on Nov. 19, a one-year low.  2016 Permits  California , the largest carbon-emitting state after  Texas ,
this week also sold 9.56 million permits that can be used for
compliance beginning in 2016. They went for $11.10 a metric ton,
above the $10.71-a-ton “floor,” the minimum price allowed by
the state.  California’s 2013 allowances were also expected to sell
close to the minimum, according to an Oct. 31 report by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Carbon markets consulting firm
Four Twenty Seven said in a  Nov. 18 outlook  that permits would
clear in the range of $10.71 and $10.85 a ton.  Companies bidding in the auction had “an opportunity to
snatch up allowances near the floor price,” Colleen Regan, a
Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst in  New York , said in the
research note. “If they wait three months, allowances will be
offered at a minimum of $11.41.”  California carbon markets still have “several bearish
years ahead,” Regan said in the note, which projects that
California’s emissions will remain under the limits established
by the state until 2017.  During the auctions, companies submit confidential bids for
the number of allowances they want at a specific price. The
highest bidder is awarded permits first, then the second-highest, and so on until the all of the permits for sale have
been called for. Then all bidders pay the price of the lowest
winning offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
