London ’s top policeman, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said he wouldn’t cycle in the U.K. capital because
it’s too dangerous.  The Metropolitan Police commissioner, who was speaking
after six bike riders died on London’s streets in less than two
weeks, said there’s too much traffic for him to feel safe.  “I’ve never been a big bike rider anyway but it seems to
me that if you get it wrong, or if the driver gets it wrong, the
person that’s going to pay is the cyclist,” Hogan-Howe told the
BBC late yesterday. “It seems to me there’s a lot of traffic,
and personally I wouldn’t.”  The death of a cyclist in a collision with a truck in
Walworth, southeast London, this week brought the number of
bike-riders who’ve lost their lives on the capital’s roads this
year to 14, the same as in the whole of 2012. The five previous
deaths in recent weeks also involved trucks and buses.  “I wouldn’t, but that’s my choice and I can afford not
to,” Hogan-Howe said. “But of course some people don’t have
the choice; economically it’s not easy.”  London Assembly members attacked Mayor  Boris Johnson  on
Nov. 20 over his policies to encourage cycling, accusing him
of not doing enough to speed up measures to introduce segregated
cycle lanes. Green Assembly member Jenny Jones said Johnson was
“blaming the victims” by saying some cyclists were riding
dangerously, such as by wearing headphones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
