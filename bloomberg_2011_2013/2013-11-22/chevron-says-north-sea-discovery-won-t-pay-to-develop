Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the world’s second-largest non-state energy company by market value, said its
Rosebank oil discovery off the coast of  Scotland  would be
unprofitable to bring into production at this time.  Chevron plans to continue evaluating the 240 million-barrel
field along with partners  OMV AG (OMV)  and Dong Energy A/S for ways to
improve the project’s potential returns, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. A
final decision on whether to proceed will be made next year,
according to the statement.  Rosebank’s unprofitability is a blow to U.K and Norwegian
efforts to halt the slide in  North Sea oil output  as fields
first drilled in the 1970s and 1980s near the end of their
productive lifespans. Dropping North Sea supplies are expected
to drive a 15 percent decline in European crude and gas liquids
production by 2018, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said in its annual world outlook on Nov. 7.  Rosebank “does not currently offer an economic value
proposition that justifies proceeding with an investment of this
magnitude,” Chevron said in the statement.  Chevron and its partners hired South Korea’s  Hyundai Heavy
Industries (009540)  Co. Ltd. in April to construct a $1.9 billion
platform that could offload crude directly to tankers, Hyundai
said in a Nov. 15 slide presentation. The vessel would have
capacity to draw 100,000 barrels of oil and 190 million standard
cubic feet of gas daily from the seafloor.  Chevron hasn’t disclosed any cost estimates for the total
development. Rosebank is located 80 miles (130 kilometers)
northwest of the Shetland Islands and 3,700 feet (1,130 meters)
beneath the sea surface.  Chevron discovered Rosebank in 2004 and owns a 40 percent
stake. OMV owns 50 percent and Dong holds a 10 percent interest.  Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest oil company by market
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
