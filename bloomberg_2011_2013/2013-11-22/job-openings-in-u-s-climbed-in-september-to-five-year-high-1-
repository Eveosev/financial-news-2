Job openings in the U.S. climbed to
a five-year high in September, indicating employers were
confident about demand before the federal government shutdown.  The number of  positions  waiting to be filled in the U.S.
rose by 69,000 to 3.91 million, the highest since May 2008, from
a revised 3.84 million in August, the Labor Department reported
today in Washington. The pace of hiring increased.  Further gains in the job market would help drive wage
growth and boost  consumer spending , which accounts for almost 70
percent of the economy. Employers have added 186,300 workers on
average from January through October, up from an average of
about 173,000 in the same period last year.  “Things are genuinely getting better,” said  Brian Jones ,
senior U.S. economist at  Societe Generale  in  New York . “I don’t
think we’re at the point where people will quit without having
something in hand, but hopefully we’re moving in that
direction.”  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
called for 3.85 million openings in September after a previously
reported 3.88 million a month earlier.  The Job Openings and Labor Turnover report is among data
monitored by  Janet Yellen , the nominee for Federal Reserve
chairman, and helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures.  Payrolls expanded by 204,000 workers last month after
rising 163,000 in September, a Labor Department report showed on
Nov. 8. The  jobless rate  rose to 7.3 percent in October after as
many as 800,000 federal workers were furloughed during the 16-day government shutdown.  Hiring Rate  Today’s report showed the number of people hired increased
to 4.59 million in September, the most since August 2008, from
4.56 million. The  hiring rate  rose to 3.4 percent from 3.3
percent in August. The gauge calculates the number of hires
during the month divided by the number of employees who worked
or received pay during that period.  Job openings  increased at construction companies,
retailers, professional and business services, and in the trade,
transportation and utility industries.  The number of total dismissals, which excludes retirements
and those who left their job voluntarily, rose to 1.73 million
from 1.68 million in August.  Some 2.34 million people quit their jobs in September, down
from 2.36 million the prior month. The  quits rate , which shows
the willingness of workers to leave their jobs, held at 1.7
percent in September, down from a 2.1 percent reading when the
recession started almost six years ago.  Fed’s Yellen  An increase in the gauge would indicate that “workers
perceive that their chances to be rehired are good -- in other
words, that labor demand has strengthened,” Yellen said in a
March speech before the National Association for Business
Economics.  In the 12 months ended September, the economy created a net
1.9 million jobs, representing 52.7 million hires and 50.8
million separations.  Considering the 11.3 million Americans who were  unemployed 
in September, today’s figures indicate there are about 2.9
people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the last
recession began in December 2007.  Payrolls data released earlier this month also showed that
private employment, which excludes government agencies, rose
212,000 in October, the most in eight months.  Holiday Hiring  Retailers are among those adding employees in anticipation
of holiday demand, with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  expected to hire 40
percent more workers than last year and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
taking on 10 percent more seasonal employees and an additional
700,000 workers. In total, retailers added 159,000 holiday jobs
in October, the strongest start to the season in 14 years,
according to employment consulting firm Challenger, Gray &
Christmas Inc.  Other businesses are taking steps to cut staff. Lockheed
Martin Corp., the largest U.S. government contractor, said Nov.
14 it will cut 4,000 jobs and close some operations in response
to decreased federal spending. HJ Heinz Co., the ketchup-maker
owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G
Capital, said it will fire 1,350 workers as it closes
manufacturing plants in  North America .  Fed officials are gauging the outlook for the labor market
as they consider scaling back their $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. Policy makers this
week signaled they may taper “in coming months” if the economy
improves as anticipated.  Fed officials “generally expected that the data would prove
consistent with the committee’s outlook for ongoing improvement
in labor market conditions and would thus warrant trimming the
pace of purchases in coming months,” according to the record of
the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Oct. 29-30 gathering,
released Nov. 20 in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
