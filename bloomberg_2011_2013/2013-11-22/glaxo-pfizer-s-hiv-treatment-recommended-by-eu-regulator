GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s HIV drug
Tivicay was recommended for approval by the European Union’s
drug regulator.  Tivicay won the backing of the Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use in combination with other antiretroviral
medicines for the treatment of HIV patients over the age of 12,
the European Medicines Agency said in a  statement  today. The
drug was developed by ViiV Healthcare Ltd., Glaxo’s venture with
two other drugmakers.  The treatment, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in August, reduced the HIV virus to undetectable
levels in more people than  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s Atripla, the
world’s best-selling AIDS drug, in a clinical trial released
last year. The medicine, also known as dolutegravir, is an
integrase strand transfer inhibitor that interferes with the
enzymes necessary for HIV to multiply.  Merck & Co. makes the first and only other approved
integrase strand transfer inhibitor, Isentress, which was
cleared in 2007 and had sales of $1.5 billion last year.  ViiV is an independent company that is a venture of Glaxo,
New York-based Pfizer Inc. and  Osaka , Japan-based drugmaker
Shionogi & Co. Glaxo owns 76.5 percent of ViiV while Pfizer has
a 13.5 percent stake and Shionogi holds 10 percent, according to
Glaxo.  The EMA’s recommendations are the final stage before the
European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, approves or rejects
a drug for sale to patients in the 28-nation region. The EC
usually follows the committee’s advice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
