Kimberley Process members ended four
days of talks in Johannesburg without agreeing on an updated
definition of the  conflict diamonds  whose sale to help finance
wars or violence the group was set up to eradicate.  During the discussions it became clear “once again that
there is no way that you can agree on any text for a new
definition,” Welile Nhlapo, chairman of the Kimberley Process,
told reporters today as the organization concluded its annual
meeting in the South African city.  The joint program between governments, industries and non-profit groups has been criticized by members for failing to halt
trade in the stones, sometimes called  blood diamonds . They have
been used in the past to finance wars by rebel movements.  “It’s not just only adding one or two phrases to the
current definition, but it needs a much more involved
engagement,” Nhlapo said.  South Africa, which has chaired the  Kimberley Process  this
year, will hand over to China for 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
