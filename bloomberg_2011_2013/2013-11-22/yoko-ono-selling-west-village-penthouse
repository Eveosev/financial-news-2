Yoko Ono’s penthouse is on the market, but according to her, it won’t be selling anytime soon because the building’s co-op is interfering. John Lennon’s widow bought the  penthouse at 49 Downing St, New York, NY 10014  for her son, Sean, in 1995. He lived there only a few years before moving, leaving the unit empty. Ono is currently suing the co-op board for hampering a possible sale of the home. A family with children placed an offer on the house, but Ono maintains in court documents that the co-op prefers an empty unit with “ an owner who pays the bills but isn’t around .” According to property records, this isn’t the first time Ono has tried to dump the place. As recently as July 2013, she had it on the market for $8.995 million. It was just relisted for a discounted price of $6.5 million. The 3-bedroom, 5-bath home has a private entrance with a private garage and elevator. Inside, the penthouse is all brick and soaring ceilings, with original beams and columns. The loft includes a greenhouse, rooftop deck, terrace and rec room. Ono currently lives in the Central Park West building The Dakota, which was the site of Lennon’s 1980 murder. The listing is held by Paula Allen of  Sotheby’s International Realty .
