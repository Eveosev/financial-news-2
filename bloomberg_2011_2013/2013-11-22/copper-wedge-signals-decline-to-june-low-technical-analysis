Copper prices, which are heading for
a second straight monthly decline, may extend losses and fall at
least 4.7 percent by the end of the year after breaking out of a
so-called wedge pattern, according to  technical analysis  by
FuturePath Trading LLC.  The attached chart shows March futures have traded below a
so-called support line since Nov. 13, when copper fell below the
psychologically “important” level of $3.20 a pound, said Paul Kavanaugh, the director of business development at FuturePath.
The move signals that prices may drop below the contract low of
$3.05 that was reached on June 24, he said.  “We saw a pretty convincing breakout last week,”
Kavanaugh said in a telephone interview from  Chicago . “The
chart is in a convincingly bearish range.”  Copper futures for delivery in March gained 1 percent
yesterday to $3.199 on the Comex in New York. The contract has
fallen 3.3 percent this month, after sliding 0.7 percent in
October.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an area where
analysts anticipate orders to buy a security. The stronger the
support, the more selling pressure is needed to fall below that
level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
