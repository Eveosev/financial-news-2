Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh
completed a $300 million capital increase for his distressed
retailer SMU SA after selling stakes in insurance companies to
raise the funds.  Saieh has fulfilled his pledge to complete the capital
increase by the end of the year, SMU said today in a statement
distributed by an external press agency. The company plans to
sell a further $200 million of shares by October 2016.  Saieh made his fortune in banking in the 1980s and last
year spent $1.3 billion to buy  Colombia ’s Helm Bank. SMU is his
attempt to build Chile’s third-largest retailer by buying a
series of small retail chains throughout Chile. The company said
in July it had breached terms on its debt after restating
earnings to show higher liabilities.  SMU bonds due in 2020 are the best-performing in
Bloomberg’s  emerging-market corporates index  this month after
posting  Latin America ’s worst returns in the first 10 months of
the year. The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to buy
SMU’s bonds instead of  U.S. Treasuries  rose six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 16.39 percentage points today. The
spread has fallen from a high of 19.82 percentage points on Oct.
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inversiones La Construccion SA said on Oct. 1 it would pay
$170 million in cash and assume debt for a 67 percent stake in
Corp Group Vida  Chile  SA, the holding company through which
Saieh controls two insurers. He also sold 31 bank branches for
$83 million to Independencia Rentas Inmobiliarias, a real estate
fund that will lease the space back to Corpbanca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
