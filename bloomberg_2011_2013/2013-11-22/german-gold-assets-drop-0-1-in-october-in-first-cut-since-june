Germany reduced gold holdings in
October in the first decline since June, according to data from
the  International Monetary Fund .  The holdings, the largest after the U.S., fell 0.1 percent,
or 3.4 metric tons, to 3,387 tons last month, the data show. The
Bundesbank sells about six to seven tons each year to the
finance ministry to mint commemorative coins, the central bank
said last year. Bullion accounts for about 68.8 percent of the
nationâ€™s reserves, according to World Gold Council data.  Central banks turned net buyers in 2009 as countries sought
to diversify their reserves. The producer-funded WGC predicts
purchases will total 350 tons in 2013 from 534.6 tons last year,
the most since 1964. Bullion is headed for the first annual drop
since 2000 amid expectations that the  Federal Reserve  will start
to pare stimulus as the  U.S. economy  recovers.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,245.18
an ounce at 10:13 a.m. in Singapore after touching $1,236.88
yesterday, the lowest since July 9. The metal entered a  bear
market  in April and is 26 percent lower this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
