Intelsat SA (I) , the commercial-satellite operator that went public in April, increased the size
of a loan it’s seeking by 77 percent to $3.1 billion, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The company originally asked lenders for a $1.75 billion
term loan to  refinance  a portion of bank debt due in 2018, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t
set. Bank of America Corp. is arranging the deal.  Luxembourg-based Intelsat has a $3.2 billion term loan that
matures in April 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The satellite operator is also seeking a $500 million revolving
 credit line , the person said.  Unprecedented demand for leveraged loans this year has
helped companies borrow a record $582.9 billion of the junk-grade debt from non-bank lenders. Investors have poured almost
$60 billion into loan funds, tripling the previous peak of $17.9
billion in 2010, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
