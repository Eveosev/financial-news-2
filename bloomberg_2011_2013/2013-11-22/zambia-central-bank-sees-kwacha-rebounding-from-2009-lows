Zambia’s central bank said the drop
in the kwacha to near the weakest levels in 4 1/2 years against
the dollar is temporary and that the currency of  Africa ’s
largest copper producer is set to rebound.  The kwacha will be in “equilibrium” at a rate of 5.30 to
5.40 per dollar, Emmanuel Pamu, financial markets director at
the central bank, said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday. The
kwacha has retreated 4.1 percent over the past month, falling to
5.56 per dollar on Nov. 19, the lowest close since May 2009. It
was unchanged at 5.5050 per dollar as of 7:17 a.m. in Lusaka,
the capital, after declining 0.2 percent yesterday.  The currency’s slide is a “random walk,” Pamu said. “It
doesn’t concern us too much. We expect some correction.”  African currencies from the Kenyan shilling and Nigerian
naira to the South African rand and Malawi kwacha have weakened
against the dollar this year partly as the  Federal Reserve 
considers an end to stimulus that drove demand for emerging-market assets. A 12 percent decrease this year in the price of
copper, which accounted for 82 percent of Zambian exports in
September, has compounded the kwacha’s fall, Pamu said.  Fitch Ratings  last month lowered Zambia one step to B, five
levels below investment grade and  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded
its outlook to negative, retaining its B+ rating. Yields on the
nation’s $750 million of bonds have climbed 224 basis points, or
2.24 percentage points, to 7.4 percent since being issued in
September 2012 compared with an average 133 basis-point increase
for dollar-denominated African  debt , JPMorgan Chase & Co.
indexes show.  Deficit Swells  The nation’s budget deficit is forecast to swell to 8.5
percent of gross domestic product this year, compared with an
earlier estimate of 4.3 percent, as funding needs are pushed
higher by  government spending  on wages and subsidies. A weaker
currency pushes up prices in the land-locked nation that imports
everything from oil to breakfast cereal.  Yields on Zambia’s one-year treasury bills have climbed
from less than 10 percent at the start of the year to 15.25
percent at the latest auction last week. Government has been
increasing the amount of debt it auctions to meet spending
requirements, Pamu said.  The size of bond auctions isn’t expected “to be going
down,” which will inevitably push yields higher, he said. “If
you have financing requirements that are higher, naturally the
 interest rates  are expected to also be higher.”  Government spending will rise 33 percent to 42.7 billion
kwacha in 2014, Zambian Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda
said last month. The country will borrow 3.5 billion kwacha
locally and 7.5 billion kwacha abroad to fund next year’s budget
shortfall, which government expects will be less than 6.6
percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
