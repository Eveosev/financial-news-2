Peru ’s economic growth decelerated
in the third quarter as an export slump damped private
investment.  Gross domestic product rose 4.4 percent from a year
earlier, the statistics agency said in an e-mailed statement.
The  median forecast  of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for
a 4.3 percent rise. GDP rose 5.6 percent in the second quarter.  Peru’s central bank cut its overnight rate Nov. 7 for the
first time in four years as weak global growth curbs demand for
metals that account for half of Peru’s export revenue. Though
GDP deceleration likely bottomed out in the third quarter, more
rate cuts likely will be needed next year to bolster business
confidence and domestic demand, said Alex Muller-Jiskra, an
analyst at BTG Pactual in Santiago.  “The rate cut is going to help,” Muller-Jiskra said in a
telephone interview. “Confidence is decisive for private
investment, which has been underpinning growth in recent
years.”  Exports fell 16 percent in September from a year earlier as
copper and gold sales declined, taking this year’s drop to 9.4
percent and leaving a $932 million  trade gap , the widest since
1999, according to the central bank.  Business sentiment is rebounding after the government began
reducing bureaucratic delays on $27 billion of private
investment and the central bank intervened to halt sol
depreciation.  Fixed asset investment rose at an annual rate of 2.8
percent in the three months to Sept. 30, compared with an 8.6
percent gain in the second quarter, as construction slowed and
machinery imports fell, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
