Tarkett SA (TKTT) , the French supplier of
flooring products, fell in its stock market debut after
shareholder  KKR & Co. (KKR)  sold about 462 million euros ($623
million) of shares.  The shares, priced at 29 euros, traded at 28.32 euros as of
12:33 p.m. in Paris, giving a market value of about 1.8 billion
euros. The amount of shares sold could increase to as much as
531 million euros if a so-called over-allotment option is
exercised.  Tarkett joins French cable TV operator  Numericable SAS (NUM)  and
battery company  Blue Solutions (BLUE)  in listing shares in Paris in
recent weeks. Numericable gained 15 percent on its debut in
Paris trading, and Blue Solutions jumped 45 percent.  Sales at Tarkett, which is benefiting from demand in
eastern Europe, Asia and  North America , are forecast to rise 9
percent this year to 2.5 billion euros, generating about 300
million euros to 310 million euros in earnings, Chief Executive
Officer Michel Giannuzzi said this month.  Nanterre-based Tarkett has been jointly owned by private-equity firm KKR and the Deconinck family since 2007. The
Deconinck family will have 50.1 percent of Tarkett, and KKR will
retain 18.9 percent of the company assuming a full exercise of
the over-allotment option, Tarkett said yesterday.  The company is the world’s third-largest maker of flooring
products for residential and commercial markets after Mohawk
Industries Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Shaw Industries
Group, Giannuzzi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
