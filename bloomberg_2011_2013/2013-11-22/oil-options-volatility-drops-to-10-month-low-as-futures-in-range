Crude options volatility fell to the
lowest level in almost 10 months as West Texas Intermediate
futures traded within the previous day’s range.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
16.05 percent at 3:55 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 16.36 percent at settlement yesterday. It’s the lowest
level for front-month options since March 27.  West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery slid 60
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $94.84 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, after settling yesterday at the highest
since Oct. 31. Prices slipped back from $95.57 after failing to
break above yesterday’s high at $95.63.  Puts, or bets that prices will fall, accounted for 61
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were January $85 puts, which were unchanged at 6 cents a
barrel with 2,513 lots trading. December $55 puts were also
unchanged at 25 cents a barrel on volume of 1,829 contracts.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 56 percent of
the 96,790 lots traded. January $85 puts declined 7 cents to 6
cents a barrel with 5,392 contracts trading. January $100 calls
gained 11 cents to 24 cents on volume of 4,210 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for June $80 puts, with
27,685 contracts. Next were January $75 puts with 27,245 lots
and December 2015 $120 calls with 25,319.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
