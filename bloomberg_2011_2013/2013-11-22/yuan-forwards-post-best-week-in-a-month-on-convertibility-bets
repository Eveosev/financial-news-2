China ’s  yuan  forwards posted the
biggest weekly advance in more than a month as central bank
officials signaled they will allow a more flexible  exchange rate 
and widen the daily trading limit in the onshore currency.  The People’s Bank of China will “basically” end normal
intervention in the foreign-exchange market, Governor  Zhou
Xiaochuan  said in a book explaining reforms outlined at a
Communist Party meeting last week, without giving a timeframe.
Deputy Governor  Yi Gang  said Nov. 20 that it’s no longer in
China’s interest to increase its foreign-currency holdings,
adding to signs policy makers will rein in dollar purchases that
limit the yuan’s appreciation.  “Zhou and Yi’s comments show that China is accelerating
the pace of yuan convertibility, which is positive to the
market,” said Patrick Cheng, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst
at Goldenway Group, a foreign-exchange brokerage.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.16 percent
this week to 6.1536 per dollar as of 4:52 p.m. in Hong Kong,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts slipped
0.06 percent today and traded at a 0.97 percent  discount  to the
spot rate in Shanghai.  The onshore spot rate was little changed for the week and
today at 6.0936 per dollar in Shanghai, 0.73 percent  premium  to
the daily fixing, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices
show. The PBOC set the  daily reference rate , which limits the
yuan’s movements to 1 percent on either side, 0.02 percent
weaker at 6.1380 today.  Bond Sale  The Ministry of Finance sold 7 billion yuan ($1.15 billion)
of Dim Sum bonds to institutional investors yesterday in  Hong
Kong . The three-year tranche  received  20.5 billion yuan of
applications for the 5 billion yuan sale, according to the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority. The five-year portion got 5.4 billion
yuan orders for the 2 billion yuan issuance, HKMA said.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.04
percent for the week and 0.07 percent today to 6.0769 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 1.55 percent this week. The
gauge was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
