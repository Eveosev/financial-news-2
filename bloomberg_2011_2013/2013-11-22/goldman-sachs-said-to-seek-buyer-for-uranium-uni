Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  put its
uranium trading unit up for sale as prices for the radioactive
metal fall and regulatory scrutiny of banks’ commodity
activities increases, a person briefed on the matter said.  The person asked not to be identified because the decision
hasn’t been made public. SparkSpread, an online energy
publication, reported the move earlier today.  Prices for uranium have declined since Japan’s Fukushima
nuclear disaster, which eroded demand for the metal as nations
shuttered reactors. Banks from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to UBS AG
have cut their price outlooks for next year as the radiation
leaks fan speculation that the restart of Japan’s idled plants
will take longer than expected.  The  Federal Reserve  is reviewing companies including
Goldman Sachs as U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns
that banks might abuse their various roles in physical
 commodities markets  for their own benefit, or that the
businesses pose risks to the firms’ financial stability.  The bank received inquiries from potential buyers for its
aluminum warehousing company, Metro International Trade Services
LLC, a person briefed on the matter said this week. New York-based Goldman Sachs bought Metro as a merchant banking
investment in 2010 and must sell it by 2020.  Goldman Sachs has said it has no intention of exiting its
broader commodities business. The firm said last month that
Magid N. Shenouda, its London-based co-head of commodities
trading, is leaving the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
