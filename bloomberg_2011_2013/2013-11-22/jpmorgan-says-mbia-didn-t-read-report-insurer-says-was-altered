MBIA Inc. (MBI)  didn’t even read a report
the bond insurer says was altered to hide deficiencies in a
$1.16 billion pool of mortgages until a week after it agreed to
insure the loans, attorneys for JPMorgan Chase & Co. told a New
York state judge.  Lawyers for JPMorgan asked state Supreme Court Justice Alan
D. Scheinkman in White Plains to throw out a lawsuit filed
against the bank by MBIA last year accusing its Bear Stearns
unit of inducing the insurer to back the pool by removing
information from a report showing underwriting and compliance
problems with the loans in the pool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
