San Francisco gasoline dropped for a
second day after a state report showed production of the fuel
rose to a record for this time of year and  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  was seen
finishing repairs on a refinery unit.  Gasoline weakened as Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden
Eagle refinery in Northern  California  neared the end of work on
a hydrocracker, which converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter
fuels such as high-octane gasoline, according to a person
familiar with the schedule. The unit was expected to return to
normal operations by next week, the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public, said Nov. 13.  The unit startup would come amid record-highs seasonal
production of California-blend gasoline, or Carbob. Output
jumped 8.6 percent to 7.23 million barrels a day in the week
ended Nov. 15, the most for that period since at least 1999,
according to data  compiled  by the state Energy Commission.  Carbob in San Francisco declined 2 cents against futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange to a discount of 12.5
cents a gallon at 1:57 p.m. East Coast time, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Retail gasoline  in California slipped 0.3 cent
to $3.556 a gallon, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA.  Carbob in Los Angeles weakened 1 cent to 3 cents a gallon
below futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and state-grade diesel in Los Angeles narrowed
for the first time in four days, shrinking 77 cents a barrel to
$12.53 at 4:20 p.m. New York time. The spread, an indicator of
refining profitability in the western U.S., has climbed 4.4
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
