J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , the retailer
struggling to bounce back from its worst sales year in two
decades, will be replaced in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by
Allegion Plc., S&P said in a statement today.  J.C. Penney’s market value fell 37 percent this year to
$2.7 billion, making it “more representative of the mid cap
market,” S&P said. Allegion, which makes residential and
commercial door locks, has a market capitalization of $4.2
billion. It was spun off from Ingersoll-Rand Plc and started
trading on the  New York  Stock Exchange on Nov. 18.  The  S&P 500  change will take place after the close of
trading on Nov. 29, S&P said. The revisions in the benchmark
equity index may prompt money managers to shift holdings to
match it. About $5.14 trillion was benchmarked to the gauge,
according to the S&P website.  J.C. Penney will bump Aeropostale Inc. from the S&P MidCap
400 Index, and Aeropostale will displace Corinthian Colleges
Inc. from the S&P SmallCap 600.  Shares of Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney have fallen 55
percent this year as the retailer reported quarterly losses in
each period since mid-2011, including $489 million last quarter.
The stock fell 1.4 percent in late trading today after losing
3.3 percent to close the regular session at $8.87.  Chief Executive Officer Mike Ullman, who returned as CEO in
April to replace  Ron Johnson , has restored promotions and
popular private-label brands while ending his predecessor’s
remodeling plan. He also raised about $4 billion to try to give
the company enough cash to complete a turnaround.  Revenue declines slowed in the quarter ended Nov. 2 and the
department-store chain said sales and profit margins would
improve during the  holiday shopping season .  To contact the reporter on this story:
