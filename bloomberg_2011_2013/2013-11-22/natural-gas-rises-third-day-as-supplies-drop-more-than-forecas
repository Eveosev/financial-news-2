Natural gas rose for a third day in
 New York  after a government release showed that U.S. inventories
dropped more than forecast last week.  Futures for December delivery gained 0.4 percent to $3.717
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , and were $3.712 at 1:41 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract climbed 0.8 percent yesterday to
settle at $3.702, the highest since Oct. 25.  Inventories slid 45 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Nov. 15 to 3.789 trillion, the Energy Information Administration
said yesterday. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed a
withdrawal of 38 billion cubic feet while a survey of Bloomberg
users predicted a decrease of 40 billion.  The low in New York on Nov. 27 may be 26 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 3 Celsius), 12 less than average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The low in
 Chicago  may also be 26 degrees, 3 lower than normal. About 49
percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, according to the
EIA, the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
