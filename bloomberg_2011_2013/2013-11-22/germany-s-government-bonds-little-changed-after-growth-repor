Germany ’s notes fell, with two-year
yields rising the most in 11 weeks, as the nation’s business
confidence climbed to the highest level in more than a year in
November, damping demand for the safest assets.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year
bonds over benchmark German securities narrowed after the Rome-based Treasury yesterday canceled debt auctions planned for Nov.
26 and Dec. 12, citing reduced funding needs. The yield on
Spain’s five-year notes dropped to the least relative to 10-year
securities since September 2012 on bets the  European Central
Bank  will keep its  interest rates  lower for longer.  “It’s just the normal reaction in the bund following a
stronger economic number,” said Mathias Van Der Jeugt, a fixed-income strategist at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “There is a
little bit of upside left.”  Germany’s two-year rate climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 0.14 percent as of 5 p.m. London time, the
biggest increase since Sept. 5. The zero percent note due in
December 2015 dropped 0.07, or 70 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,355) face amount, to 99.725. Ten-year bund yields were
little changed at 1.75 percent after climbing to 1.78 percent
yesterday, the  most  since Nov. 13.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 109.3 from 107.4 in
October, exceeding the 107.7 median estimate of 43 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. That’s the highest since April 2012. German
 gross domestic product  rose 0.3 percent in the third quarter,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today,
confirming a Nov. 14 estimate.  Italian Sale  Italy  canceled the scheduled auctions after selling 22.3
billion euros of inflation-linked bonds due in November 2017 to
retail investors earlier this month, the biggest-ever sale by a
European government.  “If Italy has less supply coming to the market, then in
the short term that is a slight positive,” said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “Italy
is pretty well supported by a search for yield. As the economy
improves people will be willing to continue to buy Italy and
Spain.”  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond fell two basis points to
4.08 percent, narrowing the spread by three basis points to
similar-maturity German bunds to 233 basis points.  The rate on  Spain ’s 10-year securities was little changed
at 4.10 percent, leaving the spread over German bunds one basis
point tighter at 236 basis points.  Yield Spread  The Spanish-German spread also shrank after Spain’s Economy
Ministry said it had covered 99.4 percent of planned sales for
this year and may use funds from subsequent auctions in 2013 to
redeem bills.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-year
bonds instead of five-year notes widened five basis points to
155 basis points, the most since September 2012.  European 10-year yields are rising quicker than five-year
rates after the ECB unexpectedly cut borrowing costs to a
 record-low  0.25 percent this month.  ‘Less Attractive’  The ECB pushed “the beginning of a possible tightening
cycle further out,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive director of
fixed-income research at Sunrise Brokers LLP in  London . “While
rates will almost certainly remain as low as they are for
another 1 1/2 to 2 years, I think it is a bit of a hazard to
project that so much further out. I think the market has over-reacted and the five-year has become to me less attractive than
longer maturities at these levels.”  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Belgium and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  German  government bonds  lost 1.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent and Italy’s earned 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
