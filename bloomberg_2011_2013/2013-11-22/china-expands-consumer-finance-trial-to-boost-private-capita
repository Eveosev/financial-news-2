China  is expanding a trial program
that allows non-bank financial institutions to lend to buyers of
retail goods, as policy makers seek to increase the role of
private capital in the economy.  The number of cities where consumer finance companies can
be set up will increase to 14 from four, according to  revised
rules  published on the website of the China Banking Regulatory
Commission today. The program will also expand to include
qualified non-financial companies, under rules that will take
effect next year, the CBRC said.  The expansion follows Chinese leaders’ announcement this
month of the biggest overhaul of the economy since the 1990s,
including a plan to allow private investors to set up small to
medium-sized banks. Premier Li Keqiang is seeking to reduce the
government’s role as the world’s second-largest economy heads
for its slowest growth in more than two decades.  By expanding the types of investors in consumer finance,
the regulator hopes to “make full use of private capital,” an
unidentified CBRC spokesperson said in a  separate statement  on
the revised rules. Individuals will be allowed to borrow as much
as 200,000  yuan  ($33,000) from consumer finance companies,
compared with a previous limit of five times their monthly
income, the CBRC said.  Under the trial program that has set up one company each in
Beijing, Tianjin,  Shanghai  and Chengdu since 2009, consumer
finance companies aren’t allowed to take deposits from the
public or fund purchases of houses or cars.  In addition to adding the 10 cities, the revised rules will
permit two qualified financial institutions from Hong Kong and
Macau to set up consumer finance business in Guangdong province,
bringing the number of new companies to 12, the regulator said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
