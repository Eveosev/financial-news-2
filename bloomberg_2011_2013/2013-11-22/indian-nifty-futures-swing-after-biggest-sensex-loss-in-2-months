Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced, with the
benchmark index gaining for the first time in three days, as
capital goods companies and banks advanced.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  increased 1 percent, helping the S&P BSE
Bankex index rebound from a 2.5 percent decline yesterday.
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  advanced 1.6 percent, leading a rally in
the BSE Capital Goods Index.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.4 percent to 20,303.51 at 10:02
a.m. in Mumbai. The gauge slumped the most since Sept. 3
yesterday as the rupee weakened after the U.S. Federal Reserve
signaled monetary stimulus may be reduced in coming months. The
Fed’s $85 billion of monthly bond-buying has helped fuel inflows
into Indian stocks this year. International investors have
bought a net $17.2 billion of Indian shares this year, the
highest after  Japan  among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Indian stocks will lead the next cycle of gains in
equities, along with South Korea and China, according to a
Credit Suisse Group Inc. report today. Elections next year
“could act as a catalyst to boost nominal gross domestic
product growth,” the report said.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index climbed 0.4 percent to 6,021.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
