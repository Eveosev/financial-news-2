U.S.  stocks  rose, capping a seventh
week of gains for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after the
pace of hiring increased and drugmakers rallied on favorable
decisions by European regulators.  Health-care stocks in the  S&P 500  jumped 1.2 percent as a
group, led by Biogen Idec Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. Time
Warner Cable Inc. surged 10 percent on renewed takeover
speculation.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  climbed 3.9
percent after billionaire David Tepper said his “big play in
the market” is airlines. International Business Machines Corp.
slid 1.5 percent after billionaire Stan Druckenmiller said he’s
shorting the shares.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.5 percent to a record 1,804.76 at 4
p.m. in New York. The advance pushed the U.S. equity benchmark
to a 27 percent gain for the year, poised to be the biggest
annual increase since 1998. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
rose 54.78 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,064.77. About 5.6
billion shares changed hands in the U.S., 8 percent below the
three-month average.  “I don’t see any reason why the market shouldn’t go up,”
Karyn Cavanaugh, a vice president and market strategist at ING
U.S. Investment Management in New York, said in a phone
interview. Her firm oversees $196 billion. “There’s not really
any bad news. We have a little bit of a pullback and then people
jump in and say, ’Hey, I want a piece of this.’”  The Dow advanced 0.6 percent this week, finishing its
seventh straight weekly gain, the longest streak since January
2011. The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent during the past five days.  Job Openings  David Tepper , the hedge-fund manager who runs Appaloosa
Management LP, said stock markets are not inflated as economies
in the U.S.,  Europe  and  China  are on “firm ground.” He said
that while he remains bullish on U.S. stocks, markets may fall 5
percent to 10 percent when the Fed curbs its stimulus program.  “I know there’s talk about bubbles, this is not one,”
Tepper said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s
 Stephanie Ruhle  at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in New
York yesterday.  Job openings in the U.S. climbed to a five-year high in
September, indicating employers were confident about demand
before the federal government shutdown. The Labor Department
report showed the number of people hired increased to 4.59
million in September, the most since August 2008, from 4.56
million. The hiring rate rose to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent in
August.  The S&P 500 rallied yesterday after three days of losses as
data showed weekly  jobless claims  fell to the lowest level since
September and a confidence survey indicated American consumers
became less pessimistic this month.  Fed Stimulus  “It’s hard to ignore all the tailwinds to this market,”
Chris Bouffard, chief investment officer of the Mutual Fund
Store in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , which oversees $8.5 billion,
said in a phone interview. “We’ve got low oil, that’s
definitely helping consumers, especially going into the key
holiday spending period. Buybacks and dividends are doing very
well.”  Economic stimulus from the Fed has helped the S&P 500 soar
167 percent since its March 2009 low. The gauge traded for about
17 times its companies’ reported earnings at its last record on
Nov. 15, the highest valuation since May 2010.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
gauge of S&P 500 options known as the VIX, slid 3.2 percent
today to 12.26. The measure is down 32 percent this year.  Drugmakers Rally  Biogen Idec  surged 13 percent to $285.62, the biggest gain
in more than two years. The company’s multiple sclerosis drug
Tecfidera won designation as a “new active substance” in
Europe, giving it added protection against generic copies and
paving the way for approval there. The pill is projected to be
the company’s top-seller by 2015.  Gilead rallied 3.7 percent to a record $74.27. The  drug
company  received a positive recommendation for its hepatitis C
treatment from the European Medicines Agency.  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. climbed 6.3 percent to
$293.68. An experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug the company
is developing with Sanofi eased symptoms and damage caused by
the disease in a clinical trial, advancing its prospects to
compete in the market.  United Continental rose 3.9 percent to $38.54. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. also lifted its rating on the  world’s biggest
airline  to buy from neutral.  Time Warner Cable jumped 10 percent to $132.92. Comcast
Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. have discussed a joint bid
for the company to divide its assets between them, people with
knowledge of the matter said. The talks between Comcast and
Charter were preliminary, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations are private.  Gap, Intel  Foot Locker Inc. (FL)  rallied 4.1 percent to $38.27. The largest
U.S. athletic shoe retailer posted third-quarter earnings of 68
cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate by 2
cents.  Ross Stores Inc. (ROST)  tumbled 5.7 percent to $75.67 for the
biggest decline in the S&P 500. The retailer of discount
designer wear  lowered its forecast  for fourth-quarter earnings
to no more than $1.01 a share, after previously predicting as
much as $1.03. That fell short of the average analyst estimate
of $1.08.  Gap Inc. fell 1.3 percent to $41.31. The biggest U.S.
specialty-apparel retailer maintained its annual  profit  forecast
range, signaling that the holiday-shopping quarter may fall
short of analysts’ estimates.  Intel, IBM  Intel Corp. (INTC)  lost 5.4 percent to $23.87. The world’s largest
maker of semiconductors said  revenue  will be approximately
unchanged in 2014. The company predicts the personal-computer
market, measured by units, to be down in the “low single-digit” percent, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said.  IBM fell 1.5 percent to $181.30. Stan Druckenmiller, who
boasts one of the hedge-fund industry’s best long-term track
records of the past three decades, said he’s betting against the
shares because the company’s business will be replaced by
technology such as cloud computing.  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. slid 2.3 percent to $34.15. The
retailer was cut to market perform from outperform at Wells
Fargo Securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
