A roof collapsed at a supermarket in
the Latvian capital  Riga  last night, killing at least 25 and
injuring three dozen more, prompting an overnight rescue
operation to search for other victims.  Fire and rescue teams may need 24 hours to work their way
through the rubble following the cave-in of a 500-square-meter
(5,400 square-feet) section of roof at a Maxim supermarket,
ministry and rescue officials said. Twenty-eight were
hospitalized and seven others were being treated at the scene,
said Emergency Services spokeswoman Ilze Buksa.  The army and state police were assisting heavy machinery to
clear debris as they search for survivors, the  Baltic News
Service  reported today. Abolins said emergency teams were forced
to stop work twice to listen for anyone seeking help.  “We express our deepest condolences for the families of
the deceased employees and customers,” Maxima, the biggest
supermarket chain in the Baltic states, said on its Latvian
website, which showed only a statement with a black background.  To contact the reporter on this story:
