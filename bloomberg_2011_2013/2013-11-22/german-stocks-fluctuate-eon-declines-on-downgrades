utility, fell as Kepler Cheuvreux and Commerzbank AG reduced
their ratings on the shares.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.3 percent to 9,219.04 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt . The benchmark has surged 21 percent in
2013 as central banks around the world pledged to leave  interest
rates  low for a prolonged period. The gauge, which rose 0.6
percent this week, is trading at 13.7 times its members’
projected earnings, near the highest valuation since 2009. The
broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  also gained 0.3 percent today.  “Our view is pretty much that the ingredients for the
markets to see higher levels are still very much in place,”
said Ashish Misra, who helps oversee $18 billion at Lloyds Bank
Private Banking in  London . “There is still value in equities
and we’re seeing growth in many parts of the world.”  German business confidence surged to the highest in more
than 1 1/2 years in November. The Ifo institute’s  business
climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased
to 109.3 from 107.4 in October. Economists forecast a gain to
107.7, according to the median of 43 estimates in a  Bloomberg
News survey .  Debt Overhang  ECB governing council member Peter Praet said at a
conference in Paris that Europe has a debt overhang problem that
needs to be addressed “forcefully.” Policy makers have already
lost time in tackling it, he said. His colleague in the council
and Bank of Austria governor, Ewald Otto Nowotny, said the
regional economy has too little demand and fixing the banking
system alone isn’t enough to end the crisis.  TUI rose 1.2 percent to 10.44 euros, its highest price
since February 2011. Fredriksen sold his stake in TUI Travel Plc
to buy more stock in German parent company TUI. Fredriksen’s

brought forward a sales target for driver-assist systems to 2016
from 2020, Handelsblatt reported, quoting an interview with new
chassis & safety division head Frank Jourdan.  EON dropped 0.5 percent to 14.02 euros, paring earlier

Both Commerzbank and Kepler said its earnings outlook doesn’t
justify the share-price gain since July. EON rose 18 percent
