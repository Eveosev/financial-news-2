India ’s 10-year government bonds
headed for a sixth weekly loss after faster inflation sparked
concern the central bank will raise interest rates and as the
Federal Reserve signaled it may reduce its monetary stimulus.  The Fed might pare its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases in the “coming months” as the U.S. economy improves,
minutes of an October policy meeting released Nov. 20 showed.
Foreign funds have cut holdings of rupee-denominated debt by
more than $14 billion from an  all-time high  of $38.5 billion in
mid-May.  Wholesale prices  in India rose 7 percent in October
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since February.  “Inflation is trending higher while the Fed tapering
overhang remains,” said Harish Agarwal, a fixed-income trader
at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “Markets are keen to see what
stance the Reserve Bank of India takes to tackle inflation.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 climbed 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, this week to 9.12 percent
as of 10:14 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central
bank’s trading system. The rate, which rose four basis points
today, is set for the highest close since Aug. 19.  The RBI will auction new 10-year bonds today. The central
bank boosted its  repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75
percent on Oct. 29, the second consecutive increase. The
monetary authority will carefully study data before deciding
whether to raise the benchmark rate again, Governor Raghuram
Rajan said Nov. 13.  Consumer-price inflation  quickened to 10.1
percent in October, a separate report showed last week.  India’s one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract
used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three
basis points to 8.65 percent this week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
