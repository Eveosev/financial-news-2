Canadian  stocks  rose for a second
day, leaving the benchmark index poised for a third weekly gain,
as precious metals producers rallied and data showed  consumer
spending  in September jumped more than projected.  Pretium Resources Inc. surged 63 percent after saying gold
recovered from an ore sample at its British Columbia project
surpassed targets. Silver Standard Resources Inc. added 4
percent as the price of the metal advanced. Manulife Financial
Corp., the nation’s largest insurer, added 1.1 percent to pace
gains among financial stocks.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 27.79
points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,503.12 at 10:05 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge has risen 0.1 percent this week and
is up 8.6 percent this year.  Canadian  retail sales  rose more than three times faster
than economists forecast in September, adding 1 percent to a
record C$40.7 billion ($38.7 billion), on the biggest gain at
new  car dealerships  in more than four years. Canada’s annual
inflation rate slowed more than expected to 0.7 percent in
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
