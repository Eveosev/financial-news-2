Mexico ’s inflation-linked bonds
gained, pushing yields on debt due in three years to a two-week
low, after a report showed consumer prices rose more than
forecast in the first half of November.  Yields on inflation-linked securities maturing in June 2016
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.65
percent at 9 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The peso slipped 0.1 percent to 13.0471 per dollar,
extending its decline this week to 0.8 percent.  Investor demand for the bonds rose as the national
statistics agency said Mexico’s consumer prices increased 0.85
percent in the first two weeks of this month, compared with the
0.74 percent median forecast of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation accelerated to 3.51 percent.  “You’re going to see demand because of the inflation
data,” Roberto Ivan Garcia Castellanos, a bond trader at Casa
de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said in a telephone interview from
Guadalajara, Mexico.  The peso climbed yesterday as a report showed that  Latin
America ’s second-biggest economy expanded faster than forecast
last quarter. Gross domestic product rose 1.3 percent from a
year earlier, compared with the 1 percent median estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Yields on fixed-rate peso bonds due in June 2016 dropped
one basis point to 4.10 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yields are up five basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
