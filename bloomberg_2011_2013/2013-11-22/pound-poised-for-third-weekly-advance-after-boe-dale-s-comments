The pound declined from a two-week
high against the euro as  Bank of England  policy maker  Spencer Dale  said it would take a long time until the U.K. economy was
strong enough to justify higher  interest rates .  Sterling extended losses versus the 17-nation currency
after a German report showed business confidence in Europe’s
biggest economy surged to the highest level in 19 months. While
the U.K. is recovering, there’s still “a long way to go”
before it has healed enough to withstand higher borrowing costs,
Dale said in an interview on BBC Radio Merseyside. U.K.
government bonds rose, paring a weekly decline.  “They are not in a rush to hike rates,” said  Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan.
“This rally of sterling may be excessive and some correction
might be on the cards while the euro should sustain gains.”  The pound weakened 0.4 percent to 83.54 pence per euro at
4:11 p.m. London time after appreciating to 83.17 pence, the
strongest level since Nov. 7. The U.K. currency was little
changed at $1.6193. It earlier climbed to $1.6217, the highest
since Oct. 25.  U.K. policy makers will raise interest rates “when we’ve
seen a sustained recovery and the economy is strong enough to
stand it,” Dale said. “The message we’ve been giving to
businesses is that we don’t think that’s anytime soon.”  Bank of England officials are not in a “rush” to increase
the benchmark rate from a record-low 0.5 percent, the Sun
newspaper quoted Deputy Governor  Charles Bean  as saying in an
interview yesterday. While growth was picking up it was still
muted, he said.  German Confidence  The pound weakened for the first time in three days versus
the euro as the Ifo institute said its German business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 109.3
in November, the highest since April 2012. The result exceeded
all 43 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The pound has strengthened 6.8 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 4.2 percent, while the dollar weakened 1.6 percent.  Sterling climbed to the highest in more than three years
versus  Australia ’s dollar today amid speculation U.K. data next
week will confirm economic growth accelerated in the third
quarter and a gauge of  house prices  rose for a seventh month.  Economic ‘Resilience’  Gross domestic product  climbed 0.8 percent after growing
0.7 percent in the previous three months, according to a
Bloomberg survey before the  Office for National Statistics 
releases the figures on Nov. 27.  Home prices  climbed 0.7 percent
in November, a separate survey showed before the  Nationwide
Building Society  issues the report next week.  “Going into next week we expect the upcoming U.K. data to
highlight the resilience of the economic recovery and
corroborate the view that the Bank of England would be moving
towards removing policy accommodation before long,”  Valentin Marinov , head of European Group-of-10 currency strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in a research note.  “All that
should keep sterling supported for now.”  The pound gained 0.8 percent to A$1.7682 after rising to
A$1.7702, the strongest since July 2010. The U.K. currency was
little changed at 164.94 yen. It earlier appreciated to 164.13
yen, the highest since October 2008.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.80 percent, trimming this week’s
increase to five basis points. The 2.25 percent bond due in
September 2023 rose 0.175, or 1.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 95.345.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.5 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.3 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  declined
2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
