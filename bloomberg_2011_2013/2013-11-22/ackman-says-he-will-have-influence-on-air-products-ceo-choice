Activist investor  William Ackman 
said he’ll be able to influence the selection of the next chief
executive officer at  Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD)  after taking
a stake in the industrial-gas company.  “We have the opportunity to interview the finalists for
the job,” Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management
LP, said today in an interview with  Stephanie Ruhle  on Bloomberg
Television. “We’ll have influence, but the board will identify
the next CEO with some input from us.”  Air Products said in September that its CEO and Chairman
John E. McGlade will retire next year, less than two months
after Pershing Square became its largest shareholder. The next
CEO will be recommended by a committee of Air Products directors
with help from an executive search firm, the Allentown,
Pennsylvania-based company said Sept. 26.  Ackman said Air Products’ operational efficiency can be
improved in the coming years. There are no plans for a large
financial restructuring, he said.  Pershing Square holds a 9.8 percent stake in Air Products,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
