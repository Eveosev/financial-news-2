Rigs targeting oil and natural gas
in the U.S. dropped by one this week to 1,761, according to
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  increased two to 1,387, data posted on the
company’s website show. The  gas  count dropped one to 369, the
Houston-based field services company said. Miscellaneous rigs
were down two to five.  The volume of crude and gas extracted per rig has jumped to
records in shale plays across the U.S. as companies adopt more
efficient drilling and completion techniques, boosting the yield
from wells and helping increase domestic oil production to the
highest level in two decades. The advances have weakened
companies’ appetite for more rigs, driving the  U.S. rig count
 down by 56 in the past year.  U.S. oil output slipped 7,000 barrels a day to 7.97 million
in the seven days ended Nov. 15 from the highest level since
January 1989 in the previous week, according to data compiled by
the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm. Crude  stockpiles  climbed 375,000 barrels to
388.5 million barrels, a record seasonal high.  West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery declined
34 cents to $95.10 a barrel at 1:07 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, up 8.8 percent in the past year.  U.S. gas stockpiles  slid 45 billion cubic feet last week to
3.789 trillion, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were 2.3
percent below a year earlier and 0.4 percent above the five-year
average.  Natural gas for December delivery rose 7.1 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.773 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex, down 3.3 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
