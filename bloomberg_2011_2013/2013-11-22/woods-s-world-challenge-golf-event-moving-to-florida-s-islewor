Tiger Woods’s World Challenge U.S.
PGA Tour event will move to Florida’s Isleworth Golf & Country
Club from California next year.  This year’s event, scheduled for Dec. 2-8, will be the last
to be played at Sherwood Country Club in  Thousand Oaks ,
California, where it has been staged for the past 13 years. The
2014 challenge is scheduled for Dec. 1-7 at Isleworth in
 Orlando , Florida, where Woods lived from 1996 to 2011.  Isleworth was the site of the one-car accident four years
ago that left Woods injured and led to revelations of serial
adultery, which cost him his marriage and several sponsors.  Woods, a 14-time major tournament champion and ranked as
the world’s top golfer, announced the tournament change on his
website yesterday.  The tournament has an 18-player field, with the current
four major winners, the top 11 available from the Official World
Golf Ranking, the defending champion and two special-exemption
entries. It counts for points in the world ranking but prize
money doesn’t count toward the U.S. tour’s season title.  Graeme McDowell won the 2012 tournament, with Woods tying
for fourth with  Jim Furyk  and  Rickie Fowler .  In August, the tournament added Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance Co. as its title sponsor, two years after  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  ended its support of the event. Northwestern is the
tournament’s fourth title sponsor in 15 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
