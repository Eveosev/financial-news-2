West Texas Intermediate’s discount
to Brent reached an eight-month high as rising inventories
weighed on U.S. futures and limited progress in  Iran  nuclear
negotiations supported the European benchmark.  The spread widened to $16.21 from $14.64 yesterday. WTI
declined as rising domestic output added to inventories at
record highs for this time of year. Brent reached a six-week
high as envoys haggled over language in their efforts to ease
the standoff over the atomic ambitions of Iran, whose oil
exports have been reduced by sanctions.  “We have increasing crude oil supplies here in the U.S.,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “WTI is under
pressure. The market is very skeptical that a deal is going to
be achievable. That’s helping Brent disproportionately.”  WTI for January delivery slid 60 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$94.84 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
settling yesterday at the highest since Oct. 31. Trading was 12
percent below the 100-day average. WTI’s weekly gain of 1.1
percent was the first since Oct. 4.  Brent for January gained 97 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$111.05 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest settlement since Oct. 11. Brent has gained
3.9 percent in three days.  The Brent-WTI spread increased for a third day to $16.21,
the most since March 14. The gap has expanded by $5.69 in the
past two weeks.  Rising Stockpiles  U.S.  crude inventories  expanded amid a surge in production.
Stockpiles climbed by 375,000 barrels to 388.5 million in the
seven days to Nov. 15, the Energy Information Administration
reported on Nov. 20. That’s the highest level since June 21.  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI
futures, increased for a sixth week to 39.9 million barrels, the
most since July.  Domestic  production  was little changed from the Nov. 8
level of 7.98 million barrels a day, the highest in 24 years.
U.S. crude production surpassed imports in October for the first
time since 1995, according to the EIA.  “We have more than enough oil out there and prices should
be lower,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.  Iran Talks  Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations
 Security Council  plus  Germany  are negotiating to break the
nuclear deadlock and help remove sanctions that might resume oil
exports. Differences remain over how extensively powers can
recognize Iran’s uranium-enrichment work, which the Security
Council has ordered stopped. Failure to strike an accord
increases the prospects that U.S. legislators will seek to
impose more sanctions. The talks were scheduled to end today.  “Things could get worse in Iran and it’s going to be
supportive for Brent,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst
at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “WTI is having a hard
time moving higher because there is so much supply.”  Iran was the sixth-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last month with 2.6 million
barrels a day, according to a Bloomberg survey. That’s down
565,000 barrels from June 2012, when it was ranked second.  WTI may decline next week on rising inventories. Fourteen
of 29 analysts, or 48 percent, forecast crude will fall through
Nov. 29. Nine predicted a gain.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
January was 16.1 percent, down from 16.4 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 458,111
contracts as of 2:54 p.m. It totaled 481,981 contracts
yesterday, 16 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.63 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
