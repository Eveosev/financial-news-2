Royal Mail Plc (RMG) , the U.K.’s 360-year-old postal company, missed service-quality targets set by
regulators to ensure regular mail deliveries.  The company delivered 91.7 percent of First Class letters
the day after collection in the year through March, compared
with a 93 percent target, the U.K.’s communications competition
authority Ofcom said in a statement today. The postal service
also failed to make next-day deliveries to many parts of the
U.K., completing this service in only 62 percent of postcodes,
below the 91.5 percent required, Ofcom said.  “Should it miss the targets in future, Ofcom will consider
opening a formal investigation which could result in enforcement
action, including the possibility of fines,” the regulator
said.  Royal Mail  raised 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) in an
initial public offering last month, a move that was opposed by
many union members and opposition politicians.  “We were disappointed that we didn’t meet all of the
regulatory quality of service targets we were required to last
year,” a Royal Mail spokesman said in an e-mailed statement.
“This remains a key area of focus for us.”  About 86 percent of residential customers are generally
satisfied with the postal service, Ofcom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
