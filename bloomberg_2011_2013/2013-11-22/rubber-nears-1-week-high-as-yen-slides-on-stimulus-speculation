Rubber advanced to near one-week
high as  Japan ’s currency slid to a four-month low against the
dollar, boosting the appeal of yen-based futures, amid
speculation the  Bank of Japan  may add stimulus.  The contract for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange gained 0.7 percent to settle at 260 yen a kilogram
($2,574 a metric ton), the highest level since Nov. 18. Futures
pared losses to 0.8 percent this week.  The yen slid to 101.35 per dollar, the lowest level since
July 8, and was poised for its longest stretch of weekly
declines since February. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said today
he does not think the yen is excessively weak, and the bank will
do the utmost to restrict long-term yield gains.  “Speculation is growing that the BOJ may add stimulus to
sustain growth and achieve its inflation goal, leading to sales
of the yen and purchases of futures in Tokyo,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 0.5 percent to close at 19,095  yuan  ($3,134) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board rose 0.3 percent to 78.85 baht ($2.48) a
kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
