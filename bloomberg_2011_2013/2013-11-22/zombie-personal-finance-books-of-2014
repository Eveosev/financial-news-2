"Stop it. Just stop it," you said. "Stop with the personal finance books. Twelve ways to build my nest egg. Six ways to retire at 60. Sixty ways to retire at 6. What would the Buddha do with $5,000 and the right ETF? I can't take it anymore." Well, you know what? Neither can they. How much longer do you think the personal finance gurus, exhausted by their own rhetoric and embarrassed by their awkward wealth, can muster the energy, or the nerve, to counsel us bunglers? I give it six weeks.  In 2014, a mutant strain of empowerment and advice books will begin to spread, each with Zombie in the title, entirely without justification and solely as the deal closer. After five are published, the whole industry will implode, like one of those stars only Stephen Hawking can explain, and honestly not even then. But what a five. Buying stocks at highs And selling them at their lows Is not a great move *** Make contributions That your company may match Free money. Rejoice! *** Think of a load fund As your very own ball, chain Hurts thinking of it Suzanne Woolley is  personal finance  editor of Bloomberg.com.
