The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission should make greater use of investor surveys to test
the value of new disclosure regulations before making them
permanent, SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar said today.  Disclosure requirements should be tested in the same way
consumer products and services are vetted by focus groups and
potential customers, Piwowar said in a speech at the Los Angeles
County Bar Association. A trial period would help inform whether
the materials convey useful information or affect investor
behavior, he said.  The SEC typically screens new regulations by soliciting
comment letters from companies, industry organizations and
public-interest groups. The agency has surveyed investors before
about changes to disclosure reports, including a 2010 plan that
proposed altering the way target-date retirement funds show
their  asset allocation .  “I expect that the staff will consider, in rulemakings
with a disclosure component, whether it is appropriate to engage
in investor testing of the proposed disclosure,” said Piwowar,
one of two Republicans on the five-member commission. “It is a
far better approach to consideration of disclosure proposals to
have empirical data, rather than rely exclusively upon the
beliefs and opinions expressed in comment letters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
