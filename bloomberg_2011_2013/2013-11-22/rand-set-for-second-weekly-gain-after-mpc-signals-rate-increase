The rand swung between gains and
losses, headed for its second weekly advance, after  South
Africa ’s central bank indicated it may raise borrowing costs as
a weaker currency fuels inflation.  The Monetary Policy Committee left the repurchase rate at 5
percent yesterday, matching the forecasts of all 23 economists
in a Bloomberg poll. While inflation slowed last month and the
central bank lowered its price projections, MPC members spent
“considerable time” discussing raising  interest rates  in the
face of inflation threats, Governor Gill Marcus said.  “Governor Marcus iterated time and again in the statement
about the continued risks to inflation along with a downward
revision in growth, so on balance it was certainly more hawkish
than we expected,” Mohammed Nalla, head of strategic research
at Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by e-mail. The rand
may trade between 10.05 and 10.25 per dollar today, he said.  South Africa’s currency advanced less than 0.1 percent to
10.1256 per dollar as of 10:07 a.m. in Johannesburg after
gaining as much as 0.1 percent and declining 0.2 percent
earlier. The rand is poised for a 0.3 percent appreciation this
week. Yields on benchmark bonds due December 2026 dropped five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.21 percent,
following a 12 basis-point jump yesterday.  Foreign investors  sold  a net 3.12 billion rand ($308
million) of South African bonds yesterday, the most in a day
since May 29, according to JSE Ltd. data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
