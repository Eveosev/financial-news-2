Shenzhen is selling a collectively-owned rural land parcel in the city’s first trial of such land
sales, property website Guandian.cn  reported  today.  The 14,568-square-meter (156,808-square-feet) site in the
southern Chinese city has a starting price of 116 million  yuan 
($19 million), according to the report, citing a statement from
the local land exchange center. Local information-technology
companies that have started preparations for an initial public
offering would qualify as a buyer, according to the  statement .  The sale follows a local  government regulation  introduced
in January that allows rural collectives to sell land-use
rights, according to the Guandian.cn report. Owners of the land
will get 30 percent of the proceeds, while the government will
take the remaining 70 percent, according to the report.  Citic Trust Co. set up  China ’s first trust to invest in
rural land, offering farmers a way to cash in on their usage
rights as the world’s second-largest economy continues property
reforms and speeds up urbanization.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
