Oils produced on the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate late
in the spring refinery maintenance season as WTI’s  discount to
Brent widened .  WTI weakened against Brent by 52 cents to $16.52 a barrel
at 2:07 p.m. in New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.
 Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Borger refinery completed maintenance work
yesterday and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Pascagoula Mississippi refinery
was said to be on schedule to finish coker work next week.  “Crude prices haven’t been this low in a while,” said
Carl Larry, broker at Houston-based Atlas Commodities LLC.
“Refiners just say ‘Hey, let’s pick up as much as we can on the
 spot market , process as much as we can in the next couple
weeks.’”  Poseidon’s premium gained $1.30 to $16.20 a barrel over WTI
at 1:53 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Southern Green Canyon gained $1.50 a barrel to a
$14.25 premium.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI rose by 90 cents to $15.65 a
barrel. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
strengthened by 30 cents to $18.15.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 75 cents a
barrel to $21.25. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 70 cents a barrel
to $20.50.  Bakken crude  strengthened 50 cents to a premium of 25
cents. West Texas Sour weakened 25 cents to a discount of 50
cents.  The discount for Western Canada Select against WTI weakened
40 cents to $20 a barrel, according to Calgary oil broker Net
Energy Inc., which also reported that Syncrude’s premium
weakened 25 cents against WTI to trade at $5.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
