Ukrainian wheat and corn stockpiles
declined from a year earlier, according to the countryâ€™s
 Agriculture Ministry .  Inventories of wheat fell to 6.5 million metric tons early
this month, the ministry said in a statement yesterday. That
compared with 8.1 million tons as of March 1, 2012, according to
government statistics. Ukraine will require 3.5 million tons of
the grain for domestic needs through the end of the marketing
year on June 30, the ministry said.  Total grain stocks were 22 million tons as of early March,
the statement showed, against 21 million tons a year earlier.
The ministry projected domestic demand at about 9.7 million tons
from March through June.  Corn inventories dropped to 9.5 million tons early this
month, the ministry said. That compared with 9.7 million tons of
the grain at March 1 last year, government figures showed.  Barley stockpiles were estimated by the ministry at 4.4
million tons at the start of this month. A year earlier, they
contained 2.1 million tons of the grain used in brewing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
