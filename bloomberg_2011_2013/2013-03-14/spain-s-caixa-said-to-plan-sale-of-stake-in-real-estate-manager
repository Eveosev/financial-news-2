Spain ’s La Caixa banking group
plans to sell a stake in its real  estate  management company to
tap demand from investors seeking to profit from the country’s
property crash, people familiar with the plans said.  La Caixa, which owns Spain’s third-biggest  bank , plans to
offer investors a stake in the property management division it
created as part of last month’s  reorganization  of its real
estate arm, ServiHabitat, said the people, who asked not to be
named because the information hasn’t been made public.  Investors are looking for ways to profit from Spanish
lenders’ struggle to recover from a property crash that has left
the industry with more than 180 billion euros ($233 billion) of
soured real estate loans. Like its competitors,  La Caixa  has
been forced to manage properties it repossessed by renting or
selling them. Revenue from those operations doubled last year to
1.6 billion euros, according to the lender.  “A myriad of different players are entering the Spanish
servicing market, from traditional international service
providers to investors interested in controlling their asset
management,” Vanesa Carceller, director for Spain at Bluestone
Group, a real estate services firm, said in a telephone
interview, without referring to any specific transaction.  A spokeswoman for Barcelona-based La Caixa, who asked not
to be named in line with company policy, declined to comment.  The group had net repossessed real estate valued at about 7
billion euros at the end of 2012. As part of a 2011
reorganization of La Caixa, the group transferred most of the
real estate assets accumulated before that date to a holding
company separate from its publicly traded bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
