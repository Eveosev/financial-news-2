Treasury 30-year bonds fell as the
U.S. government’s sale of $13 billion of the securities
attracted the weakest demand in seven months amid signs the
recovery in the world’s biggest economy is gathering momentum.  The auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of debt offered, was 2.43,
the lowest since August, versus 2.74 at last month’s offering.
The sale was the final of three note-and-bond auctions this week
totaling $66 billion. Treasuries slid earlier as U.S. jobless
claims unexpectedly fell, fueling risk appetite.  “There was less demand in general after yesterday’s pretty
strong auction, as we are still in somewhat of a bearish
environment,” said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at
Tradition Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “That
said, we could be set up for a rally given these higher
yields.”  The yield on  30-year bonds  increased two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.24 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. It touched 3.26
percent after reaching 3.28 percent on March 8, the highest
level since April 5. The price of the 3.125 percent security due
in February 2043 declined 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount,
to 97 27/32.  Benchmark 10-year note yields rose one basis point to 2.03
percent and reached 2.07 percent. They touched 2.08 percent on
March 8, the highest since April.  Bond Auction  Treasuries trading volume rose 8 percent today to $313.7
billion, the highest level since March 8’s $384 billion,
according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S.
government debt . The average daily volume for the past year is
$247 billion.  The long-bond sale drew a  yield  of 3.248 percent, the
highest since March 2012. That compared with an average forecast
of 3.243 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers, who are obliged to bid in
U.S. debt offerings.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42 percent of the bonds, compared with
36.4 percent at the Feb. 14 bond sale and an average of 35.8
percent for the past 10 offerings.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 4.9 percent,
the least since September 2009, versus 14.5 percent at the
previous sale and an average of 15.8 percent for the past 10.  Primary dealers  bought 53.1 percent of the securities, the
most since October.  Shows Reluctance  “Dealers own a bit more than they usually do,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It demonstrates reluctance to
get involved.”  Long bonds have lost 5.1 percent this year, compared with a
1 percent decline in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a
yield of 2.029 percent, compared with a forecast of 2.057
percent in a Bloomberg survey of eight primary dealers. The
government auctioned $32 billion of  three-year notes  on March 12
at a yield of 0.411 percent, below the 0.413 percent average
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  A daily close by the 10-year yield above 2.06 percent,
which would be the first since April 2012, would confirm
weakness in the note, said  George Davis , chief technical analyst
for fixed income in Toronto at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC
Capital Markets unit. The yield has risen this year in an
ascending-channel pattern, a chart formation that shows higher
highs and higher lows over time.  ‘Bearish Tone’  “The market continues to exhibit the bearish tone we’ve
seen since December, and will continue if we breach 2.06
percent, a significant level,” Davis said in a telephone
interview. “We are in for more of a gradual grind higher in
yields instead of a spike, given the Fed’s continued purchases.
But any rally should be seen as a selling opportunity.”  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
each month to spur the economy. It purchased $3.34 billion today
of Treasuries maturing from May 2020 to February 2023.  “Yield rises are limited until increased expectation that
the Fed will scale back easing,” said  Adrian Miller , director
of fixed-income strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York.
“The Fed has put a ceiling on rates.”  Treasuries fell earlier as the Labor Department reported
initial claims for  unemployment benefits  fell by 10,000 to
332,000 in the week ended March 9, the fewest since mid-January.
A Bloomberg survey forecast an increase to 350,000.  Ten- and 30-year yields reached the highest levels in 11
months on March 8 after the department said U.S. payrolls
increased by 236,000 jobs last month, more than forecast.  Inflation Bets  Traders’ inflation expectations rose today. The yield gap
between 10-year notes and Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, called the 10-year  break-even rate , increased to
2.59 percentage points, the widest since Sept. 17 on a closing
basis. The gap signals traders’ outlook for consumer prices over
the life of the debt. It has averaged 2.35 over the past year.  Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in February from a year
earlier, a Bloomberg survey forecast before data tomorrow.  Treasury securities due in a decade and more traded at
almost the cheapest level since 2011 relative to global peers
with comparable maturities, according to the Bank of America
indexes. Yields on Treasuries were 54 basis points higher on
March 8 than those in an index of other sovereign debt, the most
since August 2011, the data showed. The spread was 53 basis
points yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
