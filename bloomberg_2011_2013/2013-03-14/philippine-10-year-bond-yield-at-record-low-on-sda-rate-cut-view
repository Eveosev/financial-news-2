Philippine 20-year bonds gained,
pushing the yield to a one-year low, as the central bank cut the
 interest rate  on its special-deposit accounts for a second time
this year. The peso weakened  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reduced the rate on the
accounts to 2.5 percent from 3 percent today and set the rate on
all tenors for its reverse-repurchase facility at 3.5 percent,
the same as the overnight borrowing rate, Governor Amando
Tetangco said in a briefing. The two SDA cuts this year will
result in 20 billion pesos ($493 million) of annual savings for
the monetary authority, Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said.  “Bids continue to flock to the long-end of the curve to
lock-in spreads after the SDA rate cut,” said Bunny Bernardo- Recto, vice president at Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank
Corp. in  Manila .  The yield on the 5.875 percent bonds due March 2032 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.48 percent
after the decision, according to Tradition Financial Services.
That’s the lowest since the notes were first sold a year ago.  The peso closed 0.1 percent lower at 40.625 per dollar
before the policy announcement, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
It’s the best-performing emerging-market currency in the past 12
months, appreciating 5.6 percent. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 11 basis points to 3.62 percent.  BSP will continue to review all tools and will take into
account the rising level of liquidity, Assistant Governor Amador
said at the briefing today. The monetary authority has raised
its inflation forecast for 2013 to 3.3 percent from 3 percent,
she said.  The savings from the first SDA rate cut will allow BSP “to
participate a little bit more” in the foreign-currency market,
Monetary Board Member Felipe Medalla said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
