The volatility of  Chile ’s peso
dropped to a 14-year low amid speculation the central bank might
intervene to limit appreciation.  The currency was little changed at 471.03 per dollar as of
11:42 a.m. in Santiago. Thirty-day volatility, a gauge of the
magnitude of the currency’s average daily fluctuations over the
past 30 days, dropped to the lowest since June 1998.  The peso has traded in a narrowing range for more than two
months amid concern the central bank might step in as a growing
economy and stable  interest rates  pressure the currency to
strengthen. The peso has traded between 470 and 473 per dollar
since March 4.  “The range keeps tightening.” said Eugenio Cortes, head
of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “You have intervention on one side and the growing
economy on the other.”  The Chilean central bank is scheduled to meet today. The
bank probably will leave its benchmark rate unchanged at 5
percent for a 14th straight month, according to all 20
economists in a  Bloomberg survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
