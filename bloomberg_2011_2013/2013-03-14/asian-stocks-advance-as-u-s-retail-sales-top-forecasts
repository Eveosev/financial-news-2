Asian  stocks  outside Japan
declined, led by material producers and developers, on concern
policy makers in  China  will step up efforts to cool the property
market and as Hong Kong banks raised mortgage rates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, slid
2.3 percent in Sydney as commodity prices fluctuated. Country
Garden Holdings Co., the Chinese developer controlled by
billionaire Yang Huiyan, declined 2.9 percent. Japan’s Nikkei
255 Stock Average, the best performing developed-market
benchmark gauge this year, rose after the lower house of
Japanese Parliament endorsed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
nominees for the central bank leadership.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index (MXAP)  dropped 0.3
percent to 476.1 as of 6:17 p.m. Hong Kong time, with about four
shares falling for every three that rose. The gauge is heading
for its third day of decline after data on the weekend showed
inflation rose at the fastest pace in 10 months and People’s
Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said monetary policy is
“no longer relaxed.”  “Asian equities continue to underperform partly because of
concerns over tightening measures in China,” said John Woods, a
Hong Kong-based Asian strategist at Citigroup’s private bank.
“This consolidation has further to run. We’re still positive on
the global economy so we’re looking at this leg down as an
opportunity to build risk.”  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.2 percent even as
the country’s employers increased payrolls in February by the
most in almost 13 years. Taiwan’s Taiex Index lost 0.6 percent.
The Philippine Stock Exchange Index sank 1.2 percent, while the
Jakarta Composite Index dropped 1 percent.  Abe’s Rally  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes companies from
 Japan , slid 0.1 percent to 135.14. The Nikkei 255 jumped 1.2
percent, rising for the first time in three days. The lower
house of Parliament today approved Haruhiko Kuroda for governor
and Kikuo Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso for deputy governor posts.
Prime Minister Abe now needs to get his nominations through a
vote tomorrow in the upper house, where his Liberal Democratic
Party lacks a majority.  The Japanese benchmark gauge has rallied for the past seven
months amid speculation more would be done to boost the world’s
third-biggest economy. Net equity purchases by foreign investors
in Japan reached 1.12 trillion ($11.7 billion) last week, the
highest since March 2004, according to  data  tracked by
Bloomberg.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.3 percent, erasing a
drop of as much as 1.1 percent, as a rally in Chinese railway
and utility companies in the final hour of trading countered
declines among developers. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
of mainland shares rose 0.6 percent, reversing earlier losses of
as much as 1.3 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3
percent, after earlier falling 0.5 percent.  Chinese President  China’s national legislature named Xi Jinping as the
country’s president, replacing Hu Jintao in the country’s most
rapid formal transfer of power in more than a generation.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.9 percent to an all-
time high after central bank governor Graeme Wheeler pledged to
keep borrowing costs at a record low until next year. South
Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.1 percent, erasing earlier losses of
1.1 percent.  India ’s S&P BSE Sensex Index climbed 1.1 percent, poised
for its first gain this week, as a slowdown in non-food
inflation signaled the central bank may have room to cut rates.

basis points to 7.5 percent on March 19, according to 15 of 16
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded yesterday at

decline among the 10 industry groups in the Asia-Pacific gauge,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Lead, copper, iron ore
and zinc dropped amid concern heightened property curbs in China
will reduce demand.  BHP fell 2.3 percent to A$35.09 in Sydney.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ,

for the railway industry, resulting in 1.11 trillion  yuan  ($179
billion) in additional government spending, according to
Barclays Plc.  China Resources Gas Group Ltd. (1193) , a supplier of piped natural
gas and petroleum products, jumped 5.3 percent to HK$19.48 after
