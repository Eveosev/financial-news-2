Gasoline fluctuated in  New York ,
rebounding from an earlier decline as U.S. initial jobless
claims dropped.  Futures were little changed after a 1.4 percent drop.
Volatility in gasoline remained higher than in crude amid swings
in the cost of Renewable Identification Numbers for 2013
vintage, or RINS, that refiners must buy in lieu of blending
ethanol into gasoline.  “The jobs report was positive,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “We’ve seen a
huge amount of volatility in the gasoline contract as the market
tries to figure out the impact of the increasing costs of
renewable fuel credits.”  Gasoline for April delivery gained 0.36 cent to $3.1305 a
gallon at 9:22 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
touching $3.0983. Trading volume was 12 percent above the 100-
day average for the time of day. The contract is for
reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or RBOB.  Gasoline volatility has increased even as crude oil has
moved little. The 30-day average historical volatility for crude
was 14.6 percent today compared with 33.2 percent for RBOB.
That’s up from 19.9 percent on Feb. 25, when crude volatility
was 15.5 percent.  Jobless Claims  First-time jobless  claims  fell by 10,000 to 332,000 in the
week ended March 9, the fewest since mid January, according to
data today from the Labor Department in  Washington .  The price of 2013-vintage RINs gained 9 cents to 86.5 cents
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The April  crack spread , or gasoline’s premium over West
Texas Intermediate oil, gained 1 cent to $39.47 a barrel, the
fourth consecutive drop. The spread versus Brent oil on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange  narrowed  $1.19 to $22.26 a barrel.  Heating oil for April delivery gained 0.73 cent to $2.9315
a gallon on volume that was 21 percent below the 100-day average
for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to
$3.701 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are 11
cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
