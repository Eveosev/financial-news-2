Hugo Boss  AG, the German luxury-
clothing maker that gets about 60 percent of its revenue from
 Europe , expects the region’s economy to struggle through next
year, forcing it to seek growth elsewhere.  The proportion of sales Hugo Boss gets from Europe may fall
to about half by 2015 as the suitmaker expands in the U.S. and
 Asia , Chief Executive Officer Claus-Dietrich Lahrs said in an
interview today at the company’s headquarters in Metzingen.  “I see the European economy under pressure even in 2014,”
Lahrs said. Concern about unemployment and cuts in public
spending will be “with us for a moment.”  Hugo Boss is expanding in the U.S. and Asia as the euro-
area economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 after a 0.6 percent
contraction last year, the first back-to-back decline since the
euro’s debut in 1999, according to a European Commission
forecast. Still, the recession in the 17-nation economy has
reached a bottom, Lahrs said, adding he’s more confident about
the bloc’s economy than a year ago.  “The daily discussion about whether the euro is going to
survive is gone, which is already a positive,” Lahrs said. “If
a couple of very important decision makers stand out and say the
euro will not disappear, then the euro will not disappear.”  Unemployment across the region will be about 12.2 percent
in 2013, with joblessness as high as 27 percent in  Greece  and
26.9 percent in  Spain , the European Commission has said.  The CEO said Hugo Boss is still opening stores in southern
Europe whenever it finds good locations.  Year-End  Lahrs said he expects the second half of 2013 will be a bit
more “encouraging” than the end of 2012 and the beginning of
2013. European sales rose 10 percent last year excluding
currency shifts, and the CEO said he expects revenue growth in
the region this year.  The company forecasts revenue of 3 billion euros and Ebitda
of 750 million euros in 2015, rising 28 percent and 42 percent
respectively from last year’s levels. The clothing retailer said
the retail business will represent about 55 percent of revenue
by that year as it opens about 50 stores annually.  Sales from retail exceeded wholesale for the first time in
2012, and the owner of the Boss Orange brand will boost spending
this year to expand the network further.  “In 2008 we were one-third retail and two-thirds
wholesale, by 2020 we are going to see the opposite ratio,”
Lahrs said.  The company is more confident now than last year it can
achieve its target of $1 billion revenue in the Americas by
2015, Lahrs said.  There is “very strong momentum” in U.S. retail and
consumption, the CEO said, adding that Mexico and  Brazil  will
also boost revenue.  In Asia-Pacific, where the maker of men’s suits has about
27 percent of its stores, consumer sentiment will recover in the
second half of 2013, Hugo Boss forecast. The company will open
flagship stores in Shanghai and  Tokyo  this year. It plans to get
more than 20 percent of its revenue from Asia by 2015 as it
upgrades its Chinese retail network and as business improves in
 Japan  and  Australia  this year.  -- Editors: Thomas Mulier, Celeste Perri  To contact the reporter on this story:
