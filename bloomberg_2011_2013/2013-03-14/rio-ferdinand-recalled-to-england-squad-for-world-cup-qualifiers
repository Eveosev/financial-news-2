Manchester United’s  Rio Ferdinand 
has been recalled to the England soccer squad for this month’s
World Cup qualifying matches.  Ferdinand, 34, gets his first call-up under England manager
 Roy Hodgson , who didn’t select the defender for the 2012
European Championships for what he called “footballing
reasons.” Ferdinand made the last of his 81 England appearances
in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland in June 2011.  England resumes World Cup qualifying March 22 at San Marino
and plays at Montenegro four days later. Montenegro leads
England by  two points  after four of 10 matches in European Group
H, with the winner automatically qualifying for next year’s
World Cup in Brazil.  West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper  Ben Foster , who previously
made himself unavailable because of injury, and Tottenham
teammates Michael Dawson and  Scott Parker  have also been
recalled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
