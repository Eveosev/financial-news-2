Natural gas rose from the highest
settlement in more than three months in  New York  after a
government report showed U.S. stockpiles last week fell to the
lowest level in almost two years.  Futures advanced as much as 0.9 percent, gaining for a
third day. Prices surged 3.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
increase since Feb. 25, after the Energy Information
Administration said inventories dropped 145 billion cubic feet
last week to 1.938 trillion, the least since May 13, 2011.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected
decline of 137 billion.  Gas for April delivery climbed as much as 3.3 cents to
$3.845 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $3.829 at 10:13 a.m. Singapore
time. Volume for all contracts was 26 percent lower than the
100-day average. Prices climbed 13.2 cents to settle at $3.812
per million Btu yesterday, the highest since Nov. 23. The fuel
is up 14 percent this year.  The discount of April contracts to October, a gauge of
summer demand for gas, settled at 14.5 cents yesterday, the
narrowest differential since Oct. 19. It was at 13.6 cents
today.  U.S. Stockpiles  The stockpile decrease was almost twice the five-year
average decline for the week of 74 billion cubic feet,
department data show. A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to
11.4 percent from 14.8 percent the previous week. Supplies were
18.5 percent below year-earlier inventories, compared with 14.8
percent last week.  Northern states will see below-normal temperatures through
March 28, MDA Weather Services said. Gas futures have rallied 26
percent from a 2013 intraday low of $3.05 per million Btu on
Jan. 2 as waves of unusually frigid weather spurred  heating
demand  late in the heating season.  The low in  Chicago  on March 18 may be 22 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 6 Celsius), 10 below the usual reading, and two days
later  Boston  may fall to 9 lower than usual at 23 degrees,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the EIA, the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.
Gas demand typically slumps between the peak heating-demand
season and before hot weather drives power demand to run air
conditioners.  To contact the reporters on this story:
