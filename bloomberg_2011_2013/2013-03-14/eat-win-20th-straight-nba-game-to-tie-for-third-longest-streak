The Miami Heat beat the
Philadelphia 76ers 98-94 for their 20th straight win, matching
the 1970-71  Milwaukee  Bucks for the third-longest single-season
 victory streak  in National Basketball Association history.  LeBron James had 27 points to lead Miami (49-14) to the win
at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The Heat have the
NBA’s best record this season.  Miami’s streak matches that of the Bucks, who were led by
future Hall of Fame members Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as
Lew Alcindor, and Oscar Robertson. Milwaukee’s streak ended with
an overtime loss to the Chicago Bulls on March 9, 1971.  The
Bucks went on to win their only NBA championship.  The longest winning streak in NBA history belongs to the
1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers, who won 33 straight games en route
to an NBA title. Players on that team, which went 69-13 in the
regular season, included future Hall of Fame members Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Gail Goodrich and Elgin Baylor.  The 2007-08 Houston Rockets failed to turn their 22-game
winning streak into an NBA championship. Led by Yao Ming and
Tracy McGrady, the Rockets lost to the Utah Jazz in the first
round of the playoffs.  The Washington Capitols, coached by Red Auerbach, won 20
straight games over two seasons in 1948.  Tonight’s win at Philadelphia began a five-game road trip
for Miami, which then plays at Milwaukee, Toronto,  Boston  and
 Cleveland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
