United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  is on
pace to top its $1 billion stock-buyback target for this year as
Chief Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  rewards investors after
completing the largest aerospace takeover in history.  The maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators
will buy back $350 million of shares in each of the first and
second quarters, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said today
at an analyst meeting in New York.  The repurchases follow a yearlong pause to conserve  cash 
after the $16.5 billion acquisition of Goodrich Corp. in 2012.
While  United Technologies , based in Hartford, Connecticut, will
re-evaluate the pace midyear, both Hayes and Chenevert have said
they hope to buy back more than $1 billion of stock in 2013.  United Technologies affirmed its full-year  forecast  today
for earnings per share of $5.85 to $6.15 on sales of $64 billion
to $65 billion. U.S. military spending cuts that took effect on
March 1 will reduce the company’s profit by 10 cents a share
this year, matching earlier guidance, Hayes said.  United Technologies climbed 0.4 percent to $93.45 at the
close in  New York . The shares have gained 14 percent this year,
surpassing a 9.6 percent increase by the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
