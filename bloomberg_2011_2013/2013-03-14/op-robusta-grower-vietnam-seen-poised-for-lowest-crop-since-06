The coffee harvest in  Vietnam , the
biggest grower of robusta beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  in instant
drinks, may drop to an eight-year low because of drought in the
main growing regions, boosting prices to the highest since 2011.  Production may plunge as much as 30 percent to 1 million
tons in the 12 months starting October from 1.43 million tons
this year, according to the median of eight trader and shipper
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the smallest
since 2005-2006, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
 data . The decline will be at least 10 percent, the survey shows.  A lower crop in Vietnam would cut supplies from  Asia  where
exports from Indonesia, the third-largest shipper, are falling
because of higher domestic consumption. Global usage of robusta
has expanded as processors shifted from costlier arabica beans,
brewed by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , says Macquarie Group Ltd. Buyers of
the Vietnamese variety are paying a larger premium as sales 
come to “a complete stop” on speculation prices will rise amid
the drought, according to Volcafe Ltd.  “There’s a very high chance of a poor crop with this dry
weather,” said Mai Ky Van, deputy director at October Coffee-
Cocoa One Member Ltd. “If it doesn’t rain in the next 20 days
or so, damage will be huge,” said Van, whose company is
accessing water from reservoirs far from its plantations.  Futures on NYSE Liffe in  London  may climb 12 percent to
$2,450 a ton by the end of the year, a level not traded since
July 2011, according to the median of six trader and shipper
estimates in a separate survey.  Discount Shrinks  The  discount  for robusta to arabica slumped to 40.67 cents
per pound on March 13, the lowest level in four years, and was
at 41.38 cents yesterday as robusta futures climbed 14 percent
this year and arabica fell 2.3 percent on ICE Futures U.S.  A 30 percent drop in production was also forecast by  Luong
Van Tu , chairman of the Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa Association on
March 10. Tu didn’t give a specific output estimate.  Drought in the central region covering five coffee growing
provinces, including top producer Dak Lak, will continue and may
become more severe, the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological
Forecasting said March 5. Water levels at rivers in the region
will “fall slowly” in the 10 days through March 20, said a
March 11 report from the center. Trees usually flower starting
January and most would have formed fruits by now, growers say.  “My next crop will decline for sure,” said Dang Xuan Tap,
49, a Dak Lak farmer who started growing coffee in the 1990s.
“I’m worried that the drought this year could be as bad as the
one in 2004,” he said. The harvest that year was 870,000 tons,
according to USDA  data .  Sales Halt  Tap, who has 1 hectare of plantations, expects to harvest 2
tons to 3 tons of beans from the next crop, compared with 4 tons
this year. He’s held back half the output since the Tet New Year
holiday which ended about a month ago as prices advanced.  In  Dak Lak  province, which supplies about a third of
Vietnam’s crop, the beans cost 45,400 dong ($2.17) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) on March 13, up 19 percent this year,  data  from the
Daklak Trade & Tourism Center show. Prices rose to 45,500 dong
on March 11, the highest since September 2011.  Beans from the country for shipment in April and May were
at a premium of $50 a ton to the futures price on NYSE Liffe,
said Volcafe, the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd. That was double the $25 a ton premium a week
earlier, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in a
report e-mailed on March 8.  Fewer Shipments  Farmers may have sold 57 percent of the current crop, less
than 60 percent a year earlier, as they sought higher prices
because of the drought and a decline in shipments from  Indonesia ,
according to a Bloomberg survey published March 7.  Exports from Indonesia may drop to a two-year low as
increasing domestic consumption erodes supplies from a record
harvest, a survey showed Feb. 28. Shipments will total 450,000
tons in the 12 months starting April 1. That’s 7.4 percent less
than sales of 486,000 tons this year, USDA data.  Global robusta usage rose 11 percent in the 12 months to
September as arabica consumption fell 6.2 percent, Macquarie
said in January. Instant coffee demand will grow 6.5 percent
from 2012 to 2017, more than the 6 percent forecast for the
roast- and ground-market, J. Ross Colbert, global strategist of
beverages at Rabobank International, said at a meeting of the
 International Coffee Organization  in London on March 5.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
