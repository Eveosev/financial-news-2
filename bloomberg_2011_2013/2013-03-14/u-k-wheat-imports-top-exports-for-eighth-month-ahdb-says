U.K. wheat imports topped exports
for an eighth straight month in January after excess rain cut
production in the past season.  Wheat purchases were 269,676 metric tons in January,
against exports of 18,036 tons, the Agriculture & Horticulture
Development Board said today in an e-mailed report, citing
customs figures. Imports were more than triple the amount in
January 2012. Cumulative purchases since the marketing year
began July 1 totaled 1.61 million tons, compared with exports of
530,165 tons, according to the report.  The U.K. had its second-wettest year on record in 2012,
according to the  Met Office , the national weather forecaster.
The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs has said
that production dropped 13 percent this season to 13.26 million
tons.  Germany was the biggest supplier of wheat to the U.K.
during January at 103,987 tons, followed by France at 61,393
tons and  Estonia  at 26,455 tons, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
