OPEC’s output may rise in the
second quarter to meet increasing demand from refiners,
indicating prices will increase as spare production capacity is
reduced, Morgan Stanley said.  Output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
could rise by 850,000 barrels a day from April to June, the bank
said in the report published today. The group will pump more as
refineries come out of maintenance and utilities in  Saudi Arabia 
and  Japan  use more crude and fuel oil for electricity
generation, said Morgan Stanley.  “Higher OPEC production should be a bullish indicator,”
Adam Longson, a New York-based analyst at the bank, said. “We
find OPEC production tends to follow prices rather than lead. In
this case, higher demand should pull more Saudi crude onto the
market.”  Increased oil output by the producer group cuts spare
capacity and will reduce the amount of available supply,
according to the report. OPEC provides about 40 percent of
global production.  “Higher demand for OPEC crude points to a tighter global
balance this summer, reinforcing our view that any spring
weakness in Brent should mark a good buying opportunity,”
Longson said in the report.  Brent futures for May settlement, the most active contract,
today rose as much as 0.3 percent to $108.54 a barrel after
dropping 0.9 percent yesterday. It was at $108.38 at 4:39 p.m.
Singapore time. The April contract, which expires today, was at
$108.80, after falling 1 percent the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
