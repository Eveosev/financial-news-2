Japan  plans to sign an agreement
with  Bangladesh  on March 19 as part of its program to set up
clean-energy and energy-saving projects in developing countries
to help offset greenhouse-gas emissions.  It will be a second such pact for Japan, following a deal
with Mongolia signed in January, Koji Hachiyama, head of
partnership programs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry, said today in an interview.  The bilateral agreements are open to non-Japanese
companies, Hachiyama said. Talks with Indonesia and Vietnam are
progressing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
