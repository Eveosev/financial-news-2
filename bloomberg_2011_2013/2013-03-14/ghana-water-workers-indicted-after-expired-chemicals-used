Four employees of state-owned  Ghana
Water Co.  have been indicted after an investigation found that
expired chemicals were used to treat drinking water.  Ghanaian security officials who raided a warehouse at the
countryâ€™s biggest water-treatment plant last month found bags of
aluminum sulphate from  China  that had expired in June 2012,
according to a government statement published today.  An internal probe found a lack of due diligence in
procuring shipments of the chemical used to make water potable
for humans, according to the statement. Among those indicted
were two procurement officials at the water company, it said.  Daily water shortages are common in  Ghana , the second-
biggest economy in West Africa, due to a fast-growing urban
population and a lack of investment in sanitation and
infrastructure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
