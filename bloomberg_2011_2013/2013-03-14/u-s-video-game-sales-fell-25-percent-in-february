U.S. retail sales of video-game
software, hardware and accessories declined 25 percent last
month to $810 million, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.  Hardware sales fell the most, shrinking 36 percent to
$244.2 million from the previous year, the  Port Washington , New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Software
sales for the current generation of home consoles and portable
devices fell 27 percent to $369.9 million.  Sales of physical game products are declining amid a
consumer shift toward mobile play on smartphones and tablets.
Retail sales now account for about 50 percent of total U.S.
consumer spending on games, according to Liam Callahan, an NPD
analyst.  Software sales fell even with the release of two shooter
games from  Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  and one from Sega in February,
NPD reported.  Callahan estimated total US. video-game sales were almost
$1.2 billion in February.  Nintendo Co. (7974)  in November released its first home console
since 2006, and  Sony Corp. (6758)  said last month its new PlayStation 4
will go on sale in time for year-end holiday shoppers. Both give
consumers the ability to download games over the Internet.  Microsoft Corp. earlier today said U.S. retailers sold
302,000 Xbox 360 games consoles in February, citing NPD data.
Its machines account for 41 percent of current-generation
console sales, it said in a statement. Microsoft sold 426,000
Xbox 360 units a year ago.  Sony and Nintendo do not typically release the console
sales data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
