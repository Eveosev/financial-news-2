Russia’s former finance minister,
 Alexei Kudrin , said the country would probably participate in
any European bailout of Cyprus.  “I hope that the European Union will take action to
support Cyprus,” Kudrin said in an interview in London today.
“Most likely -- this is my forecast -- Russia would take part
in this support, but only within the framework of a plan put
forward by the EU.”  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades told reporters in
Brussels today he hopes “everybody’s going to be fair” as the
country negotiates a rescue package with its euro-area partners
and the  International Monetary Fund . Russian bank loans to
Cyprus-based companies of Russian origin totaled $30 billion to
$40 billion at the end of last year, Moody’s Investors Service
said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  “Those who keep their reserves in Cyprus’s banks may be
hurt” depending “on the type of support that will be chosen
for Cyprus,” Kudrin said.  Cyprus Finance Minister Michael Sarris will meet with his
Russian counterpart Anton Siluanov in Moscow on March 18, state-
run Cyprus News Agency reported yesterday, citing comments by
Sarris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
