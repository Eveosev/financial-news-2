Taiwan’s government bonds rose for
a third day, the longest winning streak in two months, after
global funds cut holdings of the island’s stocks. The local
dollar weakened.  Overseas investors sold $159 million more Taiwanese
equities than they bought today, a third day of net sales, as
the Taiex index of shares retreated from its highest level in
almost a year. President Ma Ying-jeou said today the island’s
economic recovery “could be slow but steady.” The statistics
bureau raised its 2013 growth forecast to 3.59 percent last
month from 3.53 percent, and boosted its projection for exports
to 6.23 percent from 6.07 percent.  “Stocks are retreating, showing the Taiex rally lacks
momentum,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “On the bonds side, some traders were
forced to buy back bonds to close their short positions.” A
short position is a bet the price of an asset will decline.  The yield on the island’s 1.125 percent debt due March 2023
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.306 percent
in Taipei, according to prices from Gretai Securities Market.
The run of declines was the longest for a benchmark 10-year note
since Jan. 17.  Currency Market  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.80 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.81 on March 11, the weakest level since Sept. 10.  The central bank has sold the local currency in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month  non-deliverable forwards  slipped 0.1 percent to
NT$29.69 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  over a month used to price options, rose two basis points
to 3.33 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little
changed at 0.386 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
