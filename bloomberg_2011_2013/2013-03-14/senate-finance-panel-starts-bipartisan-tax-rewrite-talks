The Senate Finance Committee will
begin a series of bipartisan meetings to build momentum toward
rewriting the U.S.  tax code .  The meetings will begin March 21 with a session on trying
to simplify the tax system for families. Other meetings will
focus on international taxation, charitable giving and small
businesses, the committee said today.  “ Tax reform  can provide families certainty, spark economic
growth, create jobs, and make U.S. businesses more
competitive,” said  Max Baucus , the Montana Democrat who is
chairman of the panel, in a statement.  Among the biggest obstacles for lawmakers will be a lack of
consensus on goals for rewriting the tax code. Beyond
simplification, they disagree largely along party lines on how
much revenue the U.S. should raise and how much importance
should be given to rate reduction.  In the House, the Ways and Means Committee has broken into
11 working groups. The panel’s chairman, Republican  Dave Camp  of
Michigan, said the committee will pass a revenue-neutral rewrite
of the corporate and individual parts of the code this year.  Camp has released discussion drafts that would address
international taxation, the treatment of financial products and
tax rules affecting partnerships and other businesses that pay
taxes through their owners’ individual returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
