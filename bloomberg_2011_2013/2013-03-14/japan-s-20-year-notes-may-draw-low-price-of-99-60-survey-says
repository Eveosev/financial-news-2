Japan ’s sale of 1.2 trillion yen
($12.5 billion) in 20-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted
price of 99.60, according to the median forecast of 13 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.6 percent
bonds ranged from 99.40 to 99.75, according to the survey.  One trader said 99.40, three traders said 99.50, two said
99.55, one said 99.60, three said 99.65, two said 99.70, and one
