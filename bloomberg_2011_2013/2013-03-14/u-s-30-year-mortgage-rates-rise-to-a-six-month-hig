U.S. mortgage rates for 30-year
loans rose to a six-month high after stronger-than-expected
employment growth drove up yields for the  government securities 
that guide home loans.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.63
percent in the week ended today, up from 3.52 percent and the
highest level since late August, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie
Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate climbed to
2.79 percent from 2.76 percent.  The 10-year Treasury yield reached an 11-month high on
March 8, after the Labor Department said employers added 236,000
workers in February, more than economists projected, and the
 jobless rate  fell to 7.7 percent. The U.S. property market is
recovering from a five-year slump as job gains and low  interest
rates  fuel demand.  “There is a feedback loop between the state of the economy
and the housing market,”  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS
Global Insight in Lexington,  Massachusetts , said in a phone
interview yesterday. “When you get more jobs, people are more
likely to buy homes.”  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of home-loan
applications declined 4.7 percent in the period ended March 8,
after climbing 14.8 percent in the prior week. The  refinance 
gauge fell 5.2 percent, while the  purchase  measure dropped 2.5
percent, the Washington-based group reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
