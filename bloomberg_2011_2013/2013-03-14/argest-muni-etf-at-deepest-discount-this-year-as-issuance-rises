The  largest exchange-traded fund 
tracking U.S. municipal bonds is trading at the steepest
discount to its underlying assets this year as localities borrow
the most since December.  The $3.6 billion iShares S&P National AMT-Free Municipal
Bond Fund traded below its net-asset value for the past four
days after pricing at a 0.43 percent discount yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Some investors see a discount as an
opportunity to buy the fund, which typically has traded at a
premium since it was created in 2007.  “It’s probably going to maintain the discount into
today,” said Bart Mosley, co-president at Trident Municipal
Research in  New York . Selling of munis may persist into early
April, he said.  The ETF, known as MUB, fell about 0.2 percent to  $109.65 (MUB)  at
2:31 p.m. in New York, reaching the lowest since July, Bloomberg
data show.  That drop reflects a jump in issuance in the $3.7 trillion
municipal market, Mosley said. Local governments from  California 
to New York plan to sell $8.9 billion of debt this week, the
most since December, Bloomberg data show. That supply spike and
investors looking to sell munis to make April 15 tax payments
are causing tax-exempt yields to increase, Mosley said.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  is also setting record
highs, luring investors.  Yields on top-rated munis due in 30 years climbed about
0.06 percentage point to  3.12 percent  at 2 p.m. in New York, the
highest since Aug. 22, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
