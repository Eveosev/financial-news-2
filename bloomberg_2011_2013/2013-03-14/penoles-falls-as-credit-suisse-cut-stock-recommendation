Industrias Penoles SAB, the second-
biggest Mexican mining company by market value, tumbled the most
in 16 months after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its rating and
said the company might face additional taxes.  The shares fell 4.8 percent to 553.13 pesos at the close in
 Mexico  City, the biggest drop since October 2011. The stock was
the biggest  loser  today on Mexico’s Benchmark IPC index, which
rose 0.2 percent.  Penoles, which produces silver and gold, is trading at an
11 percent premium to its net asset value, compared with an
average discount of 29 percent over the past three years, Credit
Suisse analysts led by Santiago Perez Teuffer said in a report
dated yesterday. Their  recommendation  on the stock dropped to
neutral from the equivalent of buy.  A government proposal to reform Mexico’s fiscal structure
that may come as early as this year might include mining taxes,
the analysts said. Mining makes up about 65 percent of the
company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, according to the analysts.  “Taxes in this business segment would represent a
significant risk,” the analysts wrote.  Credit Suisse’s target price for Mexico City-based Penoles
is 650 pesos, which assumes an effective  tax rate  of 30 percent,
according to the report. The target price would be 7.8 percent
lower if the tax rate increased to 42.5 percent, the analysts
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
