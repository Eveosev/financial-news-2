Hong Kong  developers  fell, heading
for their biggest drop in more than four months, after HSBC
Holdings Plc raised  mortgage rates  for the first time in 18
months.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the world’s biggest developer
by value, fell 3.5 percent to HK$107.70 as of 9:57 a.m. local
time.  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , controlled by Hong Kong’s
richest man  Li Ka-shing , declined 2.9 percent to HK$113.40. The
Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks nine of the biggest
builders listed in the city, fell as much as 3.5 percent, the
most since Oct. 29.  HSBC, the city’s biggest bank by deposit, yesterday raised
home-loan charges priced at the best lending rate by 25 basis
points, its first increase since 2011, after the city’s banking
regulator tightened risk rules on concern a property bubble may
undermine financial stability.  Home prices  in Hong Kong have
doubled in the past four years, prompting the government to
impose curbs including extra transaction taxes.  “While the 25-basis-point hike may appear marginal, we see
significant impact to the physical market, and increasing
risk,” Venant Chiang and Christie Ju, Hong Kong-based analysts
at Jefferies Group Inc., wrote in a report yesterday. “The
extra cost on mortgages may be insignificant at first, but the
impact would become substantial if the rate hike continues --
they usually do.”  Mortgage Rates  New World Development Co., the builder controlled by
billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , dropped 4.6 percent to HK$13.38. Sino
Land Co., which makes almost all its revenue in Hong Kong, fell
2.5 percent to HK$13.60.  HSBC’s mortgages linked to the best rate will climb to a
range of 2.85 percent to 3.15 percent, from 2.6 percent to 2.9
percent, the bank said yesterday.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority last month told banks to
set the risk weighting for new residential loans at 15 percent
or more, seeking to strengthen buffers after prices doubled to a
record in the past four years.  Hong Kong  home prices  may fall by as much as 20 percent
over 24 months as mortgage rates increase and the government
seeks to cool demand, Deutsche Bank AG said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
