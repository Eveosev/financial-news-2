U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who
set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before seeking
office, said Republicans preventing a vote on Richard Cordray as
the agency’s director are “keeping the game rigged.”  “Blocking Rich Cordray is about weakening the agency,”
Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in comments prepared for
a Consumer Federation of America conference in Washington.
“Blocking Rich Cordray is about keeping the game rigged,
keeping the game rigged so that consumers remain in the dark-
and a few bad actors can rake in big profits.”  Cordray’s nomination is stalled in the Senate, where 43 of
45 Republicans in the 100-member chamber have vowed to block his
confirmation until structural changes are made to the consumer
bureau. While only a majority of the Democrat-led Senate is
required for approval of President  Barack Obama ’s nomination, 60
votes are needed to bring it up for a vote.  Warren and other Democrats, including Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Tim Johnson of South Dakota, have urged
Republicans to permit an up-or-down vote on Cordray, who was
placed in the job by Obama in a recess appointment in 2012.
Republicans are demanding that the bureau be converted from
director-led to a commission and have its budget subjected to
congressional appropriations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
