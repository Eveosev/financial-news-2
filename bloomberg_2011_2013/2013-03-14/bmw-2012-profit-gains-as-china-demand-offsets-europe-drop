Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, reported a drop in
profitability at its auto unit as it invests on expanding
offerings to keep ahead of  Audi (NSU)  in a tightening race for the
sales lead.  Operating profit at BMW’s car division fell to 10.9 percent
of sales last year, down from 11.8 percent in 2011, the Munich-
based carmaker said today in a statement. BMW slightly trailed
the 11 percent margin of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi in 2012.  BMW is introducing the 3-Series GT and the 4-Series coupe
and is preparing to roll out its first electric vehicle, the i3
city car. The expansion is aimed at securing a third consecutive
year of record sales in 2013 and countering Audi, which trails
the BMW brand by 407 car deliveries after two months in 2013.
The investment comes as European car sales head for a sixth
consecutive annual decline this year.  “Economic conditions are likely to remain challenging in
many markets,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said
in the statement. “The BMW group is preparing for tomorrow’s
technological challenges and is setting the course for further
growth and profitability.”  BMW  dropped  as much as 1.57 euros, or 2.2 percent, to 69.70
euros and was down 0.4 percent as of 1:10 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The
stock has lost 2.7 percent this year, valuing the company at
45.4 billion euros ($58.7 billion).  Decline Forecast  Earnings before interest and taxes edged up 3.5 percent to
8.3 billion euros in 2012, after a 14 percent profit surge in
the fourth quarter. Ebit is forecast to drop to 7.99 billion
euros in 2013, according to the  average  of 18 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ebit at BMW’s carmaking unit last year rose 2 percent to
7.62 billion euros. BMW has a long-term automotive profit margin
target in the range of 8 percent to 10 percent of sales.  The German automaker is proposing a record  dividend  of 2.50
euros per common share for last year compared with 2.30 euros a
year earlier. Net income in 2012 rose 4.4 percent to 5.12
billion euros, as sales advanced 12 percent to 76.8 billion
euros.  To tighten its grip on the premium segment’s top spot, BMW
appointed  Peter Schwarzenbauer , the former Audi sales chief, to
its management board to oversee the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW
motorcycle brands as well as after-sales operations, the company
said today.  Schwarzenbauer will take over from Harald Krueger as of
April 1. Krueger is replacing Frank-Peter Arndt, who decided to
step down for health reasons, as BMW’s production chief.  The company expanded its lead in the luxury auto segment
with a 12 percent increase in sales to 1.54 million BMW-brand
vehicles on demand for the new 3-Series, 1-Series compact and X3
sport-utility vehicle. Audi’s deliveries rose 12 percent to 1.46
million, while Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, which has also vowed
to take the segment’s top spot, sold 1.32 million cars, up 4.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
