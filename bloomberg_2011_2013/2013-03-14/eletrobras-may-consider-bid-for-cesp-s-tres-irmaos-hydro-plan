Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s biggest power company, would consider bidding
for  Cia Energetica de Sao Paulo ’s Tres Irmaos hydroelectric dam,
which  Brazil ’s government is expected to auction this year.  Eletrobras, as the state-controlled company is known, is
interested in any power plant that goes up for auction, Chief
Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto said in an
interview.  “We are especially interested in dams that have a good
operation,” Carvalho said, when asked about the Tres Irmaos
dam.  Cesp refused a government proposal to extend the 800-
megawatt dam’s expired concession last year after shareholders
rejected the proposed rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
