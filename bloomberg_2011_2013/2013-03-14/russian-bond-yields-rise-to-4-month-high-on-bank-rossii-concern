Russia ’s long-term government ruble
bonds declined, pushing yields to the highest level in almost
four months, before the central bank meets on interest rates
tomorrow.  The yield on OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.45 percent by 7 p.m. in
Moscow, the highest since November 20.  Policy makers will probably leave borrowing costs unchanged
for a sixth month at a meeting tomorrow, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 28 economists. Inflation accelerated to 7.3
percent in February from 7.1 percent in January, the state
statistics service said this month.  “No one wants to buy while inflation is at a local peak,”
Yulia Safarbakova, a fixed-income analyst at BCS Financial
Group, said by phone. “We need to see an implicit deceleration
for investors to react.”  The ruble strengthened 0.1 percent against the dollar to
30.7600 and also gained 0.1 percent against Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro basket to 34.8582. Oil in New York added 0.2 percent
to $92.71 a barrel. Crude and natural gas account for about 50
percent of Russia’s budget revenue.  The regular monthly tax period, which starts tomorrow, may
provide support for the Russian currency in the near term as
exporters sell foreign currency to transfer rubles to the
 federal budget , Dmitry Polevoy and Egor Fedorov, analysts at ING
Groep NV’s Moscow unit, said in a note to clients.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  forecast 350 billion rubles of obligatory
insurance contributions on March 15, according to a March 4
note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
