OAO RusHydro, the Russian renewable
energy producer that sank to a record low in London yesterday,
will extend declines as a second year of sliding revenue dims
dividend prospects, according to VTB Capital.  RusHydro, urged last month by President Vladimir Putin to
investigate missing building funds, slid in London and Moscow
yesterday and is the second-biggest decliner this year among the
most-traded Russian stocks in New York. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index (RUS14BN)  fell 0.4 percent to 100.33, while  futures  on
Moscow’s RTS Index slipped 0.1 percent to 152,890.  The company, Russia’s biggest alternative energy producer,
will post a 25 percent contraction in sales for 2012 when it
reports earnings in international standards April 1, according
to the mean of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
government, seeking to steady support after protests around
elections last year, wants to limit power costs, with Putin
saying utility tariff growth will be capped at 6 percent, RIA
Novosti reported Feb. 25.  “It’s quite predictable that the company will report
another decline in revenue as electricity tariffs are
stagnating,” Mikhail Rasstrigin, an analyst at VTB Capital, a
unit of Russia’s second-biggest bank, said by phone from Moscow
yesterday. “Without better dividends, the stock has no chance
to be of any interest to investors.”  Rasstrigin recommends selling  RusHydro (HYDR) ’s Moscow-listed
stock and expects it to drop 6.9 percent from current levels.  Dividend Yield  RusHydro’s 12-month gross  dividend yield  was at 1.2 percent
yesterday, the lowest level among the most-traded Russian
equities in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  During an energy commission meeting with industry leaders
last month, Putin told RusHydro’s Chief Executive Officer Evgeny
Dod to investigate the disappearance of “billions of rubles”
in a construction project in Moscow. The Interior Ministry
opened an investigation into suspected embezzlement of funds in
Karachaevo-Cherkessia region on March 7.  “Investigation into the company’s finances has created a
certain nervousness,” Vladimir Sklyar, an analyst at
Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.  RusHydro fell 0.8 percent to $2.14 in  London  yesterday. The
shares settled at a 2.6 percent discount to its Moscow-listed
stock yesterday, the widest since Jan. 15. The company’s
American Depositary Receipts were little changed at $2.13
yesterday. Shares on Russia’s Micex Index fell 0.2 percent to
67.69 kopeks, or 2.2 U.S. cents.  ‘Under Pressure’  George Rizhinashvili, a deputy chairman at RusHydro, said
on a Jan. 18 conference call with investors and analysts that
business “was under pressure of sluggish power prices Europe
and Russia.” The government  owned  60.5 percent of the company
as of June 30 according to RusHydro’s website.  Sales in 2012 probably fell to 272 billion rubles ($8.83
billion) from 363 billion rubles in 2011, according to the mean
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell 0.9 percent
to $28.65 in New York yesterday, the lowest level since March 4.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
stock futures, rose 0.7 percent to 20.44.  Sberbank Falls  ADRs of  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s biggest lender, fell 1.8
percent to $13.59 in New York yesterday.  Ten-day volatility 
jumped to an almost two-week high. Sberbank  futures , which were
little changed in U.S. hours, expire today, stoking price swings
as investors decide whether to roll over the contracts or take
delivery of shares, Luis Saenz, head of equity sales at BCS
Financial Group in London, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Futures expiring in March on Russia’s ruble showed the
currency falling less than 0.1 percent to 30.831 per dollar,
after losing 0.3 percent to 30.7940 in Moscow yesterday. The
currency was little changed at 34.9052 against the dollar-euro
basket used by the central bank.  Crude for April delivery settled little changed at $92.52 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Brent for
April settlement dropped 1 percent to $108.52 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Urals crude ,  Russia ’s
major export blend, decreased 0.5 percent to $106.26.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2.2 percent to HK$4.04 in Hong Kong trading as of 12:32
p.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
