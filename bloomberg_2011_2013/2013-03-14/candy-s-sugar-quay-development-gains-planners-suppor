CPC Group, the developer owned by
 Christian Candy , won planners’ support to develop 165 luxury
apartments near the Tower of London.  Planning officials recommend the City of London financial
district approve a project to develop an eight- and 10-story
residential building on the bank of the  River Thames  near Tower
Bridge, according to documents on the council’s website.  The development will have 11 penthouse apartments with a
resident’s swimming pool, gym and library, according to the
document. There will be 25,372 square meters (273,102 square
feet) of residential space and 658 square meters of retail space
in the buildings.  Developers are build apartments in the City of London as
non-prime offices on the fringes of the financial district
become difficult to lease. CPC helped develop the luxury One
Hyde Park apartment project in Knightsbridge as part of a joint
venture with Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin
Jaber al Thani’s closely held Waterknights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
