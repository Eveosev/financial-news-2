Europe  needs a new Marshall Plan to
help economic “reconstruction” in debt-crisis battered states
just as the original plan helped rebuild the continent after
World War II, German Social Democrat leader Sigmar Gabriel said.  The aid would be funded by revenue from a financial-
transaction tax and banks, including the European Investment
Bank, and could run for as many as 30 years to pay for job-
creation programs, Gabriel, the chairman of  Germany ’s main
opposition party, said in a  Guardian  newspaper  guest column .  The plan would be an “immediate response to the challenges
of the crisis and counterbalance the current austerity policy,”
the Guardian cited him as saying. Following the model of former
U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall’s recovery program, a
new European economic-recovery plan would fuel “growth and
jobs.”  Gabriel said he’s at odds with “one-sided” austerity
measures to curb the debt crisis. The root cause of Europe’s
economic misery “does not lie with profligate governments,”
said Gabriel. Rather, it’s due to “excessive speculation and
the resulting crash that forced many states to go massively into
debt to bail out their banks.”  On March 22, Gabriel’s SPD presented its campaign manifesto
to challenge the ruling Christian Democrats and Free Democrats
in September federal elections. The 102-page program endorses
tax increases and the introduction of a national minimum wage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
