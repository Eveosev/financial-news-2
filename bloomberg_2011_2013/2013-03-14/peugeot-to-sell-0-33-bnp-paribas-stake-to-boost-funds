PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  sold its  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP)  stake for about 177 million euros ($229 million) to
boost the financing of Europe’s second-largest carmaker.  The sale of the 4 million shares was carried out through an
accelerated book building, with  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  acting as
the sole lead manager and book runner, the Paris-based automaker
said today. The price was 44.24 euros a share.  Peugeot has been selling assets to raise funds as Europe’s
auto market sinks for a sixth straight year in 2013. Disposals
have included the Citer vehicle-rental business and a majority
of the Gefco trucking unit. The French company also sold a 1
billion-euro bond last month.  Peugeot reported a 576 million-euro operating loss for 2012
as a recession caused industrywide sales in the region to slump.
Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin vowed on Feb. 13 to put
Peugeot on a break-even level by end of 2014 through spending
reductions and a new strategy that includes moving its Peugeot
brand upscale.  France’s government offered guarantees last year for as
much as 7 billion euros of new bond sales by the Banque PSA
Finance unit. Peugeot has won temporary European Union approval
to sell 1.2 billion euros in government-backed bonds and must
present more details of the plan to win full approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
