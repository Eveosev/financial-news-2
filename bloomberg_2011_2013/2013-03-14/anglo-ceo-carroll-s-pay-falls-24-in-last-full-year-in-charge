Anglo American Plc (AAL)  Chief Executive
Officer  Cynthia Carroll  received 24 percent less pay in 2012,
the last of her five full years in charge of the company during
which it lost almost a quarter of its value.  Carroll got 1.7 million pounds ($2.55 million) in salary,
cash bonus and benefits, compared with 2.2 million pounds a year
earlier, London-based Anglo American said in its annual report
posted online today. Her total 2012 package, which included
bonuses deferred, share releases and pension contributions, fell
to 3.2 million pounds from 8.1 million pounds in 2011.  Princeton, New Jersey-born Carroll quit the company in
October and will be replaced by  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AN)  CEO Mark Cutifani on April 3. She will receive about 1.4 million pounds
in vested shares as part of her termination deal, a person with
knowledge of the matter said earlier this month. She will
continue to receive her 1.2 million pound-annual salary in
monthly installments as long as she does not have a new job,
until the end of 2013 at the latest.  Anglo American lost about $14 billion of its value during
Carroll’s tenure to October 2012 and suffered cost blowouts and
delays at its $8.8 billion Minas-Rio iron-ore project in  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
