Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud party has reached agreements with other
parliamentary factions to form a new government, according to a
spokeswoman for his Likud party.  “We expect that the coalition agreements will be signed by
the party leaders later today,” Likud spokeswoman Noga
Rappaport said in a phone interview.  The agreements will enable Netanyahu’s Cabinet to be
officially sworn in early next week, just before U.S. President
 Barack Obama  arrives on March 20 for his first visit to Israel
while in office.  The new government, which would also include the Yisrael
Beitenu, Yesh Atid, Jewish Home and Hatenuah parties, would hold
68 seats in Israel’s 120-seat parliament, the Knesset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
