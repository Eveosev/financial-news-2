The chairman of U.K. Prime Minister
 David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party  said the Tories may not win
the next election in 2015, making him the most senior lawmaker
to openly talk about the possibility of losing power.  In an interview with The House magazine, which is
distributed to lawmakers, Grant Shapps, whose responsibilities
include election planning, looked ahead to the party’s spring
gathering on March 16. His remarks follow three weeks of
questions about Cameron’s leadership, after the U.K.’s top
credit rating was downgraded last month and the Tories were
pushed into third place in a special election.  “I think the simple message for spring conference halfway
through this Parliament is: We’ve started this job and we need
to get it finished,” Shapps was cited as saying. “Not for our
sakes. We may or may not win the next election, but my God we
need to finish this, the job of stopping this country going
bust, fixing the mess that Labour left, or at least as far as we
can.”  Following Cabinet revolts over government spending plans
and alcohol pricing, Cameron said in a broadcast that aired last
night that the Tory party and voters need to concentrate on the
longer-term goal of restoring economic growth. He also dismissed
stories on leadership speculation as “rubbish.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
