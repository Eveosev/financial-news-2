Treasury bonds fell, pushing yields
to almost the highest levels in 11 months before a $13 billion
auction of the securities, as signs of a strengthening U.S.
economy reduce demand for the longest-maturity  U.S. debt .  Thirty-year bonds have lost 5.13 percent this year,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. A report
today showed unemployment claims unexpectedly fell last week to
the lowest level in almost two months. The bonds being sold
today yielded 3.24 percent in trading before the auction, the
highest since the March 2012 sale.  “We’ve been seeing some good data since last week,” said
 Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of
the 21 primary dealers obligated to bid in U.S. debt auctions.
“We’ve seen a drop in claims. Combine that with supply, and
Treasuries are pressured.”  Thirty-year  yields  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.24 percent at 12:21 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They touched 3.26
percent today, after reaching 3.28 percent on March 8, the
highest level since April 5. The price of the 3.125 percent
security due in February 2043 declined 10/32, or $3.13 per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 29/32.  Ten-year yields rose two basis points to 2.05 percent. They
reached 2.08 percent on March 8, the highest since April.  Treasury Losses  The benchmark 10-year notes have lost 1.9 percent this
year, and five-year securities have slipped 0.5 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  First-time U.S. jobless claims fell by 10,000 to 332,000 in
the week ended March 9, the fewest since mid-January, according
to data from the Labor Department in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 350,000.  “Any time you get a downward drift in claims, you’ll get
Treasuries selling off,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist
in New York at the primary dealer Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
“It’s pushed us back to the upper end of the yield range.”  Ten-year note yields reached the highest level in 11 months
on March 8 after the Labor Department reported that U.S.
payrolls increased by 236,000 jobs last month, more than
forecast. Commerce Department figures yesterday showed U.S.
 retail sales  jumped 1.1 percent in February from January, the
biggest gain in five months.  Bond Auction  Thirty-year bonds  yielded  3.18 percent at the last auction,
on Feb. 14. Investors submitted  bids  for 2.74 times the amount
of securities for sale, compared with an average of 2.62 at the
past 10 sales.  While investors typically avoid longer-maturity debt during
periods of economic growth because of the rise of inflation,
consumer-price increases have been slow. The cost of living in
the U.S. rose 0.5 percent in February from a month earlier,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast before the Labor
Department reports the data tomorrow.  Yesterday’s U.S. 10-year auction drew a  yield  of 2.029
percent, compared with a forecast of 2.057 percent in a
Bloomberg survey of eight primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover 
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 3.19, versus 2.68 at the
February sale.  The Treasury announced it will sell $13 billion in 10-year
inflation-indexed debt on March 21.  Fed Purchase  The U.S. central bank purchased $3.34 billion today of
Treasuries maturing from May 2020 to February 2023. It is buying
$85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur the
economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing costs.  “The Fed buying every day is putting a cap on rates to
some degree,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New
York of government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “Given
the economic numbers, you would expect a higher move in rates,
but that has yet to be seen.”  Treasury securities due in a decade and more traded at
almost the cheapest level since 2011 relative to global peers
with comparable maturities, according to the Bank of America
indexes. Yields on Treasuries were 54 basis points higher on
March 8 than those in an index of other sovereign debt, the most
since August 2011, the data showed. The spread was 53 basis
points yesterday.  Benchmark 10-year yields will climb to 2.32 percent at
year-end, according to a Bloomberg survey of forecasters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
