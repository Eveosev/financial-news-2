GBT Brasil SA, a joint venture
between  Global Blade Technology  and Feel Energia SA, said it
will start producing its first  wind turbines  in  Brazil  by the
end of the year.  The 900-kilowatt power units, including the towers, blades
and generation equipment, will be assembled at three factories
in the state of Parana, Arthur Schuler da Igreja, managing
director of Toledo, Brazil-based GBT Brasil, said today in an e-
mail.  Wind farms in Brazil are able to produce energy at about 90
reais ($45.72) a megawatt-hour, and factories often buy power
from the grid for more than twice that, according to Igreja. One
of the buyers will be Notus SA, a company composed of several
GBT Brasil investors that own factories in Parana.  “The potential to reduce power bills is very attractive,”
Igreja said. “Industry here pay some of the highest electricity
prices in the world. If you produce your own energy you’re
saving money.”  GBT Brasil is developing so-called plugs at a temporary
facility in Parana to produce molds used to make blades that may
be sold to other wind-farm developers in Brazil, he said.  GBT Brasil is 85 percent-owned by Feel Energia, a holding
company for five construction and energy companies. The
remaining shares are owned by Wieringerwerf, Netherlands-based
Global Blade Technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
