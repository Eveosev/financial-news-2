Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will
tomorrow announce that  Japan  will join the Trans-Pacific
Partnership trade negotiations, according to a government
official who asked not to be named ahead of the statement.  Free trade forms part of the “third arrow” of Abe’s
three-pronged economic policy, which calls for deregulation to
stimulate private investment. The TPP talks currently span 11
nations and are aimed at lowering tariffs, strengthening patent
protection and improving access to government contracts.  Abe’s other two arrows -- bold monetary easing and fiscal
stimulus -- have increased his public approval ratings by
strengthening share prices and pushing down the yen. By contrast,
the TPP decision may fuel discontent, with opposition from the
farming sector and some members of his ruling  Liberal Democratic
Party .  The LDP signed off on the decision yesterday, while calling
for special treatment for agricultural products including rice,
beef, dairy products and sugar.  The announcement comes less than a month after Abe
discussed the TPP with President  Barack Obama . Japan must obtain
the permission of the existing members of the TPP negotiations
before it can take part in talks, a process that took about a
year in the case of Mexico and  Canada .  Economy Minister Akira Amari will be given responsibility
for handling the negotiations,  Kyodo News  said today. Abe’s
plans to unveil joining the TPP talks were reported earlier by
Japanese media including public broadcaster NHK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
