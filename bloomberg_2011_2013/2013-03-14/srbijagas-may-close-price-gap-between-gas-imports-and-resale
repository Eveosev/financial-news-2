Srbijagas JP,  Serbia ’s natural-gas
monopoly, may eliminate losses stemming from a price disparity
between the cost of importing gas from  Russia  and selling it in
the home market.  The state-owned company expects that the cost of import, at
$400 per 1,000 cubic meters in the first quarter, will fall to
about $370 “in the course of the year,” while Serbia’s energy
regulator may allow an increase in the resale price, now at $350
for a 1,000 cubic meters, Dusan Bajatovic, Srbijagas general
manager said at a business forum in Kopaonik today.  “With a minor increase in the price for our consumers, we
could achieve some balance,” Bajatovic said, reiterating that
the state should end its “welfare approach” to regulated gas
prices.  To contact the reporters on this story: Gordana Filipovic in
