Pennsylvania asked a judge to
dismiss a lawsuit by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association that seeks to block the state from controlling fine
money paid in the Jerry Sandusky sex-abuse scandal.  The case should be thrown out because the court lacks
jurisdiction to handle the dispute, lawyers for Governor Tom Corbett and state treasurer Rob McCord said today in a six-page
filing in federal court in Harrisburg. If the suit isnâ€™t tossed,
it should be put on hold until an earlier suit Corbett brought
over the same fine is resolved, according to the filing.  The NCAA accused Pennsylvania officials in a suit filed
last month of attempting to improperly confiscate the $60
million sanction it imposed on Pennsylvania State University
over the Sandusky abuse case. The NCAA argued that a new
Pennsylvania law requiring such fines to be used inside the
state violates the U.S. Constitution.  Corbett sued the Indianapolis-based NCAA in January
challenging the fine levied against the school for its failure
to prevent sexual abuse by Sandusky, a former Penn State
assistant football coach.  Sandusky was convicted in June by a jury of molesting 10
boys. He was sentenced in October to a minimum of 30 years in
prison.  The case is NCAA v. Corbett, 13-00457, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
