Serbia ’s economic contraction may
deepen and unemployment may soar should the central bank and
government shift to a fixed-exchange rate from the dinar’s
managed float, the head of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank AD said.  “Radical measures” such as the introduction of a
currency-board system or an fixed-exchange rate for the dinar
“imply a high cost,” said Vladimir Cupic, the head of the
Serbian unit of  Austria ’s Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank International AG,
said at a business forum in Kopaonik, Serbia, today.  Serbia has managed the dinar’s exchange rate to keep
inflation under control since 2006, though some local economists
and business leaders have urged the central bank to consider
fixing the dinar to the euro instead.  “There is hardly a politician who would be ready for a 10
percent drop in gross domestic product and an increase in
unemployment to 30 percent as a result,” Cupic said. “In a
small, open and highly indebted economy, the exchange rate
cannot be used as a tool for growth either.”  The government will ask the central bank to lower  interest
rates  and manage the dinar’s exchange rate to bolster economic
growth and aid exporters, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said
March 6.  According to Hypo’s research, the dinar’s nominal decline
of 30 percent against the euro between late 2008 and the end of
2012 was equivalent to zero depreciation in real terms, with no
impact on exports over the past four years.  “It’s the real depreciation that matters for trade,”
Cupic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
