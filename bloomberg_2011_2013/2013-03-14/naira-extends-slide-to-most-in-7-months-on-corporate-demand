Nigeria ’s naira headed for its
longest losing streak in seven months as corporate demand for
dollars wasn’t matched by the central bank, which cut the amount
of U.S. currency it sold in auctions this week.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated for
a fifth day, weakening 0.4 percent to 159.53 per dollar by 12:49
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. A close at that level
would be its lowest since Aug. 8 and the run of losses the most
since the same month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lenders bought all $360 million offered this week, compared
with $384 million last week, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of
Nigeria  said in an e-mailed statement. Nigeria relies on imports
to cover 70 percent of its fuel needs because of inadequate
refining capacity, and those shipments into the country are a
source of pressure on the naira, according to the central bank.  The currency weakened “largely due to increased corporate
demand to cover import bills and other foreign-exchange
obligations,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, analysts at
Ecobank Transnational Inc. in Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients today.  The central bank held its benchmark rate at a record-high
12 percent for an eighth time on Jan. 21 to control consumer
prices and stabilize the naira. Inflation eased to 9 percent in
January from 12 percent in December, the statistics bureau said
on Feb. 18.  “Over the short term, the naira will likely continue to
trade on the  interbank market  within the central bank’s 3
percent band” above or below 155 naira per dollar, Ezun and
Asenime said.  Borrowing costs on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic
bonds due January 2022 rose 15 basis points to 11.18 percent,
according to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets
Dealers Association  website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million
of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell 5.6 basis points to 4.13
percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a third day, sliding 0.3 percent
to 1.9297 per dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
