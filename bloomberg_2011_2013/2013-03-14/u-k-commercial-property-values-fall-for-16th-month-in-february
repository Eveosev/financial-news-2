U.K. commercial real estate values
fell for the 16th consecutive month in February, led by a drop
in retail properties, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
declined 0.2 percent from January, London-based IPD said in a
statement today. Total return, which combines changes in real
estate values and rental income, fell to 0.3 percent in
February.  “There are encouraging signs in the U.K. property market,
but sentiment is vulnerable to external shocks,” Phil Tily, a
managing director at IPD, said in the statement. “Many will be
waiting for the chancellor’s budget next week in the hope that
it includes stimulus for regional growth, because until economic
performance starts to improve outside of  London , investors will
continue to hesitate.”  The U.K.’s largest real estate companies are using their
access to capital to invest in properties and developments at a
time when prices are falling and smaller competitors are
struggling to raise money.  British Land Co. on March 12 said it plans to raise about
500 million pounds ($751 million) in a share sale to spend on
acquisitions and development. “Vendors are showing an
increasing realism around value access to finance continuing to
constrain many buyers,” the company said.  Retail values overall declined by 0.3 percent. The average
values of offices and warehouses fell 0.2 percent.  The IPD index was compiled from appraisals of 3,427
properties valued at 31.5 billion pounds at the end of January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
