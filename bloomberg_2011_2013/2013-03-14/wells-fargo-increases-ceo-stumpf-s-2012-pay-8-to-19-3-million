Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  boosted Chief
Executive Officer  John Stumpf ’s compensation for 2012 by 7.8
percent to $19.3 million, making him the second highest-paid
leader among the biggest U.S. lenders.  Stumpf received $12.5 million in stock awards and a $4
million bonus, some of which was awarded as restricted stock,
the San Francisco-based bank said today in a regulatory filing.
He received a $2.8 million salary. Wells Fargo gave Stumpf $17.9
million for his work in 2011.  Shares of Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, rose
24 percent last year as residential markets firmed and the
company originated almost 1 in 3 mortgages. Net income of $18.9
billion set a record for a third straight year.  Stumpf’s pay fell short of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO
 Lloyd Blankfein . The New York-based firm gave Blankfein $21
million, a person with knowledge of the matter said in January.
Both Stumpf and Blankfein outpaced  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Jamie Dimon, who runs the biggest U.S. bank. Dimon’s pay was halved to
$11.5 million as a penalty for the CEO’s role in the so-called
London Whale episode that led to a trading loss of more than
$6.2 billion at his New York-based company.  Under regulatory guidelines that also include changes in
executive pension accounts, Stumpf received $22.9 million in
compensation for 2012. The change in the pension plan was $3.6
million. Wells Fargo gave Stumpf $19.8 million last year,
including a $1.9 million change in the pension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
