Growth in demand for steel  in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer, is set to rebound from a
four-year low, supporting earnings for mills and the iron ore
producers that supply them.  Apparent consumption, which includes production and net
imports, may rise 4.6 percent to 708.8 million metric tons in
2013, according to the mean estimate of six analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . That’s up from 2012 when demand grew by 2.9
percent to 677.8 million tons.  The growth will benefit  Vale SA (VALE5) ,  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s top three exporters of iron ore as
China plans to spend 650 billion  yuan  ($105 billion), the most
in  three years , on railways. The strongest start to passenger
car sales in China since 2010 is also helping mills such as
Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. raise prices to the highest since June.  “The urbanization process will generally support steel
demand over the long run,” He Wenbo, chairman of Baoshan Steel,
China’s biggest listed steelmaker, said in an interview last
week in Beijing. Baoshan supplies half the steel used in cars
and home appliances in China.  The nation’s crude steel production gained 9.8 percent to
61.83 million tons last month from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said March 12. That follows record January
production of 63.62 million tons.  London-based Rio and Melbourne-based BHP have rallied 23
percent and  13 percent  respectively in Sydney trading from Sept.
5 to yesterday as  iron ore  rebounded from a near three-year low.
Ore has climbed 60 percent since then, driven by restocking from
Chinese steelmills. Baoshan Steel rose 11 percent in Shanghai
trading in the same period.  Boosting Growth  China is lifting railway spending from 631 billion yuan
last year, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Jan. 17 as
it seeks to have 120,000 kilometers (74,580 miles) of track in
operation by 2015.  “China has since the second-half of last year implemented
measures to stabilize the economy,” Hu Zhengwu, a Beijing-based
researcher with Baosteel Group Corp., China’s third-biggest
steelmaker and parent of Baoshan, said in an interview. “We
think the new government will extend such measures to boost the
growth.”  That may help improve profits at mills including Angang
Steel Co. and  Maanshan Iron & Steel (323)  Co. Aggregate earnings at
the nation’s major steel mills tumbled 98 percent to 1.58
billion yuan last year, the China Iron and Steel Association
 said  Jan. 31. Of the mills, 29 percent incurred losses, it said.  Improve Earnings  Anshan, Liaoning province-based Angang, which probably
recorded a loss of about 4.16 billion yuan in 2012, may swing to
 profit  of 502 million yuan this year, according to the mean of
15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. Maanshan, Anhui
province-based Maanshan Steel may narrow its loss to  196.4
million yuan  in 2013, from a probable loss of as much as 3.95
billion yuan, according to the mean estimate of 14 analysts.  Last week’s unexpected price increase by Baoshan Steel
“injected confidence in steel demand,”  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-
based analyst with UOB Kay Hian Ltd., said in a note to clients
last week.  Baoshan raised hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel products
for April delivery by 150 yuan a ton, the company said March 8.
It’s raised prices for six straight months.  Passenger-vehicle sales rose 20 percent to 2.84 million
units in January and February from a year ago, according to the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, beating the
average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 11
percent.  Better Year  Still, steel demand may be hurt after the government
announced measures to tame  home prices , including a 20 percent
tax on individuals selling properties, according to UOB’s Lau.
The tightening may reduce steel consumption by 1 percent to 702
million tons from an earlier forecast of 708 million tons, Lau
said in a separate note on March 4. Property accounts for 33
percent of China’s total steel demand, she said.  That isn’t a concern for mills, Baoshan’s He said, who said
the  steel industry  is improving from a low last year. At 2.9
percent, 2012’s growth would be the slowest since 2008 according
to  World Steel Association data .  “The steel industry hit a trough last year,” Baoshan’s He
said. “This year would be better.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Helen Yuan in
