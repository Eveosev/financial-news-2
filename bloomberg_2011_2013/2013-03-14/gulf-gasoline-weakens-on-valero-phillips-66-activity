U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened
against futures for the first time in three days as  Phillips 66 (PSX) 
and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  returned units to service at refineries
in  Texas .  Valero’s  Port Arthur plant  boosted equipment to planned
rates following a power interruption, said  Bill Day , a San
Antonio-based company spokesman, who didn’t specify which units
were involved. A 57,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker is still shut
for compressor repairs, he said in an e-mail today.  Phillips 66 yesterday completed maintenance on the No. 40
fluid catalytic converter’s wet gas compressor at the Borger
refinery. The work was expected to last from March 4 to March
11, according to a filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the Gulf weakened 0.62
cent to a discount of  19.25 cents  a gallon below futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:52 p.m. Reformulated
gasoline, or RBOB, slid 0.5 cent to a discount of  16.25 cents  a
gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  was at a 6-cent premium to
heating oil futures after falling 1.5 cents.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, a measure of  refining
profitability  for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slipped $1.02 to $31.21 a
barrel. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil dropped
$1.73 to $10.71 a barrel.  The Borger and Port Arthur refineries have a combined
capacity of 456,000 barrels per day, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
