Gold futures rose for the fifth
time in six sessions as a decline by the dollar boosted demand
for the precious metal as an alternative investment  The greenback dropped as much as 0.6 percent against a
basket of currencies after reaching the highest since August.
The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits
averaged 346,750 in the past four weeks, the lowest since March
2008, government data showed today. Last month, gold fell 5
percent as the dollar gained 3.5 percent.  “We saw a dollar selloff after the better-than-expected
jobs numbers and a corresponding rise in gold,” Scott Gardner,
who helps manage $400 million at Verdmont Capital SA in Panama
City, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery advanced 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,590.70 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New

of debt. The metal has declined 3.2 percent in the past 12
months.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 0.5 percent to $28.807
an ounce. The price has dropped 4.7 percent this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
