For the last two decades, India has had one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Even in recent years, when the global recession and complacent policymaking have slowed progress, growth has remained a healthy 5 percent to 6 percent. Recent surveys of employment patterns  in the workforce, though, point to the disturbing fact that rapid growth over the last decade hasn't been accompanied by a spurt in jobs. If anything, the word  "jobless"  needs to be used as a caveat prefacing the words "Indian growth story" to better understand the nature of this country's triumphs and failures.  Recent studies have shown that  in the five years  between 2005 and 2010 fewer than 3 million new jobs were added to the economy. This is worrying when one considers that about 12 million people join the workforce every year. The malaise is particularly serious in the manufacturing sector, which shed as many as 5 million jobs between 2004 and 2005 and between 2009 and 2010 and has been unable to absorb the (to some extent desirable) exodus from agriculture in India's modernizing economy. Without large-scale job creation, India's growth becomes, lower down, a fiction to millions of people looking for structured work and unable to find it. The problem becomes more pressing when one factors in  India's prospective demographic "bulge"  in the coming decades, as ever-increasing numbers of young people join the workforce every year before fertility rates fall and the population stabilizes around 2040 at about 1.5 billion. What some economists project as a  ''demographic dividend"  could turn out to be a period of crisis marked by steep unemployment and rising social unrest. In a report in the Mail Today,  SPS Pannu wrote : And a recent piece by Gaurav Choudhury and Zia Haq  in the Hindustan Times  drew on some of the same data: It's clear that to make economic growth more inclusive (rather than relying on the current system of subsidies and extensive but flawed redistribution of resources), the Indian government needs to immediately provide a massive stimulus for manufacturing -- partly by cutting red tape and eliminating structural defects in the manufacturing sector, but also by improving the  lamentable  quality of public education. Indeed, India currently has far too many people  who are functionally illiterate , compounding low job growth with the even more tragic problem, noted in  this perceptive overview  by Amy Kazmin, of "high unemployment coupled with labour shortages."  Some of these issues are addressed in a document called  "The Manufacturing Plan: Strategies For Accelerating Growth of Manufacturing In India in the 12th Five Year Plan and Beyond"  prepared last year by India's Planning Commission. An overview of this plan and an argument for an industrial policy directed by government was provided by  Arun Maira , a member of the commission, in an essay called  "New Manufacturing Policy: Why India needs a blueprint to boost manufacturing:" India's latest  "National Manufacturing Policy"  has set ambitious goals: the creation of 100 million new manufacturing jobs in the next decade and an increase in manufacturing's contribution to gross domestic product to 25 percent from 16 percent.  Asit Ranjan Mishra and Amrit Raj  noted the policy's main new emphasis in the business newspaper Mint: But the plan's projected goals seem so optimistic as to be almost unachievable, as  a recent paper on India's jobless growth situation  makes clear: The writing, then, is on the wall. India needs a massive improvement in the manufacturing sector and much greater investment in education and skilled labor if its "demographic dividend" isn't to become a demographic crisis.
