Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the second-
largest mobile-phone company, will end its sponsorship of the
McLaren Formula One racing team at the end of the year.  Vodafone, which has reviewed its sponsorship strategy, is
shifting its focus on live events and digital campaigns to
increase awareness of its brand, the Newbury, U.K.-based company
said in a statement today.  “Our brand is evolving, and we’ve concluded we will have
less of a need for this kind of exposure in the future,” Chief
Commercial Officer Morten Lundal said. “We have been very happy
with our engagement with McLaren.”  Vodafone was able to brand the cars with its Verizon
Wireless logo in the first U.S. Formula One race since 2007 last
year. Since 2007, Vodafone and McLaren have had 34 Grand Prix
victories, and last season won seven races. McLaren driver  Lewis Hamilton , who was world champion in 2008, has switched to the
Mercedes team this year.  A Vodafone spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the
release. The McLaren deal cost Vodafone as much as $75 million a
year, the Financial Times reported earlier today, citing people
familiar with the contract. The sponsorship deal began in 2007.  “Our focus is on continuing to drive results for all our
partners throughout the 2013 season, and we look forward to
making a major title partnership announcement towards the end
of the year,” said Martin Whitmarsh, the Vodafone McLaren
Mercedes team principal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
