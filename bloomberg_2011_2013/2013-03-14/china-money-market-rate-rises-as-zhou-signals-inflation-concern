China’s money-market rate rose to a
one-week high after central bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said
yesterday the nation should be on “high alert” over inflation.  Consumer-price gains in February, distorted by the weeklong
Lunar New Year holiday, reached a 10-month-high of 3.2 percent,
official data showed March 9. The People’s Bank of China will
sell 18 billion  yuan  ($2.9 billion) of 28-day repurchase
contracts today, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions, which will effectively reduce
the amount of cash in the system.  “The PBOC is still withdrawing liquidity” said Weisheng
He, a Shanghai-based strategist at Citigroup Inc. “The
authorities are somewhat concerned about rapid monetary
growth.”  The  seven-day repo rate , which measures interbank funding
availability, climbed six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 3.08 percent as of 10:45 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched 3.1 percent earlier, matching the highest
level since March 5.  Monetary policy  is “no longer relaxed” and is
“relatively neutral” as demonstrated by a 13 percent target
for money-supply growth that’s tighter than economic expansion
in the last two years, the PBOC’s Zhou said at a press
conference yesterday during the annual gathering of China’s
National People’s Congress.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to receive
the seven-day repo, was unchanged at 3.27 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
