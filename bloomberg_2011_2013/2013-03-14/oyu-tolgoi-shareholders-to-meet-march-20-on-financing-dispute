Shareholders in Mongolia’s $6.6
billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine will reconvene on March
20 to try and resolve disputes that are holding up construction
funding, Mongolia’s Minister for Economic Development Nyamjav
Batbayar said.  The mine is currently operating on a month-to-month budget
with funds from  Rio Tinto  Group, which owns 66 percent of the
project through its  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ)  unit. Mongolia
owns the rest. Batbayar identified six issues to be tackled by
shareholders, according to a Tuesday  report  from the state-owned
Montsame News Agency.  Among them is costs. The government alleges that the
project has gone 40 percent over budget, while Rio Tinto says
the figure is closer to 18 percent. Mongolia says it will only
approve the 2013 budget when it sees a finalized feasibility
study for phase two of the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
