Copyright claims by  Universal Music 
Group and other studios against the Internet video-site operator
Veoh Networks Inc. were properly dismissed, a federal appeals
court ruled.  Veoh was protected from the claims by “safe harbor”
provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which
shields Internet service providers that unknowingly post
copyrighted material and remove it when alerted, a three-judge
panel in San Francisco said today.  The court previously ruled in favor of Veoh in 2011,
granting the studio’s request for rehearing. It issued a new
opinion today. The lawsuit was filed in 2007 against Veoh and
its backers. Most of Veoh’s assets were acquired in 2010 by
 Qlipso Media Networks Ltd.   Universal Music is a unit of Paris-based  Vivendi SA. (VIV)   Steven Marenberg, an attorney for Universal, didn’t
immediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking comment about
the ruling.  The case is UMG Recordings Inc. v. Veoh Networks Inc., 10-
0955902,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
