ESB Novusmodus LP, a clean
technology fund backed by Ireland’s Electricity Supply Board,
led an investment in Aveillant Ltd., a U.K. company with
technology that stops wind turbines from jamming airport radars.  The 6.75 million pounds ($10 million) will enable
Cambridge-based Aveillant to make and install its Holographic
Radar units, which allow radars to distinguish between aircraft
and wind turbines, according to a statement e-mailed by
Greencoat Capital LLP, adviser to ESB Novusmodus.  When built in the sight of air traffic control radars,
turbines create “clutter” on controller screens, obscuring the
visibility of aircraft and fueling objections to projects in
planning. There is more energy capacity held up in the
consenting process because of aviation radar issues than is
installed on the ground, according to the statement.  The financing includes contributions from existing
investors DFJ Esprit LLP and Cambridge Consultants Ltd.
Demonstrations of the technology, deployed at no cost to the
airport and paid for by wind farms as they use the system, are
planned at Prestwick and Glasgow airports, in addition to a
system at Cambridge airport, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
