Two cases of Carruades de Lafite
2008, the second wine of Bordeaux first-growth Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild, sold for a four-month high of 1,750 pounds
($2,620) on the London-based Liv-ex wine market yesterday,
according to data on its Cellar Watch website.  The price was 8 percent up from a 31-month low reached last
October, and came after 12 cases were sold at an Acker Merrall
& Condit auction in  New York  last month, six for $2,952 each
and six for $2,706, according to Ackerâ€™s online records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
