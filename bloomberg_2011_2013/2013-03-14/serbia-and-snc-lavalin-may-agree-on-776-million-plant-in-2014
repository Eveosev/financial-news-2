Serbia and a unit of  SNC-Lavalin
Group Inc. (SNC)  may sign a contract next year on building a 600
million-euro ($776 million) hydro-power plant in the Balkan
country after Parliament ratifies an accord with the  Canadian
Commercial Corporation .  The bilateral agreement with  Canada ’s state agency for
international contracting will help provide guarantees for
hiring SNC-Lavalin International Inc. to build the 680-megawatt
pumped-storage Bistrica plant, Energy Minister Zorana Mihajlovic
told reporters at a business forum in Kopaonik today. The plant
will help Serbia balance the grid during consumption peaks, she
said.  Negotiations with SNC-Lavalin on the Bistrica project will
start after lawmakers approve the  accord , which they are
currently discussing. A binding contract with the Montreal-based
builder may be closed in 12 to 18 months, she said.  Elektroprivreda Srbije,  Serbia ’s dominant, state-run power
producer, signed a memorandum of understanding with SNC Lavalin
on the project last March. The document also envisaged the
participation of China Nuclear Power Engineering Co. Ltd.,
though “SNC Lavalin is seen as the lead contractor,”
Mihajlovic said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
