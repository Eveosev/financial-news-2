The Senate Banking Committee will
vote March 19 on President  Barack Obama â€™s nomination of Mary Jo White to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The committee also will vote on the nomination of Richard Cordray for director of the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau. The committee held a hearing on both nominations on
March 12.  The committee vote is the first of a two-stage Senate
confirmation process. After a vote by the Banking committee, the
nominations must also be voted on by the full Senate. No date
for a Senate floor vote has been set for either nominee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
