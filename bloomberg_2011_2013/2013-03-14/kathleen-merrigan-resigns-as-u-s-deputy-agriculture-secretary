Kathleen Merrigan has resigned as
deputy secretary at the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , the
agency’s No. 2 job.  Merrigan, an organic-foods expert, “played a vital role in
the department’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative,”
which focused on locally grown food, as well as the agency’s
budget cutting efforts, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said
today in an e-mail. No reason was given for her departure.  Merrigan, 53, served as chief of the USDA’s Agricultural
Marketing Service under then-President  Bill Clinton  and was a
staff member of the Senate Agriculture Committee from 1987 to
1992. In that position she helped develop the Organic Foods
Production Act of 1990, which set national standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
