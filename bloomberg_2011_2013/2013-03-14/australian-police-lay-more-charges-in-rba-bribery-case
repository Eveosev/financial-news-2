Australian Federal Police said
additional charges were laid relating to bribery of foreign
officials by employees of  Reserve Bank  of  Australia ’s note-
printing units.  Three men, who had been charged in 2011 in relation to
efforts to secure banknote contracts on behalf of Note Printing
Australia Ltd. face two additional charges of foreign bribery
and false accounting, police said in a statement on the
Australian Federal Police  website . A fourth man was also charged
with foreign bribery activity in Nepal. Police didn’t name any
of the men.  A total of nine former managers and employees at the
central bank’s note-printing unit and Securency International
Pty now face charges in relation to the bribing of officials in
Malaysia,  Indonesia , Nepal and Vietnam from 1999 to 2004 to win
banknote printing contracts. NPA is a wholly owned unit of the
central bank. The RBA agreed to sell its 50 percent stake in
Securency in February.  Glenn Stevens , the central bank governor, has denied
allegations that some senior RBA officials were involved in
covering up evidence of corruption at the units.  A person convicted of bribing a foreign public official may
face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.  Police said the investigation is continuing and no further
comments would be made.  To contact the reporter on this story:
