<a href="news:linkid=MJO0E26TTDS9"> BB&T Corp. (BBT) </a>, North Carolina’s
second-biggest bank, slid as much as 3.3 percent in New York
trading after the <a href="news:linkid=MJO9526KLVR6">Federal Reserve</a> objected to the company’s
capital plan, blocking any rise in dividends or share buybacks.  The lender fell 2.8 percent to $30.84 at 9:43 a.m. today
after the Winston-Salem-based company said in a <a href="news:linkid=MJO5G66KLVR6">statement</a>
yesterday its quarterly <a href="news:linkid=MJO9526KLVR5">dividend</a> will remain at 23 cents. BB&T
will resubmit its plan “as soon as feasible.”  “BB&T’s capital plan was objected to based on a
qualitative assessment,” the Fed said yesterday in a report
detailing the results of its annual stress tests on the 18
biggest <a href="news:linkid=MJO9526KLVR7">U.S. banks</a>. Qualitative failures could include faulty
corporate governance or risk management, inadequate assumptions
about the capital plan, an unsafe capital distribution or
unresolved supervisory issues.  BB&T, led by Chief Executive Officer <a href="news:linkid=MJO0E16TTDWF">Kelly King</a>, 64,
changed how it calculates risk-weighted assets to meet
regulatory guidance, the Fed said. The adjustments increased
those assets and triggered a drop in BB&T’s risk-based capital
ratios, according to the Fed.  The lender had climbed 9 percent this year through the
close of regular trading yesterday, trailing the 12 percent
advance for the <a href="news:linkid=MJO9526KLVR8">KBW Bank Index</a> of 24 U.S. lenders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
