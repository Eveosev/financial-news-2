West Texas Intermediate rose to the
highest level in two weeks as the number of Americans  filing 
applications for jobless benefits dropped last week. Brent’s
premium to WTI widened for the first time in seven days.  WTI gained 0.6 percent after the Labor Department said
first-time unemployment claims fell by 10,000 to 332,000 last
week. The  median  forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an increase to 350,000. Futures dropped earlier after
an Energy Information Administration report yesterday showed
U.S. crude  supplies  rose to the highest level for the time of
year in records dating to 1982.  “These numbers suggest that the labor market is starting
to improve, signaling the economic recovery will accelerate,”
said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence
Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion.
“An improving jobs picture will boost energy demand. More miles
will be driven because of increased commuting and more things
will be bought, which will need to be transported.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose 51 cents to $93.03 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the highest
settlement since Feb. 25. The volume of all futures traded was
21 percent below the 100-day average at 3:17 p.m. Futures are up
1.3 percent this year.  Brent oil for April settlement, which expired today,
climbed 90 cents, or 0.8 percent, to end the session at $109.42
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It
closed at $108.52 yesterday, the lowest settlement since Dec.
17. The more-active May contract rose 72 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $108.96. The volume of all futures was 40 percent above the
100-day average.  Fibonacci Retracement  The European benchmark is rebounding after failing to break
through technical support at $108.44, said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .
That’s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement from the high of
$128.40 on March 1, 2012, to the low of $88.49 touched in June.  “If the new contract can decisively break through $108.44
a barrel during the next few days,you will see prices move
strongly to the downside,” Schork said.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index advanced to the
highest level since April. The comfort index’s measure of
personal finances climbed to the highest reading since July.  Equities also advanced on the improving economic outlook.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed as much as 0.5 percent
to an all-time high of 14,528.79. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  gained as much as 0.5 percent to 1,562.14, approaching a
record high.  Equity Strength  “The strong jobs number is giving the market support,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in  Chicago . “The numbers are boosting equities, which
should give us more strength.”  WTI’s discount to Brent shrank to a six-week low yesterday
after the EIA reported that crude supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for Nymex futures, dropped 1.53 million
barrels last week, the biggest decline since May 2011, to 49.3
million. Brent’s premium to WTI futures widened to $16.39 from
$16 yesterday.  “The spread absolutely collapsed,” Schork said. “It’s
about time for it to widen again. It was a real widow maker.”  The differential will average $7.50 a barrel this year as
U.S. refineries end maintenance and new pipeline capacity
reduces a glut at Cushing, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a
March 11 report.  Crude Inventories  U.S. crude stockpiles climbed 2.62 million barrels to 384
million last week, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Crude output  rose 66,000 barrels to 7.16
million a day, the highest level since July 1992.  OPEC’s production may rise in the second quarter to meet
increasing demand from refiners, indicating prices will advance
as spare production capacity is reduced, Morgan Stanley said.
Output by the 12-member group could grow by 850,000 barrels a
day from April to June, the bank said in the report today.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase its shipments this month, tanker tracker Oil Movements
said. OPEC will export 23.75 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to March 30, up 300,000 barrels from the previous period,
the Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. The figures exclude Angola and  Ecuador .  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 370,176
contracts as of 3:19 p.m. It totaled 723,353 contracts
yesterday, 33 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.71 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
