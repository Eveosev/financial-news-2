Israel ’s posted a  current-account 
surplus for a second consecutive quarter, as the balance of
trade widened, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said today.  The seasonally adjusted surplus was $71 million in the
fourth quarter, down from a revised $224 million in the July-
September period, the statistics bureau said in an e-mailed
statement. For the year, the country posted a deficit of $199
million, compared with a revised surplus of $3.4 billion in 2011
and $8.1 billion in 2010.  Israel had maintained an annual surplus in its current
account since 2003, driven by exports, which make up about 40
percent of gross domestic product. The European economic crisis
and decline in global trade cut demand for Israeli products,
sending the current account into deficit for three quarters,
beginning at the end of last year.  “The prospects are good; this is an improving trend,”
 Daniel Hewitt , senior emerging-market economist at Barclays Plc
in  London , said before the announcement. “The 12-month current
account had been widening and we now have a reversal.”  Israel posted a $324 million surplus in trade in goods and
services in the fourth quarter, compared with a $213 million
surplus the previous three months, the bureau said.  The full-year deficit as a percentage of gross domestic
product was 0.1 percent of gross domestic product, the bureau
said, compared with a median forecast of 0.8 percent deficit
made by three economists surveyed by Bloomberg in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
