The Treasury 10-year note’s
ascending-channel pattern suggests the benchmark security will
extend losses if the yield closes above 2.06 percent, according
to Royal Bank of Canada technical analysis.  A daily close at the level, reached but not breached on a
closing basis since April 2012, will confirm weakness, said
 George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed income in
Toronto at the bank’s  RBC Capital Markets  unit. The yield has
risen 30 basis points this year in the ascending-channel
pattern, a chart formation in which the yield shows higher highs
and higher lows over time.  “The market continues to exhibit the bearish tone we’ve
seen since December, and will continue if we breach 2.06
percent, a significant level,” Davis said in a telephone
interview. “We are in for more of a gradual grind higher in
yields instead of a spike, given the Fed’s continued purchases.
But any rally should be seen as a selling opportunity.”  The  Federal Reserve  bought $3.337 billion of Treasuries
today as part of its outright purchase program. The central bank
is buying $85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed
securities each month to foster economic growth by keeping long-
term yields low.  The 10-year note yield rose three basis point, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 11:22 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield reached
2.08 percent on March 8 on an intraday level, the highest level
since April 5, before closing at 2.04 percent. The price of the
2 percent security due in February 2023 slipped 8/32, or $2.50
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 17/32.  Ten-year notes have lost 1.9 percent this year, almost
double the 0.96 percent decline in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes. The last
time the 10-year started the year with larger declines was 2009,
when the drop as 4.73 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
