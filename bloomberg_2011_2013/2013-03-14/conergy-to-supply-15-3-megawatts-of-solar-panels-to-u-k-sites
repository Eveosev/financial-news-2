Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German clean-energy
company, will supply solar panels to four projects in Britain as
the U.K. market grows by an estimated 13 percent a year.  Conergy won contracts to supply 15.3 megawatts of panels to
projects by Spanish developer  Solaer  in southern  England , the
Hamburg-based company said today in an e-mailed statement,
without disclosing terms.  “We expect average yearly growth of about 13 percent and a
market volume of about 1.1 gigawatts by the end of 2013 that
will grow to 1.5 gigawatts in 2015,” said Robert Goss, head of
Conergy’s U.K. unit. Thanks to government subsidies, “solar
parks will play an important role here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
