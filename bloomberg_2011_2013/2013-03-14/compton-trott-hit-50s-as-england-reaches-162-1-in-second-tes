Jonathan Trott and Nick Compton hit
centuries to lift  England  to 267-2 on day one of the second
cricket Test after being sent in to bat by  New Zealand .  Trott was unbeaten on 121 at stumps with  Kevin Pietersen  on
18 at Wellington’s Basin Reserve. Trott earlier shared a 210-run
second-wicket stand with Compton, who made 100 to bring up back-
to-back centuries after scoring 117 to help the touring team
draw the series opener in Dunedin.  England captain  Alastair Cook  was the only other wicket to
fall on the opening day after losing the toss, caught off Neil
Wagner’s bowling when on 17. Wagner finished with 1-70 from his
22 overs, while spinner Bruce Martin took 1-58.  Cook’s dismissal brought Trott to the crease and the right-
hander batted the rest of the day, bringing up his ninth century
in elite Tests in the final session with a pull shot to the
boundary. Opening batsman Compton also reached three figures
with a four, though he got out soon after when he edged a Martin
delivery to  Ross Taylor  at first slip.  Both teams are unchanged from the rain-affected series
opener, which ended in a draw as England fought back after being
dismissed for 167 in its first innings.  New Zealand, which has lost eight of its past 12 elite
five-day matches, last won a Test series against England 14
years ago. The third and final Test starts March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
