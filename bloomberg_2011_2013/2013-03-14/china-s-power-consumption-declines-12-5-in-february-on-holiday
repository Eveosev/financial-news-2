China ’s power consumption fell 12.5
percent from a year earlier in February as factories shut or
slowed operations during the Lunar New Year holiday.  Electricity demand declined to 337.4 billion kilowatt hours
last month, the National Energy Administration  said  on its
website today. Power use in the first two months increased 5.5
percent from the same period in 2012 to 789.2 billion kilowatt
hours.  The year-on-year comparison of the data is distorted by the
Lunar New Year holiday, also known as the Spring Festival, when
factories and offices shut as Chinese workers travel back to
their hometowns to celebrate with their families. The break
stretched from Feb. 9 to Feb. 15 this year, while it ran from
Jan. 22 to Jan. 28 in 2012.  “The Spring Festival is the main factor in the big drop in
power-use growth last month,” Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-Kay
Hian Ltd. in  Shanghai , said by phone. “We expect this year’s
electricity consumption to increase 8 percent.”  Secondary industries, which include energy-intensive
mining, manufacturing and construction companies, consumed 4.2
percent more electricity in January and February than a year
ago, today’s report showed. Power demand by primary industries,
which include farming, rose 4.3 percent, according to the NEA.
Electricity use by the tertiary sector, including services and
logistics, increased 13.8 percent.  Power use will increase by as much as 8.5 percent this year
as the economy expands, the China Electricity Council, a group
of the nation’s biggest electricity producers, said Feb. 28.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
