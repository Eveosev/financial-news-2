Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  won
planner’s support to develop an office building that may become
its new European headquarters.  Officials recommended that the City of London financial
district approve the project near the company’s current Fleet
Street base, according to documents posted on the borough’s
Website. The council is set to vote on the plan on March 22.  The building at 70 Farringdon Street will have around
78,000 square meters (840,000 square feet) of internal office
space, according to the application letter.  Goldman Sachs was given permission in September to move a
set of protected murals from the building, helping to clear the
way for the redevelopment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
