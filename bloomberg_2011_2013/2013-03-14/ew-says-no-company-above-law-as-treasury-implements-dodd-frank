U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said no company is above the law and that the department
will continue to implement the Dodd-Frank law designed to keep
taxpayers from paying for the mistakes of financial companies.  “No one and no company is above the law and we need to
enforce our laws so that we protect the American people,” Lew
told reporters today after touring a  Siemens AG (SIE)  facility in
Alpharetta,  Georgia . “We’re going to complete the
implementation of Dodd-Frank and we will continue to implement
all the laws that we have.”‪  Lew was responding to a question about U.S. Attorney
General Eric Holder’s comments last week that the size of the
largest financial institutions makes it difficult for the
 Justice Department  to bring criminal charges when there’s
wrongdoing.  Lew, who was holding his first press conference as Treasury
secretary, also said the U.S. needs a dynamic economy that
creates jobs as he highlighted a “bright future” for American
manufacturers. Separately, his department announced in
Washington that he’ll travel to Beijing March 19-20 for talks
with officials in China’s new government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
