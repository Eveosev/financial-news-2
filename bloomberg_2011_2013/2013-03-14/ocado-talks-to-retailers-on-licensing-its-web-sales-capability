Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  is talking to a
number of retailers about licensing its Web shopping technology
after shares surged on confirmation it’s negotiating to help
WM Morrison Supermarkets Plc start an online business.  “This is in line with what we have been saying to our
investors that we will monetize the intellectual property and
the know-how in the business,” Duncan Tatton-Brown, chief
financial officer of Ocado, the U.K.’s largest Internet-only
grocer, said in an interview today. “We are always talking to
people,” he said, without identifying the retailers.  Ocado shares rose as much as 29 percent, the biggest
intraday jump since Nov. 19, to 177.10 pence, close to the 180
pence price of the 2010 initial public offering. The stock was
up 17 percent at 161.40 pence as of 11:09 a.m. in  London .  Ocado, which on Feb. 7 reported a narrower full-year loss,
will turn cash positive in the second half of the year, once
“we finished paying for the second fulfillment center” Tatton-
Brown said. Faster growth, the appointment of former Marks &
Spencer Group Plc boss  Stuart Rose  as chairman and an extension
of Ocado’s debt facility in November have eased fears over the
company’s future following concerns about the time it will take
to make a profit.  Ocado opened a second warehouse at Dordon in central
 England  in February, which currently handles 10,000 to 15,000
orders a week. At its peak, Ocado’s first facility handled
150,000 a week, Tatton-Brown said.  Gross sales rose 14 percent from a year earlier to 185.5
million pounds in the 12 weeks to Feb. 24., Ocado said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
