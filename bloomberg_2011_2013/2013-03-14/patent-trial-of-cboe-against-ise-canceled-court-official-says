International Securities Exchange
LLC, an all-electronic options trading market, opted out of a
patent trial against  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Inc. on the
day its lawyers were to deliver opening statements to a jury.  U.S. District Judge Joan H. Lefkow, who was presiding over
the lawsuit in federal court in Chicago, issued a series of
adverse pre-trial rulings that compelled ISE to “cease pursuit
of the case,” it said in a statement today.  The Deutsche Borse AG unit alleged the Chicago exchange had
infringed an automated trading patent. CBOE, in a separately
filed case, asked Lefkow to find the ISE patent was invalid.  “ISE strongly believes in the merits of its case that CBOE
copied and continues to infringe ISE’s patented trading
technology,” the New York-based company said. “ISE plans to
immediately file an appeal to the Federal Circuit to reverse
these rulings.”  The trial, set to start on March 11 and delayed for three
days while Lefkow addressed the preliminary motions, was one of
at least three legal disputes between ISE and Chicago-based  CBOE
Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , operator of the biggest U.S. options exchange.  Jury Discharged  Jurors were discharged today without ever hearing arguments
or evidence in the trial Lefkow had told them on March 11 would
last until early April.  Jonathan Marshall , an attorney for the CBOE, said in a
courtroom interview that lawyers for ISE asked the judge to
enter a judgment of non-infringement, freeing ISE to appeal.  ISE concluded the “net effect of the rulings would make it
impossible to make their case at trial,” Marshall said.  In one ruling, made public on March 11, Lefkow had barred
ISE from presenting evidence of pre-suit damages to the jury,
concluding that the exchange had failed to comply with a federal
“marking statute,” requiring it to make public its patent
claim.  “We are gratified that this case has reached the correct
result,” CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William J. Brodsky said in a statement today.  The cases are Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc. v.
International Securities Exchange LLC, 07-cv-00623, and
International Securities Exchange LLC v. Chicago Board Options
Exchange Inc., 07-cv-04709, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
