Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  agreed to
renew its short-haul fleet with 100 mostly fuel-efficient jets
from Airbus SAS, as the airline seeks to cut kerosene costs that
constitute its single biggest expense.  Of the new aircraft, 70 will be A320neo and A321neo models,
while 30 will be equipped with the current engine option, the
company said in a statement today. The airline will also take
six Boeing 777-300ER for the long-haul fleet of its Swiss unit
and two additional A380 for its namesake brand, bringing the
list price for the planes to 9 billion euros ($11.7 billion).  Europe ’s second-largest airline is emerging from the first
year of its most ambitious efficiency push ever, seeking 2.3
billion euros in operating profit by 2015. Lufthansa, which
suspended its dividend payout for 2012 to help finance the
planes, predicted today that net income will drop this year, and
that it’s unclear if the company can achieve free  cash flow .  “2013 and 2014 will be tough years of implementation and
the continuation of the restructuring process,” Chief Executive
Officer Christoph Franz said, according to a speech handed out
to journalists ahead of the company’s annual press conference at
Frankfurt airport today.  Lufthansa rose as much as 57 cents, or 3.7 percent, to
16.06 euros, and traded at 16.02 euros as of 9:31 a.m., valuing
the Cologne-based company at 7.4 billion euros.  Biggest Operator  The order makes Lufthansa the biggest airline operator
worldwide of Airbus aircraft. Franz said the fleet will not grow
significantly in coming years, and Lufthansa will remain
“restrictive” in its offering, adding just 1 percent capacity
this year. That’s down from an earlier goal of 1.5 percent
capacity growth. While the short-haul offering will be reduced
by 2.6 percent, long-haul capacity will rise 2.9 percent.  Lufthansa today said fuel costs rose 18 percent in 2012 to
7.39 billion euros, which it sees declining to about 7.2 billion
euros this year. Staff costs rose 5.6 percent to 7.05 billion
euros, while fees and charges increased by 3.3 percent.  While fuel expenses will remain on a high level, the
projected decline for this year is “a sigh of relief,” Chief
Financial Officer Simone Menne said.  Operating profit declined 36 percent last year to 524
million euros and is set to rise again this year, Lufthansa
said, without being more specific. That means profit will have
to rise more than four-fold in 3 years to reach Lufthansa’s
target. Analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg expect the number to rise
to 987.5 million euros this year.  Profit Swing  Air France KLM Group and British Airways parent  IAG (IAG)  both
suffered operating losses in 2012. Lufthansa’s passenger airline
had an operating loss of 45 million euros, while Swiss earned
191 million euros and Austrian contributed 65 million euros. The
company’s maintenance and repair unit, No. 1 in the industry,
made the biggest contribution to operating profit,  “The passenger airlines’ profits are set to be the profit
swing this year,” Damian Brewer, an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets , said in a note to clients.  Score, as Lufthansa’s efficiency push is dubbed, made a
gross contribution of 618 million euros to operating profit last
year, compared with a target for 280 million euros. Operating
profit still declined this year, as fuel costs rose by 1.1
billion euros. Score is expected to contribute 740 million euros
this year.  The program includes cutting 3,500 jobs, and Lufthansa has
already booked provisions for severance packages for 2,014
employees, the company said today.  The savings measures coincide with the company’s largest
ever fleet renewal program that includes 236 new planes to be
taken into operation through 2025 for a list price of 22 billion
euros. Customers typically get discounts on orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
