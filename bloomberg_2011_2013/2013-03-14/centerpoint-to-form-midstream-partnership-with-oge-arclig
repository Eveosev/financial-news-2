Centerpoint Energy Inc. (CNP)  agreed to
form a master limited partnership with a jointly owned
subsidiary of  OGE Energy Corp. (OGE)  and ArcLight Capital Partners
LLC, combining pipeline and storage assets in Oklahoma, Texas,
 Arkansas  and  Louisiana .  Centerpoint, a Houston-based utility owner, and OGE Energy,
an Oklahoma City-based utility owner, plan an initial public
offering of equity in the partnership after the transaction
closes, which is expected in the second or third quarter of
2013, according to a statement.  Centerpoint will have a 59 percent interest in the
partnership, OGE Energy will have a 28 percent interest and
ArcLight,  a private equity investor,  will hold a 13 percent
interest, the companies said today in a joint statement.
Centerpoint will hold a 40 percent interest and OGE Energy will
have a 60 percent interest in distribution payments made by the
new company to the general partner.  “We are very excited about creating a substantial, growth-
oriented midstream company,” David M. McClanahan, president and
chief executive officer of Centerpoint, said in a statement.  Centerpoint said last month it was exploring forming a
partnership of its midstream assets, located near gas-rich shale
formations, as a way to fund additional growth. The new
partnership will own 8,400 miles of interstate pipelines, 2,300
miles of intrastate pipelines and have more than 11,000 miles of
gathering lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
