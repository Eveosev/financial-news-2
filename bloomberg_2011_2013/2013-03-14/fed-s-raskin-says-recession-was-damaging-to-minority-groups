Federal Reserve Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said the loss of equity in homes during the
recession was especially damaging to low-income and minority
neighborhoods.  “I don’t need to tell you how damaging the recession was
to low and moderate-income neighborhoods,” Raskin said today in
a speech in Washington. “By mid-2000s the impact of subprime
mortgages, particularly those targeted to low-income and
minority neighborhoods, was easy to see.”  “Home equity has traditionally been an important source of
savings,” she said, calling it a “cushion” against unexpected
expenses. During the downturn, however, homeownership was more
of a cost than an asset for many people, Raskin, a former state
bank regulator, said during brief introductory remarks at the
NeighborWorks 35th Anniversary Symposium.  To contact the reporters on this story:
