SK Engineering & Construction Co.
plans to build  South Korea ’s biggest offshore wind farm at a
cost of as much as 800 billion won ($726 million). The facility
will begin commercial operations in 2017.  The unit of South Korea’s third-biggest industrial group
plans to install 28 seven-megawatt wind generators 2.5
kilometers (1.55 miles) off the coast of Ulsan, 280 kilometers
east of Seoul, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  SK has teamed up with  Kepco Engineering & Construction Co. (052690) ,
a unit of the nation’s only electricity distributor, to submit a
construction proposal to the  Ulsan Metropolitan City  this month,
the Seoul-based company said.  If approved, construction would start in 2015. The 196-
megawatt wind farm will be capable of generating electricity
equivalent to a year’s consumption by 100,000 households,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
