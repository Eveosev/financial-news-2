Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
in more than six months as oil importers demanded dollars in
West Africa’s second-biggest economy.  The currency of the world’s No. 2 cocoa producer
depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.9325 per dollar by 3 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, the lowest since Sept. 4 on a closing basis and a
third day of declines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The oil sector was the main driver,” Sadiq Abubakar, a
currency trader at International Commercial Bank in Accra, said
by phone. Bulk oil importers who bring in the product to sell to
marketing companies “bought the dollars to settle their
bills,” he said.  Bulk distribution companies have boosted imports since a
shutdown in August of the Tema Oil Refinery Ltd., Ghana’s lone
crude processor, said Steven Larbi, public relations and
consumer-service manager with the National Petroleum Authority,
the state agency that regulates the gasoline industry.  The state-owned refinery is carrying out test runs after it
stopped production because of machinery problems and to carry
out rehabilitation works, Managing Director Ato Ampiah said on
March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
