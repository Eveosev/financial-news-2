Mining companies in  South Africa ’s
Gauteng province may face criminal charges should they be found
responsible for polluting water, the Johannesburg-based  Times 
newspaper reported.  A report compiled by the province’s Department of Water
Affairs will help the government determine the course of action,
the newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  The case may be complex because more than half the mining
companies that could be responsible for the acid drainage have
since closed, the Times said, citing Adam Gunn of Warburton Gunn
Attorneys in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
