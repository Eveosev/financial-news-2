Standard Life Investments , the
fund-management unit of  Scotland ’s biggest insurer, said the
assets it manages on behalf of other parties rose to 50 percent
of the firm’s total on inflows from North America and Asia.  So-called third-party assets have grown from 9.4 percent of
the firm’s funds in 1998, while overall assets have almost
tripled since then to 167.7 billion pounds ($250 million) as of
the end of 2012, the Edinburgh-based unit of  Standard Life Plc (SL/) 
said today in a statement. The rest of the fund manager’s assets
come from Standard Life’s insurance unit.  “It’s an important milestone in terms of clients voting
with their feet and bringing assets to Standard Life Investments
and the importance within the group,” Chief Executive Officer
Keith Skeoch said in a telephone interview today.  Some 70 percent of the third-party funds come from
institutions and pension funds, while the rest is from retail
investors, Skeoch said. The company won a $600 million mandate
from a teachers’ pension fund in  Illinois  last year for its 21
billion-pound global absolute return strategy fund, he said.  Standard Life Investments aims to “broaden and deepen”
its relationships with distributors in Asia over the next few
years, aiming for the region to make up as much as a quarter of
net inflows, Skeoch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
