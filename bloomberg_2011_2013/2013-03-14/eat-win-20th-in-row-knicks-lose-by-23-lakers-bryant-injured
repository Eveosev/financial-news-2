straight game, the New York Knicks fell by more than 20 points
again and the  Los Angeles Lakers  lost top scorer  Kobe Bryant  to
an ankle injury in the National Basketball Association.  The Knicks, who were defeated 117-94 in Denver, lost All-

left knee. Leading scorer Carmelo Anthony followed him off the
court with a sore knee. The Knicks already are missing forward
Amar’e Stoudemire for six weeks following knee surgery.      At
the Wells Fargo Center, the Heat beat the host Philadelphia

1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks for the third-longest single-season
 victory streak  in NBA history.  LeBron James had 27 points to lead the Heat (49-14), who
have the NBA’s best record this season.  Miami’s streak matches that of the Bucks, who were led by
future Hall of Famers  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , then known as Lew Alcindor, and  Oscar Robertson . The Bucks went on to win their
only NBA championship.  The longest winning streak in NBA history belongs to the
1971-72 Lakers, who won 33 straight games en route to an NBA
title. Players on that team, which went 69-13 in the regular
season, included future Hall of Fame members  Wilt Chamberlain ,
 Jerry West , Gail Goodrich and Elgin Baylor.  The 2007-08 Houston Rockets failed to turn their 22-game
winning streak into an NBA championship. Led by Yao Ming and
Tracy McGrady, the Rockets lost to the Utah Jazz in the first
round of the playoffs.  Knicks Lose  At the Pepsi Center in Denver,  Wilson Chandler  had 24
points and Danilo Gallinari added 16 as the Nuggets (44-22)
opened a 22-point halftime lead and coasted to their 10th
straight victory. Iman Shumpert scored 20 points for the Knicks
(38-24), who lost by 29 at Golden State two nights earlier.  Anthony, in his first game at Denver since he demanded a
trade from the Nuggets two years ago, scored nine points on 3-
for-12 shooting before leaving early in the third period.  At Philips Arena in Atlanta, the Lakers lost Bryant with an
ankle injury for an indefinite period of time in their 96-92
loss to the Atlanta Hawks.  Bryant severely sprained his left ankle on the final shot
of the game. After missing a jumper that would have tied the
contest, Bryant landed on defender Dahntay Jones’ right foot.  To contact the reporters on this story:
