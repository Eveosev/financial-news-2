Hong Kong  stocks  fell for a fourth
day, led by local developers after HSBC Holdings Plc and
Standard Chartered Plc raised mortgage rates in the city.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , Hong Kong’s biggest developer,
slid 3.4 percent. Chinese developers also dropped, extending
yesterday’s declines after the China Securities Journal reported
Beijing will strengthen a review of homebuyer qualifications.
 ASM Pacific Technology Ltd. (522) , a maker of assembly and packaging
equipment for the semiconductor industry, declined 5.5 percent
after its controlling shareholder cut its stake in the company.  The Hang Seng Index retreated 0.7 percent to 22,392.54 as
of 10:33 a.m. in Hong Kong. All but six stocks fell in the 50-
member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies sank 0.8 percent to 10,950.36.  “In the short term, the market is still under pressure but
right now it’s going into a longer term support level zone,”
said Linus Yip, a Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai
Securities Ltd. “We expect there may be some bottom fishing and
bargain hunting coming out.” Property shares are dragging the
market down as they react to the news on mortgage rates, Yip
said.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost this year’s gains yesterday as
Chinese developers tumbled amid concern the government is
intensifying efforts to curb property prices, and as data from
the nation indicated slower growth in the world’s second-largest
economy. The benchmark traded at 10.9 times average  estimated
earnings  on yesterday, compared with 14.1 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hang Seng Index futures slid 0.6 percent to 22,319. The  HSI
Volatility Index (VHSI)  increased 0.6 percent to 15.78, indicating
traders expect a swing of 4.5 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
