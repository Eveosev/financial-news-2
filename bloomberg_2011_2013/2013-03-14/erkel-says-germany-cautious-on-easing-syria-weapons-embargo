Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
Germany would proceed “very cautiously” on calls by the U.K.
and  France  to ease a weapons embargo on  Syria  to help opposition
fighters, while expressing openness to such a plan.  Merkel condemned the regime of Syrian President Bashar al- Assad for committing “repeated bloodbaths” in two years of
conflict. She added that European Union states must weigh the
fact that weapons are already entering Syria “from other
countries that take a different view of Assad.”  “For us, this is a very complicated question to consider,
but Germany is ready, if there are other views by other member
states, to discuss this again among the foreign ministers,”
Merkel told reporters yesterday in Brussels during an EU summit.  France and the U.K. have called on the other 25 EU member
states to scrap a European arms embargo on Syria after it
expires at the end of May. French President  Francois Hollande 
said yesterday France will arm the opposition after the embargo
expiration even if other EU countries support extending it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
