Men’s Wearhouse Inc. (MW)  climbed the
most in more than 15 months after saying it hired investment-
banking firm Jefferies & Co. to explore strategic alternatives
for its K&G store chain.  The shares  advanced  19 percent to $34.62 at the close in
 New York , for the biggest jump since Dec. 7, 2011. The Houston-
based retailer of men’s suits and sportswear has advanced 11
percent this year,  while  the Standard & Poor’s Smallcap 600
Index has gained 10 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Doug Ewert is considering options
for K&G, which sells men’s, women’s and children’s apparel,
after the unit’s comparable-store sales fell 5.7 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to a company statement yesterday.
Men’s Wearhouse plans to focus efforts on its MW and Moores
chains selling men’s apparel.  “Sales at K&G were disappointing as customers did not
respond to our promotions and new marketing campaign as well as
expected,” Ewert said in the statement.  The company can offer no assurance it will enter a
transaction involving K&G, according to the statement. The
division operated 97 stores as of Feb. 2, generating 16 percent
of total revenue. Men’s Wearhouse operated at 1,143 total
stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
