Bank of America Corp.  hired Grant
Chamberlain from  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  as head of mergers and
acquisitions for  Australia , according to two people familiar
with the matter.  Chamberlain, based in Sydney, will report to Kevin Skelton,
head of investment banking in Australia, and Stephen Gore, head
of M&A for Asia-Pacific outside of  Japan , the people said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private. He
resigned today as Nomura’s head of mergers and acquisitions in
Australia, the people said.  Chamberlain joined Nomura in June 2010 from Deutsche Bank
AG. He declined to comment on his new appointment when contacted
by telephone today. Michelle Sprod, a Sydney-based spokeswoman
for Nomura, also declined to comment.  The Japanese lender ranked 12th among arrangers of
takeovers involving Australian companies in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank advised on four deals worth
a combined $4 billion, out of a total of $86 billion, the data
show. In 2011, Nomura placed 35th and in 2010 the bank was 33rd.  Nomura’s head of investment banking in Australia, Ian Maxton, said in May 2010 that he planned to vault Nomura to
among the top seven investment banks in the country in three
years, and eventually to the top five. Maxton and Chamberlain
were formerly colleagues at Deutsche Bank.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  also operates under the name Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
