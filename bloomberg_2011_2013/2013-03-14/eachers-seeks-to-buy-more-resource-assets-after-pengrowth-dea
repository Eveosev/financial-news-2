Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan,
 Canada ’s third-biggest retirement fund, is seeking more
investments for its natural-resource unit after closing its
first deal.  Teachers’ said today it closed a C$153.4 million ($150
million) purchase of a 4.9 percent stake in Saskatchewan’s
Weyburn oil asset from  Pengrowth Energy Corp. (PGF) , the first deal
for the Toronto-based pension fund’s Natural Resources Group
since it was set up in January.  “This is the inaugural deal of the group,” Deborah Allan,
a Teachers’ spokeswoman, said today in an interview. “They will
be looking for similar natural-resource based transactions in
Canada and abroad.”  The unit, comprising seven people, wants to buy assets in
areas including agriculture, mining and energy in Canada and
around the world, Allan said. The team is pursuing deals in the
C$50 million to C$250 million range, she said.  “The whole point here is to diversify, to get additional
commodities exposure but diversify that exposure,” Allan said.
“We’re looking at actually owning real assets.”  Teachers’, which has C$117.1 billion of assets as of Dec.
31, 2011, also shifted its timberland holdings into the group.  “We get the cashflow that we as a pension fund crave, we
get the diversification so that we’ve got real assets as well as
the financial exposure, and it gives us a hedge against
inflation,” Allan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
