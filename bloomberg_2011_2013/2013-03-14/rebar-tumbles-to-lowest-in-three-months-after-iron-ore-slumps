Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  declined for a seventh day to the lowest level in three
months after the raw material used in steel making fell.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange retreated as much as 2.4 percent to 3,741  yuan  ($602) a
metric ton, the lowest since Dec. 14, before trading at 3,770
yuan at 10:02 a.m. local time. The price has dropped 12 percent
since touching this year’s high of 4,297 yuan on Feb. 8.  Iron ore  dropped the most yesterday since January to the
lowest level this year amid concern curbs on construction in
 China  will reduce demand for the commodity used to make steel.
Imported ore with 62 percent iron content at the Chinese port of
Tianjin dropped 3.1 percent to $139 a dry ton, the most since
Jan. 16, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  “Lower raw-material prices have weighed on steel
products,” Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said in a
report today. “The market is awash with inventory so we may see
steel prices fall further.”  Sentiment is deteriorating because of concerns about demand
from real estate in China, Oscar Tarneberg, an analyst at The
Steel Index, said by e-mail yesterday. China should be on “high
alert” over inflation after February’s price gains exceeded
forecasts, central bank governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said yesterday.  The  average spot price  for rebar fell for an eighth day
yesterday, declining 0.5 percent to 3,708 yuan, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
