Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the smallest in two weeks amid record low production
of the biofuel for this time of year.  The spread between the additive and the motor fuel
contracted 4.6 cents to 51.33 cents a gallon. The Energy
Information Administration reported yesterday that  output  fell 1
percent in the week ended March 8 to 797,000 barrels a day, or
12.2 billion gallons on an annual basis, the lowest level for
the period in records going back to June 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “The only market hotter than ethanol is the Dow,” said
Mike Blackford, an analyst at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“People look at our production rate and see we’re at a rate of
12.2 billion gallons. We have a mandate for 13.8 billion gallons
and they say, ‘We need to own ethanol.’”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery climbed 4.5 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $2.628 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since Aug. 23. Prices have gained 20
percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery dropped 0.1 cent to
$3.1413 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Blackford said higher corn prices and reduced yields after
drought in the Midwest last year have made it difficult for
ethanol companies to get the grain and increase production.  Corn for March delivery slipped 8.5 cent, or 1.2 percent,
to $7.3275 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. The May contract rose 6.25 cents to $7.165.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
3 cents a gallon, compared to minus 5 cents yesterday. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Under a 2007 law, U.S. refiners are required to use 13.8
billion gallons of renewable fuels such as ethanol this year and
14.4 billion in 2014.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, the
certificates refiners submit to the Environmental Protection
Agency to show compliance with the program, fell 9.2 percent to
78.5 cents for the  conventional corn-based ethanol  grade, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-derived ethanol, dropped 8.6 percent to 80 cents. Both
varieties of the certificates reached records on March 8.  Ethanol Output  Production fell for consecutive weeks for the first time
since Dec. 14. Stockpiles of the biofuel slid a for record sixth
straight week to 18.7 million barrels, the smallest amount since
Nov. 23 and 15 percent below a year earlier, data from the
Energy Department’s analytical arm showed.  Spot ethanol in  Sao Paulo  fetched $2.42 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. didn’t  import  any of the fuel for a second week,
the first time that’s happened since June, EIA data show.
Foreign purchases of ethanol reached a record 122,000 barrels a
day in October.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, down from 94 percent the
previous week, EIA data show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  surged 9 cents
to $2.75 a gallon; in Chicago the additive increased 7 cents to
$2.635; in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel jumped 6.5 cents to $2.69;
and on the West Coast ethanol climbed 4 cents to $2.895 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 2.5
cent to 20.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded to 11.5 cents from 9.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
