Hugo Boss AG (BOSS) , the German luxury-
clothing maker controlled by buyout firm Permira Advisers LLP,
said operating profit will probably rise at a slower pace than
last year as 2013 will be challenging.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items will rise at “high single-digit rate” in
2013, slowing from last year’s 13 percent pace, the Metzingen-
based company said  today . Retail sales will be the “growth
engine” as they grow by more than 10 percent, Chief Executive
Officer Claus-Dietrich Lahrs said in a Bloomberg television
interview with Mark Barton on Countdown.  The maker of men’s suits said it will spend more this year
to expand its own store network after sales from retail exceeded
wholesale for the first time in 2012. Hugo Boss increased the
number of stores it operates itself by 35 percent to 840 last
year, adding outlets in Brussels, Toronto and  Melbourne .  “We recommend taking profits,” Andreas Riemann, an
analyst at Commerzbank AG, wrote in a report today, downgrading
the stock to hold from buy. He cited share price gains and a
boost to December wholesale revenue that formerly would be
recorded in January. “First-quarter 2013 results should not
serve as a positive catalyst for the share.”  2015 Forecast  Hugo Boss shares traded 1.5 percent lower at 89.05 euros as
of 12:32 p.m. in Frankfurt trading after previously dropping as
much as 5.2 percent. The stock is up 12 percent this year and
reached a record 92.36 euros two days ago. Berenberg Bank
expected 2013 Ebitda before special items to rise 10 percent to
584 million euros, while HSBC Holdings Plc forecast it will
increase 13 percent to 597 million euros, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro-area economy will contract for a fourth straight
quarter in the first three months of 2013, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists. The region’s economy shrank the
most in almost four years in the fourth quarter of 2012. Hugo
Boss gets the majority of its revenue from  Europe .  The company maintained its forecasts for revenue of 3
billion euros and Ebitda of 750 million euros in 2015 as it
increases sales in Asia and the U.S. The clothing retailer said
the retail business will represent about 55 percent of revenue
by that year as it opens about 50 stores annually.  The wholesale business will be “approximately stable”
this year, Hugo Boss said.  Dividend Miss  The retailer said yesterday it will increase its dividend 8
percent to 3.12 euros a share for 2012, missing a 3.20 euro
Bloomberg  forecast .  Hugo Boss reported fourth-quarter operating profit and
sales that topped analysts’ estimates last month. Sales rose 24
percent in Europe in the fourth quarter while revenue from the
Americas gained 18 percent, Hugo Boss said today.  Net debt fell to 130 million euros at the end of 2012 from
149 million euros the year before, Hugo Boss said.  Permira, based in  London , acquired a majority holding in
Valentino Fashion Group SpA in 2007. Valentino was Hugo Boss’s
parent company at the time. Permira owns a stake of about 66
percent in Hugo Boss, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The stock price has more than doubled since the end of 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
