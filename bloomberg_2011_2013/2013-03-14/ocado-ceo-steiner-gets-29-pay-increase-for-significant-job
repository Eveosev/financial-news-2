  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , a British
internet-only grocer, gave Chief Executive Officer Tim Steiner a
29 percent raise for the current year because of his
“significant individual performance.”  Steiner will get 450,000 pounds ($676,000) and is the only
 executive director  to receive a base pay increase, as the
company experienced trading difficulties last year, Ocado said
in its annual report for 2012 published today. The company
extended key credit lines, as well as sold new shares to
guarantee its survival last year.  The appointment of former  Marks & Spencer Plc (MKS)  boss  Stuart Rose  as chairman designate and faster sales have eased those
concerns and the company’s shares surged as much as 29 percent
today on confirmation it’s negotiating to help  WM Morrison
Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  start an online business.  Rose will be paid a base salary of 40,000 pounds per annum
from his appointment date of March 11 to May 10, when Ocado
expects his appointment to be endorsed by shareholders at the
annual general meeting. After that, Rose will be paid 200,000
pounds a year.  He has also been awarded 400,000 pounds worth of shares
once he takes up his role as chairman as part of a co-investment
plan which requires him to invest one year’s fees on
appointment.  He will pay the nominal value for the Matching Shares of
£9,046 and these shares will not vest until three years after he
starts as Chairman.  The bonus payment ceiling has been raised to 125 percent of
base salary from 100 percent for Steiner and to 100 percent of
base salary from 80 percent for executive directors. The
executives will have to “significantly outperform” their sales
and earnings growth this year to receive the maximum payout,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
