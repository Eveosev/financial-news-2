Opposition Labour Party leader  Ed Miliband  will pledge the creation of a network of U.K. regional
banks to lend to businesses if his party wins power in 2015.  Speaking at the  British Chambers of Commerce  annual
conference in  London  at 11.30 a.m. today, Miliband will propose
that new institutions be set up that only operate within a
defined area. They would focus on lending to businesses.  “We need a regional banking system, serving each and every
region of the country,” Miliband will say, according to his
office. “Not banks that like to say ‘no,’ but banks that know
your region and your business.”  Business groups including the BCC complain that a lack of
lending to small companies as banks avoid risk and rebuild their
balance sheets is holding back growth. Business Secretary  Vince Cable , due to speak at the conference after 1 p.m., is setting
up a government-backed business bank to try to increase the
availability of funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
