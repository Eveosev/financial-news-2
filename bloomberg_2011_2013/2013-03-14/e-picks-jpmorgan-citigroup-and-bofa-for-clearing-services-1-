The London Metal Exchange, the
world’s biggest metals marketplace, selected  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to provide
services related to its clearing system.  JPMorgan will be the custodian for gold used by exchange
members as collateral to back trades through its clearinghouse,
the LME said today in an e-mailed statement. Citigroup will act
as custodian for fixed-income collateral and “facilitate” LME
Clear’s secure payment system, while Bank of America Merrill
Lynch will provide treasury execution services.  Clearinghouses, which stand between buyers and sellers to
reduce the risk of default, have become more valuable as
regulators seek to increase central clearing of derivatives. The
LME, which handled $14.5 trillion worth of contracts last year,
is building its own system to replace LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd.,
the exchange’s current provider of clearing services.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which bought the LME
last year for 1.39 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), is helping to
build the clearinghouse. LME Clear is set to go live in 2014,
according to today’s statement. The London exchange lists
contracts for industrial metals from aluminum to tin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
