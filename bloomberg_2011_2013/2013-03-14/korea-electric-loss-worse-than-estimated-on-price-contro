Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , the
nation’s monopoly distributor, posted a fourth-quarter loss more
than three times analysts’ estimates as state price controls
barred it from passing on rising fuel costs to users.  Net loss was 1.7 trillion won ($1.5 billion) in the three
months ended Dec. 31, compared with the 1.9 trillion won loss a
year earlier, according to figures derived from full-year
results announced by the Seoul-based company today in a
regulatory filing. The mean of 15 analyst estimates  compiled  by
Bloomberg was a loss of 500.1 billion won. Sales were little
changed at 11.78 trillion won.  Kepco bought more power from plants fired by pricier fuel
after the closing of two reactors for unscheduled replacement of
components. The company raised electricity prices by an average
4 percent in January, the second increase in five months, as the
government sought to curb rising demand.  “Under the current structure, it’s inevitable for the
utility to lose money, but the quarterly loss was bigger than
expected,” said Bum Sujin, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co.
in  Seoul . “The January state approval of the tariff increase
will help the company turn to a profit this year.”  The shares rose 3.3 percent to 33,200 won today. They have
gained 9 percent this year, compared with a 0.3 percent advance
in the benchmark Kospi stock index.  Operating Loss  Operating loss, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, was 733.8 billion won in the fourth
quarter, compared with the mean estimate of 376.8 billion won in
a survey of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The cost of buying power from generators using oil and
other pricier fuels was 155.70 won a kilowatt hour, compared
with 40.9 won from nuclear and coal-fueled generators, according
to a Jan. 29 statement from its website. The utility increased
purchases from generators using oil and costlier fuel sources to
31 percent of its total purchase in the fourth quarter from 26
percent a year earlier.  Full-year loss narrowed to 3.08 trillion won from 3.29
trillion won in 2011 when operating loss shrank 20 percent to
817.9 billion won, according to the filing today. Sales rose 14
percent to 49.4 trillion won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
