Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  pushed back the
release of its Infinity video-game system by two months,
postponing a potential source of profit at its interactive unit.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, unveiled
the Infinity platform in January, saying it would reduce costs
and boost earnings at the unit. The platform, which incorporates
characters from multiple Disney films in the same game, was to
hit store shelves in June.  “We have moved the launch date for Disney Infinity to
August 18 to capitalize on the critical fall retail season,”
John Pleasants, co-president of Disney Interactive, said in a
statement yesterday.  The interactive unit makes video games and designs websites
based on Disney content. In the quarter ended Dec. 29, it posted
its first profit since Disney began breaking out results in
2009. Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Burbank, California-based company, has pledged the division will
be profitable this year.  The delay in the release of the Infinity system will
“definitely impact our goal of achieving profitability for the
year” at the unit, Pleasants said, according to an earlier  New
York  Times report, citing an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
