Rubber declined for a third day to
the lowest level in three months after exports surged from
 Malaysia , the third-largest producer, and the Japanese currency
strengthened, reducing the appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in August on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell 1.1 percent to end at 277.6 yen a kilogram ($2,880
a metric ton), the lowest settlement since Dec. 14. Futures have
lost 8.7 percent in the past three days.  Rubber exports from Malaysia jumped 21 percent to 68,300
tons in January from a year earlier, while production gained 3.3
percent to 87,960 tons, according to the statistics department.
Inventory surged 23 percent to 188,100 tons, it said. The yen
traded at 95.75 from 96.13 yesterday. The lower house of  Japan ’s
parliament will vote today on central bank leadership nominees.  “Production is greater than demand, raising inventories,”
said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker  Yutaka Shoji Co. (8747) 
“This puts pressure on the rubber market.”  Inventories in  China , the largest user, jumped to 107,481
tons, the highest level in three years, based on a survey of
nine warehouses in  Shanghai , Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and
Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said March 8. Stockpiles
in Japanese warehouses rose 3.8 percent to 11,363 tons on Feb.
28, the Rubber Trade Association of Japan said March 11.  Strengthening Japanese currency also cut an appeal of the
yen-denominated currency, while a slowdown in China car sales
raised concerns demand may weaken, Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst
at DS Futures Co., said by phone from Bangkok.  The yen gained versus most major peers as an adviser to
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signaled a need to control
inflation and as technical indicators suggested the currency’s
decline has been too rapid.  China’s passenger car sales in February dropped 8.3 percent
on year to 1.11 million units, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said March 11. Truck sales tumbled 28
percent on year to 177,400 unit, the group said.  The contract for September delivery declined 0.2 percent to
close at 22,785  yuan  ($3,665) a ton in Shanghai. Thai rubber
free-on-board lost 2.3 percent to 86.30 baht ($2.91) a kilogram
today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
