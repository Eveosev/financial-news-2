Home repossessions in the U.S.
plunged 29 percent last month from a year earlier to the lowest
level since 2007 amid increased efforts by state lawmakers and
courts to delay property seizures, according to RealtyTrac.  Banks took 45,038 properties from delinquent borrowers in
February, an 11 percent decrease from the previous month and the
fewest since September 2007, the  Irvine , California-based data
provider said today in a report. Forty-one states had drops in
completed foreclosures from February 2012, led by declines of 78
percent in  Oregon  and 69 percent in  Massachusetts .  “The U.S. foreclosure inferno has been effectively
contained and should be reduced to a slow burn in the next two
years,”  Daren Blomquist , vice president at RealtyTrac, said in
the report. “But dangerous foreclosure flare-ups are still
popping up in states where foreclosures have been delayed by a
lengthy court process or by new legislation making it more
difficult to foreclose outside of the court system.”  Refinancing programs for borrowers who owe more than their
homes are worth are helping cut foreclosures as companies add
workers and  mortgage rates  remain low. Residential values rose
6.8 percent in December from a year earlier, the biggest gain
since 2006, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan was 3.52 percent as of
March 7, close to the lowest level on record, according to
 Freddie Mac .  About 1.1 million property owners last year received new
terms through the government’s Home Affordable Refinance
Program, double the number in 2011 and more than the Washington-
based  Federal Housing Finance Agency  estimated, according to a
March 13 report. Borrowers in the hardest-hit states sought
relief, with 68 percent of Nevada refinances and 58 percent in
 Florida  going through HARP, the FHFA said.  California Law  Total filings have fallen for 29 straight months on an
annual basis, and home seizures have dropped for 27 of the past
28 months, following a coordinated legal probe by U.S. states
into faulty mortgage processing, according to RealtyTrac. A $25
billion settlement with the five largest banks was announced in
February 2012.  In  California , a new law that prohibits lenders from
pursuing foreclosure while a borrower seeks modified loan terms,
last month pushed the state down to 13th for foreclosure filings
per household, the first time since 2006 California wasn’t in
the top 10, RealtyTrac said.  The delaying effects of legislation in California and other
states was evident in the prevalence of repossessions of homes
with “well-aged, bad loans” originated from 2005 to 2007,
which represent 65 percent of all mortgages in the foreclosure
process nationwide, Blomquist said in an interview.  Total Filings  Total foreclosure filings, including default and auction
notices, fell to 154,281 last month, down 25 percent from a year
earlier and 2.3 percent from January, RealtyTrac said. One in
849 U.S. households got at least one filing last month.  The biggest increases included a 123 percent jump in total
filings from a year earlier in  Washington , which had the
nation’s fifth-highest foreclosure rate at one in 656
households, and a 319 percent jump in default notices in
 Maryland , which had the ninth-highest rate at one in 720.  Among metropolitan areas, Baltimore filings rose 145
percent, the biggest gain, followed by Seattle, which climbed
129 percent, and  New York , with a 44 percent increase, according
to RealtyTrac.  “When we dig down into local markets, there’s still a
foreclosure problem that needs to be dealt with,” Blomquist
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
