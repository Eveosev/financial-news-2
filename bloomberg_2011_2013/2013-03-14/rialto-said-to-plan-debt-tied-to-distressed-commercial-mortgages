UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  are
marketing $218 million of bonds tied to commercial mortgages,
some of which are in default.  The offering on behalf of Rialto Capital Management LLC is
linked to a mix of assets acquired from 2010 to 2012, according
to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t public.  Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities are climbing
as buyers seek alternatives to yields on government debt
hovering at almost record lows. The demand is helping Wall
Street banks create structures that enable real-estate investors
to fund riskier holdings such as partially leased properties and
foreclosed buildings in the $550 billion CMBS market.  With the  Federal Reserve  holding interest rates at about
zero into a fifth year, issuance in the market is set to rise by
50 percent to $70 billion this year, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG.  Rialto, a unit of Miami-based homebuilder  Lennar Corp. (LEN) ,
issued similar debt in April, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The deal has since paid off, 11 months ahead of its
projections, according to deal documents.  The new offering is linked to properties across the U.S.,
with Florida accounting for 17.6 percent, the documents show.
The transaction is tied to 1,472 loans and properties, according
to the documents.  The securities will be rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB- by Kroll Bond Rating Agency, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
