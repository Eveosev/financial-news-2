F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM) , which
runs the U.K.’s oldest investment trust, said assets under
management declined 4.9 percent last year as clients including
Friends Life pulled money from its funds.  Funds under management declined to 95.2 billion pounds
($142 billion) from 100.1 billion pounds in 2011, the London-
based firm said today in a statement. Net outflows of 13.3
billion pounds and foreign-exchange rate movements offset a 10.1
billion-pound gain in assets prices, it said.  Edward Bramson , F&C’s chairman and largest shareholder
through his hedge fund Sherborne Investors LLC, aims to boost
performance of the  fund manager  by cutting costs, reducing debt
and refocusing on traditional strengths such as  investment
trusts  and managing fixed-income assets for insurers. Thames
River, the hedge fund unit acquired by F&C before Bramson took
charge, had “significant outflows” in 2012, the firm said.  Withdrawals from major clients such as  Resolution Ltd. (RSL) ’s
Friends Life in the U.K. were 5.3 billion pounds in the period,
F&C said. Friends Life may withdraw a further 6.2 billion pounds
in the first half after setting up its own fixed-income fund
division, according to the statement.  Cost cuts helped boost underlying profit to 71.2 million
pounds in 2012 from 65.2 million pounds a year earlier, F&C
said. The lower assets under management caused net revenue to
fall 9 percent to 243.5 million pounds.  F&C will pay a full-year dividend of 3 pence a share for
2012, unchanged from the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
