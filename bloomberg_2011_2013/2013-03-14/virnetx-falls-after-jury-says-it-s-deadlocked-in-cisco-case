VirnetX Holding Corp. (VHC)  fell as much
as 27 percent after a federal jury in Tyler, Texas, said it was
struggling to reach a unanimous verdict in its patent-
infringement case against  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)   After the jury told the judge it was deadlocked, U.S.
District Judge Leonard Davis told jurors to continue
deliberating. VirnetX was down $5.83, or 16 percent, to $29.84
in  New York  trading at 3:07 p.m. Earlier, it tumbled as low as
$26.02 for its biggest drop since August.  VirnetX contends Cisco infringes four patents for virtual
private networks, through which a website owner can securely
interact with a customer or an employee can work at home and
have protected access to a company’s electronic files. It’s
seeking $258 million from San Jose, California-based Cisco.  Cisco, the world’s biggest maker of computer-networking
equipment, denies infringing the patents and contends they are
invalid. Cisco rose less than 1 cent to $21.58.  VirnetX won a $368.2 million verdict against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in
November over the same technology, including two of the same
patents, before a different Tyler jury. In 2010, Zephyr Cove,
Nevada-based VirnetX reached a $200 million settlement with
Microsoft Corp. over the same inventions.  The case is VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems Inc., 10cv417,
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Tyler).  To contact the reporter on this story:
