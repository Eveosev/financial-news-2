The switching of three members in
Australia’s benchmark credit-default swap index as it shifts to
a new series is set to push the gauge up, according to Westpac
Banking Corp.  Contracts on the debt of  Goodman Group (GMG) ,  SP AusNet (SPN)  and
 Asciano Ltd. (AIO)  will be added to the new series of the 25-member
Markit iTraxx Australia index, according to a  statement  on the
website of Markit, which compiles the gauge. Contracts on  Crown
Ltd. (CWN) ,  AMP Ltd. (AMP)  and Jemena Ltd. will be dropped.  “The change in composition of the Australian iTraxx is
likely to lead to a 5-to-10 basis point widening in the index,
while the change to duration will add a further 10 or 11 basis
points,” said Chris Walter, a credit research analyst at
Westpac in Sydney. “Changes to the make-up of the index were
driven by an effort to increase credit-default swap liquidity.”  New series of the default swap benchmarks are created every
six months when companies are added or dropped depending on
their ratings, cost of protection and ease of trading. The
maturity date of the new indexes is June 2018, compared with
December 2017 on the previous version.  Series 19  of the Australian index will start trading on
March 20, according to Markit.  The gauge closed at 105.3 basis points on March 12, the
lowest level since May 2011, according to CMA prices. It rose to
105.4 basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
