Spain ’s borrowing costs fell at an
extraordinary auction as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy
retains investors’ confidence amid market turmoil in Italy.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 803 million euros ($1.04
billion) of bonds maturing in 2029 to yield 5.224 percent, down
from 5.787 percent on Feb. 7, 2040 bonds at a yield of 5.434
percent, down from 5.893 percent on Dec. 13, and 2041 bonds at
5.432 percent, down from 5.696 percent on Jan. 17. No target was
set for today’s sale, which was limited to primary dealers.  Spain announced the unscheduled auction earlier this week
as the yield on its  10-year benchmark bonds  fell to the lowest
since November 2010. The nation’s bonds yesterday completed
their longest winning streak since August 2005, while  Italy ’s
borrowing costs climbed at an auction amid concern a political
deadlock may derail plans to fix the country’s finances.  “The fact the Treasury went for a public auction suggests
they expected more demand for the bonds than the buyers they had
already identified,” Justin Knight, a London-based rates
strategist at UBS AG, said by telephone. “There seems to be
interest from investors looking to cover long-term liabilities
with some extra yield, such as pension funds or insurance
companies.”  Demand Climbs  Demand for the 2029 security was 4.1 times the amount sold,
up from 2.02 last month. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.4 for the
2040 bonds, up from 2.09 in December and 2.13 for the 2041
bonds, up from 2 in January.  Investor confidence has rebounded in Spain even as it wanes
in Italy after most voters backed the anti-austerity platforms
of former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and comedian Beppe Grillo. The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  rose two
basis points to 4.84 percent at 11:09 a.m. in Madrid.  That’s nearly three percentage points less than the euro-
era record of 7.75 percent reached in July, before European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to support the
single currency. The spread with similar German maturities
widened to 335 basis points.  While the European Commission predicts Spain’s gross
domestic product will shrink 1.4 percent this year, Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  forecasts an  economic recovery  in the
second half after reducing the  budget deficit  to 6.7 percent of
growth domestic product in 2012, excluding European aid to
banks.  The Treasury, which said March 12 it had covered 30 percent
of its planned mid- and long-term debt issuance for 2013,
returns to the markets twice this month, to sell three- and
nine-month bills on March 19 and bonds on March 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
