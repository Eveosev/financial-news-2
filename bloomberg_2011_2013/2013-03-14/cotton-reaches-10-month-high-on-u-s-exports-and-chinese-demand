Cotton rose to a 10-month high in
 New York  on stronger U.S. exports stoked by Chinese demand and
on speculation planting may decline as the fiber competes with
corn and soybeans for acreage.  U.S. exports of upland cotton since the start of August
reached 6.77 million bales as of March 7, up from 5.59 million
bales a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
reported today. Weekly net sales of upland cotton were 187,561
bales, up from 150,083 bales in the week through Feb. 28, USDA
data show.  “While prices have increased on expectation that U.S.
acreage in 2013-14 will go down, U.S. export numbers have been
bullish too,” analysts at Mumbai-based Kotak Commodity Services
Ltd. wrote in a report today. “The nearby scenario will
continue to be supported by  China  buying.”  Cotton for delivery in May jumped 1.7 percent to $0.9012 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York at 9:37 a.m. local time.
Prices reached $0.9039, the highest since April 30, and are up
20 percent this year.  The U.S. last week cut its outlook for global cotton
supplies at the end of July on expanding demand in China,  India 
and  Bangladesh . Ending stocks were projected at 81.74 million
bales, down from a February estimate of 81.86 million.  China is the world’s biggest cotton grower and consumer.
The Asian country may use 36 million bales in the current crop
year, according to the USDA, compared with projected consumption
of 35.5 million bales in February.  The global cotton area may decline 8.7 percent to 31.3
million hectares (77.3 million acres) in the 2013-14 season as
farmers switch to more profitable oilseeds and grains,
researcher Oil World wrote in a report this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
