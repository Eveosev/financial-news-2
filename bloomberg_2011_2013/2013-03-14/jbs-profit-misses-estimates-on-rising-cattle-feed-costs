JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’  estimates 
after rising soybean, corn and cattle prices boosted costs.  Net income fell to 66.4 million reais ($33.7 million), or 2
centavos a share, from 367 million reais, or 13 centavos, in the
previous quarter, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a
regulatory filing yesterday. That compares with a 268.7 million-
real average of seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit margins at JBS’s U.S. unit narrowed after the cost
of feeding its poultry and hogs climbed, as well as prices for
cattle it buys from feedlots, amid the country’s worst drought
in more than 70 years. The unit  accounts  for 76 percent of
sales.  The earnings report showed a “challenging operating
environment at JBS USA Beef, where the cattle herd continues to
dwindle to an all-time loss and cattle prices trend higher,”
Alexander Robarts, a New York-based Citibank Inc. equity analyst
who rates the stock neutral, wrote in a report after earnings
were released.  Average corn prices in  Chicago  rose 18 percent in the
quarter from a year earlier and average soybean prices jumped 26
percent. Cattle futures rose to record levels.  JBS’s Brazilian beef unit benefited from a 3 percent drop
in domestic cattle prices in the quarter and a weakening local
currency that favored exports. The Brazilian real declined 1.2
percent against the  U.S. dollar  in the quarter.  Sales climbed 13 percent from the previous quarter and 29
percent from a year earlier to 21.9 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
