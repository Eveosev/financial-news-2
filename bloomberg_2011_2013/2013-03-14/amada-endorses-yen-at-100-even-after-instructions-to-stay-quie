An adviser to Japanese prime
Minister Shinzo Abe endorsed a yen level of 98 to 100 per dollar
even as he said he was scolded by the government for similar
remarks that risked friction with Group of 20 nations.  “A level of 98 or 100 would be good,” Koichi Hamada, 77,
a retired Yale University professor, told reporters today in
 Tokyo . He earlier told ruling party lawmakers that Economy
Minister Akira Amari  “asked me not to anger the G-20.”  Japan  is seeking to limit tension with other leading
economies that last month pledged to refrain from targeting
exchange rates for competitive purposes. The yen has fallen more
than 16 percent in four months as Abe presses for more
aggressive easing under a new  Bank of Japan (8301)  leadership, with
parliament voting today and tomorrow on his nominations.  The currency was at 95.78 per dollar at 11:20 a.m. in Tokyo
after touching a three-and-half-year low earlier this week.  G-20 finance chiefs signaled in February that Japan has
scope to keep stimulating its economy as long as policy makers
cease publicly advocating a sliding yen that’s helping exporters
from Toyota Motor Corp. to  Panasonic Corp. (6752)   South Korea ’s outgoing Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said
in January that his nation’s exporters may be “at risk” from
Japanese policies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
