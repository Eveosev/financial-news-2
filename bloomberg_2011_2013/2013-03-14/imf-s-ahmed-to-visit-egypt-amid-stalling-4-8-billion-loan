An International Monetary Fund
official will visit  Egypt  on March 17 to meet with authorities
amid political unrest that has stalled a $4.8 billion loan, a
fund spokesman said.  Masood Ahmed, the director of the IMF Middle East and
Central Asia Department, will be in Cairo to “discuss with the
authorities their economic program and next steps in the IMF’s
engagement with Egypt,” spokesman  William Murray  said at a
press conference in Washington today.  “The IMF remains fully committed to supporting Egypt at
this critical time through a homegrown program that addresses
the country’s economic and financial challenges and lays the
foundations for a durable and socially inclusive recovery of the
economy,” he said.  Separately, Murray said that IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  will attend a meeting of finance ministers of
the euro region tomorrow focusing on a potential bailout for
Cyprus. The IMF seeks a durable solution for the country’s
banking-sector issues that also addresses debt sustainability,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
