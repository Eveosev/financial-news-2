Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  directors won
dismissal of a shareholder lawsuit alleging they failed to
engage in a “substantive dialogue” with  Coty Inc. (COTY)  on a $10
billion takeover offer.  New York Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten granted a
request to dismiss claims by five shareholders that the 12
directors breached their fiduciary duty by not entering into
discussions with Coty. Bransten barred the shareholders from
refiling their claims.  “The board offered reasons for rejecting Coty’s earlier
offers and sought legal and financial advice to vet Coty’s final
proposal, demonstrating that the board could have been making a
business judgment,” Bransten said in her March 13 decision.  Raymond Bragar, a lawyer for the shareholders, said
yesterday that he hadn’t read the ruling and couldn’t comment on
it.  The case is Feinman v. Avon Products Inc., 651087/2012,  New
York  State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
