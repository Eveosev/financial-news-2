Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K. oil
explorer active in Asia, said that profit margins will rise
along with production this year.  The London-based company said that operating cash flow per
barrel of output climbed to $40.22 last year compared with
$28.56 in 2011. Profit before tax plunged to $10.8 million from
$112.6 million a year earlier after the company sold older, less
profitable producing assets.  “Our cash margins will grow again,” Chief Executive
Officer James Menzies said in a telephone interview. “We also
see a rise in production, so cash generation is growing
considerably.”  Salamander is focusing on three fields in Thailand and
Indonesia as it bolsters production and steps up exploration.
The company reduced debt and raised cash in a share sale last
year to fund its program.  The company said production will rise to between 12,500 and
15,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day from 10,800 barrels in
2012. The shares rose 2.5 percent to 204.3 pence in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
