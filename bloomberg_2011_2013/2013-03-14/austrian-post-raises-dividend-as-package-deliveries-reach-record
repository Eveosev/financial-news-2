Oesterreichische Post AG (POST) , the
former monopoly still majority-owned by the Austrian state, said
it will raise its dividend by 5.9 percent after package
deliveries in the Alpine republic climbed to a record high.  The management will propose a dividend of 1.80 euros
($2.33) a share, the Vienna-based company said in a statement
today. Package deliveries in  Austria  rose to 65 million from 59
million a year earlier, which helped offset declining profits in
its mail division, the company said.  “There are two megatrends that affect our business,”
Chief Executive Officer Georg Poelzl said at a press conference.
“One is the decline in mail volume because of electronic
substitution.” The other is that online shopping and
international trade is boosting package deliveries, he said.  The company is targeting a yearly revenue growth of 1 to 2
percent in the mid-term after sales rose 0.7 percent to 2.37
billion euros in 2012. It bought or raised stakes in companies
in Romania, Poland and  Bulgaria  last year to expand its business
outside of Austria.  Austrian Post will stop investing in its Hungarian unit
because of “protectionist” actions by local authorities,
Poelzl said. The Hungarian unit accounts for less than 1 percent
of the company’s total revenue, he said.  The company’s shares  fell  as much as 1.7 percent and traded
1.4 percent lower at 31.60 euros at 12:40 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
