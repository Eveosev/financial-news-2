Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
largest automaker, may build Leaf electric vehicles in the
southern Chinese province of Guangdong, according to a
government statement.  Nissan’s Chinese joint venture with  Dongfeng Motor Group
Co. (489)  may invest 2 billion  yuan  ($322 million) on the project, the
National Development and Reform Commission’s Guangdong branch
said on its  website . According to the statement, the plan calls
for initial capacity of 10,000 Leaf units a year and 50,000
after 2015 -- comparable to Nissan’s U.K. and Japan plants.  Sharon Shen, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Nissan, said
the company plans to build the Venucia e30 -- not the Leaf -- in
China and declined to comment further. The Venucia e30 and the
Leaf share similar exteriors.  China, lagging behind its target to sell 5 million electric
vehicles by 2020, is reviewing its subsidy policy and may
increase funding for hybrid vehicles and other fuel-efficient
models, according to Industry Minister Miao Wei. Only locally
produced EVs qualified for central government subsidies of as
much as 60,000 yuan, excluding local incentives, under a three-
year trial program that expired at the end of last year.  Nissan Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn , who forecast
that electric vehicles would account for at least 10 percent of
global auto sales by 2020, has struggled to attract consumers,
with U.S. Leaf sales last year not even reaching half the number
the company had previously targeted. The automaker said this
week it’s putting its EV business under the direct supervision
of the chief operating officer.  Major Projects  Leaf production in Guangdong is among major new-energy
vehicle projects listed in a 2013-2020 plan released by the
provincial government. The province, bordering Hong Kong, is
also home to  BYD Co. (1211) , maker of the e6 electric car in which one
of  Warren Buffett ’s holding companies owns a stake.  The  Guangdong province  aims to build its annual production
capacity for alternative-energy vehicles to more than 200,000
units a year by 2015 and boost sales to 50,000 units by then,
according to the statement. Total sales of such vehicles in the
province were about 7,000 units in 2011, the local government
said.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet Volt and  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) ’s plug-in Prius outsold Nissan’s Leaf globally for the
first time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  Dongfeng, earlier down as much as 2.4 percent in Hong Kong
trading, rose 0.2 percent to HK$10.76 at yesterday’s close.  Related News and Information:
