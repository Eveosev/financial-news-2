Puerto Rico  scored three runs in
the eighth inning to defeat Italy 4-3 in a World Baseball
Classic second-round game last night in Miami, eliminating Italy
from the 16-team international tournament.  The U.S. team faces the  Dominican Republic  in a second-
round contest today at Miami. Japan and the Netherlands already
have advanced to the semifinals in San Francisco.  Alex Rios tallied the decisive run for Puerto Rico, scoring
from second base on an infield single. Italy hurt itself with
three errors in the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
