Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s biggest oil
company, increased its average annual production growth target
to more than 4 percent through 2016 after discovering fields.  “Exceptional exploration successes” allowed Eni to raise
its target from a previous production growth target of more than
 3 percent, the Rome-based company said today in a statement.
Eni estimated more than 3 percent annual growth after 2016.  Eni said discoveries and developments in Russia, the
 Barents Sea , Kazakhstan, Venezuela, the  Far East  and sub-Saharan
Africa helped it boost targets. New projects will add more than
700,000 barrels of oil equivalent of production by 2016, the
company said, presenting strategy to investors.  The company will also use about 20 billion euros ($26
billion) a year in cash flow from production and more than 10
billion euros from disposals, including the sale of stakes in
Galp SGPS SA and  Snam SpA (SRG) , to fund 56.8 billion euros of
investments through 2016. That’s 1.6 billion euros more than
forecast in the last strategic plan.  Eni said today it will get $4.2 billion from the sale of a
stake in its Mozambique assets to China National Petroleum Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
