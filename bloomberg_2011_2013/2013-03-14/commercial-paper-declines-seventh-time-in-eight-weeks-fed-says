The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted for the seventh time in eight
weeks, led by a fall in issuance from nonfinancial firms.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
decreased $2.6 billion to $1.018 trillion outstanding in the
week ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its
website. That’s the lowest level since the market touched $997.9
billion in the period ended Nov. 21.  Companies are issuing more corporate bonds to lock in
longer-term, stable funding with yields at almost record lows,
in preference to shorter-term financing via commercial paper,
which has to be rolled over more often.  “Commercial paper issuance from nonfinancial companies is
declining in part because of efforts by these companies to
extend the maturities on their debts,”  Tony Crescenzi , a
portfolio manager and strategist at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach, California, said in an e-mail.
“This terming out is part of a longer-term effort to reduce
dependencies upon short-term liquidity sources that during the
financial crisis were abruptly shut off.”  IOUs issued by nonfinancial companies  dropped  $4.8 billion
to $212.3 billion, the least since $209.3 billion for the period
ended Jan. 2, the Fed said.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
