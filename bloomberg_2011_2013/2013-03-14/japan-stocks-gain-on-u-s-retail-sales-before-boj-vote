Japan’s  Nikkei 255 Stock Average (NKY) ,
the best performing developed-market benchmark gauge this year,
advanced after the lower house endorsed Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s nominees for the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s leadership.  Mitsubishi Estate Co. led developers higher on bets
Haruhiko Kuroda, who today moved one step closer to becoming the
next BOJ governor, will add to monetary stimulus.  Kubota Corp. (6326) ,
the farm-tractor maker seeking an overseas purchase of as much
as $2 billion, gained 2.7 percent after saying sales will
increase to a record next fiscal year.  Nikon Corp. (7731)  rose 4.2
percent as Ji-Asia Research Ltd. advised buying shares in the
world’s No. 2 camera maker.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 percent to close at 12,381.19 in
Tokyo, the highest since Sept. 9, 2008, extending this year’s
gain to 19 percent. The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  climbed 0.7 percent
to 1,038.17, with about two  stocks  rose for each that fell.  “Investors are holding onto hopes that once Kuroda takes
office next week, he may start bold monetary easing even before
the next policy meeting in April,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund
manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about 15
trillion yen ($156 billion). “Stocks sensitive to the bank’s
policy are going strong, especially real estate shares.”  The lower house of parliament, which is dominated by the
ruling coalition, today approved Kuroda for governor and Kikuo
Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso for deputy governor posts. The nominees
face a vote tomorrow in the upper house, where Abe’s  Liberal
Democratic Party  lacks a majority.  Record Buying  Foreign investors bought a net 1.02 trillion yen worth of
Japanese shares in the week ended March 8, according to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. That’s the most since the bourse started
gathering data in 1982. Overseas money managers bought more than
$40 billion during the rally’s first 16 weeks.  The Topix has rallied 44 percent from Nov. 14, when a
general election was announced, fueling optimism a new
government will do more to beat deflation. The Topix is trading
at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Real estate shares  advanced the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups. Mitsubishi Estate,  Japan ’s biggest developer,
gained 5 percent and Mitsui Fudosan Co., the second largest,
climbed 5.3 percent to 2,773 yen.  Kubota added 2.7 percent to 1,258 yen, the highest close
since Feb. 26, 2007, after President Yasuo Masumoto said a
weaker yen will push sales to a record 1.4 trillion yen next
fiscal year, 13 percent more than the mean of analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikon Rises  Nikon rose 4.2 percent to 2,206 yen as its rating was
raised to buy at Ji-Asia Research Ltd. The shares plunged 20
percent through yesterday from Feb. 6, when the camera maker
said price declines will probably continue this quarter amid
slower demand in Europe and  China .  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  were little changed today. The index
rose 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday, when Commerce Department
figures showed a 1.1 percent advance in retail sales in
February, more than forecast.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  rose 1.4 percent to 586 yen. Japan’s
biggest brokerage by market value is cutting staff at a business
that allows foreigners to invest in  Saudi Arabia ’s equities
market, a person familiar with the matter said.  Among stocks that fell, Japan Tobacco Inc. slid 2.3 percent
to 3,130 yen, retreating from a five-year high. The cigarette
maker yesterday rose the most in two years after its weighting
was raised in MSCI indexes following a stake sale by the
government, Societe Generale analysts led by John Carson wrote
in a report.  Seiko Epson Corp. sank 4.2 percent to 952 yen in  Tokyo 
after the printer maker cut its year-end dividend forecast.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 3.4 percent
to 23.85 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.8
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading
volume on the Nikkei 225 was 36 percent above the 30-day
average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
