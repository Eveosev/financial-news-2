California  raised yields on some
longer maturities and completed its $2.1 billion general-
obligation sale, the state’s first debt offer since it got an
upgrade from Standard & Poor’s in January.  California sale came in the worst week for state and local
debt this year. Yields on benchmark 10-year munis have risen
0.23 percentage point this week to 2.06 percent, close to the
highest since April,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. Bonds are
losing appeal as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  has set a
record high amid signs of a strengthening U.S. economy.  In California’s sale, 10-year bonds were offered at a yield
of 2.56 percent, up from 2.54 percent yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on longer maturities rose
even more. Twenty-year securities were offered with a 3.57
percent yield, up from 3.39 percent.  “All factors considered, including investor sentiment that
has become less accommodating to issuers in the last couple of
weeks, we’re very pleased with the results,” said  Tom Dresslar ,
a spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  “We came into a tough
market with a large amount of new supply and obtained a good
result for taxpayers.”  Individual investors ordered $795.4 million of the $888.9
million in tax-exempt debt made available to them. Those orders
accounted for 37 percent of the total $2.1 billion. The state
will use $1.1 billion of the proceeds to refinance existing debt
and lower borrowing costs.  Investors’ Thirst  The yield offered on the 10-year segment is about 0.48
percentage point above a Bloomberg Valuation  index  of AAA munis
and about 0.77 percentage point on the 20-year bonds.  The most-populous U.S. state earned its first upgrade from
S&P since 2006 after Governor  Jerry Brown  curbed pension costs,
won voter support for a tax boost and proposed a budget for next
fiscal year that projects a surplus. New York-based S&P raised
California to A, its sixth-highest rank, lifting it out of a tie
with  Illinois  as the lowest-rated state.  Lockyer also sold $100 million of taxable bonds yesterday
maturing in 2015 to yield 0.64 percent, or 38 basis points more
than Treasuries; and $264 million of three-year taxable
securities priced to yield 0.93 percent, a spread of 53 basis
points, Dresslar said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Separately, Lockyer remarketed $228 million of taxable
 Build America (BAB)  Bonds. The Build America program, which expired in
2010, gave states and cities a federal subsidy on interest as
part of an economic stimulus plan. California and its local
governments sold more than $39 billion of the debt.  The relative borrowing cost for issuers in the state has
been cut in half since Brown, a 74-year-old Democrat, took
office in 2011.  The extra yield over top-rated municipal bonds that
investors demand to own 10-year debt of the state and its
localities climbed  0.57 percentage point  today. It was as low as
52 basis points March 11, the narrowest since November 2008,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
