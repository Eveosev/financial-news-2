Former New York Jets safety LaRon Landry signed a free-agent contract with the  Indianapolis Colts .  Financial details of the agreement weren’t provided in a
release on the National Football League team’s website. ESPN
reported today that the four-year contract is worth $24 million,
with $14 million in guarantees.  “We feel LaRon is an absolute game changer and a true
impact player,” Colts General Manager Ryan Grigson said on the
website. “His approach to the game and his style of play are
lights out and embody the culture we’re building on the defense
and this team in general.”  A first-round pick by the Washington Redskins in the 2007
NFL draft, Landry spent five years with the team before joining
the Jets last season. He played all 16 games with New York, with
two interceptions and a team-high four forced fumbles. His 100
tackles were second to linebacker  David Harris ’s 123.  Landry, 28, thanked Jets fans on his Twitter account,
saying that he will “never forget the experience” of playing
in New York.  He joins running back  Shonn Greene  as Jets starters that
won’t return to the team next season. Greene signed yesterday
with the  Tennessee Titans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
