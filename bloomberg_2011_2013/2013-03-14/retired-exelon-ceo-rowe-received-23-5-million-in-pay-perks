Exelon Corp. (EXC)  paid retired Chief
Executive Officer  John Rowe  $23.5 million for working less than
three months in 2012 and completing the power company’s $7.3
billion takeover of Constellation Energy Group Inc.  Rowe doubled his 2011 compensation after retiring on March
12, 2012, three days after the acquisition closed, Chicago-based
Exelon said in a filing today.  Rowe’s benefits included a $9 million pension payout, $4.5
million in stock, $4 million in payments related to the
Constellation deal and $2.8 million for income taxes.  Christopher Crane, his successor as Exelon’s CEO, received
$10.2 million last year, an 83 percent increase from 2011. Mayo
Shattuck III, the former Constellation chief executive who
succeeded Rowe as chairman of Exelon’s board, received $8
million, according to the regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
