Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
Latin American non-state oil producer with the biggest market
capitalization, dropped after losing a dispute with  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) 
that will cut its share of output at a shared field.  Shares dropped 4.8 percent to 40,740 pesos at 12:44 p.m. in
Bogota, its fifth daily drop. Rubiales was the second-worst
performer on the  Colcap (COLCAP)  index, which was down 0.2 percent.  The company took a $61 million charge on net income after
an arbitrator ruled yesterday in favor of Ecopetrol, which would
mean a lower share of production for Rubiales at the Quifa SW
field. Under the contract, Rubiales’s 60 percent stake in the
field decreases according to a high-price clause that assigns
additional production to Ecopetrol.  Rubiales reported a net loss of $24 million in the fourth
quarter after the provisions for the arbitration, compared with
a gain of $81 million in the prior year.  The company would have had a profit in the quarter
excluding this number, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Perez said
today on a conference call. Rubiales is taking a “very
conservative approach” with its provisions, Perez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
