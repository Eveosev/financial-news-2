OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA, Brazil’s biggest decliner this year, rose the most in a week
after declaring three fields commercial.  OGX, controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , gained 0.8
percent to 2.39 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo.
Brazil’s benchmark stock index fell 0.2 percent.  The Rio de Janeiro-based explorer yesterday announced there
was up to 1.3 billion barrels of oil in place at the Tubarao
Tigre, Tubarao Gato and Tubarao Areia fields that it declared
commercial in the Campos Basin. The company also said it
submitted evaluation plans to the National Petroleum Agency for
six other discoveries in the Campos and Santos basins.  OGX will probably extract a total of 245 million barrels
from the three fields it declared commercial, Caio Carvalhal, an
analyst at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , said today in a note to
clients. The volumes OGX announced yesterday are “in excess”
of investors’ expectations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
