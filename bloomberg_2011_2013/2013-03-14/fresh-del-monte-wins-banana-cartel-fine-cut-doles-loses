Fresh  Del Monte  Produce Inc. won a
reduction in a European Union cartel fine to 8.82 million euros
($11.4 million) while  Dole Food Co. (DOLE)  lost an EU court challenge
against its 45.6 million-euro fine for rigging banana prices.  The EU General Court today ruled Fresh Del Monte’s fine
merited a reduction from the original 14.7 million euros, citing
cooperation with regulators and mitigating circumstances. The
Luxembourg-based court dismissed Dole’s appeal.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator, in
 October 2008 fined  the two companies for colluding on prices
between 2000 and 2002 in eight EU countries, including Austria,
Germany and the Netherlands. Banana exports rose to the highest
in at least a decade in 2011, making it the most-traded fruit,
according to the  World Trade Organization .  “We strongly believe that the European competition laws
were not violated and we will appeal this decision to the EU
Court of Justice,” C. Michael Carter, Dole’s president and
chief operating officer, said in a statement today. “The
General Court’s decision treats discussions about general market
conditions the same as a price-fixing cartel.”  Fresh Del Monte got its penalty jointly with Internationale
Fruchtimport Gesellschaft Weichert GmbH & Co.  Chiquita Brands
International Inc. (CQB)  escaped an 83.2 million euro-fine because it
was first to tell EU regulators about the cartel.  Chiquita in 2011 also avoided being penalized by blowing
the whistle in a second cartel in Italy, Greece and  Portugal 
from July 2004 until April 2005.  Dole, based in  Westlake Village , California, made an
initial fine payment of $10 million to the commission in January
2009 and “provided the required bank guarantee for the
remaining balance,” the company said in a March 12 filing.  The cases are:  T-588/08 , Dole Food and Dole Germany v.
Commission;  T-587/08 , Fresh Del Monte Produce v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
