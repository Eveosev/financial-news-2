Australia  recalled Brad Haddin and
Nathan Lyon among four changes for the third cricket Test
against  India  as rain delayed the start of play in Mohali.  Australia, trailing 2-0 in the four-match series, only had
12 players available for selection after Shane Watson, James
Pattinson, Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Johnson were suspended for
failing to submit feedback on how they and the team could
improve and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade was ruled out because of
an ankle injury.  Haddin will play his first Test since January 2012 after
taking Wadeâ€™s spot, while Lyon was recalled in place of Glenn
Maxwell and Mitchell Starc came in for fellow paceman Pattinson.
Allrounder Steve Smith was picked at No. 5 in a rejigged batting
order that puts captain Michael Clarke at No. 3.  India, which would regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy by
avoiding defeat in either of the remaining two matches, is set
to give opening batsmen Shikhar Dhawan his Test debut in place
of the dropped Virender Sehwag.  Australia: David Warner,  Ed Cowan , Michael Clarke
