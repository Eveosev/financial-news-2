Slovenia’s Tina Maze won her first
super-G title and her fourth in total this season after the
World Cup’s final speed race was canceled because of high winds
in Lenzerheide, Switzerland.  The 29-year-old has dominated ski racing this season.
Before today, she had already secured titles in the super-
combined, giant slalom and the overall championship on the
alpine World Cup circuit. She finished the super-G with 420
points, 55 points clear of Julia Mancuso of the U.S. while
Austria’s Anna Fenninger was third.  It’s the second day in a row the World Cup finals have been
canceled because of bad weather.  AmericanLindsey Vonn, whose season ended last month with a
knee injury, yesterday clinched a record sixth straight women’s
World Cup downhill title one point clear of Maze after fog
caused the final downhill event of the season to be called off.  Today’s men’s super-G race was also canceled. The title had
already been secured by Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal two weeks
ago after four wins this season. Svindal won the men’s downhill
title yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
