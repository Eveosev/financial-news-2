Canada ’s dollar gained the most
against its U.S. peer in more than two months after the nation’s
new-home price index rose and American jobless claims dropped,
adding to signs the economic recovery is gaining traction.  The Canadian currency climbed versus the majority of its 16
most-traded counterparts as new-home prices rose 0.1 percent in
January, led by a 0.3 percent increase in Toronto, the country’s
largest city,  Statistics Canada  said in Ottawa. Lumber and
aluminum futures gained along with oil as the differential
between Western Canada Select crude and West Texas Intermediate
remained at almost a five-month low.  Raw materials  account for
almost half of Canada’s export revenue.  “The strength in the U.S. numbers is helpful for the
Canadian currency,”  Nick Bennenbroek , the head currency
strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said in a phone interview. “It
comes in the context of fairly solid employment reports from the
U.S. and Canada last week.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, gained 0.5 percent to C$1.0222
per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It climbed as much as 0.6
percent, the most since Jan. 2. One loonie buys 97.83 U.S.
cents.  Debt Auction  Canada’s benchmark 10-year bond fell, pushing yields up
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.95 percent.
The 2.75 percent security maturing in June 2022 declined 29
cents to C$106.74.  The  Bank of Canada  will sell C$3.3 billion ($3.23) worth of
two-year government notes on March 20. The 1 percent securities
will mature in May 2015. The central bank sold C$3.3 billion
($3.2 billion) of two-year government notes at an average yield
of 1.168 percent on Feb. 13. The offering drew C$8.5 billion in
bids.  Implied volatility for three-month options on the greenback
versus the Canadian dollar touched 6.2, the least since Feb. 19.
Implied volatility signals the expected pace of currencies
swings and is quoted by traders to set prices. Lower volatility
correlates with a stronger Canadian dollar versus its U.S.
counterpart.  Western Canada Select, the benchmark for oil-sands bitumen,
traded at a  discount  of $20.25 to U.S. West Texas Intermediate
price after hitting $18.50 on March 11, the lowest since Oct.
17. The discount has fallen by $22.25 since Dec. 15.  ‘Most Important’  “The Western Canada Select-West Texas Intermediate spread
should be on every Canadian dollar traders screen, because it’s
the most important factor in trade right now,” Adam Button,
currency analyst for Forexlive.com in  Montreal , said by phone.  Lumber futures for May deliver rose $10, the most allowed
by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The contract for May
delivery rose as high as $409.90 per 1,000 board feet after the
close of regular trading, extending a rally to the costliest for
a most-active contract since March 2005. Aluminum for delivery
in three months rose as much as 1.3 percent to $1,990.50 a
metric ton. Oil climbed 0.7 percent to $93.18 a barrel in  New
York .  Canada’s  housing gain  matched the forecast of economists in
a Bloomberg survey. From a year earlier, new  home prices 
increased 2.2 percent in January.  First-time  jobless claims  in the U.S., Canada’s biggest
trade partner, fell by 10,000 to 332,000 in the week ended March
9, the fewest since mid-January, according to data today from
the Labor Department in  Washington . The median forecast of 49
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase to
350,000. The four-week average declined to a five-year low.  Employment Reports  This came after reports last week that showed employment
gains in Canada and the U.S. exceeded forecasts, with both
nations’ unemployment rates at four-year lows.  “If we look at the North American economy as a whole, the
second half of 2013 is looking like the best half since the
crisis,” Button said.  The loonie strengthened 0.5 percent to 94.02 yen after
 Japan ’s lower house of parliament endorsed  Haruhiko Kuroda , an
advocate of increased stimulus, as the next  Bank of Japan (8301) 
governor. The upper house, where Abe’s  Liberal Democratic Party 
lacks a majority, is scheduled to vote tomorrow.  The loonie has fallen 2.1 percent in the past six months
against nine developed-nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Only the yen and the
pound have fallen more, at 17 percent and 4.5 percent. The U.S.
dollar has risen 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
