Kentz (KENZ)  Corp., an Irish oil and gas
engineering company, rose the most in almost nine months in
London trading after winning a contract from  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) 
for an oil-sands project in Canada.  The contract at the Athabasca project in northern  Alberta ,
which will run until 2016, is “significant” in value, the
Tipperary-based company said today in a statement, without
disclosing a number.  Kentz climbed 9.2 percent to 412.90 pence at the close, the
most since June 19. That values the company at 486 million
pounds ($732 million). Trading volumes were more than 14 times
the three-month daily average.  The company’s order backlog increased 7 percent last year,
it said in January, citing “confidence that we will deliver
double-digit earnings growth in 2013.”  The contract may be worth about $200 million, according to
an analyst at VSA Capital Ltd.  “Significant” may mean 5 percent to 10 percent of the
$2.6 billion order book, Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil and gas
analyst at VSA, said in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
