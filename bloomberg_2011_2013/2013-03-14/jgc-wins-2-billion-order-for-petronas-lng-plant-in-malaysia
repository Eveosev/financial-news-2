JGC Corp. (1963) , a Japanese engineering
company, won a $2 billion contract from Malaysian state oil
company Petroliam Nasional Bhd. to expand a liquefied natural
gas plant in Malaysia.  Under the engineering, procurement, construction and
commissioning contract, Yokohama, Japan-based JGC will build an
additional LNG plant at the Bintulu site in the east Malaysian
state of Sarawak by the end of 2015, it said in a statement. The
ninth train will have capacity of about 3.6 million tons per
year, it said.  The Malaysian company, known as Petronas, said last year
that JGC will compete for the expansion project against a
partnership of Japan’s  Chiyoda Corp. (6366)  and Italy’s  Saipem SpA. (SPM) 
JGC, which has constructed the eight existing trains at the
plant, is working for four LNG EPC projects in Australia,
Indonesia and  Papua New Guinea , according to the statement.  JGC shares rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most since Feb.
19, to 2,534 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose as much as 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
