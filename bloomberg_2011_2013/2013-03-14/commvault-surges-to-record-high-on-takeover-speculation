CommVault Systems Inc. (CVLT) , a provider
of data-storage software, surged to a record high amid
speculation that the company may be acquired.  The shares jumped 8.5 percent to $84.16 at 12:33 p.m. in
 New York , and earlier touched $86.89 for the highest intraday
price since a public market debut in 2006. Through yesterday,
the  stock  had advanced 11 percent this year, about the same
increase as the Standard & Poor’s 400 Midcap Index.  A takeover “makes sense” for any company that wants to
gain CommVault’s software, according to Joel Fishbein, an
analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in New York. He recommends
buying shares with a target price of $95, 24 percent higher than
the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The investment community is catching up to the growth
potential of the company,” Fishbein said in an interview today.
“They have the best product in the market and it would make a
lot of sense for somebody to want to have the asset.” CommVault
provides data and information management software to corporate
 customers  including Levi Strauss & Co.,  Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE)  and
 BT Group Plc. (BT/A)  Formed in 1988 as a development group within Bell
Labs, CommVault became an independent company eight years later.
The software maker sold 12.8 million shares at $14.50 apiece in
an initial public offering in September 2006.  Kevin Komiega, a spokesman for Oceanport, New Jersey-based
CommVault, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
