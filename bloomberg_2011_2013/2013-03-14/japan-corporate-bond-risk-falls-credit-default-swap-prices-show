The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment dropped, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1 basis point to 101
basis points as of 9:10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark is headed for its lowest close since March
2011, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 102.5 basis points
as of 8:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The measure rose for the past three
business days, the longest stretch since January, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 105 basis points as of 11:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The gauge has fallen 9.3 basis
points so far in March, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
