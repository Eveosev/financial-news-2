Italy’s diesel consumption fell in
February to the lowest level since August 2003, according to
 data  from the  Ministry of Economic Development , as the country’s
fourth recession since 2001 cut fuel demand.  Diesel use declined about 6 percent to 1.96 million metric
tons compared with a year earlier, data posted today on the
ministry’s website show. Gasoline demand rose for the first time
since January 2012, by 4 percent to 578,000 tons, according to
the data.  The country’s economy shrank 2.8 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, according to the latest data
available from national statistics office  Istat .  To contact the reporter on this story:
