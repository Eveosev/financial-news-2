Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  and  Oil
India Ltd. (OINL) , Indian state-run energy companies, made a joint bid
to buy a 20 percent stake in a Mozambique gas field, a person
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  ONGC and Oil India bid for shares being sold by  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and  Videocon Industries Ltd. (VCLF)  today, the person
said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. The sellers are divesting 10 percent each in the
Rovuma-1 offshore block.  Energy companies from Asia, Europe and North America have
flocked to East Africa after oil explorers made the world’s
biggest gas discoveries in a decade in Mozambique’s waters.
Rovuma-1 holds more in potential reserves than Libya has in
proven deposits, according to data from The Woodlands, Texas-
based Anadarko, the operator of the block.  ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva, Oil India Chairman S.K. Srivastava and Videocon Chairman Venugopal Dhoot didn’t answer
phone calls seeking comment. John Christiansen, a spokesman for
Anadarko, declined to comment.  Videocon, which runs businesses from television
manufacturing to mobile-phone services in India, agreed to pay
$75 million for a stake in the Rovuma-1 area in 2008. Bharat
Petroleum Corp., India’s second-largest state refiner, owns 10
percent of the block, meaning an acquisition by ONGC and Oil
India would raise state control to 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
