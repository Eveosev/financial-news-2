Mizuho International Plc, the
London-based investment-banking unit of  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411) , hired Nicolas Pourcelet as head of fixed-income sales.  Pourcelet, the former country head for France at Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., joined on March 5 as a managing
director, according to Mizuho spokesman Benjamin Harding. He was
most recently at Rosenquist Capital, where he was a founding
partner.  Mizuho, Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value, is
combining its corporate- and consumer-banking arms and expects
earnings from abroad to make up a bigger chunk of profit in
three years as the nation’s lenders combat a shrinking economy
and declining interest rates at home.  The securities firm also hired Mark Wheatcroft, formerly of
UBS AG, as head of debt syndicate for  Europe ,  Middle East  and
Africa and syndicate manager for sovereigns and supranationals,
Harding said. Wheatcroft joined last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
