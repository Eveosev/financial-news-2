Greenhunter Energy Inc. (GRH) , a water-
resource company focused on oil and natural gas shale
formations, agreed to buy a barging terminal in West Virginia
for $750,000.  Greenhunter plans to convert the location into a water
treatment, recycling and logistics terminal by the third quarter
of 2013, the Grapevine, Texas-based company said in a statement
today.  The company plans to convert the existing warehouse into a
water recycling station with up to 19,000 barrels of water tank
storage.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
