Efforts by Poland, the  Czech
Republic  and Hungary to revive economic growth in 2013 will be
stymied by recession in the 17-nation euro region and weak
domestic consumption, Moody’s Analytics said.  Poland’s  economy  will probably grow 1.9 percent this year,
compared with 2 percent in 2012 and 4.3 percent in 2011, Tomas
Holinka, an economist at the unit of  Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , said today
in an e-mailed report from London. Czech gross domestic product
will advance 0.3 percent, while Hungarian GDP will shrink 1.2
percent, he predicted.  “Exports were the only source of growth for all three
economies in 2012 as rising unemployment, negative real-wage
growth and fiscal austerity have restrained  consumer spending  at
home,” Holinka wrote. “With around 75 percent of their exports
going to the EU this could be problematic for future growth.”  Eastern European economies are suffering because of
deteriorating trade and banking ties to their western neighbors,
which are grappling with a debt crisis. The euro region will
shrink 0.3 percent this year, the European Commission estimated
in February.  Weak investment poses another risk to eastern  Europe ’s
long-term growth prospects, Moody’s said in the report. Fixed
investment is falling as a share of Czech and Hungarian GDP,
with signs that a similar trend may have begun in Poland, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
