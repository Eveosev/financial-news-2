Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell
 North Sea  Forties crude as it offered at a higher price than
yesterday’s trades.  Eni SpA (ENI)  and Total SA both bid unsuccessfully
for Russian Urals grade.  The Buzzard oil field’s share in Forties rose to 39 percent
for the week ending March 10, which was the highest proportion
in a month, according to data published on  BP Plc (BP/) ’s website.  North Sea  Trafigura offered Forties lot F0321 at 25 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent for loading March 30 to April 1, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. The cargo had been advanced by three
days, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who
asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public.  That offer compares with trades yesterday at discounts of
55 cents and 60 cents to the benchmark.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was unchanged at a discount of 56 cents to Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for April settlement traded at $109.42 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.65 in the previous session. The more
actively traded May contract was at $108.75, a discount of 67
cents to April, which expires later today.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total failed to find a seller for Urals for a second day,
the Platts survey showed. The company bid at a discount of $1.70
a barrel to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy 
for 80,000 metric tons of the grade. That’s 40 cents higher than
yesterday and the smallest discount since Feb. 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eni bid at $1.90 less than the benchmark for 140,000 tons
of Urals, according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 35 cents to $2.10 a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.90 a
barrel, compared with $1.84 in the previous session, which was
the narrowest since Feb. 20.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 2 cents to $3.33
a barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
