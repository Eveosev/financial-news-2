China’s  defense spending  may equal
that of the U.S. within a decade if annual increases continue at
the current rate, according to research published today.  Chinese military expenditure has increased by an average of
15 percent a year, according to  analysis  by the London-based
International Institute of Strategic Studies. That rate of
increase, along with the inclusion of defense spending currently
excluded from the People’s Liberation Army’s budget, will cause
it to reach U.S. levels around 2023, the institute said.  “China’s indigenous capacity to produce advanced equipment
is gradually transforming the People’s Liberation Army,” IISS
Director General John Chipman told reporters in  London  today.
“China now spends more on defense than neighboring Japan, South
Korea and  Taiwan  combined.”  The PLA commissioned its first aircraft carrier in
September and its emergence as a naval power can also be seen in
its new Type-052D destroyer, Type-056 corvettes, maritime patrol
aircraft and developments in its guided missile systems, Chipman
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
