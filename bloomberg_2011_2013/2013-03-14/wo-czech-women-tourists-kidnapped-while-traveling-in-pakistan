Two Czech women were kidnapped by
armed men in Pakistan yesterday while traveling through the
western province of Baluchistan, the Czech Foreign Ministry
said.  The two women, who were accompanied by an armed guide, were
ambushed by a group of assailants about 100 kilometers (60
miles) after crossing the border from  Iran  and taken to an
unknown place, spokeswoman Johana Grohova said when reached by
telephone. The local guide was disarmed and later released, she
said.  A police team was dispatched from Quetta, the regionâ€™s
capital, Grohova said. No group has claimed responsibility for
the kidnapping, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
