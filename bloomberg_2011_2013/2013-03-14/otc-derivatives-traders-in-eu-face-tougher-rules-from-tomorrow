Traders in over-the-counter
derivatives will face tougher disclosure  rules  from
tomorrow as part of an EU push to regulate transactions that
take place outside authorized venues.  The EU rules will require banks and other firms that
conduct OTC transactions to provide more data to so-called trade
repositories, including information on the value of contracts
and on related collateral, according to the  EU’s website .  “The complexity of these new obligations, and the short
timeframe” means that “many firms just aren’t ready for this
Friday’s deadline,” Crispian Lord, regulation partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in  London , said in an e-mail.  Global regulators are seeking to toughen rules for the $639
trillion  market  for OTC derivatives, which became a target for
oversight after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and the rescue of  American International Group Inc., (AIG)  two of
the largest traders in credit default swaps.  The Group of 20 nations set an end-2012 deadline for
nations to adopt rules requiring standard forms of OTC
derivatives to be processed through clearinghouses, and logged
in trade depositories.  While the EU approved legislation last year, it was unable
to adopt all the associated implementing rules before the end
2012 deadline.  The measures that take effect tomorrow are part of a
package of implementing standards published by the EU  last
month .  To contact the reporter on this story:
