Canada’s new home  price index  rose
0.1 percent in January, the government statistics agency said.  The gain was led by a 0.3 percent increase in Toronto, the
country’s largest city, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.  Economists predicted the index would increase 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  with
eight responses.  From a year earlier, new home prices increased 2.2 percent
in January.  Demand for homes has been supported by some of the lowest
mortgage rates in decades. Bank of Montreal is offering a five-
year fixed mortgage with a 2.99 percent interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
