The U.K. Department of Energy and
Climate Change said 1,803 homes have been assessed for its so-
called Green Deal program on  energy efficiency  since it started
on Jan. 28, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The department didn’t say how many households have taken up
an efficiency program after the assessments. Separately, the
government said 26.9 million pounds ($40.2 million) worth of
contracts have been signed under its Energy Company Obligation,
a subsidy from energy suppliers to poorer households that will
be recouped by charges spread across al bills.  The Green Deal program aims to make the nation’s 26.9
million homes more energy efficient through measures such as
insulation and double glazing that would be paid for via a
charge added to energy bills. The goal is for the charge to be
smaller than the savings that result from the measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
