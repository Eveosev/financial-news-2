U.S. solar panel installations grew
76 percent in 2012 to 3.3 gigawatts, representing a tenth of the
global market, led by large-scale projects in the desert
southwest, according to the  Solar Energy Industries Association .  In 2013, photovoltaic installations are expected to grow 29
percent to reach 4.3 gigawatts along with 946 megawatts of
concentrating solar thermal power, which uses mirrors to focus
the sun’s energy to drive generators, the Washington-based trade
group forecast today in a statement. SEIA said Dec. 11 it had
expected installations to grow to 4 gigawats this year.  Last year was led by the first “really large utility-scale
projects coming online,” eight of the ten largest, Shayle Kann,
vice president of research at GTM Research, said in an
interview. The Boston-based consulting company collaborated with
SEIA on the quarterly solar report.  Installations in the fourth quarter accounted for about
two-fifths of the year’s total, in part driven by developers
racing to qualify for expiring incentives, according to SEIA.  The residential market benefited from the continued
expansion of third-party financing from installers and
providers, like  Solarcity Corp. (SCTY)  and Sunrun Inc. Commercial
projects, those that provide power directly to businesses and
institutions, were boosted by improving economics and a boom in
in the second half of the year in  New Jersey , Hawaii and
 Massachusetts , Kann said.  California, Arizona  “We’ve brought more new solar online in 2012 than in the
three prior years combined,”  Rhone Resch , president and chief
executive officer of SEIA, said in the statement. The U.S.
installed 16 million solar panels last year, more than two
panels per second of the work day, Resch said.  California accounted for almost a third of all
installations, with 1 gigawatt installed last year.  Arizona 
followed with 710 megawatts and New Jersey with 415 megawatts.  The value of the U.S. market grew 34 percent to $11.5
billion, up from $8.6 billion in 2011. The U.S. has cumulatively
installed 7.2 gigawatts of photovoltaic panels and 546 megawatts
of concentrating solar thermal power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
