MGM Resorts International (MGM)  rose
after Kirk Kerkorian’s Tracinda Corp. said it may boost its
stake in the casino operator by more than a third to as much as
25 percent.  Tracinda, which currently owns 18.6 percent of MGM, made
the disclosure with the Federal Trade Commission to comply with
antitrust regulations, according to a securities filing
yesterday.  “No decision has been made as to the number of shares
which may be acquired,” investment company Tracinda said.  MGM advanced 6.8 percent to $13.25 at the close in New
York, for the biggest gain since Dec. 6. The shares have gained
14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
