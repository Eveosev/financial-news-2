European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said it’s not the right time to
reduce borrowing costs.  “It isn’t the appropriate time to take interest-rate
action,” Nowotny, who heads  Austria ’s central bank, said in
Vienna today. “We’re working on the assumption that growth
signs will improve over the course of the year.”  While officials discussed cutting borrowing costs last
week, the “prevailing consensus” was to leave the benchmark
rate unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent, ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said on March 7. He expects the euro-area economy
to “gradually recover” later this year.  “We have an unsatisfactory growth in  Europe ,” Nowotny
said today, adding that the Frankfurt-based ECB is “observing
the situation.”  The ECB last week cut its growth forecasts and now expects
the 17-nation economy to shrink 0.5 percent this year before
growing 1 percent in 2014. It sees inflation slowing to 1.3
percent next year, well below its 2 percent limit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
