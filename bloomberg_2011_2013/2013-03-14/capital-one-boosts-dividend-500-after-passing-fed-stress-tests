Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
worst performer among 24 U.S. lenders in the KBW Bank Index this
year, said it would boost its dividend sixfold after submitting
its capital plan to the  Federal Reserve .  The payout for the first quarter will increase to 30 cents
from 5 cents, the McLean, Virginia-based company said today in a
statement. After last year’s stress test, Capital One said it
would raise $1.25 billion through the sale of its own stock to
help fund the purchase of HSBC Holdings Plc’s U.S. credit-card
portfolio.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, 62, said in
January that he expects a “meaningful” dividend increase this
year and that the lender initially won’t seek to repurchase
shares.  Fairbank has spent more than $28 billion on acquisitions
since 2005, including last year’s HSBC deal and the $9.1 billion
purchase of  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s online U.S. bank, which helped boost
 deposits  by more than $80 billion.  Capital One has dropped 5.9 percent this year, closing at
$54.51 today in New York. It’s the  only company  in the  KBW Bank
Index (BKX)  whose shares have declined this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
