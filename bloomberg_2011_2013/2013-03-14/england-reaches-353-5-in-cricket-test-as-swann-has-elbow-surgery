England  reduced  New Zealand  to <a href="news:linkid=MJOR6B6JIJV4">66-3</a>
after half-centuries by <a href="news:linkid=MJORL16JIJVY">Matt Prior</a> and <a href="news:linkid=MJORL16JIJVW">Kevin Pietersen</a> lifted
the touring team to 465 batting first in the second <a href="news:linkid=MJODC76JIJUX">cricket</a> Test
in Wellington.  Fast bowler <a href="news:linkid=MJOR6B6JIJV2">Stuart Broad</a> ended day two at Basin Reserve
with 2-18 after removing Hamish Rutherford and <a href="news:linkid=MJOR6B6JIJV3">Ross Taylor</a> in
successive deliveries in the final session. Dean Brownlie fought
off the hat trick ball before reaching 8 not out at stumps, with
Kane Williamson on 32.  <a href="news:linkid=MJOR6B6JIJV5">England</a>, seeking its fourth straight series win against the
Black Caps, lost five wickets for 112 runs in the afternoon
session to be dismissed on the stroke of the tea interval. All
10 batsman got out to catches, including top scorer <a href="news:linkid=MJODC76JIJUS">Jonathan
Trott</a>, who failed to add to his overnight score of 121.  Prior was the second-last man out after hitting 10 fours
and two sixes in his 99-ball innings, while Pietersen added 73.
England had resumed at 267-2 following centuries by Trott and
Nick Compton on day one.  Spinner Bruce Martin finished as New Zealand’s best bowler
with 4-130 from 48 overs. Williamson, Trent Boult and Neil
Wagner each took two wickets.  The series-opener in Dunedin ended in a draw. New Zealand,
which has lost eight of its past 12 elite five-day matches, last
won a Test series against England 14 years ago.  Swann Operation  England spin bowler <a href="news:linkid=MJODC76JIJUV"> Graeme Swann </a> faces about two months of
rehabilitation after “an uncomplicated operation” to remove
excess bone formation in his right elbow, the England and Wales
Cricket Board said.  The 33-year-old Swann, whose 212 Test wickets are the
second-most by an England spinner, flew to the U.S. for the
surgery after being ruled out of the current series last week.  “Swann will now commence a 6-8 week rehabilitation and
back-to-bowling program before returning to competitive cricket
early in the summer,” the board said.  England is scheduled to host New Zealand in two Tests
starting May 16 before back-to-back five-Test <a href="news:linkid=MJOR6B6JIJV6">Ashes</a> series, in
the U.K. beginning July 10 and then in  Australia  from Nov. 21.  The third Test between Australia and India began in Mohali
after the first day was rained out.  Ed Cowan  scored 86 as
Australia reached 273-7, with  Steven Smith  58 not out at stumps
and Mitchell Starc an unbeaten 20.  Opening Pair  Cowan and  David Warner  had an opening partnership of 139,
Australia’s highest in a Test in India, before Warner was caught
by MS Dhoni from Ravindra Jadeja for 71. Jadeja, who took 3-56,
then dismissed captain <a href="blpnews:linkid=CW35JPBKZAH3&peplid=5204707&pepllastname=Clarke&peplfirstname=Michael_John&peplcompanyname=Australia_International_Cricke&peplcompanynumber=1076114&pepltitle=Professional_Cricket_Player&interviewstatus=0&interviewdate=2013-03-15_12_37_58&interviewreporterpepl=0&intervieweditorpepl=1708438&intervieweditoremail= bbensch@bloomberg.net &interviewsource=News_Reporter_Software&srange=3410&erange=3424">Michael Clarke</a> to start an Indian
comeback.  Trailing 2-0 in the four-match series, Australia made four

and James Pattinson, respectively.  Australia only had 12 players available for selection after

suspended for failing to submit feedback on how they and the
team could improve. Wicketkeeper Wade was ruled out because of
an ankle injury.  India , which would regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy by
avoiding defeat in either of the remaining two matches, handed
opening batsmen Shikhar Dhawan his Test debut in place of the
dropped <a href="blpnews:linkid=JU5OJN2S3RK1&peplid=4385715&pepllastname=Sehwag&peplfirstname=Virender&peplcompanyname=Indian_Cricket_Team&peplcompanynumber=994574&peplwhohits=24&pepltitle=Professional_Cricket_Player&interviewstatus=0&interviewdate=2013-03-15_12_38_30&interviewreporterpepl=0&intervieweditorpepl=1708438&intervieweditoremail= bbensch@bloomberg.net &interviewsource=News_Reporter_Software&srange=5918&erange=5933">Virender Sehwag</a> and picked Pragyan Ojha ahead of
