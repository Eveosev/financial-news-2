Bullishness among individual
investors increased the most in almost three years after the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  rallied to a record high, according to
a survey by the  American Association  of Individual Investors.  Expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six
months rose 14 percentage points to 45.4 percent, putting
optimism at a six-week high, Charles Rotblut, vice president and
editor of the AAII Journal, said in a report today. The weekly
gain was the biggest since July 15, 2010. The historical average
for market optimism is 39 percent.  “The current level of bullish sentiment is not excessive,
but it does in part reflect the Dow Jones industrial average’s
nine-day winning streak,” Rotblut wrote. “While the streak has
prompted some investors to be more optimistic about the short-
term direction of stock prices, many AAII members remain leery
that stocks are overbought and due for a correction.”  Expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six
months, or bearish sentiment, remained above its historical
average for a fourth week, even as pessimism fell 6.5 percent to
32 percent of investors  surveyed . Neutral sentiment,
expectations that prices will remain steady, reached its lowest
level since Nov. 15, 2012, falling 7.9 percent to 22.5 percent
of investors.  The record set by the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  of
14,253.77 on March 5 has made 17 percent of investors surveyed
more cautious, according to the survey. About 11 percent of
respondents said they feel more confident, and approximately 30
percent of people said the record had no effect on their opinion
of the attractiveness of stocks.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  is about five points away
from its record closing level of 1,565.15 set in October 2007.
The gauge has more than doubled from its bottom in 2009, fueled
by corporate earnings that topped estimates and monetary
stimulus from the  Federal Reserve . The Dow has set record
closing highs for seven straight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
