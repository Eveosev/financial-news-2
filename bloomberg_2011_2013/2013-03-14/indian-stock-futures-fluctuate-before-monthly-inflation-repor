Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped for a fourth
day before the monthly inflation report. Lenders and carmakers
led the declines.  The S&P BSE Sensex slid 0.1 percent to 19,336.7 at 11:11
a.m. in Mumbai, with volumes exceeding the 30-day average by 33
percent at this time of day.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  and  HDFC Bank Ltd., (HDFCB) 
the nation’s two biggest non-state lenders, declined on a money-
laundering report.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land
Rover, fell for a second day.  Consumer prices  rose 10.91 percent last month from a year
earlier, compared with a 10.79 percent increase in January,
official data showed March 12. Wholesale-price inflation will
ease to 6.59 percent from 6.62 percent, the slowest pace since
2009, according to the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey before data due around noon in  New Delhi  today. Price
pressures are “still high and stubborn,”  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in  London  yesterday. The
authority meets to set monetary policy on March 19.  “We don’t expect a very aggressive rate cut, at best it
could be 25 basis points,” D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of SMC
Investments & Advisors Ltd., which has about $100 million in
assets, said by phone from New Delhi. “Inflation continues to
be sticky.”  The RBI cut its benchmark  rate  25 basis points to 7.75
percent on Jan. 29, the first reduction in nine months. Nine of
10 analysts in another Bloomberg survey predict Subbarao will
lower the rate to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent on March 19.  ICICI Bank lost 0.1 percent to 1,084.55 rupees, HDFC Bank
decreased 0.5 percent to 631.8 rupees and  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  fell
0.9 percent to 1,334.85 rupees. The stocks retreated after
Cobrapost.com released a report saying the three lenders were
involved in  money laundering .  ‘Knee-Jerk Reaction’  “We have constituted a high level inquiry committee to
investigate into the matter and submit its findings in two
weeks,” ICICI Bank spokesman Kausik Datta said in an e-mail
today. HDFC Bank spokesman Neeraj Jha and Axis Bank spokesman
Julius Samson didn’t answer calls made to their mobile phones.  “It seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to the reports by
Cobrapost,” SMC’s Aggarwal said.  Tata Motors slid 1.5 percent to 296.45 rupees. Aluminum
maker  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  lost 1.2 percent to 94.7 rupees.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index of the National Stock Exchange of
 India  slid 0.3 percent to 5,832.75. India VIX, which measures
the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, increased
0.9 percent to 16.35.  The Sensex slumped 5.2 percent in February, its first drop
in four months and the biggest monthly fall since May, as more
index companies missed earnings estimates in the three months
ended Dec. 31 and the economy expanded in the quarter at the
slowest pace in almost four years.  Overseas funds still bought a net $144 million worth of
shares on March 12, taking their net investment in domestic
equities this year to $9.3 billion, a record for the period,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Foreigners purchased a net
$24.5 billion worth of shares last year, the most among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
