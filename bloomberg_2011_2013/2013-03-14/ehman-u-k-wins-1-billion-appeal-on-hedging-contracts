Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
U.K. unit won its appeal over the interpretation of hedging
contracts with the failed bank’s Swiss subsidiary.  The ruling may result in London-based Lehman Brothers
International Europe and its administrators
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP receiving an extra $1 billion,
according to a written decision handed down this morning by
Judge Mary Arden in the U.K. Court of Appeals.  Lehman spread risk from its derivatives trades by using
inter-company agreements with Swiss unit Lehman Brothers Finance
SA. The appeal dealt with how those contracts should be closed
out and whether a letter setting out conditions for unwinding
those deals should be considered.  “The side letter should be taken into account for the
purposes of determining the value” of the transactions, Arden
ruled, allowing PwC’s appeal and overturning a prior ruling.
Stephanie Howel, a spokeswoman for PwC, didn’t immediately
comment.  PwC settled legal disputes with Lehman’s U.S. bankruptcy
trustee in February, paving the way for the return of money to
the U.K. unit’s creditors. PwC announced its first distribution
to creditors last April, more than three-and-a-half years after
what was once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank filed the
biggest bankruptcy in American history, listing $613 billion in
debts and setting off a global credit crunch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
