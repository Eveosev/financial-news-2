Google Inc. (GOOG) , operator of the
worldâ€™s biggest Web-search engine, is ending support for an
application that manages calls on  BlackBerry (BBRY)  smartphones,
pulling back on initiatives as it streamlines operations.  Google Voice App for BlackBerry will no longer be supported
after next week, Google said in a  blog post  today.  BlackBerry users should opt for a browser-based application
offered by Google instead to handle calls, contacts and voice
mail, Google said in the post.  The search-engine provider is also shutting down Google
Reader in July, the Web-based application for subscribing to
blog posts, news feeds and other content.  To contact the reporter on this story:
