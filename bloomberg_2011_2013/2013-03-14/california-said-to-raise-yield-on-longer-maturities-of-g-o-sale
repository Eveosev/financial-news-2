California  raised yields on some
longer maturities in the final day of its first debt sale since
getting an upgrade from Standard & Poor’s in January.  The state is selling about $2.2 billion in tax-exempts this
week. It began offering the securities to investors such as
mutual funds today, after two days of marketing to individual
buyers.  Bonds maturing in 2023 were offered at a preliminary yield
of 2.56 percent, up from 2.54 percent yesterday, according to
four people familiar with the deal, who declined to be named
because the prices weren’t final.   On longer maturities, yields rose even more from levels at
which the state marketed to individual investors the past two
days. For debt due in February 2033 with a 5 percent coupon,
California is offering the debt today with a 3.54 percent yield,
up from 3.39 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
