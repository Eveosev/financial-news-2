Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the auto
lender majority-owned by the U.S., had its capital plan rejected
by the  Federal Reserve  after regulators deemed the firm’s
planning process and  capital ratios  didn’t meet standards.  Ally’s Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of financial
strength, was 1.52 percent in a worst-case economic scenario
when taking into account the company’s revised capital plan,
below the Fed’s 5 percent minimum threshold, according to
central bank data released yesterday in  Washington . That’s lower
than the Detroit-based firm’s 1.78 percent ratio after its
initial submission.  The lender must submit yet another capital plan after
correcting its “deficiencies,” according to the Fed, which
said it objected “on quantitative and qualitative grounds.”  Ally, which received a $17.2 billion bailout that left the
U.S. Treasury Department with a  74 percent stake , has repeatedly
clashed with the Fed over the calculation of capital ratios.
Last week, after the initial release of stress-test results, the
company called the central bank’s analysis “fundamentally
flawed.” Yesterday, the lender cited the strength of its
capital.  “Ally continues to have strong capital levels and ample
liquidity to support its automotive-finance operations,”  Gina Proia , a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Ally Bank continues to be a well-capitalized bank with a
leading position in the market.  ‘Implausible’ Assumptions  Ally’s total risk-based capital ratio, which includes
common and preferred stock, was 5.96 percent under its initial
plan, and 12.59 percent under the revised plan.  The lender predicted its Tier 1 common capital ratio would
be 5.7 percent under the stress-test scenario last week, and
said the Fed’s loss assumptions for auto loans were
‘‘implausible, even in dire economic situations,” according to
a statement. Ally said the Fed could convert $5.9 billion of
preferred shares owned by the U.S. government into Tier 1 common
equity at its own discretion.  Yesterday, the lender took issue with the Fed’s assumptions
about loss rates for dealer floorplan lending.  Regulators, intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis, have run annual stress tests on the largest
lenders to see how they might fare in a recession or economic
shock. The Fed last week disclosed how banks performed in a
hypothetical recession in which  U.S. unemployment  peaks at 12.1
percent,  home prices  fall 21 percent and stocks plunge 52
percent.  Ally plans to repay its government bailout through an
initial public offering. Chief Executive Officer  Michael Carpenter , 65, has put the idea on hold until after the fate of
its bankrupt Residential Capital mortgage business is clear.  To contact the reporter on this story:
