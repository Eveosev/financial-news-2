Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, sold $600 million of bonds due 2019 to yield
5.875 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company issued the senior secured notes, callable after
three years, to pay 500 basis points over similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, the data show. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Banco Santander SA managed the
transaction, according to a person familiar with the offer who
asked not to be identified because he’s not authorized to speak
publicly.  Monterrey, Mexico-based Cemex said in a statement to the
London Stock Exchange today that it plans to buy back as much as
200 million euros ($259 million) of bonds due in 2014 with a
4.75 percent coupon. There are 430 million euros of the notes
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The last time Cemex raised money abroad was in October with
an offering of $1.5 billion of 2022 bonds. The securities have
rallied since the sale, sending yields down 2.46 percentage
points to 6.91 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cemex is the first Mexican company to sell debt overseas
since  Standard & Poor’s  changed the outlook for the Latin
American country’s sovereign credit rating to positive from
stable on March 12. S&P rates Mexico BBB, or two levels above
junk.  To contact the reporters on this story:
