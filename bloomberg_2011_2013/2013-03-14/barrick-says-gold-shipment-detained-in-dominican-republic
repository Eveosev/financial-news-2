Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the largest
producer of the metal, said a gold shipment was detained by
customs authorities in the  Dominican Republic .  “The company has provided customs with additional
information and is seeking confirmation that the shipment can
resume, while further investigating the cause of the delay,”
Toronto-based Barrick said today in an e-mail.  Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina said Feb. 27
that the country’s contract for the development of a gold mine
by Barrick and Canada’s Goldcorp Inc. was unacceptable and needs
to be revised to produce more benefit to the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
