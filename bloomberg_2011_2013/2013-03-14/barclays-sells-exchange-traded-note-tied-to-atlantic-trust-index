Barclays Plc (BARC)  is offering exchange-
traded notes tied to an index of master-limited partnerships and
limited liability companies that specialize in energy
transportation and storage.  The Barclays ETN+ Select MLP security, which started
trading yesterday under the ticker ATMP, is linked to the price
of the Atlantic Trust Select MLP Index, according to a  filing 
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank
charges 0.95 percent a year in fees, according to a  prospectus 
available on its website.  The benchmark is “more of a pure play on energy
infrastructure,” as opposed to other MLP indexes that include
refineries, producers, or exploration companies, said Adam Karpf, portfolio manager for Atlantic Trust Group Inc. It
started on Feb. 20, according to the  SEC filing .  The note is Barclays’s second tied to MLP assets this year,
after the iPath S&P MLP ETN, which started trading on Jan. 4.
MLPs are companies that pay no corporate income tax and
distribute cash to owners of limited partnership units.  Mark Lane , a spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment.  The  JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ)  is the largest U.S.
 exchange-traded note  by assets, with $5.52 billion under
management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year,
the bank capped issuance of shares of the security.  UBS AG started selling its own ETN tied to the Alerian MLP
Index in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
