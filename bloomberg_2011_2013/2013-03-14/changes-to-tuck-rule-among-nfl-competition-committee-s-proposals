The  National Football League ’s
competition committee will ask owners to modify the so-called
tuck rule to make it a fumble rather than an incompletion when a
quarterback loses the ball as he brings it to his body.  Rich McKay, the Atlanta Falcons’ president and co-chairman
of the committee, said many such plays were being called as
fumbles on the field before getting reversed by replay officials
because of the rule’s language.  “We’ve been talking about this for too many years,” McKay
told reporters on a conference call yesterday. “We were swayed
by the officials themselves who met with us in Indianapolis and
were very comfortable calling this.”  If the quarterback loses the ball while his arm is going
forward, the play would remain an incomplete pass, McKay said.
The rule used to consider the quarterback’s throwing motion to
last from the time he begins moving his arm forward until he
tucks the ball back against his body.  The tuck rule saved  Tom Brady  and the  New England Patriots 
from a fumble late in a playoff game against the  Oakland Raiders 
in 2002. The Patriots went on to win the first of three Super
Bowl titles.  The committee also proposed a change that would prevent
runners or defenders from lowering their heads to initiate
contact with the crown of the helmet while approaching each
other outside the tackle box. McKay said the change would
protect players and force them to choose safer techniques.  Another proposed rule change would allow officials to use
instant replay even if a coach incorrectly throws a challenge
flag on a play subject to automatic review.  Detroit Lions coach Jim Schwartz challenged a touchdown run
by the Houston Texans’ Justin Forsett in a game last year and
thus negated the automatic review of scoring plays, which
probably would have wiped out the touchdown because Forsett was
clearly down.  Owners will discuss the proposed changes when the league’s
32 teams meet in  Arizona  next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
