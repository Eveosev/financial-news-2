UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, will say today that it’s selling ATF Bank to a Kazakh
investor, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The lender will probably sell its full stake in the Kazakh
unit for less than 400 million euros ($520 million), said the
person, who requested anonymity because the talks are private.  UniCredit owns 99.7 percent of Almaty-based ATF Bank
through its Bank Austria AG subsidiary. The Kazakh bank was
purchased by UniCredit for $2.1 billion in 2007. The lender has
since taken writedowns on the unit amid a surge in bad loans in
the country.  UniCredit rose 1 percent to 3.81 euros in Milan yesterday,
valuing the company at 22 billion euros. UniCredit’s shares have
added 2.7 percent this year, compared with an 8.3 percent
increase in the 40-member  Bloomberg Banks and Financial Services
Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
