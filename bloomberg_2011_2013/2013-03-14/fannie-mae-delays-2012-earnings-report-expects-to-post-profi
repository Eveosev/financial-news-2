Fannie Mae  will miss a March 18
deadline for reporting its earnings for the fourth quarter of
2012 while it analyzes how to handle some deferred tax assets,
the company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Fannie Mae (FMCC)  expects to report “significant net income” for
both the last quarter of 2012 and the full year, the company
said in the SEC filing today.  Washington-based Fannie Mae and McLean, Virginia-based
 Freddie Mac  have received almost $190 billion in taxpayer
assistance since they were taken into federal conservatorship in
September 2008 amid losses on risky loans that pushed them to
the brink of insolvency.  The two companies, which package mortgages into securities
on which they guarantee payments of principal and interest,
began reporting regular quarterly profits last year as the
housing market rebounded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
