(Corrects timing of Seaway expansion in seventh paragraph.)  West Texas Intermediate oil rose
for a second day, heading for a second weekly advance.  Brent
crude ’s premium to the U.S. benchmark grade is poised for the
biggest weekly drop in five months.  WTI futures climbed as much as 0.3 percent in  New York 
after gaining 0.6 percent yesterday, the most in a week. OPEC
will increase daily crude exports by 300,000 barrels to 23.75
million in the four weeks to March 30 as refineries in Europe
and the U.S. resume after maintenance and boost demand,
according to Oil Movements, a tanker tracker. Brent oil is
poised for a weekly decline.  “In the U.S., we’re exiting the refinery turnaround period
and heading into the summer demand season,” said  Anthony Nunan ,
a senior adviser for risk management at  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  in
 Tokyo . “With the glut in the U.S. Midcontinent being gradually
relieved because of pipeline capacity build out, it looks like
WTI is going to stabilize and maybe come up. WTI is much more
constructive, whereas Brent really looks like it’s on a
downtrend.”  West Texas oil for April delivery rose as much as 32 cents
to $93.35 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $93.28 at 11:35 a.m. Singapore
time. The volume of all futures traded was in line with the 100-
day average. The contract advanced 51 cents yesterday to $93.03,
the highest since Feb. 25. Prices are up 1.4 percent this week.  Brent-WTI Spread  Brent for May delivery climbed 52 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$109.48 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange. The April contract expired yesterday at $109.42. Brent
has dropped 1.2 percent this week, narrowing its premium to WTI
by $3.06 a barrel, the most since Oct. 19. The spread was at
$15.84 today, near the narrowest since January.  The differential will average about $16 a barrel this year
and narrow to $9 in 2014 as new pipeline capacity lowers the
cost of moving crude to  Gulf Coast  refiners from the central
U.S., the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said in a monthly report March 13.
The spread will average $7.50 during the second quarter of this
year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a March 11 report.  A doubling of the capacity on the Seaway pipeline to the
Gulf Coast may help clear a glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for the Nymex WTI contract. The boost to 850,000
barrels a day will be completed in the first quarter of 2014,
according to slides published by  Enterprise Products Partners
LP (EPD) , co-owner of Seaway, at a Feb. 28 Simmons Energy Conference
presentation.  Technical Resistance  Inventories at Cushing fell by 1.5 million barrels last
week, according to the EIA. That’s the biggest drop since May
2011, reducing stocks at the largest U.S. oil storage hub to the
lowest in 11 weeks.  Brent crude in  London  has technical resistance along its
200-day moving average, about $109.47 a barrel today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures this week fell below the
indicator, signaling a breach of long-term chart support, and
yesterday failed to settle above it. Sell orders tend to be
clustered near technical-resistance levels.  Oil output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries may rise by 850,000 barrels a day from April to June,
signaling a gain in prices as spare production capacity is
reduced, Morgan Stanley said in a report yesterday. The group,
which provides about 40 percent of global production, will pump
more as refineries end maintenance and utilities in  Saudi Arabia 
and  Japan  increase the use of crude and fuel oil for electricity
generation, the bank said.  WTI may fall next week after rising domestic production
boosted U.S. crude inventories to the highest level in eight
months, a Bloomberg survey showed. Thirteen of 29 analysts and
traders, or 45 percent, forecast prices will drop through March
22. Ten respondents, or 34 percent, predicted a gain. Six said
there would be little change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
