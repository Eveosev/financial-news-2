(Corrects from first paragraph to show default fund is in
addition to existing margins.)  South African derivatives clearing
members and the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange  will set aside 500
million rand ($54 million) for a fund aimed at protecting banks
from possible defaults.  Safcom , the clearing house for derivative contracts such as
single  stock futures , will set up a default fund where clearing
members and the JSE will contribute additional cash, the bourse
said in a statement today. The exchange currently calls for
about 14 billion rand in margin to cover trading of 350 billion
rand a day, the JSE said.  “The new fund reduces systemic risk as well as clearing
members’ exposure to counter-party credit risk when clearing
through Safcom,” Leila Fourie, director for post-trade services
at the stock exchange, said in an e-mailed statement.  The fund’s introduction follows the 2008 financial crisis
when Dealstream Securities Ltd., a South African derivatives
broker, collapsed and  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , the country’s second-
largest bank, lost money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
