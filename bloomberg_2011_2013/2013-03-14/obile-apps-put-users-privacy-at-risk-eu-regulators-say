Applications for smartphones and
tablets can pose “significant” privacy risks for consumers if
they aren’t aware of how their personal data is used, European
Union privacy regulators said.  “Although app developers want to provide new and
innovative services, the apps may have significant risks to the
private life and reputation of users of smart devices if they do
not comply with EU data-protection law,” the EU’s 27 data-
protection watchdogs said in a joint opinion, according to a
 statement  on the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s website.  The EU regulators said users “must be in control of their
own personal data” and informed how it’s used when they
download an app. Everyone involved in developing mobile software
programs “has a set of important responsibilities to create a
safe, secure and data-protection-compliant app environment,”
said the  Article 29 Data Protection Working Party , the umbrella
group for national privacy authorities in the EU.  EU Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  said earlier this
month that U.S.-based technology giants such as Google Inc.,
Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and other non-European companies that
offer services in the European Union must abide by the bloc’s
overhauled data-protection rules. Google and Facebook are among
several U.S. Internet companies that have faced scrutiny in the
EU for possible privacy-rule violations over their use of
personal data.  While the Article 29 group has no powers to enforce its
opinions directly, national data-protection regulators in  Europe 
have varying levels of power to take action, including the
levying of fines, against companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
