Wheat futures rose, capping the
longest rally in seven months, after a government report showed
higher overseas demand for U.S. supplies. Corn also climbed,
while soybeans declined.  In the week ended March 7, U.S. wheat exporters increased
 sales  44 percent from a week earlier to 888,540 metric tons, the
second-highest total since the marketing year began June 1, the
Department of Agriculture said in a report today. Premiums
shippers paid for the grain delivered to New Orleans yesterday
rose to the highest in two weeks, the USDA said.  “Export sales are improving,”  Shawn McCambridge , the
senior grain market analyst for Jefferies Bache LLC in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “The cash markets are starting
to firm up to acquire additional supplies.”  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 2.1 percent to close at
$7.2475 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
largest gain since Nov. 27. Prices have gained 6 percent in six
sessions, the longest rally since July 20.  There were 545 delivery receipts, linked to more than 2.7
million bushels of the grain, canceled in Toledo at the
Anderson’s Inc. grain terminal overnight, the CBOT said in a
 report . The canceled receipts mean the wheat may be moving from
stockpiles to replace corn in livestock rations, McCambridge
said.  In Toledo yesterday, wheat traded at a discount of 35.25
cents a bushel to corn. That compares with an average premium of
about 41 cents in the past year, according to USDA data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.9 percent to $7.165 a
bushel on the CBOT, the highest close since Feb. 6.  Soybeans futures dropped 0.8 percent to $14.355 a bushel in
 Chicago . Prices earlier reached $14.29, the lowest for a most-
active contract since Feb. 27.  About 11.66 million metric tons of the oilseed and soy
products were scheduled for shipment at leading Brazilian ports
as of today, up from 10.71 million a week earlier, according to
SA Commodities and Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
