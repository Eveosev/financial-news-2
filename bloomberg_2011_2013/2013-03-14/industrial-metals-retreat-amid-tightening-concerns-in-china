Lead declined from the highest
level in more than a week as copper and zinc dropped after
 China ’s central bank governor’s comments on inflation signaled a
heightened focus on controlling prices.  Lead for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.7
percent to $2,235 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $2,239 at 10:49 a.m. in Shanghai. Copper fell 0.2 percent
to $7,772 a ton and zinc dropped 0.3 percent to $1,977 a ton.  China should be on “high alert” over inflation after
February’s figures exceeded forecasts, the People’s Bank of
China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said. Growth of consumer prices
accelerated in February, while industrial output had the weakest
start to a year since 2009.  “Concerns over China’s macro economy persist,”  Li Peng ,
an analyst at Guotai Junan Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai. “Real estate is a so-called ‘pillar’ industry to the
Chinese economy and has a great impact on metals demand.”  Copper for delivery in July on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.5 percent to 56,530  yuan  ($9,094) a ton, as
metal for delivery in May on the Comex in New York was little
changed at $3.521 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
