The International Monetary Fund
called on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to help support
the economy of Gaza and the West Bank, where growth has been
slowing and unemployment is rising.  “The economy is hobbled by persistent restrictions and
increasing political uncertainty,” IMF staff said in a report
released today. “Urgent actions are needed -- by the
Palestinian Authority, by the government of Israel and by donors
-- to stabilize the fiscal position and rekindle economic growth
over time.”  The Washington-based IMF sees growth of 5 percent this year
in the Palestinian territories, compared with 6 percent last
year and an average of about 11 percent in 2010-2011. It expects
a “continuing downward trend in subsequent years.”  The Palestinian Authority needs to rein in its budget
deficit with caps on spending commitments, according to the
report, which also sees as “essential” an easing of Israeli
restrictions on external trade, and the movement of goods and
people in the region.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
