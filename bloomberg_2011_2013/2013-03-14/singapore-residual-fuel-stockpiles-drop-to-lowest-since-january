Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
7.1 percent to the lowest level in seven weeks, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen declined 1.42 million barrels to
18.6 million in the seven days to yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s
the lowest since the week ended Jan. 23.  Supplies of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene rebounded 602,000 barrels, or 6.4 percent, to 10
million barrels, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the first
gain in three weeks.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were down 238,000 barrels, or 2.4 percent, at 9.8
million barrels, according to the data. Stockpiles decreased for
a third week.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
