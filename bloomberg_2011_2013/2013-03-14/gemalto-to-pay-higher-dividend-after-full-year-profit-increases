Gemalto NV (GTO) , the maker of chips and
software that help make bank cards and mobile phones secure,
said spending will increase this year as it pushes into more
products as part of a growth plan and boosts its dividend.  Full-year net income rose 25 percent to 201 million euros
($260 million) as sales gained 11 percent to 2.25 billion euros,
Amsterdam-based Gemalto said today. Analysts predicted profit of
203 million euros on sales of 2.2 billion euros. The dividend
rises to 34 cents a share, a 10 percent boost from 2012.  Gemalto, which competes with  Germany ’s Giesecke & Devrient
GmbH and France’s Oberthur Technologies SA, is seeking to expand
in areas such as mobile payments to boost growth. An increase in
investments will lead to greater swings in  profit  from
operations between the two halves of 2013, Gemalto said. The
company projected “double digit” sales growth for 2013.  “The guidance for 2013 is great, but they invested a
little more than expected last year, which weighed on operating
profit,” said Sebastien Sztabowicz, a Kepler Capital Markets
analyst in Paris. “It’s normal to have some profit-taking
today, especially given how well the shares have performed.”  Operating profit last year was 305 million euros, trailing
Sztabowicz’s estimate of 315 million euros. Gemalto had targeted
300 million euros.  Gemalto fell 0.9 percent to 71.49 euros at 10:23 a.m. in
Paris. The  stock  has been trading on  France ’s leading CAC 40
index since Dec. 24 and rose 52 percent over the past 12 months.  No ‘Revolution’  Gemalto is preparing to unveil a new long-term development
plan in the second half, after reaching its 2013 operating
profit target -- set in 2010 as part of a three-year strategic
plan -- a year early.  The next phase of the company’s development will be an
extension of existing businesses, Chief Executive Officer
Olivier Piou said on a conference call.  “Our development will be essentially organic. Don’t expect
a big revolution,” Piou said. “That shows you the confidence
we have in our existing businesses and the potential there is to
develop them.”  Gemalto will focus on new applications such as mobile money
and mobile identification in the coming years, Piou said.  Piou, the 54-year-old executive who has run Gemalto since
it was created in 2006 through the merger of Gemplus
International SA and Axalto Holding NV, has been refocusing the
company from older commoditized smart chips to new security
technology. Piou is betting on the ramp-up of mobile payments
and machine-to-machine transmissions, as well as new
opportunities with companies such as  Facebook Inc. (FB)   To contact the reporter on this story:
