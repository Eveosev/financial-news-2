Diesel consumption in France
dropped 2.7 percent last month from a year earlier, continuing
the downward trend seen in 2012, according to the Union
Francaise des Industries Petrolieres, an industry group.  Gasoline demand dropped 8.7 percent in the same period, the
Paris-based group known as UFIP, said today on its website.  France’s fuel consumption in the first two months of the
year dropped 3.5 percent from a year earlier, Jean-Louis Schilansky, UFIP president, said in the statement.  Diesel prices  at the pump in France averaged 1.40 euros
($1.81) a liter in February, compared with last year’s peak of
1.46 euros at the end of August, according to European
Commission data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
