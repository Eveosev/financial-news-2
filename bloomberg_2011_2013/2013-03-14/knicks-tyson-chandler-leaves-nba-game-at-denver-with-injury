New York  Knicks center  Tyson Chandler  left tonight’s game at the Denver Nuggets late in the
first half with a bruised left knee and leading scorer Carmelo Anthony followed him off the court.  Chandler collided under the basket with Corey Brewer of the
Nuggets and was helped to the locker room by teammates. The
Knicks were losing 58-38 when Chandler, an All-Star for the
first time this season, was injured.  Anthony, who returned two nights ago at Golden State after
missing three games with a knee injury, went to the locker room
early in the second half.  The Knicks, who lost by 29 points two nights ago at Golden
State, already are missing forward Amar’e Stoudemire for six
weeks because of a knee surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
