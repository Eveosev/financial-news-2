European stocks  advanced to a 4
1/2-year high as the region’s policy makers gathered for a two-
day summit in Brussels and U.S. jobless-benefit claims fell to
the lowest level in almost two months.  Assicurazioni Generali SpA rallied the most in almost three
years after  Italy ’s biggest insurer reported increased operating
profit. HeidelbergCement AG climbed to the highest since 2008 as
debt declined more than estimated. Deutsche Lufthansa AG rose
3.6 percent as Europe’s second-largest airline agreed to buy
aircraft from Airbus SAS.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  climbed 1.1 percent to 298.52 at
the close of trading, the highest level since June 2008. The
benchmark measure has risen 6.7 percent this year as data on
U.S. payrolls and Chinese exports bolstered confidence in the
global economic recovery and central banks around the world
continued stimulus measures.  “Markets are grinding higher, pushed by better-than-
expected U.S. data resisting fiscal headwinds,” said Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion as senior strategist at
PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen. “On the other hand, anxiety is
growing steadily, primarily regarding euro-zone developments.
Nobody is expecting anything concrete from the summit, but there
is the potential for surprises, for example on Cyprus.”  European Summit  European leaders gathered for a two-day summit today, with
euro-area finance ministers meeting separately tomorrow to
discuss a bailout for Cyprus. Policy makers may loosen austerity
measures as the recession and mounting unemployment in southern
 Europe  overtake the debt crisis as the region’s biggest
headache.  In the U.S.,  applications  for jobless benefits dropped by
10,000 to 332,000 in the week ended March 9 from a revised

percent to the highest since July 2011.  Generali (G)  surged 9.4 percent to 13.33 euros, the biggest
jump since May 2010. The insurer said fourth-quarter operating
profit increased 12 percent from a year earlier to 928 million
euros ($1.2 billion), boosted by the non-life insurance
business.  HeidelbergCement Debt  HeidelbergCement advanced 3 percent to 56.22 euros, the
highest price since October 2008. The German cement maker said
 debt  declined more than expected last year as improved earnings
covered dividends and repayments. Borrowings fell 700 million
euros to 7 billion euros, while analysts had predicted 7.4
billion euros.  Lufthansa rose 56 cents to 16.05 euros. The company agreed
to renew its short-haul fleet with 100 mostly fuel-efficient
aircraft from Airbus, as the airline seeks to cut kerosene costs
that constitute its single biggest expense.  Booker Group Plc, Britain’s biggest food wholesaler, jumped
7.8 percent to 125 pence, the highest price in seven years,
after the U.K. Competition Commission provisionally approved its
acquisition of Makro Holding Ltd.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  added 6.9 percent to 1,965 pence as the world’s
largest provider of mobile power supplies won a contract in
Mozambique and  Namibia .  France Telecom  France Telecom SA and Telefonica SA rose 6.6 percent to
8.47 euros and 4 percent to 11.50 euros, respectively. A gauge

largest potash maker predicted earnings and revenue will
increase this year.  OC Oerlikon Corp. (OERL)  fell 2 percent to 12.40 Swiss francs,
paring an earlier loss of as much as 4.4 percent. The world’s

executive officer to replace Michael Buscher, who led the
company through a reorganization since joining in 2010.  Chief Financial Officer Juerg Fedier will act as interim
CEO, the Pfaeffikon, Switzerland-based company said, without
