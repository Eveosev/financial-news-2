Swedish  unemployment  rose last
month as companies in the export-dependent country suffer from
falling demand mainly from recession-burdened  Europe .  Seasonally adjusted unemployment  rose to 8.2 percent from 8
percent the previous month, the Stockholm-based statistics
office said today. The rate  was predicted  to rise to 8.1
percent, according to the median estimate of seven economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The  non-seasonally adjusted rate  rose to
8.5 percent from 8.4 percent.  The Riksbank left its main lending rate unchanged at 1
percent last month after cutting it four times since December
2011 to cushion the effects of the  European debt crisis .  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the worldâ€™s largest maker of mobile phone
networks, and truck maker Volvo AB, are among exporters who have
announced it will cut jobs. Sweden sells about half of its
output abroad, of which about 70 percent go to Europe where
countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
