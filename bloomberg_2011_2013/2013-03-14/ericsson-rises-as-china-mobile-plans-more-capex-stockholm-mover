Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks, rose to its highest level since 2011
after  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  announced plans to boost capital
expenditure by 49 percent this year.  Ericsson jumped as much as 3.4 percent to 86.4 kronor, the
highest level since July 2011. The share traded 1.9 kronor, or
2.3 percent, higher at 85.5 kronor as at 11:01 a.m. in
Stockholm, its fourth day of gains. Trading volume was less than
half the three-month daily average.  China Mobile, the world’s largest phone company by users,
said it will raise capital spending to 190.2 billion  yuan  ($30.6
billion) in 2013 from 127.4 billion yuan a year earlier,
Chairman  Xi Guohua  said at a briefing in Hong Kong. Ericsson
supplies the carrier with wireless gear, which accounts for four
percent of the Stockholm-based company’s full-year sales,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Last year, China and north-east Asia supplied Ericsson with
17 percent of total sales. The company is trying to sell more
services such as network management and maintenance in the
region to help offset competition, such as from China’s Huawei
Technologies Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
