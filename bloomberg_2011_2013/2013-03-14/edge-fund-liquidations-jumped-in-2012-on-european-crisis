Hedge-fund liquidations rose to a
three-year high in 2012 as the  European debt crisis  and concerns
about global economic growth hurt performance for the $2.3
trillion industry, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.  The number of firms shut jumped to 873, the most since
2009, the Chicago-based data provider said in a statement today.
Still, the net number of  hedge funds  increased after money
managers started 1,108 firms last year, it said.  Smaller hedge funds have been hardest hit by the global
financial turmoil that has made it more difficult to raise money
from investors since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in 2008. Hedge funds managing more than $5 billion got 65
percent of the $3.4 billion of assets that flowed into the
industry in last year’s fourth quarter while firms with less
than $1 billion reaped 8.7 percent, Hedge Fund Research said.  “The capital-raising environment continued to be
challenging for emerging managers, including both small and mid-
sized funds, as well as newly launched funds,” Kenneth Heinz,
Hedge Fund Research’s president, said in the statement. “To
raise new investor capital, hedge funds must not only
demonstrate both superior performance and an innovative
strategy, but also increased organizational efficiencies.”  Hedge funds have historically charged investors a 2 percent
fee to manage assets, while keeping 20 percent of any investment
gains. Average industry management fees declined 1 basis point
last year to 1.56 percent, while performance fees fell 17 basis
points to 18.54 percent, Hedge Fund Research said.  More than a third of hedge funds that shut in 2012 invested
in stocks, after the returns of equity-focused hedge funds on
average  failed  to beat the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  for a
third straight year. Equity hedge funds rose 8 percent from 2009
through 2012, trailing the 36 percent gain for the S&P with
dividends reinvested, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The 238 hedge fund liquidations in the fourth quarter of
2012 was the highest over a quarterly period since 240 closed in
the first three months of 2010, Hedge Fund Research said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
