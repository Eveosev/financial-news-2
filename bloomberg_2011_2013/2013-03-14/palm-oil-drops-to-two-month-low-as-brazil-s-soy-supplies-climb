Palm oil declined to the lowest
level since January on concern that a bumper soybean crop in
 Brazil , poised to be the world’s largest grower this year, will
boost global oilseed supplies and damp demand.  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 1.5
percent to 2,362 ringgit ($759) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest most-active price since Jan. 14.
Futures were 2,363 ringgit at close of the morning session in
Kuala Lumpur, down 30 percent in the past year.  About 11.9 million tons of soybeans and its products were
scheduled for shipment at major ports in Brazil as of yesterday,
up from 10.77 million tons a week ago, according to SA
Commodities and Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos. The country is
set to overtake the U.S. this year as the top exporter of the
beans that can be crushed to make soybean oil.  “Buyers know that the supply is coming, so they may be
only willing to offer lower prices,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun,
an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd., referring to
oilseeds from Brazil.  Soybean oil for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to 49.41
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May delivery retreated 0.5 percent to $14.40 a bushel. Soybean
oil was about 1.44 times  costlier  than palm.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September dropped 0.7
percent to 6,296  yuan  ($1,012) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month was little
changed at 8,032 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
