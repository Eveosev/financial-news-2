Indonesian stocks fell, dragging
the benchmark  index (JCI)  down by the most in six months, on concern
the government’s efforts to rein in fuel subsidies will boost
living costs and spur inflation.  The Jakarta Composite Index dropped 1.4 percent to 4,766.67
at 11:12 a.m. in Jakarta, heading for sharpest fall since Aug.
30. PT Unilever Indonesia, the largest consumer company in the
index by market capitalization, was the biggest drag on the
gauge today, falling 4 percent.  “There’s an expectation that there will be a fuel price
hike,” Ferry Wong, head of Indonesia equity research at
Citigroup Inc.’s Indonesia unit, said by phone today. “It would
be negative for the short term. People are also locking in
profits.”  The benchmark stock gauge has risen 10 percent this year,
driving reported earnings to 18.9 times. It traded at 19.4 times
profit on March 8, the highest level since January 2011.  Inflation accelerated to a 20-month high in February on
higher food price and power tariffs, reducing the scope for the
central bank to cut interest rates. President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono said yesterday the government is formulating a more
targeted fuel subsidy policy as costs increase.  PT Astra International, the nation’s largest company, fell
1.3 percent. Instant noodle-maker PT Indofood Sukses Makmur fell
4.5 percent, bound for its biggest drop since June 4.
Pharmaceutical company PT Kalbe Farma fell 3.2 percent, the most
since Dec. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
