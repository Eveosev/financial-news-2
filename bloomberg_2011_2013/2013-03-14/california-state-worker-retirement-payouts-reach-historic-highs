California  lawmakers should require
state workers to use their vacation time rather than bank it
until retirement, the Legislative Analyst’s Office said after
finding the costs to taxpayers has reached historic highs.  More than 23,700 public employees have exceeded the maximum
vacation time they can bank, after time off increased by 50
percent when workers were forced to take unpaid leave, or
furloughs, to trim payroll costs, the LAO said today in a
 report . The liability for unused leave grew to  $3.9 billion  in
2011 from $1.4 billion in 2003, according to state financial
reports.  Payroll data compiled by Bloomberg on 1.4 million public
workers in the 12 most populous states, published in December,
showed how managers and employees throughout California
government ignore limits on accrual of paid vacation and other
leave, leading to lump severance payouts. A psychiatrist
retiring from a mental hospital in Napa was paid $608,821 in
2011 after banking 72 weeks’ worth of time off.  California costs will continue to grow next year, the LAO
said, as most state employees receive a 3 percent to 5 percent
pay increase in July. That means state workers will get paid for
those banked vacation days at their new pay rate, not at what
they were earning when they amassed the days off.  The nonpartisan LAO said lawmakers should impose a “use it
or lose it” cap on future time-off accruals and institute a
buyback program to reduce long-term costs. New Jersey caps lump-
sum payments at $15,000 per state employee, and such limits are
common at private companies.  ‘Strict Cap’  “Most of the other states we looked at have some form of a
strict cap on the amount of vacation/annual leave that employees
may accumulate,” the analyst’s office said in the report.  Governor  Jerry Brown , a 74-year-old Democrat, has proposed
a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 that doesn’t
include more furloughs.  More than 111,000 people who left jobs as employees of the
12 most populous U.S. states collected $711 million in 2011 for
unused vacation and other paid time off, according to payroll
data compiled by Bloomberg.  California employees  accounted for 39 percent of that
total. Since 2005, the state’s workers collected $1.4 billion
for accumulated leave.  Base Pay  In the seven years ending in 2011, more than 1,390 full-
time California state workers collected retirement checks that
were greater than their annual base pay, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Those workers were paid a total of $141 million,
or an average of $101,274.  More than 19,000 lump-sum payments totaling $275 million
were issued in California in 2011, an average of $14,110 each.
The average payment in the other 11 states was $4,764.  California recipients included a pair of prison dentists
who cashed out $784,000 combined, and a highway patrol chief who
took a $280,258 check when he retired. Of the 100 biggest
payments in 2011 in the dozen states, all but 10 went to
California state workers. The average payout for the top 100 was
$178,267, in addition to regular wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
