Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of luxury cars, appointed former Audi AG
sales chief  Peter Schwarzenbauer  to its management board, adding
expertise from its nearest rival.  Schwarzenbauer, 53, will take over the responsibilities of
Harald Krueger and oversee the Mini and Rolls-Royce car brands,
BMW motorcycles and after-sales operations, the Munich-based
manufacturer said in a statement today.  Krueger will remain on the management board and become
BMW’s head of production as of April 1 as part of the changes.
The current head of production, Frank-Peter Arndt, decided to
leave the company for health reasons, BMW said.  BMW and Audi are battling for the global top spot in luxury
car sales, with the BMW brand securing a 407-car lead in the
first two months of 2013. Schwarzenbauer, Audi’s sales chief for
more than four years, led the brand’s pursuit by raising its
U.S. presence, increasing sales in  China  and gaining market
share in  Europe .  Schwarzenbauer was passed over in a broader management
revamp by Audi’s parent company  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and left the
company in August. Audi has vowed to overtake BMW in sales by
the end of the decade. Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz is pursuing
the same goal.  Schwarzenbauer started his career at BMW in 1984 and left
after 10 years to join Porsche AG. He led the sports-car maker’s
North American business from 2003 until moving to Audi in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
