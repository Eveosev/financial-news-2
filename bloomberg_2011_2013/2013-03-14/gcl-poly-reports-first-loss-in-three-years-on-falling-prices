GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
world’s biggest maker of polysilicon, reported its first full-
year loss since 2009 as prices sank on a glut of supply and
global economic uncertainty.  The loss was HK$3.52 billion ($454 million) for the 12
months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of HK$4.27 billion
a year earlier, GCL-Poly said today in a filing to the Hong Kong
stock exchange. The loss was almost triple the HK$1.2 billion
mean  estimate  of 19 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “Market prices of polysilicon and wafer continued to
decline in 2012,” the company said in the statement. The
company will “actively seek the use of low-cost long-term
financing products to strengthen our  capital structure  and
solidify our operations,” it said.  A glut across the solar-component industry has combined
with slowing demand to send prices tumbling and drive some
companies into bankruptcy. The 17-member BI Global Large Solar
index has fallen 25 percent in the past year.  Wafer prices dropped 24 percent last year while the average
spot price of  polysilicon , the raw material for most solar
panels, was down 40 percent, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance data.  The tumble led companies including units of  Baoding Tianwei
Baobian Electric Co. (600550)  to halt production and prompted GCL-Poly to
stop expansion last year.  Jiangsu Sunshine Co. (600220) , a Chinese maker
of textile products and raw material for solar panels, in
January filed for bankruptcy at its polysilicon unit after
failing to cope with a decline in prices.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
