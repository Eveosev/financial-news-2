Spot gasoline in  San Francisco 
gained for a third day against futures as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
performed work at the Benicia plant in Northern California amid
tight West Coast supplies.  The hydrocracker at the 170,000-barrel-a-day Benicia
refinery was offline today because of work on a hydrogen plant,
 Bill Day , a Valero spokesman in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.
Stockpiles of California-blend gasoline dropped 5.5 percent last
week to 6.24 million barrels, the lowest level since Dec. 28,
according to the state Energy Commission. Output fell 3.2
percent to 6.01 million barrels during the period.  Carbob in San Francisco gained 4 cents to a discount of 8
cents a gallon against futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4 p.m., the highest level since Feb. 26, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The same fuel in  Los Angeles  gained 1.5 cents to a discount
of 8.5 cents a gallon, the second straight advance against
futures.  BP Plc (BP/) â€™s Carson refinery may run at lower rates for
several days during work on a fluid catalytic cracker, a person
with knowledge of the maintenance said yesterday.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles tumbled
3.12 cents against Nymex heating oil futures to a premium of
1.38 cents a gallon, the lowest level since Dec. 18. The same
fuel in San Francisco rose 1 cent to a premium of 7.5 cents.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  low-sulfur diesel  fell by 2 cents to
premium of 13.5 cents a gallon against futures, the second
straight decline. Conventional, 84-octane gasoline in Portland
was unchanged versus gasoline futures at a discount of 16 cents
a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
