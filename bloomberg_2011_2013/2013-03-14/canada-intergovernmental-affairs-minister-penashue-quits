Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs
Minister Peter Penashue is resigning from that job and as a
member of Parliament, citing “ineligible donations” accepted
by his election campaign.  “Although I was unaware of the inaccuracies in the return,
I believe I must be accountable to the people who elected me and
therefore I am stepping down as the Member of Parliament for
Labrador and will seek re-election through a by-election,” he
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a separate statement
that Transport Minister Denis Lebel will replace Penashue as
intergovernmental affairs minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
