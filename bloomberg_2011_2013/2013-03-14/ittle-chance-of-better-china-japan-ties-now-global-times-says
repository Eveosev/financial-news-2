There is almost “no possibility”
that  China  and  Japan  will restore ties to the level they were
before an island dispute so long as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
remains in power, the Global Times newspaper said.  China should aim to force the Abe government to negotiate
over islands in the East China Sea claimed by both sides, the
paper said in an editorial. Doing so would be a strategic
victory though it could create the risk of war, the state-run
newspaper said.  Tensions between China and Japan over the islands, known as
Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, have damaged the two
countries’ $340 billion trade relationship. Chinese law
enforcement vessels have conducted numerous patrols this year
around the islands. The deputy head of China’s mapping agency
said surveyors will land on the island at an “appropriate
time,” China National Radio reported March 12.  “China needs to give up its dreaming and should be tough
in response to Abe’s toughness,” the Chinese-language editorial
said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
