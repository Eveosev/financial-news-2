The Dow Jones Industrial Average
extended the longest rally since 1996 as U.S. jobless claims
unexpectedly dropped, while European stocks rose to an almost
five-year high as policy makers gathered for a two-day summit.
Treasuries pared earlier losses and commodities gained.  The Dow added 0.6 percent in its 10th straight gain and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to 1,563.23, about
0.1 percent below its 2007 record, as of 4 p.m. in New York. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 1.1 percent to the highest level
since June 2008. Ten-year Treasury note yields added one basis
points to 2.03 percent after jumping five basis points earlier.
 Australia ’s dollar reached a one-month high versus the dollar as
payrolls grew the most in almost 13 years.  The number of Americans filing applications for
unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in
almost two months, data from the Labor Department showed today.
As stocks rallied, the benchmark gauge of U.S. equity options
sank to the lowest level in six years amid reduced demand for
contracts to protect against losses in stocks.  “We’re feeling a lot better about the general state of the
world and the U.S. economy today than we could have said a year
ago,” Richard Slinn, investment specialist at JPMorgan Private
Bank, which oversees $877 billion in client assets, said from
San Francisco. “The market is reflecting fundamental
improvement and earnings growth, revenue growth, dividend
growth, more than it is price momentum.”  Market Movers  Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp.
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose more than 1.6 percent to lead the
 Dow’s gain  today.  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  added 1.6 percent after  being raised  to
overweight from equalweight at Evercore Partners Inc. CBS Corp.
climbed 2.2 percent after introducing a new iPhone and iPad app.
Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.4 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co.

stake.  The S&P 500 rose to within two points of its all-time high
in 2007. The Dow set a new record high for an eighth straight
day.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, slid 4.5 percent to 11.30, its lowest since
February 2007.  When the S&P 500 reached a record high on Oct.
9, 2007, the VIX finished the day at 16.12. The measure of the
cost of options to insure against stock losses declined for four
straight  years  through 2006 and slid to a 13-year low of 9.89 in
January 2007 before reversing the losses and jumping to an all-
time peak of 80.86 in November 2008 amid the height of the
financial crisis.  Banks, Fed  After financial markets closed in New York, the Federal
Reserve said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
the world’s biggest trading firms, must submit new capital plans
to regulators to address weaknesses in their planning processes
found.  The central bank didn’t object to the two New York-based
firms’ capital plans, and approved 14 other banks’ proposals,
the Fed said today in a statement. Capital plans submitted by
Ally Financial Inc. and BB&T Corp. were rejected, while American
Express Co. had to revise its submission to win approval.   BB&T (BBT)  lost 2.7 percent and Goldman Sachs lost 1.3 percent in
extended trading as of 5:04 p.m. in New York. Bank of America
Corp. jumped 4.6 percent after winning approval to buy back as
much as $5 billion in stock in its first repurchase program
since the financial crisis.  Senate Probe  JPMorgan lost 2 percent after hours. A Senate probe found
that the bank’s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon sought to
hide escalating  trading losses that surpassed $6.2 billion by
misleading investors and dodging regulators as the position
deteriorated last year. JPMorgan also announced plans to buy
back up to $6 billion in shares and boost its quarterly  dividend 
to 38 cents a share from 35 cents.  Stocks opened higher and remained up for the entire day
after the jobless claims data.  First-time claims fell by 10,000
to 332,000 in the week ended March 9, the fewest since mid
January, according to the Labor Department. The median forecast
of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase to
350,000. The four-week average declined to a five-year low.  Treasury Auction  Treasuries fell after the U.S. auctioned $13 billion of 30-
year bonds amid signs the world’s biggest economy is gathering
strength.  Losses were tempered as yields at almost 11-month highs
attracted buyers. The sale drew a yield of 3.248 percent, the
highest since March 2012, compared with an average forecast of
3.243 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Federal
Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt
offered, was 2.43, the lowest since August, versus 2.74 last
month.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  headed for a fourth straight week of gains.

biggest insurer said fourth-quarter operating income rose 12
percent. HeidelbergCement AG climbed 3 percent as debt declined
more than estimated.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  jumped 12 percent in
 London  after the operator of Homebase and Argos stores raised
its full-year profit estimate.  European leaders gathered for a two-day summit today, with
euro-area finance ministers meeting separately tomorrow to
discuss a bailout for Cyprus. Policy makers may loosen austerity
measures as the recession and mounting unemployment in southern
Europe overtake the debt crisis as the region’s biggest
headache.  ‘Risk On’  “The risk-on sentiment is backed on the fact that tail-
risks in  Europe  have diminished,” said Alessandro Bee, an
economist and fixed-income strategist in Zurich at Bank Sarasin
& Cie AG, which manages the equivalent of $104 billion.
“Economic indicators in the U.S are trending up and there’s
expectations central banks will keep their accommodative
policies.”  Australia’s dollar strengthened as much as 1 percent to
$1.0401, the strongest level since Feb. 6, after a government
report showed the number of people employed in February jumped
71,500, the biggest monthly increase since July 2000.  The Norwegian krone weakened against 15 of its 16 major
peers, dropping more than 1 percent versus the euro for its
biggest decline since 2012, after the Norges Bank kept benchmark
interest rates unchanged at a sixth consecutive meeting and
Governor Oeystein Olsen said the key policy rate may be kept low
for longer than previously anticipated.  Spanish Bonds  Spain’s 10-year bonds declined, pushing the  yield  nine
basis points higher to 4.86 percent. A report showed retail
