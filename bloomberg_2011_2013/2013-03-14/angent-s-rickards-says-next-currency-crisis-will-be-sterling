The next currency crisis will be in
the pound, according to  James Rickards , senior managing director
at Tangent Capital Partners LLC.  “Look for sterling to go down a lot,”  he said in an

Francine Lacqua.  The pound was little changed at $1.4936 as of 9:01 a.m.
London time. It traded at 86.76 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
