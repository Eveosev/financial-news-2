Canadian  stocks  rose, after falling
the most since November yesterday, as energy shares gained
following an unexpected decline in U.S. jobless claims that sent
oil prices higher.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  and Advantage Oil & Gas
Ltd. increased at least 4.4 percent, as crude rose to a three-
week high.  First Quantum Minerals (FM)  Ltd. advanced 3.2 percent for
its highest close in two months, after an analyst raised his
rating for the stock.  Quebecor Inc. (QBR/B)  declined the most in 19
months following the media company’s announcement of lower-than-
forecast earnings and a management shuffle.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 55.80
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,799.91 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
S&P/TSX has risen 3 percent this year, underperforming every
developed market in the world except  Hong Kong  and  Italy .
Trading volume was 8 percent above the 30-day average.  “Energy prices are firming up here, which is helping the
TSX today, but without stronger metals and Chinese performance
it’s hard to get too excited,” said Youssef Zohny, a portfolio
manager with Richardson GMP Ltd., on the phone from  Vancouver .
Richardson GMP manages about C$15 billion ($15 billion).  Oil rose 0.6 percent to $93.03 in  New York , erasing earlier

and Advantage Oil & Gas gained 6.5 percent to C$3.46.

an ounce, erasing earlier losses of as much as 0.8 percent.  First Quantum Minerals gained 3.2 percent to C$21.83, its
highest close since Jan. 4. Alex Terentiew, analyst with Raymond
James Ltd., raised his rating for the stock to outperform from

C$22.  The mining company said March 12 it “anticipates being in

holders tendered their stock to First Quantum. Inmet rose 1.6
percent to C$71.94.  Quebecor, a cable operator and newspaper publisher, plunged
5.2 percent to C$43.66, the biggest decline since August 2011.  The Montreal-based company said adjusted profit of 89
