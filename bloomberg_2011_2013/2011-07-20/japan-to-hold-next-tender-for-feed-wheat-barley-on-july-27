Japan  will hold a tender for a
maximum of 50,000 metric tons of feed wheat and 200,000 tons of
feed barley on July 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries said today.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, didn’t purchase anything today because of a lack of
demand from end-users, Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain-
trade division said by phone.  Tenders are held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-
sell system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
