Copper fell from a three-month high
after existing home sales unexpectedly declined in the U.S., the
world’s largest user of the metal after  China .  Sales of previously owned homes dropped to a 4.77 million
pace, the lowest in seven months, the National Association of
Realtors said today. The median projection in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a gain to 4.9 million. Builders are the
biggest copper users in the U.S. Stockpiles monitored by the
 London  Metal Exchange gained for the fifth time in six days.  “The housing data basically stopped the rally for the time
being,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview today. “We are starting
to see supply building up at the LME.”  Copper futures for September delivery fell 3.2 cents, or
0.7 percent, to close at $4.436 a pound at 1:22 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest decline since July 11. Yesterday,
the price touched $4.496, the highest since April 11.  The metal has dropped 4.8 percent from a record $4.6575 on
Feb. 15 on signs of slowing growth in China.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months declined
$85, or 0.9 percent, to $9,755 a metric ton ($4.42 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc fell in London. Tin rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
