A Bangladesh cabinet committee has
approved an elevated expressway project to help ease traffic and
cargo movement within the country and to neighboring India,
Nepal and Bhutan, Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said.  The 34-kilometer (21-mile) road will cost about $2 billion,
according to the website of the  Bangladesh Bridge Authority ,
which will help execute the project.  The Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway Project will be built
by government and private companies, Muhith told reporters in
Dhaka today after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic
affairs, which approved the project. Companies have to submit
bids by July 31 to pre-qualify for the expressway construction
contract, the proposal said.  The road will be an extension of the 26-kilometer Dhaka
Elevated Expressway, which is being built to link the capitalâ€™s
Shahjalal International Airport to the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway.  The expressway will benefit 40 million Bangladeshis,
according to the project proposal submitted at the cabinet
committee meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
