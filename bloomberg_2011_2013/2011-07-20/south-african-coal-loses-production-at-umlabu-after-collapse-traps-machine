South African Coal Mining Holdings
Ltd. (SAH)  said it’s lost about 7,820 metric tons of production at its
Umlabu-Mooifontein underground mine after a “fall of ground”
resulted in a mining machine being trapped underground.  “It is too early to determine the impact on future
production,” the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
