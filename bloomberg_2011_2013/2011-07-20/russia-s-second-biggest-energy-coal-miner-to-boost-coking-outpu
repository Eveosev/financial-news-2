OAO  Kuzbassrazrezugol (KZRU) ,  Russia ’s
second-largest producer of coal for power stations, will raise
output of coking coal used to make steel as prices climb.  The producer, based in Kemerovo and controlled by Russian
billionaire Iskandar Makhmudov, will boost output of coking coal
concentrate 12 percent this year to 3.37 million metric tons,
according to the company’s annual report posted on  its website .  Overall coal output will drop to 47 million tons from 49.7
million tons as the company seeks to mine more efficiently, it
said. Exports will increase 3.4 percent to 25 million tons.  Sales rose 2 percent last year to 50.7 billion rubles ($1.8
billion) and net income was flat at 7.4 billion rubles using
Russian accounting standards, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
