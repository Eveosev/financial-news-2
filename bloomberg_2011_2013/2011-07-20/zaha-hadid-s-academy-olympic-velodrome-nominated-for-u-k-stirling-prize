Zaha Hadid , the Iraqi-born architect
who last year won the U.K.’s RIBA Stirling Prize for her MAXXI
Museum in Rome, is shortlisted again this year for her design of
a school in Brixton, south  London .  The other five nominees for the U.K.’s top architecture
prize include David Chipperfield (the 2007 winner) for his
Folkwang Museum in Essen,  Germany ; and Hopkins Architects, for
the  London 2012 Olympics  Velodrome.  “This year’s shortlist features the first Olympic venue, a
beautifully clever exemplar for the U.K.’s games,” said Ruth
Reed, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects,
which oversees the  prize-giving  to the best new European
building “built or designed in Britain.”  The winner will be announced on Saturday Oct. 1.  Hadid’s shortlisted building, the Evelyn Grace Academy,
cost 36.5 million pounds ($59 million) and has a bending facade
of concrete and glass that vaguely recalls her MAXXI in  Rome .  The other three nominees are: the Royal Shakespeare Theatre
in Stratford-Upon-Avon (Bennetts Associates Architects); the
Angel Building in London (by  Allford Hall Monaghan Morris ); and
the An Gaelaras cultural center in Derry, Northern Ireland
(O’Donnell and Tuomey).  To contact the writer on the story:
