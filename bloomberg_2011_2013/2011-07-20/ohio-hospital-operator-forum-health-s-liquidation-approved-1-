Forum Health, an operator of three
hospitals in northeast  Ohio , won bankruptcy court approval of
its liquidation plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kay Woods confirmed the Chapter 11
plan of Warren, Ohio-based Forum Health, at the conclusion of a
two-day hearing today in Youngstown, Ohio, according to a filing
in the court docket.  The company, which operated Trumbull, Northside Medical
Center and Hillside hospitals, sold most of its assets at an
auction in August to CHS  Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH)  for
$120 million. The liquidation plan was approved over the
objection of the committee of unsecured creditors, which had
submitted its own Chapter 11 plan before withdrawing it.  Under the plan, general unsecured creditors would recover
from 5.49 percent to 8.43 percent of claims estimated at
$162 million.  Forum Health filed for Chapter 11 creditor protection in
March 2009. Court papers stated that the company’s service area
experienced a “severe economic decline during a period in which
the broad economy flourished and its population declined.”  Forum had “difficulty recruiting new physicians,” its
labor costs were higher than the national average and pension
obligations were “significant.”  The company lost about $100 million in the four years
before the Chapter 11 filing, according to court papers.  The case is Forum Health, 09-40795,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court ,
Northern District of Ohio (Youngstown).  To contact the reporter on this story:
