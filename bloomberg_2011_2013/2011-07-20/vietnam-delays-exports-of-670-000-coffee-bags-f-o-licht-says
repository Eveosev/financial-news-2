Coffee exporters in  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety, have delayed
shipments of 670,000 bags of 60 kilograms (132 pounds), German
researcher F.O. Licht said, citing unidentified traders.  The shipments were delayed because of “thin domestic
stocks and a jump in local market prices beyond export levels,”
Licht said in a July 1 to 18 report.  About two-thirds of the shipment was delayed by two major
exporters, including a “major company in the Central Highlands
coffee belt,” it said, without being specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
