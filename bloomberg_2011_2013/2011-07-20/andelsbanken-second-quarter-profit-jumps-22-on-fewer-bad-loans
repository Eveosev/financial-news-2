Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) ,  Sweden ’s
second-largest lender, rose the most in 10 months in Stockholm
trading after the company posted a 22 percent increase in
second-quarter profit on narrowing loan losses.  Handelsbanken reported net income of 3.14 billion kronor
($480 million), beating the 2.97 billion-krona average estimate
of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Loan losses narrowed to
172 million kronor from 369 million kronor, the company said.  Sweden, home to four of the Nordic region’s six biggest
banks, wants its lenders to follow stricter capital standards
than those set out by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision , and to push the changes through earlier. Nordea
Bank AB, Handelsbanken, Swedbank AB and SEB AB all passed the
European Banking Authority’s stress test on July 15 with a core
Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, of at
least 8.6 percent under an adverse scenario.  The earnings reinforce Handelbanken’s “safe haven status
during a volatile climate for European banks,” said Andrew Lim,
banking analyst at Banco Espirito Santo SA in  London .  Handelsbanken shares climbed as much as 5.2 percent, the
biggest increase since Sept. 1, and were 4.5 kronor, or 2.4
percent, higher at 194.40 kronor as of 10:51 a.m. in Stockholm.  “Higher demand from companies during the second quarter
contributed to a break in the trend of decreasing volumes,”
Handelsbanken said in a statement.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
earns from lending and what it pays on deposits, rose 12 percent
to 5.68 billion kronor in the quarter, while net fee and
commission income slipped 2 percent to 1.95 billion kronor.  Handelsbanken said today its Tier 1 capital ratio under
 Basel II  was 17.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
