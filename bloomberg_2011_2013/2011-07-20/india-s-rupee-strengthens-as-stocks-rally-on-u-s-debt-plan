India ’s rupee strengthened for a
second day on speculation the nation’s relatively higher yields
will lure overseas funds to add to their debt holdings.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
six major trading partners, fell 0.4 percent today to its lowest
level in two weeks. Foreign funds bought $493 million of Indian
debt this month, increasing their outstanding holdings to $21.2
billion as of yesterday. India’s bond yields are the highest
among Asian countries with investment grade.  “Inflows into debt have been healthy,” said R.N. Hirve,
chief currency trader at state-owned  Central Bank of India  in
Mumbai. “The dollar’s weakness against major currencies is also
benefiting the rupee.”  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 44.46 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 44.4450 earlier, the strongest level since July 14.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.99 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.05 yesterday.
