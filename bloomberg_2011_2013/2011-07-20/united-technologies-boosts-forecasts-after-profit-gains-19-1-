United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  boosted
its sales and earnings forecasts for the year after second-
quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates amid gains in the
Carrier air-conditioning division.  Sales in 2011 may be $58 billion, compared with a previous
forecast of at least $57 billion, the Hartford, Connecticut-
based company said today in a statement. Full-year profit will
be higher than previously forecast at $5.35 to $5.45 a share,
the company said.  Second-quarter net income rose to $1.32 billion, or $1.45 a
share, from, $1.11 billion, or $1.20, a year earlier, the
Hartford, Connecticut-based company said. That surpassed the
$1.42 average estimate from 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales climbed 9.2 percent to $15.1 billion, higher than the
average estimate of $14.7 billion.  Revenue from operations owned at least a year rose in all
six divisions as orders for new equipment at Otis elevators and
Carrier air conditioners as well as spare parts at Hamilton
Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney units increased. The company now
expects to buy back stock valued at more than $2.5 billion this
year, Chief Executive  Louis Chenevert  said in the statement.  United Technologies, which gets more than half its sales
from outside the U.S., benefited from conversion of foreign
currency into U.S. dollars, which the company said made up  4
percentage points of its revenue gain and helped drive the full-
year forecast increase. United Technologies gets more than half
its sales from outside the U.S., with about a quarter from
 Europe .  The full-year forecast is in-line with analysts’
projections of $5.44 a share in profit on revenue of $57.8
billion.  Quarterly results included costs to restructure of about 5
cents a share offset by 5 cents in one-time gains, United
Technologies said.  United Technologies climbed $2.38, or 2.7 percent, to
$91.20 at 7:31 a.m., before the start of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. The shares gained 34 percent in the 12
months before today, compared with a 24 percent rise in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
