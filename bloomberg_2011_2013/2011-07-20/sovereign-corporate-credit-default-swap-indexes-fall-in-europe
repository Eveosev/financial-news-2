The cost of insuring against default
on sovereign and corporate bonds fell for a second day on
optimism agreements will be reached to resolve debt crises in
the U.S. and  Greece .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped 17 basis points to 278
at 11:30 a.m. in London. Swaps on  U.S. Treasuries  fell 3 basis
points to 51, down from a 2 1/2-year high of 56 on July 18,
according to CMA.  Investors are betting U.S. lawmakers will reach a
compromise to raise the government’s debt limit before the Aug.
2 deadline after President  Barack Obama  endorsed a bipartisan
deficit-cutting proposal yesterday. European officials may
consider plans previously rejected by  Germany  at tomorrow’s
Brussels summit to prevent contagion to Spain and Italy.  “Markets around the globe are breathing a sigh of relief
that the U.S. may be close to agreeing a debt ceiling extension
and deficit reduction deal,” said Simon Ballard, a strategist
at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “The same goes for the
Eurozone. Ahead of tomorrow’s EU summit, the assumption that a
solution for the indebted periphery will be found has provided a
fillip for risk asset markets.”  Swaps on Greece dropped 58 basis points to 2,442, according
to CMA. Ireland tumbled 72 to 1,084, Portugal decreased 83 to
1,099 and Spain fell 23.5 to 334.5, while Italy declined 19 to
286. France fell 11 to 104 and Belgium was 15 lower at 189. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 19
basis points to 442, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 4.5 basis points to 119.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 13 basis points to 175 and
the subordinated index dropped 24.5 to 305.  To contact the reporter on this story:
