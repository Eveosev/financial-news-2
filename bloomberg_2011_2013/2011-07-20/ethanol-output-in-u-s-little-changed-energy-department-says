Ethanol production in the U.S. was
little changed at 873,000 barrels a day last week, according to
an Energy Department report.  Output rose from 872,000 the week before, the department
said. Stockpiles climbed 2 percent to 19.1 million barrels, the
steepest increase since the week ended May 6. Thatâ€™s enough
supply for 21.5 days, according to the Energy Department.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
slipped 0.7 percent to 5.14 million barrels a day, up 6.2
percent from a year earlier. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax
credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery lost 1 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.901 a gallon at 11:11 a.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices yesterday settled at $2.911, the
highest level since June 27, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
