Phoenix Solar AG (PS4) , a German
solar-energy developer, faces a “challenge” to offset first-
quarter losses and is “working hard” to generate a 2011 
profit, Chief Executive Officer Andreas Haenel said.  “We face a challenge on the Ebit side but we’re working
hard to achieve a positive result by the end of the year” amid
rising third- and fourth-quarter sales in Europe, Asia and the
U.S., Haenel said today in Munich.  Phoenix Solar, a Sulzemoos-based company that sells and
builds solar plants, has expanded abroad to counter slumping
revenue at home.  Germany , the world’s largest solar market, 
installed about 1,000 megawatts in the first five months of 
this year compared with 1,700 megawatts a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
