Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  increased car
production at its factory in Slovakia in the first six months by
more than 25 percent compared with the same period in 2010,
driven by rising demand for sport-utility vehicles.  The South Korean carmaker’s Slovak unit produced more than
134,000 vehicles in January-June in Zilina, Slovakia, compared
with 107,000 a year ago, the unit said in an e-mailed statement
today. Engine production at the factory rose 25 percent to
191,000 units, according to the statement.  Kia and its affiliate Hyundai Motors Co. plan to tap rising
demand for small SUVs to gain market share in  Europe  as the
economy is recovering from the worst economic crisis since World
War II. SUVs represented about 60 percent of Kia’s Slovak output
this year.  The carmaker produces Kia Sportage and Hyundai-brand ix35
SUVs in Zilina. The 1.1 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) plant, which
became operational in 2006, also makes cee’d compact cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
