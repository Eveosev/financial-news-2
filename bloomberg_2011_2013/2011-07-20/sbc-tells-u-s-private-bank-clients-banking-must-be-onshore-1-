The private banking unit of  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest bank, told U.S. clients they can
no longer hold accounts offshore and that they will be managed
onshore in future.  “After a review of services that can be provided to U.S.
clients from locations outside of the U.S., we believe that U.S.
clients will be better served by our private banking teams,” THE
London-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.  U.S. clients at the private bank typically have about $5
million or more of assets to invest, and in return they can
expect services including access to private equity deals,
according to a person familiar with the process. Clients have
been informed of the move throughout this month, and about a few
hundred will be affected, the person said.  The decision follows U.S. efforts to curb  tax evasion . In
April, U.S. tax authorities stepped up their probe of HSBC by
seeking authorization to obtain information on thousands of
Americans who may have used accounts in India to evade taxes.
 UBS AG (UBSN) , the largest Swiss bank, avoided U.S. prosecution in 2009
by paying $780 million, admitting it helped Americans evade
taxes and disclosing account holder data to the  Internal Revenue
Service . The Wall Street Journal reported HSBC’s decision
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
