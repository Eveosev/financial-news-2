Zimbabwe ’s central bank governor,
Gideon Gono, apologized to lawmakers for printing money for
“quasi-fiscal activities” and running up debt of about $1.4
billion, the  Daily News  said.  The central bank printed money on government instructions
to fund items such as farm mechanization and the purchase of
vehicles for officials, the Harare-based Daily News said on its
website. Gono also printed money to finance President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and
elections in 2008, the newspaper reported.  The bank has since “repented,” the Daily News cited Gono
as saying yesterday at a parliamentary finance committee
meeting.  Zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009 after inflation
rose to an International Monetary Fund estimate of 500 billion
percent. The southern African nation now uses primarily U.S.
dollars and South African rand, alongside the euro, the British
pound and the Botswana pula.  To contact the reporter on this story:
