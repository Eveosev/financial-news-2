South African inflation accelerated
to a 15-month high last month, bolstered by rising fuel and food
costs, increasing pressure on the central bank to raise  interest
rates  from a 30-year low.  The inflation rate climbed to 5 percent from 4.6 percent in
May, the Pretoria-based statistics office said on its  website 
today. The increase was in line with the median estimate of 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices rose 0.4 percent in the
month.  The central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 5.5 percent on May 12, while saying that price pressures are
intensifying. The bank will probably keep the rate unchanged
tomorrow, according to all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “You’ve got to start monitoring the trend more closely as
its moving up quite quickly now,” said  Colen Garrow , an
economist at Brait SA in Johannesburg. “I think the  Reserve
Bank  will respond, even if the reasons are totally out of their
control.”  Inflation, which has accelerated for the past four months,
will probably average 5.1 percent this year and 6 percent in
2012, according to the central bank, which is tasked with
keeping the measure to within a 3 percent to 6 percent target
band.  The rand traded at 6.9067 per dollar as of 10:26 a.m. in
Johannesburg, from 6.9188 before the inflation data was
released.  An index of food and non-alcoholic beverages prices rose
7.1 percent from a year earlier, while a transport-price index
gained 5.2 percent, the statistics agency said.  The price of oil, which has gained 20 percent in  New York 
since the start of 2010 until the end of last month, has started
to fall. The government cut gasoline prices by 0.2 percent in
June and 3 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
