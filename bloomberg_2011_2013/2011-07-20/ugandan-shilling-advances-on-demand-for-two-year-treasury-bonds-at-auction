Uganda ’s shilling gained for the
first time in three days amid dollar sales by investors buying
the domestic currency to participate in an auction of two-year
Treasury bonds.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
gained 0.2 percent to 2,585 per dollar at 3 p.m. in the capital,
Kampala. The shilling closed at 2,590 yesterday.  “There were some dollar inflows today because of the bond
sale where demand was a little high,” Ahmed Kalule, a trader at
Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  The Ugandan currency is the world’s second-worst performer
over the past month, after  Serbia ’s dinar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shilling has weakened as inflation
accelerated to a 17-year-high of 16 percent in May, before
slowing to 15.8 percent last month.  East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy sold 85 billion
shillings of the securities at a yield of 15.2094 percent,
according to the central bank. The yield at the previous sale of
similar-dated bonds on June 22 was 14.5301 percent.  Demand for the bonds increased amid speculation that yields
may decline at the next auction after overnight lending rates
dropped to 11 percent today from 15 percent earlier this week,
Kalule said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
