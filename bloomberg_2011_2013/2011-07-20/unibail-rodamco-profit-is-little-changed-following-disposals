Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) , Europe’s largest
publicly traded real-estate company, said profit was little
changed in the first half as higher rents charged to new tenants
offset disposals of smaller shopping centers.  Profit excluding changes in asset values and proceeds from
asset sales, known as recurring profit, totaled 434.9 million
euros ($617 million), or 4.74 euros a share, the Paris-based
company said in a statement. That compared with 429.1 million
euros, or 4.7 euros a share, a year earlier. Five analysts
expected earnings per share of 4.29 euros, according to the
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Poitrinal said today that
recurring earnings per share will probably fall 3 percent in
2011 because of disposals and last year’s 1.8 billion-euro
special dividend. He plans to raise as much as 3 billion euros
through 2013 from disposals as the company focuses on dominant
regional malls, reinvesting the proceeds to fund 6.6 billion
euros of Paris office developments and mall projects.  Unibail-Rodamco has risen 1.9 percent since the end of 2010
through yesterday, less than the 2.3 percent gain for the FTSE
EPRA/Nareit Developed  Europe  Index of real estate stocks. The
gains lifted the company’s value to 14 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
