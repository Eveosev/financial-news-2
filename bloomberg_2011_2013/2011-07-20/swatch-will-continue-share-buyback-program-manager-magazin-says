Swatch Group AG (UHR)  plans to continue
its share buyback program, Manager Magazin reported, citing
Chairman Nayla Hayek.  Swatch doesn’t “desperately” need any new brands, though
some “promising” jewelry and watch brands would fit in with
the Biel, Switzerland-based company, the German magazine cited
Hayek as saying in an interview published on its  website . Swatch
may also seek to form new partnerships with other companies, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
