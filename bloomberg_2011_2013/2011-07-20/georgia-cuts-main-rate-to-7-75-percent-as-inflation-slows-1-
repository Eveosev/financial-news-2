Georgia ’s central bank cut its
refinancing rate by 25 basis points after inflation slowed in
June.  The benchmark refinancing rate was lowered to 7.75 percent
from 8 percent, the Tbilisi-based bank said on its website
today. The rate had remained at 8 percent since February.  Inflation slowed to 10 percent in June, after consumer-
price growth accelerated to 14.3 percent the previous month,
according to the statistics office. The bank expects inflation
to slow to 7.5 percent by year-end.  Borrowing costs in the Black Sea nation are among the
highest in the region, with rates in neighboring Armenia and
 Azerbaijan  at 8.5 percent and 5.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
