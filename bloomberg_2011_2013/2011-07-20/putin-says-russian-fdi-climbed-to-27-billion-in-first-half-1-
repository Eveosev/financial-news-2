Russian foreign direct investment
grew to more than $27 billion in the first six months from $19.4
billion during the same period last year, Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  said, citing preliminary estimates.  “The main goal is now to support this positive tendency,
with an emphasis on the quality of long-term investments,”
Putin said at a government meeting in Moscow today.  The authorities expect FDI flows soon to reach between $60
billion and $70 billion a year, the premier said. FDI surged to
$3.9 billion in the first quarter, a 48 percent increase from a
year earlier, the Federal Statistics Service said in May.  Russia is seeking to reverse capital flight and lure more
inflows, Putin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
