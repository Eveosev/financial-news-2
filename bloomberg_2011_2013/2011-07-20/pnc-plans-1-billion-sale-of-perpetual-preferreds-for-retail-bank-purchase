PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) 
sold $1 billion of perpetual preferred stock to help fund its
acquisition of Royal Bank of Canada’s U.S. retail banking unit.  The bank sold fixed-to-floating rate shares, according to a
regulatory filing today from the Pittsburgh-based lender. The
preferred stock will pay 6.75 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  PNC, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr,

the retail banking unit and related credit-card assets. It said
today that second-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $912
million, or $1.67 per share, from $803 million, or $1.47, in the
same period a year earlier.  “If you’re going to do mergers and acquisition activity
now’s a good time to get funding in the marketplace,” said
Anthony Valeri, market strategist at  LPL Financial  in  San Diego .
“Markets are still conducive to favorable borrowing.”  The shares are expected to be rated Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and A- by  Fitch Ratings , Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
