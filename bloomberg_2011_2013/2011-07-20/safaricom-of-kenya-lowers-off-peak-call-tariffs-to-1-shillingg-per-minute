Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , Kenya’s biggest
mobile-phone company, cut off-peak call tariffs to 1 shilling
($0.01) per minute from 3 shillings.  The new pricing will apply to calls made between 10 p.m.
and 10 a.m. within the company’s network, the Nairobi-based
company said today in a statement in the Daily Nation newspaper.  Last month, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki ordered a halt to
further cuts in interconnection fees, the rates operators charge
each other to connect voice calls across networks, after
companies including Safaricom and Telkom Kenya Ltd. opposed the
reductions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
