America Movil  SAB, the largest
wireless carrier in the Americas, reported a 14 percent rise in
second-quarter profit on subscriber growth and foreign exchange
gains that helped overcome the blow of regulatory measures.  Net income climbed to 24.2 billion pesos ($2.08 billion)
from 21.2 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based
America Movil  said yesterday . Sales rose 7.8 percent to 160
billion pesos. Analysts predicted 158.3 billion pesos.  America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , is
offering packages such as a 1,000-minute airtime plan to lure
more Mexican users. Total wireless subscribers reached 236
million with the addition of about 5.1 million since the first
quarter, compared with the 4.7 million estimate of  Gray Powell ,
an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York.  “Results were more or less in line with expectations,”
Powell said in a research note today. “However, results in
Mexico continue to deteriorate.” He expects the shares to
perform in line with the broader market in the next 12 months.  America Movil gained 1 centavo to 14.81 pesos at 4 p.m. New
York time in Mexico City trading. The shares have declined 16
percent this year.  The company is battling Mexican regulatory decisions this
year that threaten to cut into its profits and its 70 percent
share of the market. Mexico’s phone regulator slashed by more
than half the fees America Movil can charge rivals to connect
calls to its network, and the antitrust agency fined the company
$1 billion for anticompetitive practices in the market for call
connections. The company is appealing both decisions.  Rate Cuts  The rate cuts in  Mexico , the company’s biggest market,
reduced America Movil’s profit margin to 38.8 percent from 41.1
percent, leaving out interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization. The company had applied all the rate cuts required
in Mexico by May 17, it said.  Second-quarter results were helped by a net foreign-
exchange benefit of 2.09 billion pesos, compared with a loss of
2.24 billion pesos a year earlier.  America Movil reported earnings per share of 61 centavos,
compared with 53 centavos a year earlier, based on the average
number of shares outstanding in the quarter. The company split
its stock 2-for-1 on June 29.  Using the number of shares after the split, as some
analysts did in their forecasts, the company would have reported
earnings of 31 centavos a share, or about 52 cents per U.S.-
listed share, compared with the 54-cent median forecast of eight
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Subscriber Gains  America Movil gained 1.3 million wireless subscribers in
Mexico in the second quarter, trailing only  Brazil ’s 2.1 million
additions among the 18 countries in which the company operates.
Churn, a measure of customer retention, was steady at 3 percent,
and average monthly airtime rose 5.8 percent to 220 minutes.  In Brazil, America Movil’s second-biggest market, profit
margin fell to 27.9 percent from 29.2 percent, excluding
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, mostly because
of advertising and programming costs for the fixed-line unit,
which includes TV, Internet and phone services.  Wireless churn rose to 3.5 percent from 3.2 percent in
Brazil. Average monthly  airtime  dropped 10 percent to 83
minutes, and the average monthly wireless bill fell to 17 reais
($11) from 20 reais a year ago.  (The company started a conference call at 10 a.m.  New York
