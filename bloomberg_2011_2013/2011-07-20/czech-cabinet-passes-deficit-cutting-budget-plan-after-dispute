The Czech government approved today
a framework for 2012 budget designed to narrow the deficit by 22
percent as the smallest party in the ruling coalition demanded
more spending for its ministries.  The budget outline, which sets limits for spending and the
deficit, is a part of Premier Petr Necas’s plan to reduce the
fiscal shortfall and state debt after assembling the largest
parliamentary majority since independence in 1993. The
government’s pledge to cut the budget gap to less than the
European Union limit of 3 percent of economic output helped
Czech bonds outperform German debt in the past year.  The budget plan limits the deficit to 105 billion koruna
($6.1 billion), compared with a 135 billion-koruna target for
2011. The  Finance Ministry  will submit the full budget draft
with detailed spending allocations to the government by the end
of August, Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said.  “The government is fulfilling its commitment to fiscal
consolidation,” Kalousek told reporters in Prague.  Public Affairs, the smallest member of the three-party
coalition, opposes the current budget plan and will demand more
money for transportation projects, Vit Barta, head of the
party’s parliamentary caucus, told reporters today in Prague.  The government plans to narrow the public-finance
shortfall, the fiscal yardstick for assessing an EU member’s
readiness to adopt the euro, to 3.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2012 from 4.2 percent in 2011. The Cabinet expects to
trim the gap to less than 3 percent in 2013.  The 2012 budget outline set the spending limit at 1.090
trillion koruna, compared with 1.195 trillion koruna planned for
this year. The budget is based on assumption of revenue of 985
billion koruna, compared with 1.060 trillion koruna in 2011,
Necas said at the joint news conference with Kalousek.  Public Affairs blocked today Kalousek’s proposal to cut the
deficit further to 95 billion koruna next year by raising the
value-added tax, Necas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
