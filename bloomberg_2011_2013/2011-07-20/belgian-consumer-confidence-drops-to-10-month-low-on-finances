Belgian  consumer confidence  fell to
the lowest in 10 months in July as households pared their
expectations for economic growth and became less optimistic
about their capacity to save in the next 12 months.  The consumer sentiment index for  Belgium , the euro area’s
sixth-largest economy, dropped to minus 4 from minus 3 in June,
the Brussels-based  National Bank of Belgium  said today in an e-
mailed statement. That’s the lowest reading since September
2010.  A sub-index gauging households’ assessments of the economy
in the coming year fell to minus 6, the lowest value since May
2010, and a gauge measuring consumers’ capacity to save fell to
minus 1 from 3 in June. That’s the first negative reading in
more than two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
