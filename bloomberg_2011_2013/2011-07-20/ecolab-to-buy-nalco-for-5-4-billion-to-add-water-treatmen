Ecolab Inc. (ECL) , the largest maker of
cleaning chemicals for hotels and restaurants, agreed to acquire
 Nalco Holding Co. (NLC)  for $5.4 billion to add water-treatment
services.  The transaction values Nalco at $38.80 a share, a 34
percent premium to its closing price yesterday, St. Paul,
Minnesota-based Ecolab said today in a statement.  Buying Naperville, Illinois-based Nalco will diversify
Ecolab’s customer base, which is dominated by the hospitality
industry and hospitals. Nalco’s Correxit dispersant was used to
help clean up the oil spill from  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Macondo well in the
Gulf of Mexico last year.  Nalco rose 32 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $28.87 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
dropped 9.6 percent this year.  Ecolab was founded as Economics Laboratory in 1924. A maker
of rug cleaners for hotels, it became a leading seller of
dishwasher detergent in the 1950s, held an initial public
offering in 1957 and changed its name to Ecolab in 1986,
according to Hoover’s Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
