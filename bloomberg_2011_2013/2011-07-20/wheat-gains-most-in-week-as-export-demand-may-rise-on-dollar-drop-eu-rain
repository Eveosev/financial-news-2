Wheat futures rose for a second
straight day on speculation that demand will increase for U.S.
supplies as the dollar drops, while prospects diminish for crops
in  Europe .  The dollar fell for a second-straight day against a basket
of six currencies, boosting the appeal of U.S. grain exports.
Crops in the European Union, which produces a fifth of the
world’s wheat, have already been reduced by spring drought and
now face harvest delays and declines in quality because of
excess rains this month, according to French farm adviser Offre
et Demand Agricole.  “If rains would continue to persist, that would be a bad
thing” for global wheat supplies,  Jason Britt , the president of
brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City,
 Missouri , said by telephone. “The weaker dollar is something
that is obviously a net positive” for U.S. exports, he said.  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $6.97 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
