European governments will consider
using the euro areaâ€™s rescue fund to guarantee sovereign bonds
to stem the debt crisis, the Financial Times Deutschland
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Another proposal to be discussed at a summit of euro-area
leaders in Brussels tomorrow is to set up a flexible credit
facility as a backstop for countries heading toward a debt
crunch, emulating credit lines offered by the  International
Monetary Fund , the German newspaper  reported  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
