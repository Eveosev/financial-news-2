F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) ’s stock fell the
most in six months after the maker of software used to manage
 computer networks  reported quarterly revenue that trailed some
analysts’ estimates.  The shares dropped $12.57, or 11 percent to $98.87 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, marking the
biggest decline since January. Today’s loss extends the stock’s
slide for the year to 24 percent.  Sales in the fiscal third quarter ended June 30 totaled
$290.7 million, as revenue decreased in Europe and slowed from
the U.S. government, the Seattle-based company said yesterday in
a statement. The average of 34 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was $290.8 million. Profit excluding some items was 97
cents a share, more than the average estimate of 91 cents.  “We’re in a pause right now as  Europe  is weak, the U.S.
federal government is weak in terms of spending, and financial
firms are actually slowing spending a bit,” said Alkesh Shah,
an analyst at Evercore Partners in New York who rates the stock
“underweight” and has a price target of $90. “That
combination is causing a pause that people didn’t expect and
that’s why the stock has pulled back.”  Investors are concerned that revenue growth has been
slowing since 2010’s fourth quarter, when sales increased 45
percent from a year earlier. Sales rose 26 percent in the most
recent three-month period. The average analyst estimate for this
quarter is for a 22 percent gain, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
