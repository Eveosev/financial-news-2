Jose Reyes  returned from the
disabled list after missing 12 games with a strained left
hamstring and helped spark the  New York Mets  to a 4-2 victory
over the  St. Louis Cardinals .  Reyes went 2-for-5 with a run scored and his defense at
shortstop kept the Cardinals from mounting a rally in the eighth
inning last night. Reyes first prevented a run with a diving
stop and then turned a bases-loaded double play on Albert Pujols
to get the Mets out of the inning.  “I feel pretty good and I’m happy with the win,” Reyes,
who leads  Major League Baseball  with a .355 batting average,
said in a televised interview. ‘I just want to do my job and
give a lot of energy for my team, try to get on base and make
things happen.’’  The Mets had gone 6-6 without Reyes, including a 1-3 record
after the All-Star break, the start of a stretch that General
Manager  Sandy Alderson  said will help determine how the team
approaches the July 31 trade deadline. The Mets are in third
place in the five-team National League Eastern Division at
48-48, 12 games behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies.  Reyes will become a free agent after this season, as will
outfielder Carlos Beltran, who also returned to the Mets’ lineup
last night after missing the previous three games with the flu.
Beltran went 3-for-3 with a double and reached base in all five
of his plate appearances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
