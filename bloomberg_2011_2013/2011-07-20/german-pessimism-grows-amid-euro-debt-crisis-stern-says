Germans became more pessimistic last
week as concerns about the stability of the euro grew, Stern
magazine said in an e-mailed statement, citing a survey it
commissioned from Forsa together with RTL television.  Germany ’s economic situation will worsen, 47 percent of
2,506 people polled between July 11 and July 15 said, compared
with 40 percent a week earlier, Stern said. The share of
optimists declined to 19 percent from 26 percent, it said.  “Many, especially older people, worry about their hard-
earned savings,” Stern cited Forsa head Manfred Guellner as
saying. “For them, the German mark was still a guarantor of
stability.”  Euro-area government chiefs are meeting tomorrow in
Brussels for the second time in a month as they aim to break a
deadlock over a new Greek rescue that has spooked investors.
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said yesterday the crisis can’t
be resolved in “one spectacular step.”  The poll had a margin of error of as many as 2.5 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
