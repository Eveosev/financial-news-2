TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  reported second-
quarter sales and income that missed estimates as it booked
lower profits from holdings in Eurasia,  Turkey  and  Russia .  Second-quarter net income dropped to 3.86 billion kronor
($592 million), from 5.24 billion kronor a year ago, Stockholm-
based TeliaSonera said in a statement today. Revenue declined
4.3 percent to 25.9 billion kronor. Analysts in a Bloomberg
survey expected income of 4.25 billion kronor on sales of 25.9
billion kronor.  TeliaSonera affiliate Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri booked a
loss in Belarus and had “weaker operational performance” in
Turkey, almost wiping out its contribution to the Swedish
company’s profits, according to the statement. Income from
MegaFon in Russia also declined, and currency fluctuations
offset sales gains in Eurasia. Fixed voice services in the
Nordic and Baltic regions continued to decline, with 450,000
customers quitting for broadband, fiber or mobile connections.  “The decline in earnings per share can be explained by
currency movements and weaker results,” Chief Executive Officer
Lars Nyberg said in the statement. “We reiterate our guidance
for net sales, profitability and investments.”  TeliaSonera said in April it expects net sales growth in
local currencies and without acquisitions to be around 3 percent
this year, compared with an earlier forecast of 4 percent.  Tele2 AB,  Sweden ’s second-largest telephone company,
reported quarterly net income that declined more than 30 percent
to 1.11 billion kronor as fixed-line customers in Sweden
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
