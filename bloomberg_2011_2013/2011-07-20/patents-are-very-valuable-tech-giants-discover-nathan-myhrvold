Patents rarely make headlines, but
they did this month when Nortel Networks Corp., the defunct
Canadian telecommunications giant, auctioned off its patent
portfolio and drew an astonishing winning bid of $4.5 billion
from a group of companies that includes both  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   The sale marks a watershed in the maturity of intellectual
property markets and a dramatic shift in strategy for technology
companies. Suddenly these companies are acknowledging that
patents are a strategic asset worth billions.  Here’s an inside look at what happened -- and what’s at
stake -- and remember, as you read this, that my company buys
and licenses high-tech patents.  Most big tech companies inhabit winner-take-most markets,
in which any company that gets out in front can develop an
enormous lead. This is how Microsoft came to dominate in
software,  Intel Corp . in processors,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in web search,
Oracle Corp. in databases, Amazon.com Inc. in web retail, and so
on.  As a result, the tech world has seen a series of mad
scrambles by companies wanting to be king of the hill. In the
late 1980s, the battle was for dominance of spreadsheet and
word-processing software. In the late 1990s, it was about e-
commerce on the emerging Internet. The latest whatever-it-takes
struggle has been over social networks, with enough drama to
script  a Hollywood movie .  In each case, the recipe for success was to bring to
market, at a furious pace, products that incorporate new
features. Along the way, inconvenient intellectual property
rights were ignored.  Copyrights Are Easy  Yes, copyright was almost religiously enforced. Copyrights
are trivial to obtain (just type the “c” in a circle symbol),
and software companies see them as essential to restraining
piracy, which hurts revenue. Patents are a different story,
however. It takes time for engineers to apply for patents and
even more time if they diligently respect other people’s
patents. So technology companies typically did neither.  In fact, many tech companies forbid their engineers from
checking whether their products incorporate others’ patents. The
practice amounts to an intellectual property version of “don’t
ask, don’t tell.”  As tech giants commercialized ideas that had been pioneered
by small companies and merged once-separate technologies into
new products, they infringed other people’s patents. Personal
computers took over publishing, photo processing, cash handling
and a million other functions once performed by other companies’
patented products. Smart phones likewise displaced more
specialized devices, such as GPS units and bar-code readers.
When the TV commercial says, “There’s an app for that,” the
“that” part is sometimes covered by patents the app creator
doesn’t own.  Patent Vulnerability  Once tech giants got to the top, they realized that their
cavalier treatment of patents had left them vulnerable. If you
already control 90 percent of the market, your own patent
portfolio does little for you. But outside patent owners
sometimes show up and ask to be paid. Last month, the U.S.
Supreme Court decided that Microsoft, the company I used to work
for, must pay almost $300 million to a Toronto-based company
called I4i LP, which claimed its patented technology was used in
Microsoft Word. All tech companies face this sort of claim, and
they’re not happy about it.  The biggest companies, which have always touted their
brilliant innovations to justify the billions of dollars in
 stock options  they pay their executives, have been in the odd
position of attacking the patent system and publicly deprecating
the innovations of others. Patents attempt to create a level
playing field, but the last thing an 800-pound gorilla of a
company wants is a fair fight. After succeeding in part by
stealing other people’s inventions, they decry any inventors who
have the temerity to ask for a share of the returns.  In Congress, lobbyists for every major semiconductor,
software and Internet-services company worked for seven years to
undermine the much-needed patent reform bill and to delay its
passage. (The House and Senate each recently passed a version of
the bill; they are now working to reconcile the two measures.)  Yet even as that was going on, a growing number of tech
companies started to discover that patents might be useful after
all. In 2009, Micron Technology, a major computer chipmaker,
transferred about 4,500 of its patents to a renowned patent
litigator in the hope that he could make some money on them. And
in the past two years, Microsoft has sued companies that were
using the Linux computer operating system and Android, Google’s
mobile-phone platform, to collect on what it viewed as its share
of the patent liability that is hidden in a lot of “free”
software.  Attack by Apple  It isn’t just about the money; these are also strategic
moves. Apple, flush with the iPhone’s success but understandably
worried that it might wind up becoming the R&D outfit that
prototyped ideas that made others rich, has recently sued HTC
Corp., Samsung and others. Just last week, the company won a
preliminary ruling from the International Trade Commission,
which if upheld will prevent HTC from importing smart phones
into the U.S., essentially wiping out its business here.  Microsoft and Apple could have sued Google; most of the
disputed features are in Android code. Instead, they elected to
sue Google’s customers as a way to avoid an all-out war with the
search giant -- reminiscent of how, in the  Cold War , the U.S.
and the  Soviet Union  used to battle by proxy in places such as
 Vietnam . Oracle, buoyed by patents it got in its acquisition of
Sun Microsystems, was less circumspect; it sued Google directly.  These tussles set the stage for Nortel to put on the block
more than 6,000 patents and patent applications, which cover
many features of current and future mobile phones, in an auction
orchestrated by Lazard Ltd. Analysts at my company and elsewhere
in the industry found that the patents were good, but what made
them extraordinary wasn’t their quality -- it was simply that
they were on the market and hadn’t been widely licensed. Just
six months ago, the expected selling price had been $200 million
to $400 million -- a lot of money, but still a pittance compared
with the prize of being the biggest winner in the smart-phone
business.  Google Bids  Google then made its move, tendering a public stalking-
horse offer of $900 million that sent shock waves through the
industry. Even stranger, its offer allowed Lazard to shop the
deal for several months.  Many people were surprised that Google stepped forward; it
has consistently been one of the most outspoken critics of the
patent system, presumably because it faces enormous potential
patent liability. Even its basic business model of advertising-
supported search was first invented and patented by a company
called  GoTo.com , which sued Google for infringement in 2002.
Google settled the lawsuit shortly before its initial public
offering in 2004.  The amount of Google’s offer was unexpected, but the high
price made perfect sense. Google has very few of its own
patents; with Nortel’s portfolio, it could change the balance of
power in the smart-phone industry. It could threaten to
countersue any company that attacked Android, or it could even
take a page from Apple’s book and go on the attack. Such potent
ammunition in the battle for smart-phone supremacy could be
worth far more than $900 million.  A third shocker was how Google structured its public bid.
Neither I nor anybody I have spoken with can explain what Google
was thinking. Had it simply waited for the auction, it easily
could have won. Other bidders had much lower expectations and
wouldn’t have had the time to get board approval for bids large
enough to stay in the game.  Schemes and Counterschemes  Instead, the stalking-horse offer set in motion
unprecedented scheming and counterscheming among strange
bedfellows. Companies that normally fight one another, such as
game-console rivals Microsoft and Sony and smart-phone rivals
Apple and Research in Motion Ltd., pondered whether they hated
the prospect of a patent-powerful Google even more. Investment
companies like mine, which had been interested in Nortel’s
portfolio for its potential financial return, decided the
bidding was too rich for our blood, and dropped out. As the
auction neared, rumors flew about who was teaming up with whom
and how high the bids would soar.  Then, as the auction began, Google unveiled one more
surprise. Its bids were numbers like $1,902,160,540. That’s a
billion times Brun’s constant, which appears in the mathematics
of prime numbers. And its successive bids were other
mathematical constants, including one for pi billion dollars
($3,141,592,653).  Math geekiness, it turns out, doesn’t guarantee victory. A
consortium of six other companies -- Microsoft, Apple, RIM, Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications AB and EMC Corp/ Massachusetts  --
won with an astounding $4.5 billion bid.  Google’s Strategy  The result effectively retains the status quo. Google still
has no strategic weapon to compensate for the patent liability
inherent in Android, so the lawsuits will continue. Some in the
industry think Google acted brilliantly; the company is no worse
off than it was before, and it cost its competitors $4.5
billion. Others argue that Google was somehow snookered by
Lazard into a disastrous strategy that has left its competitors
better armed for the fight -- and more than a little angry. You
don’t pay $4.5 billion for assets and then let them sit on the
shelf.  More importantly, this sale validates the notion that
patents will be a fundamental tool in the tech industry. They
had been moving toward that position for years, but the
magnitude of Nortel’s sale shows that they have arrived. Patents
virtually define the pharmaceutical and biotech markets, and in
the future they could play the same role for tech.  What’s next? The history of mergers and acquisitions
suggests one possibility. Once upon a time in the clubby
atmosphere of corporate America, hostile takeovers were rare;
gentlemen just didn’t do such things. Then, in the 1960s, the
hostile takeovers came to be accepted as a legitimate business
tool. Similarly, the strategic use of patents now appears to be
accepted in the technology industry. If that’s true, then Nortel
is just the beginning.  ( Nathan Myhrvold , the former chief strategist and chief
