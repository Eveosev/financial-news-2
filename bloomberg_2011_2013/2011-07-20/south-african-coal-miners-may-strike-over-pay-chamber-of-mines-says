South African coal miners may strike
after labor unions declared a dispute with the Chamber of Mines,
which represents most major coal miners, the employers’ group
said in an e-mailed statement today.  A strike can be called with 48 hours notice, the Chamber
said. The Chamber improved its pay offer to between a raise of 7
percent and 8.5 percent depending on the worker’s job grade.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  are
members of the Chamber.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
