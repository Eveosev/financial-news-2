U.S. natural-gas inventories
probably rose 61 billion cubic feet last week, more than the
gain a year earlier, as higher nuclear production reduced demand
for gas-powered electricity, analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles gained 2.3 percent to 2.672 trillion in the week
ended July 15, based on the median of 16 estimates. Supplies
climbed 55 billion cubic feet a year earlier, according to
Energy Department data. The five-year average change for the
week is an increase of 67 billion.  Output from nuclear plants rose to a seven-month high on
July 11 as reactors in Kansas and  Pennsylvania  boosted
production, according to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
Temperatures were above normal in the South, Midwest and East
last week, Commodity Weather Group LLC said.  “It’s quite likely that if you have nuclear power running
at a higher level, you won’t see as much natural-gas generators
running,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory
company Cameron Hanover Inc. in  New Canaan , Connecticut.  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 54 billion
to 73 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  Nuclear power generation increased to 98,276 megawatts, or
97 percent of capacity, on July 11, the highest level since Dec.
26, according to the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg. Three
of the 104 U.S. reactors were offline.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  Supply Report  Gas storage levels increased 84 billion cubic feet to 2.611
trillion in the week ended July 8, the Energy Department
reported last week. Stockpiles were 2 percent below the five-
year average and 7.7 percent below year-earlier levels.  Marketed gas production will average 65.39 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up 5.8 percent from 61.83 billion last
year, according to the Energy Department.  Temperatures in New York last week were above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.
