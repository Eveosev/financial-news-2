Iran  has developed technology to
transform its “considerable resources” of ultra-heavy crude
into lighter oil,  Fars News Agency  reported, citing Deputy Oil
Minister Mohammed Reza Moqaddam.  Iran’s Khuzestan oil refinery was the world’s first to make
lighter crude from heavy oil, Fars said today on its website.
The agency didn’t specify how much light oil the refinery
produced or whether the Khuzestan plant would use the technology
on a regular basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
