South African retail sales growth
ground to a halt in May, while inflation accelerated in line
with economists’ forecasts last month, adding to expectations
the central bank will keep  interest rates  unchanged tomorrow.  Retail sales were unchanged from a year earlier, after
expanding a revised 10 percent in April, the Pretoria-based
 statistics office  said on its website today. The median estimate
of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.2 percent.
Inflation accelerated to 5 percent in June from 4.6 percent in
the previous month.  “We just don’t see a rate hike happening in this economic
cycle too quickly,” Nicky Weimar, an economist with  Nedbank
Group Ltd. (NED) , said in an interview from Johannesburg. Retail sales
“is a really weak number. Things are slowing down a lot. We can
expect this weaker trend to continue.”  All 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the  Reserve
Bank  to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 30-year
low of 5.5 percent tomorrow. The rand’s gains may help to curb
price pressures, including from food and fuel, weakening the
case for a rate increase.  The rand strengthened to 6.8878 as of 2:45 p.m. in
Johannesburg from 6.9209 before the inflation data was released.
The yield 13.5 percent government bond due 2015, known as the
R157, fell 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, to 7.42
percent.  Oil Price  Inflation, which has accelerated for the past four months,
will probably average 5.1 percent this year and 6 percent in
2012, according to the central bank, which is tasked with
keeping the measure to within a 3 percent to 6 percent target
band.  The price of oil, which has gained 20 percent in  New York 
since the start of 2010 until the end of last month, has started
to fall. The government cut gasoline prices by 0.2 percent in
June and 3 percent in July.  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South Africa ’s second-largest
grocer, said on July 6 it may fire about 8.6 percent of its
workforce after profit slumped. Sales at larger rival  Shoprite
Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  increased 7.3 percent to 72.3 billion rand ($10.4
billion) in the year through June 30, the retailer said on July
18, missing analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
