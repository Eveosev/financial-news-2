Zurich American Insurance Co. claims
in a lawsuit it isn’t obliged to defend  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s U.S. unit
against lawsuits and possible probes related to hacking of
Sony’s PlayStation Network.  Sony has demanded that Zurich American and Zurich Insurance
Co. Ltd., both units of Switzerland-based  Zurich Financial
Services AG (ZURN) , “defend and potentially indemnify them” from
class-action lawsuits, miscellaneous claims and possible probes
by state attorneys general over the hacking.  Zurich American and Zurich Insurance “are not obligated to
defend or indemnify any of the Sony defendants for the claims
asserted,” says the lawsuit, which was filed yesterday in New
York state Supreme Court in Manhattan.  Sony restored full PlayStation Network and Qriocity online
services in Japan earlier this month, closing a 2 1/2-month
chapter in which hackers forced the company to shut down its
global video-game and movie-streaming operations.  The April attack on Sony’s data centers in San Diego
compromised more than 100 million customer accounts, the second-
largest online data breach in U.S. history, and will cost the
company an estimated 14 billion yen ($173 million) this fiscal
year.  Patrick Seybold , a spokesman for Sony Computer
Entertainment, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message
yesterday.  The case is Zurich American Insurance Co. vs.  Sony Corp. (SNE)  of
America, 651982/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
