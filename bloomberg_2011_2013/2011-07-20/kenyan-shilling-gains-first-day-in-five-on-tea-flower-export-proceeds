Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in five days as traders converted proceeds from
dollar-based sales of tea and flowers, the main source of
foreign exchange.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 90.08 per dollar at 4:25 p.m. in Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital. It closed at 90.36 yesterday.  “In the afternoon we started seeing some dollar inflows
from tea and horticulture, Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading a
Commercial Bank of Africa said in a phone interview from the
capital, Nairobi, today. “We expect the shillings to close at
the same levels.”  Kenya is the world’s biggest exporter of black tea and
 Europe ’s largest source of cut flowers. Agriculture accounts for
25 percent of Kenya’s gross domestic product, with tea and
horticulture being its main source of foreign exchange.  African tea prices rose for a second week, climbing to an
average of $2.82 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the
Kenyan port city of Mombasa, up from $2.81 a week earlier, Tea
Brokers East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
