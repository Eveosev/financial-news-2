Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , China’s biggest
maker of personal computers, will start sales of two new tablet
devices in the U.S. to compete in a market dominated by  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  The company will take orders for the IdeaPad Tablet K1 from
today, and start sales of the Thinkpad Tablet from Aug. 2, it
said in a statement today. Lenovo began sales of its LePad
tablet in China in March.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and Lenovo, the world’s
three biggest makers of PCs, are offering new tablets as the
popularity of Apple’s iPad curbs growth in demand for desktop
and notebook computers. Global PC shipments rose 2.3 percent in
the three months ended June, according to Gartner Inc., less
than the 6.7 percent increase predicted by the research company.  The IdeaPad Tablet, priced from $499, and the Thinkpad
tablet, priced from $479, use version 3.1 of  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android operating system, Lenovo said. The company plans to sell
a new tablet based on  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows 7 system in the
fourth quarter, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
