to the Thai Rice Exporters Association.  The price of 100 percent grade-B white rice rose to $563 a
metric ton, according to the associationâ€™s  website . The price of
25 percent broken rice rose to $502 a ton from $495 a week
earlier, it said.  The association holds a meeting every week to set prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
