The rupiah gained for a second day
after Fitch Ratings said  Indonesia  may achieve an investment-
grade credit rating before the end of next year. Bonds rose.  Indonesia has a “more than 50 percent chance” of an
upgrade in the next 12 months to 18 months,  Andrew Colquhoun ,
the Hong Kong-based head of the Asia-Pacific Sovereigns team at
Fitch, said yesterday. Fitch rates Indonesia BB+, one step below
investment grade, and raised the outlook on the rating to
positive in February. Foreign funds increased their holdings of
government debt by 2.9 percent this month through July 18 to
241.76 trillion rupiah ($28.3 billion), according to  debt
management office  data.  The statement by Fitch “points toward the general optimism
for Indonesia,” said Emmanuel Ng, a currency strategist at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “With inflows into
Indonesia’s capital markets, it’s a nice combination for the
rupiah.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to 8,540 against the
dollar as of 3:10 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has advanced 5.1 percent this year as
overseas investors bought $2.5 billion more Indonesian shares
than they sold, exchange data show.  Government bonds  rose. The yield on the 8.25 percent
securities due July 2021 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.29 percent, according to midday prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
