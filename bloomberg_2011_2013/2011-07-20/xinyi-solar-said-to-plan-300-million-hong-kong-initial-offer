Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd., the solar
glass unit of  Xinyi Glass Holdings Ltd. (868) , is preparing an initial
public offering in Hong Kong that may raise about $300 million,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The maker of raw and processed ultra-clear photovoltaic
glass aims to start trading in the fourth quarter, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information is
private. Citigroup Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will manage the
offering, the people said.  Xinyi Solar has submitted a listing application to the Hong
Kong stock exchange, Xinyi Glass said in a June 7 filing to the
bourse. Spokespeople for Xinyi Glass couldnâ€™t immediately be
