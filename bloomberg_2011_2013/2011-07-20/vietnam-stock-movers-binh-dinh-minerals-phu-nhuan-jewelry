Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, rose 1.6 percent to 416.77. That’s the steepest
increase since June 21.  Binh Dinh Minerals Joint-Stock Co. (BMC VN), a miner and
trader of metal ores, increased 4.7 percent to 24,700 dong, the
highest level since May 13. The company will pay shareholders a
dividend of 1,000 dong per stock on Aug. 17, it said in a
statement filed on the bourse’s website.  Phu Nhuan Jewelry Joint-Stock Co. (PNJ VN), the only
jewelry manufacturer on the exchange, fell 0.4 percent to 25,800
dong. International gold may decline for a second day, extending
a drop from a record, after President  Barack Obama  backed a plan
to cut the deficit, potentially paving the way for raising the
U.S. debt ceiling and avoiding default.  Immediate-delivery gold was little changed at $1,589.35 an
ounce after touching an all-time high of $1,610.10 yesterday.
Gold closed 1 percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
