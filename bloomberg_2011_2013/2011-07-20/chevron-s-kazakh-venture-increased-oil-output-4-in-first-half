TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , increased oil production 4 percent
in the first half from a year earlier.  Crude output rose to 13 million metric tons, or 104 million
barrels, in the period from 12.5 million tons in the first half
of 2010, the Atyrau-based company said by e-mail today.  The venture exports its oil via the Caspian Pipeline
Consortium to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea
and then by rail to Odessa and Feodosiya in Ukraine, as well as
to the Kazakh port of Aktau for onward shipment to Batumi and
Kulevi in Georgia.  For 2011, TengizChevroil plans to produce at least as much
as last year’s 25.9 million tons, or 207 million barrels, Linsi Crain, a company spokeswoman, said Feb. 10.  Chevron, based in  San Ramon ,  California , holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia’s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
