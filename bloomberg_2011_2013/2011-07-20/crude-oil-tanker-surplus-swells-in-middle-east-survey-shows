The supply of  oil tankers  seeking 2
million-barrel cargoes of crude from  Middle East  ports expanded
in the past week, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
shipbrokers and owners.  The surplus of very large crude carriers, or VLCCs,
competing for cargoes over the next month rose 1 percentage
point to 15 percent, according to a survey of five brokers and
one owner today and another on July 12.  VLCC earnings on the Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route that’s
used to settle freight derivatives fell 24 percent yesterday to
$2,631 a day, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. That’s
less than a 10th of the $29,700 that Frontline Ltd., the largest
operator of the ships, said May 25 it needs to break even on the
vessels.  Costs to charter tankers as measured in industry standard
Worldscale terms gained 0.1 percent to 49.88 points, according
to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
