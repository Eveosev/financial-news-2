U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said global regulators will create a “level playing
field” for financial rules because major economies share the
same objectives.  “It’s not in the interests of any country to have a weak
financial system and to be the source of global risk,” Wolin
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. “We think
that we will get a level playing field.”  The U.S. has been a global leader by approving the Dodd-
Frank financial overhaul law and will try to ensure that “the
rest of the world comes along with us so that we all have a
strong, stable financial system,” Wolin said. Dodd-Frank’s one-
year anniversary is tomorrow.  “I think there’s been very good agreement among the
leadership” of the Group of 20 nations on objectives for a
regulatory framework, Wolin said. “I think we’ve made a lot of
progress in our discussions globally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
