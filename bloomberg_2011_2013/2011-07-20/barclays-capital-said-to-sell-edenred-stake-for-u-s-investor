Barclays Capital  sold a stake of
about 8 percent in  Edenred (EDEN)  SA, the worldâ€™s largest seller of
meal and service vouchers, on behalf of an institutional seller.  The London-based investment bank sold about 18 million
Edenred shares at 20.30 euros apiece, according to two people
familiar with the transaction. The stock was originally offered
at 20.30 euros to 20.60 euros a share, according to a term sheet
obtained by Bloomberg News.  An Edenred spokeswoman confirmed that Southeastern Asset
Management Inc. was selling some shares in the company. She
declined to comment on the number of stock being sold.  Edenred dropped 5.7 percent to 20.37 euros in Paris. The
stock has risen 15 percent this year, giving the Malakoff,
France-based company a market value of 4.6 billion euros ($6.5
billion).  Edenred said earlier this week that first-half revenue rose
9.8 percent on a like-for-like basis to 501 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
