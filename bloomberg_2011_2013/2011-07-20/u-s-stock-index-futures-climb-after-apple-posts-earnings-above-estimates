U.S. stocks fell, a day after the
best rally since March for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
concern the government will fail to increase the debt limit
overshadowed higher-than-estimated earnings at  Apple Inc. (AAPL)     United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  lost 1.8 percent as  Boeing Co. (BA) 
picked a rival engine maker to upgrade its 737 jet. Yahoo! Inc.,
Altria Group Inc. and  Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  slid at least 2.4
percent as results disappointed investors. Apple jumped 2.7
percent after record sales of iPads and iPhones lifted profit,
helping the company join 89 percent of S&P 500 members topping
estimates so far in the earnings season.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 1,325.84 at 4 p.m. in
 New York  after yesterday surging 1.6 percent as President  Barack Obama  endorsed a bipartisan deficit-reduction plan from the so-
called Gang of Six senators. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
decreased 15.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,571.91 after
surging 202 points yesterday in its biggest gain of 2011.  “There have been a couple of companies that have had some
nice beats,” Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Santa Fe,
New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc., which
oversees about $80 billion, said in a telephone interview. “But
the macro environment is weighing on things and people are still
worried about the U.S. debt situation.”  The  S&P 500  has declined 2.8 percent from a three-year high
in April amid speculation the sovereign debt crisis in  Europe  is
spreading across the region and concern U.S. lawmakers will fail
to reach a deal on raising the debt limit before the Aug. 2
deadline, pushing the government of the world’s largest economy
closer to default.  Deficit Talks  The proposal for a $3.7 trillion debt-cutting plan praised
by Obama is facing resistance from House Republicans, as
lawmakers intensify efforts for a compromise less than two weeks
before a threatened default. Obama plans to renew talks at the
White House this week with congressional leaders as the
Democratic-led Senate and Republican House pursue divergent
paths toward ending the stalemate.  Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien  said today in an interview
on Bloomberg Radio that investors in the stock market do believe
U.S. lawmakers will reach a deal on raising the nation’s debt
limit as the likelihood that tax increases will be part of the
plan increases.  “There’s a residual feeling on the part of investors that
somehow this will be solved,” said Wien, the vice chairman of
Blackstone Advisory Partners, whose parent, New York-based
Blackstone Group LP, is the world’s largest private-equity firm.
“The point that the market was so excited about yesterday was
that since it was a bipartisan group of six there was a
possibility there could be revenue increases in addition to
spending cuts - that’s key to getting an agreement.”  United Technologies Slumps  United Technologies declined 1.8 percent to $87.22 as
investors focused on Boeing’s selection of a competing jet-
engine maker to upgrade its 737 model rather than quarterly
profit. United Technologies’ second-quarter earnings rose more
than analysts estimated, led by its Carrier division. The
company also raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts.  Yahoo fell 7.6 percent to $13.48, the biggest decline in
the S&P 500. The most-visited web portal in the U.S. reported
revenue that missed estimates as marketers favored competing
sites and a sales-team shakeup made it harder to clinch
advertising orders.  Altria Group Inc. (MO)  slumped 2.4 percent to $26.37. The
cigarette maker reported second-quarter earnings of 53 cents a
share, matching the average analyst estimates. Sales net of
excise taxes were $3.88 billion, falling short of the analysts’
prediction of $4.4 billion.  Earnings Season   Johnson Controls fell 4.4 percent to $39.69. Some analysts
questioned the largest U.S. auto supplier’s third-quarter profit
margins on record sales of $10.4 billion. Profit excluding
certain items rose to 56 cents a share from 54 cents a year
earlier. The average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 53 cents. The company’s sales rose 21 percent.  Positive earnings reports helped push the S&P 500, the
benchmark index for U.S. stocks, up from a three-week low
yesterday. Among the 61 companies in the S&P 500 that posted
results since July 11, 54 beat the average analyst estimate for
per-share profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Apple Rallies  Apple gained 2.7 percent to a record price of $386.90. The
biggest technology company by market value said third-quarter
net income more than doubled to $7.31 billion, or $7.79 a share,
lifted by record sales of iPhones and iPad tablets. Analysts had
predicted profit of $5.87 a share.  The report eased investors’ concern that sales would suffer
from the lack of a new iPhone, which isn’t expected until
September, and about the absence of Chief Executive Officer
 Steve Jobs , who has been on medical leave since January.  S&P 500 technology stocks declined 0.4 percent, after
yesterday rising the most since in a year.  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  erased 0.8 percent to $183.65 after
surging 5.7 percent to a record yesterday.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  fell
1.7 percent to $27.06. Financial stocks had the biggest gain out
of 10 groups in the S&P 500, rising 1.1 percent.  Clorox Co. (CLX)  gained 2.4 percent to $74.34 after  Carl Icahn ,
the company’s largest investor, increased his offer for the
bleach maker to $80 a share in cash from $76.50 a share, valuing
it at about $10.7 billion. Clorox rejected Icahn’s previous
offer.  Bank of America  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  climbed the most in the Dow, surging
2.9 percent to $9.85. Analysts from  Wells Fargo & Co ., Citigroup
Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. wrote that the biggest U.S. lender
probably won’t need to raise capital. The shares offer
“considerable value” to investors as the stock traded at a 25
percent discount to its $12.65 tangible book value, Citigroup
said in a note. The shares had lost 28 percent for the year
through yesterday.  Zillow Inc. surged 79 percent to $35.77. The Seattle-based
online real estate information service sold 3.46 million shares
at $20 each in an initial public offering.  Nalco Holding Co. (NLC)  rallied 24 percent to $35.87 after
agreeing to be bought by Ecolab Inc., the largest maker of
cleaning chemicals for hotels and restaurants, for $5.4 billion.
Nalco provides water treatment services and its Corexit
dispersant was used to help clean up the oil spill from BP Plc’s
Macondo well in the  Gulf of Mexico . Ecolab declined 7.4 percent
to $51.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
