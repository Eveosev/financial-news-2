Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  said
he may consider splitting up  Clorox Co. (CLX)  and selling off pieces
of the company if his bid for the maker of the namesake bleach
is completed.  “We might do that,” Icahn said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. “If we buy it, we might split it up and
possibly keep one of the divisions.”  Icahn declined to say which unit he may seek to keep.  To contact the reporter on this story:
