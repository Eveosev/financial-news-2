Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, gained for a fifth day on speculation
sugar prices will rise as traders hoard supplies to sell more
expensively as drought cuts production.  The stock climbed 1.4 percent to 7.30 shillings by the
3 p.m. close in Nairobi, its longest streak of gains since
August 2010.  The Kenya Sugar Board, which regulates the nation’s
industry, said yesterday it suspects traders in the East African
country are hoarding the sweetener to sell at a higher price as
drought reduces production. Kenya consumes 780,000 metric tons
of sugar a year and produces 520,000 tons, leaving a deficit of
260,000 tons, Patricia Njeru, the board’s head of planning, said
by phone from the capital, Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
