Barclays Capital, the investment
banking unit of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said it will make hiring more
people for equity research in India a “big focus” and plans to
increase staff in Taiwan, Korea and  Hong Kong  this year.  The London-based company is also considering adding equity
strategists and analysts to cover utilities and quantitative
research, said Stephen O’Sullivan, managing director of Asia
equity research outside Japan, in an interview from Hong Kong.
He declined to give specific numbers of staff or hiring plans.  “India is going to be a big focus for us in the next 12 to
15 months,” said O’Sullivan. “It’s a very big market and we’ve
literally only just started with our cash equities business.”  India ’s economy is forecast to expand 8.2 percent in 2011,
almost twice as fast as the 4.3 percent estimate for global
growth, according to data compiled by  International Monetary
Fund . Barclays named Bhavtosh Vajpayee as managing director and
head of its equities operations in India on July 11.  O’Sullivan, who joined Barclays 17 months ago from
Macquarie Securities, said he will build out the company’s
equity research for the region over the next three to four years
and plans to eventually extend coverage to Australia and the
Asean region, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand
and Philippines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
