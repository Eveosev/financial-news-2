Dennis Gartman , the economist and
editor of the Gartman Letter who correctly forecast 2008’s
commodities slump, said he will buy more gold when the metal
falls to between $1,500 an ounce and $1,525.  Bullion climbed for 11 straight days before reaching a
record $1,610.10 yesterday, the longest streak of gains since
July 1980, and touched all-time highs in euros and pounds this
week. Gartman last week said he cut his bullion holdings by
about a half as “too many people have joined the trade.”  The metal is “looking vulnerable to the downside,”
Gartman said today in his Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman
Letter. The drop “in the great scheme of things would be
inconsequential as to the validity of the long-term bull move in
gold. It would return the market to relative health by taking
the latest longs out of their positions and it would bring us
back to the market as buyers again of that which we had sold.”  European leaders will meet in Brussels tomorrow as they
struggle to resolve the European Union debt crisis that helped
boost demand for gold as a protection of wealth. Debt concerns
in the U.S. also helped the metal gain 12 percent this year and
head for a 11th straight annual increase, the best run of gains
since at least 1920. Gartman said yesterday that the recent
price run means “a correction of serious consequence is
coming.”  Commodities Up  The metal has beaten the 2.7 percent gain this year for the
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. The  Standard & Poor’s 
GSCI Index of 24 commodities is up 11 percent and treasuries
returned 3.7 percent, according to a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,587.50 an ounce by
9:59 a.m. in London and was last at 1,119.36 euros and 985
pounds. The metal may decline to about 1,080 euros and 960
pounds, Gartman said. He owns bullion in euros, pounds and yen.  Bullion’s advance earlier this week lifted its 14-day
relative strength index, a gauge of whether a commodity is
overbought or oversold, to 74.24. Some analysts who study
technical charts view a level of 70 or above as a signal of a
potential impending drop.  The Standard & Poor’s commodities index plunged as much as
66 percent in the seven months through February 2009 after
Gartman in June 2008 said there would be a “tidal wave” of
selling.  To contact the reporters on this story:
