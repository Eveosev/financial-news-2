Jordan  will receive 60,000 metric
tons of heavy fuel next week to supply the Aqaba Thermal Power
Station after natural-gas supplies were cut following sabotage
on  Egypt ’s export pipeline last week,  Al Rai  said.  The plant’s five power-generation units in the Red Sea port
of Aqaba switched to heavy fuel after the gas cuts and are
operating at full capacity, the newspaper reported, citing
Mahmoud Alawneh, the utility’s director.  Jordan, which imports almost all of its energy needs, has
been forced to switch its  power plants  to more expensive heavy
fuels such as gasoil and diesel after Egyptian gas shipments
halted on July 12 for the fourth time this year because of
sabotage attacks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
