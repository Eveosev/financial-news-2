Germany â€™s Roman Catholic Church
plans to give victims of sexual abuse as much as 5,000 euros
($7,086) each in compensation,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported
today, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the plan.  In severe cases, the church may increase the maximum
compensation and may also take over the cost of therapy for some
victims, the newspaper reported. So far, 579 people have applied
for compensation from the church, Sueddeutsche Zeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
