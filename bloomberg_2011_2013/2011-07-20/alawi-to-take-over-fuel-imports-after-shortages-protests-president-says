Malawi’s government will take over
the importation of motor fuel after shortages helped spark
demonstrations in major cities today, President Bingu wa
Mutharika said in a speech in Lilongwe that was broadcast on
national television.  “Government has taken over the importation of fuel in this
country through the establishment of the National Oil Company of
Malawi, wholly owned by the government because the Petroleum
Importers Ltd. has failed my government,” he said.  Petroleum Importers, or PIL, is a venture that includes the
local units of  Total SA (FP) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  as well as Puma Malawi
Ltd. and Petroda Malawi Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
