Vietnam ’s bonds dropped after a
report showed month-on-month inflation in the country’s two
major cities accelerated in July.  Hanoi’s consumer-price index climbed 1.32 percent, while  Ho
Chi Minh City ’s prices gained 1.07 percent, online newswire
VnEconomy reported today, citing government data. The two
cities’ CPIs rose 1.21 percent and 0.69 percent respectively in
June. Vietnam’s annual inflation rate was 20.8 percent last
month, the highest since November 2008, official data show.  “Concern about inflation has returned,” said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh City-based money-market dealer at Saigon
Thuong Tin Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “Interbank rates may
increase slightly this month so banks are hesitant to buy
bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year note increased one
basis point to 12.45 percent, according to a daily fixing from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. The one-week interbank deposit rate
gained four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.72
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged at 20,570 per dollar as of 3:10 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,608 today, unchanged since
July 11, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
