Assets in funds generated and
distributed in  Switzerland  declined more than 2 percent to 637.7
billion Swiss francs ($775.3 billion) in June, according to the
 Swiss Funds Association .  The Basel, Switzerland-based SFA cited information from
Swiss Fund Data AG and Lipper Inc. in an e-mailed statement
today. Uncertainty in capital markets, particularly surrounding
debt problems in the euro region and the U.S., led to outflows
of 441 million francs, the SFA said.  A “flight” to the Swiss currency brought 881 million
francs into franc-denominated funds while products denominated
in euros, pounds and dollars suffered “heavy outflows,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
