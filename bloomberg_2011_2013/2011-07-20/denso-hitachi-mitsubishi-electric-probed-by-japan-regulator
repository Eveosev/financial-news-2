Denso Corp. (6902) ,  Mitsubishi Electric
Corp. (6503)  and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  are under investigation by Japan’s trade
regulator in relation to the sale of car parts.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission’s probe concerns the
country’s antimonopoly act, Denso said in a statement today.
Mitsubishi Electric will cooperate with the agency, said a
spokesman who asked not to be named, citing company policy.
Tamie Nagamoto, a spokeswoman at Hitachi, said an investigation
of the company’s automotive unit started today.  The probe may involve price-fixing pertaining to sales of
wipers, radiators, engine starters and alternators, Kyodo News
reported without saying where it obtained the information.  Denso, Japan’s largest car-parts maker, declined to specify
which auto components are involved in the investigation,
spokesman Goro Kanemasu said by phone.  Denso fell 0.2 percent to 2,855 yen as of 1:14 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, while  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 1.1 percent. Hitachi was unchanged at 483 yen, and
Mitsubishi Electric gained 1 percent to 935 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
