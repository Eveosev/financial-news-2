Global supply of natural rubber will
remain “tight” at least during the next seven years as output
gains among key growers fail to match rising demand from tire
and glove makers, according to a producers’ group.  “Tightness in supply will continue until 2018 as
production growth is marginal or moderate,” Jom Jacob, a senior
economist at the Kuala Lumpur-based  Association of Natural
Rubber Producing Countries , said in an interview in Bangkok
yesterday. The member countries of the group, also called ANRPC,
represent 92 percent of global supply.  Limited supplies may help boost a 47 percent rally in
rubber futures in  Tokyo  in the past year, potentially increasing
costs for companies such as  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , Michelin & Cie.
and  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the top three tire makers.
Prices may remain “strong” until next year as persistent rains
limit gains in output, Pongsak Kerdvongbundit, president of Thai
Rubber Association, said yesterday.  A large number of producing rubber trees, which were
planted during 1980s, will have to be uprooted between 2012 and
2018, reducing total area of plantations worldwide, Jacob said.
Farmers delayed cutting down trees to take advantages of high
prices, he added.  Rubber advanced to a record 535.7 yen a kilogram ($6,768 a
metric ton) on Feb. 18 as global demand led by  China  outstripped
supply and after rain and flooding curbed output in Thailand and
 Indonesia , the two largest exporters.  December-delivery contract today gained as much as 3.2
percent to 390.9 yen a kilogram on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.  Aged Trees  Output from ANRPC member countries may climb to as much as
10.3 million tons next year from 9.9 million tons this year,
data from the group show. Production may expand further to 12.2
million tons in 2015 and 13.4 million tons in 2018, it said.  Thailand and  Vietnam  will have a greater expansion rate,
while the growth in Indonesia and  Malaysia  will probably be
stagnant, Jacob said. Some farmers may retain aged trees to gain
from high prices, he said.  Rubber production growth in 2015 may increase between 5.8
percent and 6.6 percent, compared with 2 percent to 6 percent in
normal years as trees planted in 2008 will be ready for tapping,
Jacob said.  The natural rubber shortage may widen to 1 million tons by
2020 as demand from tire makers boosts consumption to about 15.4
million tons,  Stephen Evans , secretary general of the
International Rubber Study Group said on June 8. Demand this
year may gain 4.7 percent to 11.2 million tons, he said.  Chinese Demand  China, the world’s largest consumer, may use 3.5 million
tons of natural rubber this year, a 6.1 percent increase from a
year earlier, according to ANRPC. Vehicle sales in the Asian
nation, the world’s largest automobile market, may grow about 5
percent this year, Zhu Yiping, head of the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers’ statistics department, said on July 8.  Supply deficit in  India , the second largest buyer, will
widen as increasing car sales boost demand for tires, Vinod Simon, president of All India Rubber Industries Association,
said in an interview yesterday. The shortfall may widen to
840,000 tons in 2020 from 175,000 tons this year, he added.  Bridgestone Corp. and its Indian rivals including  Apollo
Tyres Ltd. (APTY)  and  MRF Ltd. (MRF)  are investing $3 billion in plants to
meet rising demand for tires, according to the Automotive Tyre
Manufacturers’ Association. Car sales in the world’s second-most
populous nation may more than double to 3 million by 2015,
according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
