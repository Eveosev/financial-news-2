Hong Kong  Resources Holdings Co.
Ltd., a Chinese retailer of gold and jewelry, fell the most in
five months after resuming trading in Hong Kong following an
investigation of two executives.  The stock dropped 6.9 percent, the most since Feb. 24, to
HK$0.54 at the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong. Trading resumed today
after being halted on July 4.  Chairman Kennedy Wong and Executive Director Chui Chuen Shun are under investigation by the  Independent Commission
Against Corruption  “in their personal capacities,” the company
said yesterday. The investigation doesn’t relate to the
operations of the company or its units, it said.  Wong and Chui couldn’t be immediately reached for comment
when a call was made to their offices.  The two executives are under investigation for “alleged
irregular activities” in the purchase of shares in Ocean Grand
Chemicals Holdings Ltd., the former name of the company, in 2008,
Hong Kong Resources said. The commission took documents from
the company’s office on July 4, it said.  The commission’s spokesman Alan Tse declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
