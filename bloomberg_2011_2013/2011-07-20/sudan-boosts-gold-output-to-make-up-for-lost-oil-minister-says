Sudan  produced 36.8 metric tons of
gold this year through May as it expands mining to compensate
for revenue lost when oil-rich South Sudan seceded on July 9,
Mining Minister Abdel Baqi al-Jailani said today.  “If oil revenue is lost, there are other forms of oil that
we haven’t discovered yet,” al-Jailani told parliament today in
Omdurman, a suburb of Khartoum, the capital.  Sudan’s artisanal miners produced 23 tons of gold through
October last year, al-Jailani said Nov. 7. Sudanese government
figures compare with the London-based researcher  GFMS Ltd , which
says Sudan produced 10.1 tons of gold in 2010. The country
produced 4 tons in 2009 and 2.7 tons in 2008, the group said.
Last year’s 10.1 tons was the most since at least 2000,
according to GFMS data.  The country, which now produces about 115,000 barrels of
oil a day, lost control of about 375,000 barrels of daily
production to South Sudan when it was declared independent this
month.  Sudan’s gold export revenue will probably climb to $3
billion this year from about $1.4 billion in 2010, Sudanese
President Umar al-Bashir told parliament April 4.  Sudan is organizing chrome exploration activities in Blue
Nile and Qadarif states in its east and in Southern Korodfan
state, where discoveries have been made, al-Jailani said today.  “Very large quantities of phosphate have been discovered
in Sudan,” al-Jailani said. He declined to say where the
discoveries were made.  Sudan holds about 90 million tons of potassium north of
Khartoum, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
