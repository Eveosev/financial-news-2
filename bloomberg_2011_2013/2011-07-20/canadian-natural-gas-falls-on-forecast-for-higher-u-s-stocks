Canadian natural gas fell on
forecasts that a heat wave in the U.S. Midwest will ease and
speculation that U.S. stockpiles of the power-plant fuel will
grow, curbing demand.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 2
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather forecast cooler weather for the
U.S. Midwest early in the July 25 to July 29 period. The U.S.
Energy Department tomorrow may say gas inventories gained 66
billion cubic feet last week, compared with 55 billion a year
earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “The trend has been that the injections over the last
several weeks have surprised to the upside, meaning bearish, and
some people may be expecting that trend to continue,”  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston with Canaccord Genuity, said in a
telephone interview.  Alberta  gas for August delivery declined 7.25 cents to
C$3.485 per gigajoule ($3.49 per million British thermal units)
as of 11:30 a.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. September gas fell 7.5 cents to C$3.48. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas in New York fell 8.1 cents to $4.452 per
million Btu as of 11:33 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Chicago  Heat  The high in Chicago may reach 89 degrees (32 Celsius), 4
above normal, on July 25, down from today’s expected 98 degrees,
13 degrees above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State
College , Pennsylvania.  Cooling demand in Chicago will be about 69 percent more
than normal until at least July 26, said Weather Derivatives,
based in Belton, Missouri.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S.
gas supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.75 billion
cubic feet as of 10 a.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.77 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.88 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 921 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.84 billion cubic feet today, about 67 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 1.5 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $4.7053 per million Btu
yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange. Alliance is an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 3.52 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.2060.  To contact the reporter on this story:
