Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  is confident it can
win its first solar plant order in the U.S. before the end of
the year, said Paul Caudill, chief executive officer of the
German company’s U.S. unit.  Phoenix Solar is confident that “before the end of the
year” it can seal orders for sun-powered plants, Caudill said
today in an interview in Munich. Targets include “a couple” of
projects that are larger than 5 megawatts, he said.  Phoenix Solar, a Sulzemoos, Germany-based company that
sells and builds solar plants, opened a subsidiary in  San Ramon ,
California, last August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
