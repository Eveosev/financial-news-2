Alcatel-Lucent SA,  France ’s largest
telecommunications equipment supplier, said it’s exploring
“strategic options” for its enterprise business and has begun
talks with employee representatives.  Alcatel-Lucent is holding meetings with worker
representatives today to discuss possibilities for the unit,
which makes office telephones and related equipment, it said in
a statement. The Paris-based company began considering a sale or
an initial public offering of the business that could fetch
about 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) earlier this year, people
familiar with the plans said in April.  Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen is looking to sell
assets as part of a three-year turnaround plan at Alcatel. Last
year, Alcatel-Lucent sold its vacuum technology unit for 200
million euros, after earlier divesting a stake in aerospace firm
Thales SA.  “No decision has been made on the options being explored”
and the end result of the review may be no change to the
business, Alcatel said today.  Alcatel-Lucent rose as much 10.3 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
3.72 euros and traded at 3.65 euros as of 3:39 p.m. in Paris.
The stock has gained 67 percent this year, valuing the company
at 8.5 billion euros.  The enterprise business generates as much as 1.4 billion
euros in annual revenue, a person familiar with the company has
said. Alcatel-Lucent, which doesn’t break out revenue from the
business, reported 16 billion euros in total sales in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
