The rand’s real effective exchange
rate, which takes inflation into account in measuring a
currency’s performance, is about 15 percent overvalued, implying
the currency may weaken against those of its major trading
partners, Rand Merchant Bank said.  Johannesburg-based RMB, a unit of FirstRand Ltd.,  South
Africa ’s second-biggest lender, sees the rand weakening to 7 per
dollar by year-end and 8 per dollar by the end of 2012 as
European leaders struggle to agree on a second Greek bailout.
The rand slipped 0.7 percent to 6.8935 per dollar as of 4:28
p.m. in Johannesburg.  RMB is “mindful of the growing risks to our long-term
forecasts,” Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by Theuns de Wet
wrote in a research note e-mailed to clients today. “At the
forefront of our concerns is a continued softening in global
growth, a disorderly default of Greek debt and European
contagion.”  The rand’s real effective exchange rate, which is pegged by
the  Reserve Bank  against a trade-weighted basket of currencies,
may weaken as the nation’s current account deficit widens, the
RMB analysts said. The shortfall in the current-account expanded
to 3.1 percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter,
from 1 percent the previous quarter, the central bank said on
June 21.  The deficit may average 4.2 percent of gross domestic
product in 2011 and widen to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2012,
according to RMB estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
