Irish Life & Permanent Plc won
temporary European Union approval to receive an Irish government
recapitalization of as much as 3.8 billion euros ($5.4 billion.)  The European Commission will make a final decision on the
aid after the Dublin-based lender submits a restructuring plan
with measures address competition issues, the regulator said in
a statement today.  “The recapitalization is necessary to increase the bank’s
solvency ratios, thereby enabling it to resist potential stress
situations and preserving stability on the Irish financial
markets,” the commission said.  Irish Life’s shareholders will today vote on resolutions
paving the way for the government to take control of the company
with the injection of the 3.8 billion euros.  Allied Irish Banks
Plc (ALBK)  and Bank of Ireland have already gained EU permission for
extra state aid after a banking crisis forced the Irish
government to bail out the country’s lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
