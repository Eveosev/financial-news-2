Mauritius’s rupee gained for a
second day versus the dollar amid speculation U.S. and European
policy makers are moving closer to resolving their debt crises,
boosting demand for riskier assets.  The currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 28.30 per dollar
by 2:54 p.m. in  Port Louis . A close at this level will be the
strongest since July 14.  Emerging-market stocks rallied after President  Barack Obama 
endorsed a deficit-cutting deal proposed by a non-partisan group
of senators. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel meet tomorrow to seek common ground on
tackling a European debt crisis. The euro gained versus the
dollar as the U.S. currency lost some of its safe-haven appeal.  “Markets reacted positively to this news, with risk
appetite increasing,”  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the nation’s
largest lender by market value, said in a research note received
by fax.  Europe is the largest buyer of Mauritian exports, including
sugar and textiles, and is the source of almost two-thirds of
its tourists, according to Bank of Mauritius. The rupee closely
tracks the euro versus the dollar, with a correlation of 0.877
over the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 38-member SEMDEX stocks gauge declined 0.3 percent to
2,045.83, led by Sun Resorts Ltd. and  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)   To contact the reporter on this story:
