The  African Union  said it’s
considering taxes on air tickets, imports and insurance premiums
to raise funds for the 53-member bloc.  Contributions from member states and partners are “no
longer adequate, sustainable and reliable to meet the growing
financing needs of the Union,” the organization, based in  Addis
Ababa , Ethiopia, said in an e-mailed statement today. Such taxes
would “not only have a significant revenue impact for the
union, but will also be equitable and efficient.”  The African Union is seeking to mediate in the conflict
between Muammar Qaddafi and rebels opposing his rule in Libya,
historically one of the bloc’s main financers.  Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has been
appointed to head a panel investigating ways to finance the
African Union. Taxes on plane tickets in  Senegal  and import
duties in the Economic Community of West African States have
proved successful funding mechanisms, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
