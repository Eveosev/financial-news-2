Shipments of tea from  Kenya , the
world’s biggest exporter of the black variety of the leaves, may
decline as much as 25 percent this year amid a drought, Tea
Board of Kenya Managing Director Sicily Kariuki said.  Exports may decline to 330 million kilograms (727.5 million
pounds), Kariuki said at a tea convention in the port city of
Mombasa today. In January, the board said the East African
nation shipped 441 million kilograms of the leaves last year.  “Drought experienced at the beginning of the year largely
affected the production of tea in the country,” Kariuki said in
an interview.  Unseasonably dry weather has curbed agricultural output in
Kenya, which relies on farming for a quarter of its gross
domestic product. On June 8, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta 
forecast that growth in East Africa’s largest economy will slow
to 5.3 percent this year from 5.6 percent in 2010.  Output this year may decline 10 percent, she said.
Production last year was 399 million kilograms, the board said
in January. Exports are higher because the figure includes
carryover stock from the previous season.  Kenya accounted for 26 percent of global tea shipments last
year, Kariuki said.  More than 70 percent of Kenya’s tea is exported to five
destinations including  Egypt , the U.K.,  Pakistan , Afghanistan
and Sudan. Domestic consumption accounts for about 5 percent of
total output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
