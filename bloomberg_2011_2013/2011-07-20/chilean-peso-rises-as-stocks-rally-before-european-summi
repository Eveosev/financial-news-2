Chile ’s peso fell as copper prices
tumbled and U.S. stock markets declined, decreasing investor
appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 462.85 pesos per U.S.
dollar at 3:09 p.m. New York time, from 462.35 yesterday,
erasing earlier gains.  “It’s basically following the stock markets, though copper
is also a driver” Andres de la Cerda, a trader at Bice
Inversiones, said in a telephone interview from Santiago. “In
the morning, the U.S. markets were up, but they reversed and the
peso followed suit, though the changes were pretty minimal.”  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had added 0.1
percent, was down 0.1 percent at 12,580.20.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
0.6 percent to $4.44 per pound on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.57 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
