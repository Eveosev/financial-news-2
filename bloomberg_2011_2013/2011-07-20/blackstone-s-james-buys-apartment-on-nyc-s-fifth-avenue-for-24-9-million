Tony James , president and chief
operating officer of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , purchased a co-op on
Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue for $24.9 million.  The deal for the duplex at 834 Fifth Ave. was completed on
July 12, according to New York City property  records  filed
yesterday. The seller was Harold Prince, director of Broadway’s
“Phantom of the Opera.”  James joins other notable buyers of co-ops in the 16-story
building. Last July,  Charles Schwab , chairman of Charles Schwab
Corp., made a $27.7 million purchase, and Rupert Murdoch,
chairman and chief executive officer of News Corp., bought an
apartment in 2005, property records show.  “The building has just achieved a reputation over the
years by the people that have chosen to live there,” Barbara
Fox, president of New York brokerage Fox Residential Group, said
in a phone interview. “When you’ve made it, you can go there.”  A phone message left for James with a spokeswoman,
 Christine Anderson , wasn’t immediately returned. The deal was
reported yesterday by the New York Observer.  The co-op, in the Lenox Hill neighborhood, features
“exquisite detail,” 12-foot ceilings and panoramic views of
Central Park, according to  StreetEasy.com . It was on the market
since December, the property listings website shows.  -- Editors: Christine Maurus, Kara Wetzel  To contact the reporter:
