NSL Group , the parent of India’s
fifth-largest wind-turbine maker, is close to buying a wind
project in  Chile  for $50 million, the Economic Times reported,
citing people it didn’t identify.  The Hyderabad-based group plans to acquire the development
rights to build a wind farm in phases across five adjacent sites
in the South American country, the report said.  The acquisition is part of a plan to spend $650 million
over the next three years to develop 400 megawatts of wind
capacity, it said.  Earlier this week, the group announced that FE Clean Energy
Group, a Darien, Connecticut-based private equity fund, would
invest $40 million in its NSL Renewable Power Private Ltd. unit.  NSL Group owns Regen Powertech Pvt.,  India ’s fifth-largest
wind-turbine maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
