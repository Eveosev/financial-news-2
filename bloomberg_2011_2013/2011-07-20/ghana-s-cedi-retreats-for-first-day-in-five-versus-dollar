The cedi slipped for the first time
in five days versus the dollar, losing less than 0.1 percent to
1.5120 from 1.5115 yesterday.  The cedi has advanced 0.2 percent from 1.5148 per dollar
since the  Bank of Ghana  said July 6 it will offer 300 million
cedis ($198.4 million) of its first issue of five-year bonds
since 2007.  The central bank monitors the  currency market  on daily
basis and gives liquidity support when it sees the need for it,
Collins Antwi, assistant director at the treasury department of
the central bank, said July 7. Monetary policy makers have not
sold dollars so far this week, Kofi Pianim, a Stanbic Bank Ghana
Ltd. currency trader, said in a telephone interview from Accra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
