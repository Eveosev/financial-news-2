National Central Cooling Co., known
as Tabreed, said it repaid a 735 million-dirham sukuk ($200
million) that matures today.  “The repayment of the 2006 sukuk today was contemplated in
our structuring of the recapitalization program and improves the
company’s overall financial position,” Chairman Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi said in a statement to Dubai bourse today.
“The strong capital structure that was put in place with the
recapitalization program underpins Tabreed’s long-term growth
potential.”  Tabreed, which builds and operates air-conditioning and
cooling systems, said in April it completed a recapitalization
program by refinancing 2.63 billion dirhams ($716 million) of
debt and obtaining as much as 3.1 billion dirhams of long-term
capital from Abu Dubai government-owned Mubadala Development Co.  The shares lost 0.3 percent to 99.7 fils in Dubai
yesterday. The stock has declined 40 percent this year compared
with a 6.6 percent drop in the benchmark Dubai Financial Market
General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
