Poland’s  core inflation  was
unchanged for a second month in June, lower than expected and
easing pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel
prices from the  consumer price index , was 2.4 percent, the
central bank said today in a statement on its website. That’s
less than the 2.5 percent median forecast by 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The data come after the Central Statistical Office
yesterday reported that industrial output slowed in June to the
lowest growth rate in 20 months. June was the first month since
July 2010 in which the annual core inflation rate dropped from
the previous month.  “The latest inflation figures and forecasts for weaker
inflation pressure to come will not push the Monetary Policy
Council into rapid rate hikes,” economists at Bank Pekao SA in
Warsaw said in a note to clients before the release.  The central bank last week lowered its forecast for 2011
economic growth to 3.2 percent from 3.6 percent amid signs the
euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis is spreading and may damage
the bloc’s recovery. The bank paused its monetary-tightening
cycle this month after increasing borrowing costs four times
this year, saying it may raise  interest rates  further if
prospects for meeting its inflation target worsened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
