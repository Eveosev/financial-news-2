361 Degrees International Ltd., a
Chinese maker of sports shoes and clothing, climbed the most in
10 months in  Hong Kong  after the company said store sales rose
as it continued to open outlets.  The stock advanced 6.5 percent, the most since Sept. 24, to
HK$4.42 at the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong.  Sales at stores operating for at least two years grew 18
percent in the three months ended June 30, 361 Degrees said in
an e-mailed statement. A net addition of 224 locations brought
its total outlets to 7,681, the company said.  “361 Degrees is in a different camp than  Li Ning  and China
Dongxiang,” Huei-Chen Liu, an analyst at Everbright Securities
Co., said in a phone interview from  Shanghai . 361 Degrees
targets the low to mid-end market while  China  Dongxiang Group
Co., owner of the Kappa brand in China, and Li Ning Co. focus on
higher-tier cities, Liu said.  Today’s gain trims 361 Degrees’ slide this year to 21
percent, compared with a 4.5 percent drop for the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index .  Li Ning, which said July 7 it may post a decline in first-
half sales, has slid 45 percent in the same period. China
Dongxiang, which on July 8 reported a drop in first-half sales,
has lost 48 percent of its market value this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
