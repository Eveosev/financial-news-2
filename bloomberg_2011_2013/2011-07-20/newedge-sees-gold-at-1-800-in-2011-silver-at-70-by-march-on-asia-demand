Gold prices will surge to $1,800 an
ounce by the end of this year, and silver will soar to $70 an
ounce by March as physical demand climbs in  Asia  and investors
seek a haven asset, Newedge USA LLC said.  “Gold is an excellent hedge in troubled times” as
European and the U.S. leaders struggle to resolve debt woes,
Mike Frawley, the global head of metals, said yesterday in an
interview in New York. Demand for gold and silver will be “very
strong long-term from Asia, and the economic trend in the West
is improving,” he said.  The gold forecast indicates a 13 percent rally from current
levels. The metal climbed to a record $1,610.70 on July 19. The
silver estimate means prices will jump 77 percent from
yesterday’s closing price.  Newedge , based in New York, was the
biggest futures-commission merchant by a measure of customer
assets on deposit as of May.  Record investment demand for gold in  India  will keep
climbing as higher incomes spur buying, Reliance Capital Asset
Management, the operator of the country’s second-biggest fund
backed by the metal, said last week. Chinese demand, which
increased 32 percent in 2010, may double in the next 10 years,
according to the World Gold Council.  Aluminum, Copper  Industrial metals such as aluminum and copper will also
benefit from robust demand in emerging markets, Frawley said.
Aluminum may climb to $3,000 a metric ton in the first quarter,
and copper will rise above $10,000 a ton, he said.  “Millions of Chinese people are moving from the
countryside to cities annually and that migration is leading to
new jobs and new wealth, and the money is being invested in
various opportunities,” Frawley said. “And you add to that the
growth and modernization of India. The outlook for metals is
very positive.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 90 cents to $1,597.80
