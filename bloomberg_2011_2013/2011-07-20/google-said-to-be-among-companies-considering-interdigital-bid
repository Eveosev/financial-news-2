Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , aiming
to bolster their patent portfolios, are among companies weighing
possible bids for InterDigital Inc., a mobile-phone technology
designer, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  The person declined to be identified because the matter is
private. InterDigital, which has about 1,300 patents related to
mobile-phone technologies used to transfer information, hired
bankers as it considers a sale, the King of Prussia,
Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement yesterday.  InterDigital joins companies including Nortel Networks
Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co. in selling patent portfolios that
will help would-be owners defend themselves against allegations
of infringement. Google lost in a bid for Nortel’s $4.5 billion
portfolio to a group that included Apple and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   InterDigital’s patents in cellular technology are “deeper
and stronger” than Nortel’s, InterDigital Chief Executive
Officer William Merritt said in April. The company has a market
value of about $3.1 billion.  Evercore Partners Inc. and Barclays Capital will “explore
and evaluate potential strategic alternatives” that may include
a sale, InterDigital said yesterday.  Aaron Zamost, a spokesman for Google, declined to comment,
as did Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, and Jack Indekeu, a
spokesman for InterDigital.  InterDigital rose $15.41, or 29 percent, to $68.67 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after surging 28
percent yesterday. Google, based in Mountain View, California,
fell $7.20 to $595.35. Apple rose $10.05, or 2.7 percent, to
$386.90.  The Wall Street Journal reported Google’s interest earlier
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
