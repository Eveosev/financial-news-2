Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which
extracts minerals from the  Dead Sea  to make fertilizer, headed
for the highest close in two months after Mosaic Co. said demand
for potash is increasing.  The shares jumped 1.9 percent to 57.80 shekels at 1:12 p.m.
in Tel Aviv, poised for the highest close since May 19.  “There’s optimism on potash and fertilizer after Mosaic
gave guidance on quantities,” Guil Bashan, an analyst at IBI-
Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by
telephone. “Good demand implies good quantities for Israel
Chemicals too.”  Global muriate of potash shipments will climb to a record
55 million to 58 million tonnes in 2011 and are forecast to grow
to between 70 million and 73 million tonnes by 2020, James Prokopanko, Mosaic’s president and chief executive officer, said
on a conference call yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
