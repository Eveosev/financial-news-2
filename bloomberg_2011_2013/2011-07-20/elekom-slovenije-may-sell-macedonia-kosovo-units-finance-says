Telekom Slovenije d.d. may sell its
units in  Kosovo  and the Republic of Macedonia “for a good
price,” Finance  reported , citing Chief Executive Officer Ivica Kranjcevic.  Slovenia’s state-owned company’s unit in Albania may also
be for sale, while the one in Bosnia-Herzegovina “has very good
operations” and is unlikely to be sold, Kranjcevic said in an
interview with the Ljubljana-based newspaper.  Telekom Slovenije will achieve its net income target of 28
million euros ($40 million) for the year, Kranjcevic told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
