Later-than-normal rainfall in
 Burkina Faso , sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer,
caused delays in planting seeds for the 2011-12 harvest in two
of the main growing regions.  Farmers in the central part of the  West African nation  who
sell their fiber to Faso Coton, the country’s third-biggest
cotton company, planted for an extra five days ending today
after rainfall picked up over the past week, Operations Director
Marc Leynaeart said by phone yesterday. “They will plant again
the seeds which did not grow,” he said.  Cotton farmers in Burkina Faso need rain to both prepare
the soil and to germinate the seeds during the key planting
period that was supposed to end July 15. The planting period was
extended in the east of the country where farmers sell to
Societe Cotonniere du Gourma, said Ali Compaore, chief executive
officer of the company.  The company, known by its acronym Socoma, plans to produce
60,000 metric tons of cotton during the 2011-12 harvest,
Compaore said by phone yesterday. The crop output will start in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
