Myra Kraft, the wife of New England
Patriots owner  Robert Kraft , died today after a battle with
cancer. She was 68.  “Words cannot express the deep sorrow that we feel in
learning of the passing of Myra Hiatt Kraft,” the National
Football League team said in a  statement  on its website. “We
are all heartbroken. The global philanthropic community and the
New England Patriots family have suffered a great loss.”  Myra Kraft served on boards including  Brandeis University 
in Waltham,  Massachusetts , where she graduated in 1964. She was
founder and president of the New England Patriots Charitable
Foundation and in 1995 became the first chairwoman of the Boys &
Girls Clubs of  Boston .  Robert Kraft, 70, is a member of the NFL’s labor committee,
which is negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with
players who were locked out four months ago.  Robert Kraft is chairman of the Kraft Group LLC, which
includes paper container manufacturing, real estate and sports
and entertainment units. Myra Kraft’s father, Jacob Hiatt, was a
former chairman of Rand-Whitney Container Group, which is now
part of Kraft’s organization.  In addition to her husband, Myra Kraft is survived by four
sons: Jonathan, the Patriots’ president; Daniel; Joshua; and
David.  No details on funeral services were disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
