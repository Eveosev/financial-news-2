The naira weakened after the central
bank cut the supply of dollars for sale by 38 percent compared
with a previous auction.  Nigeria ’s currency depreciated by 0.07 percent to 150.11
naira per dollar at today’s bi-weekly auction, according to data
published by the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  on its
website.  The central bank sold $250 million, less than the $361.7
million demanded by lenders. The central bank of sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy and largest oil producer has
been using foreign-currency reserves to keep the naira within a
3 percentage-point band above or below 150 per dollar as its
twice-weekly auctions to help check inflation.  “With the naira already under pressure, news of a
shortfall in central bank supply affects its pricing
immediately,” Usman Onoja, the chief executive of Lagos-based
Lovonus Trust and Investment Limited, said by phone today. “The
central bank should balance supply with demand.”  Naira appreciated 0.05 percent to 152.12 by 4:14 p.m. in
Lagos on the  interbank market , the strongest level since July
12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign-currency reserves stood at $34.2 billion as of
July 18, compared with $38.4 billion a year ago, according to
central-bank data.  The Nigerian inflation rate slowed to 10.2 percent in June
from 12.4 percent in May, the National Bureau of Statistics said
on July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
