Two U.S. lawmakers asked a Dow Jones
& Co. oversight panel whether senior  News Corp. (NWSA)  executives in
the U.S. knew about or were complicit in the phone-hacking
scandal now engulfing the company.  Democratic Senators  Barbara Boxer  of  California  and  Jay Rockefeller  of West Virginia also requested information on the
hiring of Leslie Hinton, who resigned as chief executive officer
of News Corp.’s Dow Jones unit on July 15. Hinton oversaw News
Corp.’s U.K. newspapers during the time of the alleged hacking
by employees at a London tabloid.  “The American people need to be reassured that this kind
of misconduct has not occurred in the United States and that
senior executives at News Corporation properties in our country
were not aware of or complicit in any wrongdoing,” Boxer and
Rockefeller wrote in  the letter  today to the special committee
that oversees editorial independence at Dow Jones.  The committee said in a July 15 statement that it didn’t
see any relationship between Hinton’s resignation and his tenure
at Dow Jones or the Wall Street Journal, where he was the
publisher. The committee was formed in 2007 to monitor
journalistic integrity and independence at the newspaper after
News Corp.’s $5.2 billion purchase of Dow Jones.  Teri Everett, News Corp.’s spokeswoman, did not immediately
respond to a call for comment.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
