North American investors were net
sellers of Japanese stocks for the first time in a year in June,
according to a  Tokyo Stock Exchange  report today.  North American investors offloaded 97.8 billion yen ($1.24
billion) in Japanese stocks in June, the TSE data show. European
investors sold 9.6 billion yen in Japanese shares for their
first net sales in three months, while Asian investors were net
buyers, purchasing 74.5 billion yen in the nation’s equities,
according to the TSE.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average increased 1.3 percent in June,
paring this year’s decline to 4 percent, on optimism earnings
will improve for Japanese companies as the country recovers from
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that left more than 23,000
people dead or missing and triggered the worst nuclear accident
in 25 years. The broader Topix index also climbed 1.3 percent
last month, reversing three months of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
