Uganda  plans to borrow $463 million
from the  African Development Bank  over the next two years to
fund health, agriculture, water and sanitation projects, said
Patrick Khaemba, the lenderâ€™s country representative.  At least $84 million in loans have so far been approved for
health projects, $60 million for the agricultural industry and
$65 million for water and sanitation, Khaemba told reporters
today in the capital, Kampala. The loans are in addition to $1.1
billion the bank is lending the East African country for 21
projects, he said.  The 40-year loans will have an interest rate of 0.5 percent
and a 10-year repayment grace period, Khaemba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
