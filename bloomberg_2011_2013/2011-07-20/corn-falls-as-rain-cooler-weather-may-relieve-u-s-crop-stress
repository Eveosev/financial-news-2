Corn futures fell for a second time
this week on speculation that damage to the U.S. crop from a
heat wave will be limited by rain, lower temperatures and high
humidity in Midwest growing regions.  As much as 0.75 inch (1.9 centimeters) of rain will fall in
Nebraska and  Iowa  tomorrow, and the hot weather will ease
throughout the Midwest beginning July 23, Global Weather
Monitoring said in a report today. As much as 1 inch of rain
will temporarily boost soil moisture in parts of the northern
and eastern Midwest on July 24 and July 25, the forecaster said.  “The high humidity and some rain will help to reduce some
of the negative repercussions,”  Dale Durchholz , the senior
analyst for AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview. “The market is very nervous about the
weather because some crops are doing better than people expected
with the heat this week.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $6.8325 a bushel at 10:59 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $7.0375, the highest
since June 13. Before today, the most-active contract gained 74
percent in the past year.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
