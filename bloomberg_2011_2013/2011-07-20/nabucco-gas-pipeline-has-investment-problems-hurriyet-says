The European Union-backed Nabucco
pipeline project to gain access to natural gas in the  Caspian
Sea  lacks investment and has unresolved legal issues, Hurriyet
reported, citing a senior Azeri energy official.  Messages to European countries seeking investment support
for the project have yet to be answered, the paper said, citing
an interview with Elsad Nasirov, vice president of the State Oil
Co. of  Azerbaijan .  Separately, Turkey and Azerbaijan have yet to conclude an
agreement on supply and transit they had sought to sign in April
or May, Nasirov said, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
