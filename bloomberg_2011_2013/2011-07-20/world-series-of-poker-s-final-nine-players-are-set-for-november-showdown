The  World Series of Poker ’s main
event narrowed its field to the final nine players, who will
compete in November for the $8.7 million top prize.  The “November Nine” is made up of players from seven
countries -- three from the U.S. and one each from Ireland,
Belize, Ukraine,  Germany ,  England  and the  Czech Republic .  The leader is Martin Staszko, a 35-year-old Czech poker
professional who has almost 40.2 million in chips, according to
the tournament’s website. Second in chips, with more than 33.9
million, is Ireland’s Eoghan O’Dea, 26. O’Dea’s father,
Donnacha, won a World Series tournament title in 1998.  Also returning to Las Vegas on Nov. 5 to play in the final
table are Americans Matt Giannetti (24.8 million in chips), Phil
Collins (23.9 million) and Ben Lamb (20.9 million); Badih
Bounahra of Belize (19.7 million); Pius Heinz of Germany (16.4
million); Anton Makiievskyi of Ukraine (13.8 million); and Sam
Holden of England (12.4 million).  Lamb, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, has a win and second-place
finish at the 58-event  World Series  this year.  The final two players will go head-to-head on Nov. 7, with
the winner earning $8.7 million and the champion’s bracelet, and
the runner-up taking $5.4 million. Each of the final nine is
guaranteed to make at least $782,115.  The main event, officially known as the No-Limit Texas
Hold’em World Championship, began with 6,865 entrants, making it
the third largest live event in poker history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
