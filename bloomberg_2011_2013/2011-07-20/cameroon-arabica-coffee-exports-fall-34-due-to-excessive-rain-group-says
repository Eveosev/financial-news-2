Coffee exports from Cameroon’s main
port Douala have fallen 34 percent in the October to May period
after excessive rain damaged the crop.  The arabica beans have been of poor quality, Mbah
Christopher, general manager of the North West Cooperative
Association, one of the main exporters said by phone yesterday
from Bamenda, the capital of the North West province.  “There has been too much rain in the coffee producing
zones of the North West, South West and West, making conditions
unfriendly for drying”, he said.  The central African nation exported 1,277 metric tons
between October and May compared with 1,923 tons during the same
period last year, according to a report by the Cocoa and Coffee
Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
