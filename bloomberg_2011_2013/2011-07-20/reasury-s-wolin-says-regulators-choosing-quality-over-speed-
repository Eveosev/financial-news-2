U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said regulators will pick “quality over speed” when
completing rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul
law.  “We must continue to move forward quickly, but carefully,
to implement the law,” Wolin said in testimony prepared for a
hearing tomorrow before the Senate Banking Committee. “We will
continue to prioritize quality over speed, and we will take the
time we need to get it right.” The hearing coincides with the
one-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank.  “We do not have to choose between stability and growth,”
Wolin said. The U.S. will “continue to promote international
consistency” in areas including over-the-counter derivatives,
and liquidity, leverage and capital at financial institutions,
he said.  Small banks “should not have to comply with the same set
of rules as a large financial firm,” he said. “We will
continue to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
