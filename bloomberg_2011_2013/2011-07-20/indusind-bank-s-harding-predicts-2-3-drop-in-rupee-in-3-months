(Corrects prediction for the level to which rupee will decline
to 45.15 per dollar instead of 45.50.)  J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based
executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., comments on the
outlook for  India ’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.2 percent to 44.98 per dollar as of 9:11 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will drop 1.2 percent from the spot rate of 44.45.  “The rupee will weaken to 45.15 per dollar in three months.
There is no clarity on the economic front as the inflation rate
is high and that may hurt the growth. There is tremendous demand
for dollars from importers.  “There is also uncertainty on global  oil prices , which may
rise to above $100 a barrel. All these factors will put pressure
on the rupee. The trading range for the currency is between
44.15 and 45.15 for the next three months.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
