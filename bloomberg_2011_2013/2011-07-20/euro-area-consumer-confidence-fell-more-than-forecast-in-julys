European  consumer confidence 
weakened more than economists forecast in July as leaders
struggled to contain the region’s worsening debt crisis.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell to minus 11.4 from minus 10.3 in June, the Brussels-based
European Commission said in an initial estimate today. That’s
the lowest since April. Economists forecast a drop to minus 10.2
from a previously reported minus 9.8 in June, the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  European Union chiefs plan to meet for a second time in a
month tomorrow in an effort to break a deadlock over a new Greek
bailout that has undermined investor confidence. With
governments stepping up austerity measures, the recovery is
already losing some momentum. In  Germany , investor confidence
dropped to the lowest in 2 1/2 years this month.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on July 28.  The euro was little changed after the data were released,
trading at $1.4181 at 4:01 p.m. in Brussels, up 0.2 percent on
the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
