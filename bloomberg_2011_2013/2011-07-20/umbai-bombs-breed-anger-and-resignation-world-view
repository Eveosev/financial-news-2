Another day, another terror attack. As they were going home from work duringÂ  rush hour on July 13, Mumbaikars heard chilling news of a familiar kind:  Bombs were going off  in different parts of the city. When the dust had settled after  three blasts  in the busy commercial areas of Opera House and Zaveri Bazaar in south  Mumbai  and Dadar in the center, 20 people were dead and more than 80 injured. Sophisticated  improvised explosive devices  were used in the attacks, pointing to the hand of a professional terror group. There was  chaos  as mobile-phone networks were briefly jammed, people ran for cover, rumors made the rounds, and heavy rain disrupted rescue operations. It was the fourth attack in Mumbai involving serial terrorist strikes in the last eight years, making the vibrant, diverse, politically stable city one of the  world's terror capitals . If murmurs of "Pakistan" circulated in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, it wasn't without reason. It is now well established, both by the trial of Ajmal Amir Kasab in  India  and more recently that of  David Headley  in  Chicago , that the deadly terrorist strikes in Mumbai in  November 2008 , in which 174 people lost their lives, were plotted by the Pakistan-based terrorist group  Lashkar-e-Taiba  with the help of that country's security services, the ISI. But there were no immediate leads about the identity of the terror group involved in last week's blasts, and the Indian government's response was considered and temperate. If there was anger, it was mostly directed at the coalition  Congress-NCP  government in power in Maharashtra, India's second-most populous state, of which Mumbai is the capital. The city's residents believe that the state government has been lackadaisical in its efforts to combat terror, helping to make Mumbai a preferred target for terrorist groups both within and outside the country. The first inference to be drawn from the attacks, it was felt, was that the government hadn't learned any lessons from the cataclysm of Nov. 26, 2008. Indeed, the government could afford not to, as the Indian Express pointed out in an editorial called " City/State ": And an editorial in the Hindu titled " Little Learned from 26/11 " excoriated both the Indian government and Maharashtra state leaders for failures on different fronts: These assertions were echoed by the security expert Ajai Sahni, in a long and comprehensive piece in Outlook called " That Recurring Nightmare ": Compared with previous incidents, this time there was more cynicism about Mumbai's fabled "spirit of resilience," which one grizzled newspaperman,  Kumar Ketkar , called simply a "survival instinct," rooted in the detachment needed to exist in the city. It is a detachment that requires the resident of Mumbai to carry on the day after a crisis as if nothing has happened. In a piece called " What Mumbai Spirit ?" that appeared on the Website of the  New Yorker , Naresh Fernandes, a veteran journalist and editor of Mumbai's edition of Time Out, observed: The blasts occurred a few days before two important diplomatic encounters, and are sure to be high on the agenda of both. U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  arrived in  India on July 18  for a three-day visit, and the foreign ministers of India and  Pakistan  are  scheduled to meet  in the last week of July to review the  peace process . By the weekend, the  commercial districts  where the blasts took place were back to work -- they had no choice. But perhaps the least Mumbaikars could do is to find out a bit more about each of  those who lost their lives  last week. Meanwhile, in the Indian capital, a survey by a newspaper of the security arrangements in New Delhi railway station exposed a  familiar state of laxity ...
