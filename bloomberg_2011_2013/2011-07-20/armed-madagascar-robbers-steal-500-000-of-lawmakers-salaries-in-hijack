Armed Malagasy robbers stole about
$500,000 worth of lawmakers salaries and administration money in
an attack outside parliament, said Raharinaivo Andrianantoandro,
president of the country’s Transitional Congress.  “There was a robbery by some bandits who managed to steal
all the money,” Andrianantoandro said by phone from the
capital, Antananarivo.  The robbers hijacked a vehicle that was transporting the
money for about 250 lawmakers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
