U.K. stocks gained the most in three
weeks as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rallied after reporting increased
iron-ore output and Apple Inc.’s better-than-estimated earnings
boosted  ARM Holdings Plc. (ARM)   BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, rose 1.7
percent. ARM, the designer of chips for Apple products, advanced
4.9 percent after the Cupertino, California-based company
reported record sales of iPhones and iPads.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  climbed 63.83, or 1.1 percent,
to 5,853.82 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the biggest gain
since June 30. The gauge has still fallen 3.9 percent from this
year’s high in February amid speculation that Europe’s widening
debt crisis will derail the economic recovery. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index gained 1.1 percent today while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index advanced 0.9 percent.  “U.S. corporations are coming through with good earnings,
and no one’s come out and said the second half is going to be
disastrous,” said David Morrison, market strategist at GFT
Global in  London . “I also think they’re reacting to the
positive noises that came out yesterday indicating they’re
closer to some sort of agreement” on extending the U.S. debt
ceiling.  Yesterday President Barack Obama praised a bipartisan $3.7
trillion debt-cutting plan, offering a sign that lawmakers are
moving toward agreeing on proposals to raise the $14.3 trillion
debt limit before an Aug. 2 deadline.  BHP, ARM  BHP Billiton advanced 1.7 percent to 2,364.5 pence as the
company said fourth-quarter iron ore output rose 14 percent,
driving an 11th straight annual production record.  ARM gained 4.9 percent to 611 pence, the biggest increase
in two months. Apple’s expansion into China and other fast-
growing economies helped make up for slower growth in the U.S.
as it sold 20.3 million iPhones and 9.3 million iPads in the
third quarter.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG) , which also licenses
chips for smartphones, soared 10 percent to 419 pence.  Banks led the FTSE 100 higher, with Lloyds Banking Group
Plc climbing 4.1 percent to 44.91 pence,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  advancing
5.2 percent to 222.6 pence, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
gaining 3.1 percent to 34.11 pence and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
increasing 2 percent to 605.5 pence.  EU Summit  European leaders are meeting in Brussels tomorrow to
discuss measures to restore confidence in the euro region’s
creditworthiness. Officials are considering steps previously
rejected by Germany, including the use of precautionary credit
lines and enabling the main 440 billion-euro ($624 billion)
rescue fund to lend to recapitalize banks, according to a person
close to the discussions who declined to be identified because
the talks are in progress.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  advanced 3.4 percent to
1,030 pence after it said fiscal first quarter sales rose 2
percent, helped by income from capital markets and information
services.  Misys Plc (MSY) , a financial software provider, advanced 7.8
percent to 411 pence after people with knowledge of the
situation said it’s close to being acquired by Fidelity National
Information Services Inc.  ITV Plc (ITV)  gained 3.8 percent to 67.2 pence after analysts at
UBS AG said it’s their most-preferred broadcaster, and the
industry will rally when risk appetite returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
