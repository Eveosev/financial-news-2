Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee
South African sprinter, made the qualifying time for this year’s
track and field world championships and the 2012 London Olympics
with a personal-best in the 400 meters.  Pistorius, who competes with carbon-fiber prosthetic
running blades, clocked 45.07 seconds in winning the 400 meters
at the Internazionale di Atletica Leggera in Lignano,  Italy ,
last night, according to the meeting’s  website .  Known as the “Blade Runner,” Pistorius achieved the  ‘A’
standard  qualifying time of 45.25 seconds and will now need to
be selected in  South Africa ’s team in order to become the first
amputee sprinter to compete at the world championships, which
take place Aug. 27-Sept. 4 in Daegu,  South Korea .  “Feels kind of surreal to have an A-qualification time in
the bag for next year’s  Olympic Games !” Pistorius wrote on his
 Twitter feed . “Can’t sleep I’m so happy.”  Athletics South Africa yesterday named its provisional
squad of  21 athletes  before Pistorius’s run. Last night was his
final chance to qualify for Daegu and came two days after he
clocked 46.65 seconds in Padua, Italy.  Pistorius, a four-time gold medalist in the Paralympics,
smashed his personal best of 45.61 seconds. His time of 45.07 is
tied for the 16th fastest 400 meters in the world this year with
 Jamaica ’s Jermaine Gonzales. Rondell Bartholomew of Grenada
heads the 2011 list at 44.65 seconds.  Pistorius, 24, was born without fibulas and had both legs
amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.  In May 2008, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned
a ban on Pistorius competing against able-bodied athletes. The
International Association of Athletics Federations, track and
field’s governing body, had ruled that his J-shaped carbon fiber
blades gave him an advantage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
