Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , the world’s
largest salmon farmer, slumped to the lowest level in more than
two years in Oslo trading after earnings missed estimates.  Marine Harvest sank as much as 9 percent to 3.25 kroner,
the lowest intraday price since May 8, 2009. Second-quarter net
income slid 8 percent to 676 million kroner ($123 million) from
a year before as rising supply cut prices, it said today in a
statement. The result missed the 705 million-krone average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 23 percent to 4.39 billion kroner.  The company, based in Oslo, dropped 8.2 percent to 3.282
kroner by 11:13 a.m., bringing the year’s slump to 47 percent.  Marine Harvest, majority owned by shipping billionaire  John Fredriksen , said it’s “somewhat concerned” over rising supply
expected for the next 12 months and may cut its output growth.
Volumes from  Chile  are expected to show high growth, it said.  “Marine Harvest is concerned about the market balance,”
Mikael Clement, a Pareto Securities analyst, said in a note.  The company will harvest 335,000 tons in 2011, down 6,000
tons from a prior forecast, it said, mainly on lower Norwegian
volumes. It sees 79,000 tons of gutted weight this quarter.  Marine Harvest will consider a semi-annual dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
