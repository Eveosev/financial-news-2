Mersen (MRN) , the world’s biggest maker of
brushes for electrical motors, said it will probably lift full-
year targets for sales and profitability as second-quarter sales
rose 17 percent to 218 million euros, led by demand from Chinese
makers of solar panels.  Mersen, which is targeting like-for-like sales growth of
more than 5 percent and an operating margin before non-recurring
items of more than 11 percent, will “likely” raise these goals
when it releases first-half earnings on Aug. 31, the Paris-based
company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
