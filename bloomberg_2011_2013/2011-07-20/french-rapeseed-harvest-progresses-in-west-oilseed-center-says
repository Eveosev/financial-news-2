Rapeseed harvesting in western
 France  is “well advanced,” according to Paris-based Cetiom,
the country’s technical center for oilseed crops.  Average yields in the Poitou-Charentes, Vendee and Limousin
regions in the southwest, where harvesting is completed, are
around 3 metric tons a hectare (2.47 acres), the researcher said
in a  report  on its website today.  Yields are about 3.2 to 3.3 tons a hectare in southern
Brittany and the Pays de la Loire and between 3.5 and 4 tons in
northern Brittany and Normandy, according to Cetiom. Harvesting
is still in progress in the Eure and Eure-et-Loir departments
and has been completed elsewhere in the Centre and Ile-de-France
regions, Cetiom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
