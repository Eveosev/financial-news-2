South Africa ’s wheat harvest will
probably increase by 21 percent to 1.7 million metric tons this
season, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tina
Joemat-Petterson said.  Wheat production will climb from 1.4 million tons from the
previous season, according to an e-mailed transcript of Joemat-
Petterson’s remarks in response to a question in parliament.
South Africa is expected to import 1.7 million tons of wheat for
4.9 billion rand ($709.8 million) in the year through September,
it said.  The grain plantings for the 2011 production season are
expected to be about 600,000 hectares, an increase of more than
7 percent compared with the last season’s plantings of 558,100
hectares, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
