Borders Group Inc., the bankrupt
bookstore chain, said 99 objections from creditors are
irrelevant because the company’s liquidation means it won’t
carry on any contracts with business partners.  Borders is scheduled to seek court approval tomorrow to
liquidate its 399 remaining stores. All objections from
creditors should be overruled, the company said in court papers
filed yesterday. It doesn’t plan to keep or transfer any
contracts or leases, making objections from around 99 creditors
moot, Borders said.  “Nonetheless, the debtors and the liquidators have been,
and will continue, working to resolve all pending objections to
narrow, if not resolve, all outstanding issues” before
tomorrow’s hearing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan,
Borders said.  Borders has drawn objections from creditors, landlords and
e-book maker Kobo Inc., which called the sale process “hurried
and confused.”  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s Seattle’s Best Coffee LLC unit
said its intellectual property might be improperly transferred
because trademarked goods such as beverage-making instructions
haven’t been removed from Borders stores.  Borders, based in  Ann Arbor , Michigan, has about 10,700
employees. A phased rollout will close its stores by September.
The company said it will complete the wind-down under Chapter 11
and expects to be able to pay business partners.  The case is In re Borders Group Inc., 11-10614, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
