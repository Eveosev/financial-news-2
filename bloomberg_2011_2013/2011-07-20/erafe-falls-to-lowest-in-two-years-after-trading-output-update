Merafe Resources Ltd. (MRF) , part owner of
the world’s biggest ferrochrome maker, fell to a two-year low in
Johannesburg trading after predicting lower profit and output.  The stock slid 2.6 percent to 1.11 rand as of 5 p.m. local
time, the lowest close since July 22, 2009. First-half earnings
per share will decline to 3-4 South African cents from 8 cents a
year earlier, Merafe said today in a statement. A chrome venture
with  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  will run at about half capacity from June to
August, it said.  On May 4, Merafe forecast that its joint venture would
operate at 65 percent capacity in  South Africa ’s winter months,
allowing the company to carry out maintenance while higher power
tariffs applied. It attributed the latest output cutback to
“market conditions.”  The venture contributes around 16 percent of global
ferrochrome supply, according to Merafe’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
