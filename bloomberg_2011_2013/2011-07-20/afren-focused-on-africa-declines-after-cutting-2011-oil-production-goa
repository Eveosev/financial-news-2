Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer focused on  Africa , fell in London trading after it cut
its full-year production target for a second time because of
unplanned stoppages.  Shares dropped as much as 4.9 percent in London and traded
at 148 pence as of 8:18 local time.  The company forecast average daily output of 25,000 to
30,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2011 in a statement.
Afren revised its output estimate in January to 40,000 barrels
from a 55,000 barrel-a-day prediction in September.  Today’s revision is “due to non-reservoir related
facilities downtime and simultaneous operations,” said Osman
Shahenshah, chief executive officer of Afren. “Looking forward,
we are targeting both organic and inorganic reserves growth,
with up to nine exploration wells targeting over 600 million
barrels net to Afren in the second half of 2011 and further
value accretive acquisitions.”  The company said reservoirs at its Ebok and Okoro fields
had come in at the upper end of expectations and said it will
invest $450 million in projects this year. Afren plans to be
producing 50,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
