 PT Pertamina said it expects
 Indonesia  to maintain its oil production level at 1 million
barrels per day in 2025 while reducing its dependency on the
fuel to 20 percent from the current 50 percent.  Indonesia will reduce oil use while increasing coalâ€™s share
to 35 percent from 25 percent, and gas to 30 percent from 20
percent, Rukmi Hadihartini, a director of the state-run oil and
gas company, said today at a forum in  Seoul .  To contact the reporters on this story:
