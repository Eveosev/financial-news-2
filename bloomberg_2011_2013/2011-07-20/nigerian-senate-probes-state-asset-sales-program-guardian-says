Nigeria’s Senate set up a seven-
member committee to investigate the progress of the West African
nation’s state asset sales program since it began in 1999, the
 Guardian  newspaper said, citing proceedings of the legislative
chamber.  Senate President David Mark said yesterday that the
decision aimed to help the program succeed and was not intended
as a “witch hunt” of the Bureau for Public Enterprises, the
state asset sales agency, the Lagos-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
