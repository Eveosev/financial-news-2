Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures climbed for a second day after a report
showed that U.S. stockpiles dropped as refineries bolstered fuel
output and on speculation European leaders will agree on steps
to address the regionâ€™s debt crisis.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.85 percent at 2 p.m. in  New
York , down from 29.94 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 54 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $98.40 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil for August delivery gained 64 cents, or 0.7
percent, to expire at $98.14 a barrel at the close of floor
trading on the exchange. August options expired July 15.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $90 puts, with 1,311 lots changing hands. They slipped
14 cents to 80 cents a barrel. September $95 puts, the next-most
active option, fell 27 cents to $1.87 a barrel with 890 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $110 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,282 lots changing hands. They gained 10 cents
