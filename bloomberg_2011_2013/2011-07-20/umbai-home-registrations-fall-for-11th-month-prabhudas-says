Mumbai home sales fell for an 11th
month in June declining to levels seen two years ago as higher
 interest rates  and  home prices  crimped demand, according to
Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.  Registered sales declined 27 percent to 4,721 units in June
from a year earlier, according to the brokerage’s report to
clients today. Sales in Mumbai’s suburbs slid 26 percent, while
transactions in the city dropped 32 percent, said Kejal Mehta,
an analyst at Prabhudas.  “The three-month moving average of sale registrations are
now at a 24-month low,” Mehta said in the note. “With no
visible signs of a meaningful correction in prices,
affordability continues to remain a major cause of concern,
painting a grim outlook for the Mumbai realty space.”  India ’s central bank has raised interest rates 10 times
since March 2010, extending the longest streak of monetary
tightening in a decade after inflation accelerated. The  Reserve
Bank  of India last raised the repurchase rate to 7.50 percent
from 7.25 percent on June 16.  Rate increases in India will slow growth this year and help
ease inflation to 6 percent “with an upward bias” by March 31,
2012, central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on May 3.
 India’s economy  may expand “around 8 percent” in the year
through March from 8.5 percent in the previous 12 months, he
estimated.  Higher interest rates and prices are prompting more people
to defer purchases and opt for renting apartments, the brokerage
said. Lease volumes touched a new high and rose 11 percent from
the same period a year ago, indicating pent-up demand, Mehta
said. Lease registrations in June climbed to a record 10,191
units from 9,950 units in May, according to the note.  Registration data is a lagging indicator of demand as
properties are registered two to three months after the actual
purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
