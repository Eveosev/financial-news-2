Philip Wyatt, a senior economist at
UBS AG in  Hong Kong , comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee.
He predicts the currency will strengthen to 43 against the
dollar by the end of this year and to 40 by the end of 2012.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the rupee gained
0.1 percent to 45.01 per dollar as of 1:13 p.m. in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 1.2 percent from the spot rate of
44.4650.  “In the longer term we are positive on the rupee but the
roadblocks in the short term include the soft patch in global
growth, how long it takes for Indian inflation to cool and
whether the market perceives the central bank has done enough to
tame inflation.  “Big global factors are more important for the rupee in
the short term as we believe the moves by the  Reserve Bank  of
India to tighten monetary policy are coming to an end.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
