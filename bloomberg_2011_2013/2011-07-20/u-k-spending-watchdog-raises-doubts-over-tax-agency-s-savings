Britain’s revenue and customs
department faces a “significant challenge” in its efforts to
cut 1.6 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) from its costs, the
government spending watchdog said.  The National Audit Office said Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs -- a division of the Treasury -- will find it hard to
make those savings while it is trying to boost  tax revenue ,
improve services and cut welfare payments. It has a “limited”
and “restricted” understanding of costs, the auditor said in a
report published in London today.  “There is no contingency in its plans to achieve value for
money,” said Amyas Morse, head of the  audit office . “It needs
to better define the service it is aiming for, improve its
understanding of costs and develop its implementation plan.”  HMRC is seeking to trim its budget costs over four years by
cutting jobs and technology projects and reducing the number of
offices it operates. It has saved 1.4 billion pounds since 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
