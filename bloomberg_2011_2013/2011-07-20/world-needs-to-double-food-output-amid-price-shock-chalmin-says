World  food production  needs to
double in the next 50 years to feed the world’s growing
population, said  Philippe Chalmin , professor of economic history
at University Paris-Dauphine.  The world’s population is forecast to jump to 9.3 billion
in 2050 from an estimated 6.9 billion in 2010, requiring a 70
percent increase in food production, according to the  United
Nations .  The world is “having a real food crisis,” Chalmin said at
the launch of a 25th annual report on commodity markets at the
NYSE offices in  London  today. “We are definitely right now, as
far as food markets are concerned, in a situation of a real
price shock,” he said, adding that this was reflected in wheat,
corn and soybean prices.  Supply shortages are a result of increased consumption, a
lack of agricultural investment, and climatic problems,
according to Chalmin. “The world food problem is acute,” he
said, adding that more money needs to be put toward agriculture.  Grain supplies are likely to remain tight until the end of
the year, especially corn, he said, adding that a “huge
problem” could arise if it doesn’t rain in the U.S. corn belt.  Sugar prices may reach 30 cents a pound in the next few
weeks, while coffee is expected to slide, he said. The outlook
for cocoa remains uncertain.  “We will need to see what happens to  Ivory Coast ,”
Chalmin said. “A part of Ivory Coast cocoa has become Ghana
cocoa,” he said, referring to smuggling between the two
countries during the civil unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
