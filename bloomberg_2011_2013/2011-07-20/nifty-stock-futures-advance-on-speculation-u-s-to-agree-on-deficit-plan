India’s benchmark stock index fell
the most among Asian markets today amid concern rising inflation
and  interest rates  will dent corporate earnings.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the nation’s third-biggest software exporter,
plunged to the lowest in almost 11 months after saying net
income was little changed in the three months ended June 30. Dr.
Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., the second-biggest drugmaker, dropped
the most in two weeks after reporting first quarter earnings in
line with analyst estimates.  “Weak corporate earnings and forecasts are not giving
investors the confidence to put their money on the table,” said
 Arun Kejriwal , a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment
Services Pvt. in Mumbai. “The positive mood from the U.S. and
other world markets have been spoilt by Wipro’s numbers.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
151.49 points, or 0.8 percent, to 18,502.38 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange of  India  Ltd. fell 0.8 percent to 5,567.05 and its July
futures settled at 5,565.90. The BSE 200 Index slipped 1 percent
to 2,297.34.  U.S. and most Asian equities rallied after President Barack Obama endorsed a deficit-cutting proposal by a bipartisan group
of senators, easing concerns that a short-term default by
America may derail the global economic recovery.  The Sensex has declined 9.8 percent this year, the second-
worst performer among benchmark indexes of the world’s 10
biggest markets, amid interest-rate increases. Three out of six
Sensex companies that have reported earnings for the quarter
ended June 30 have fallen short of analyst estimates as rising
borrowing costs damped demand.  Wipro Forecast  Wipro sank 3.9 percent to 398.95 rupees, its lowest close
since August 30. The company said net income was little changed
at 13.3 billion rupees ($299 million) in the fiscal first
quarter ended June 30, meeting analyst estimates, and forecast
revenue from computer services may rise as little as 2 percent
as clients hold off from outsourcing larger projects.  “For the second quarter, which is typically the strongest
for all the IT companies, they’ve guided for slower growth than
their peers,” said Vihang Naik, an analyst at MF Global Sify
Securities Pvt.  Dr. Reddy’s fell 2.1 percent to 1,566.55 rupees, its
steepest slide since July 6. The company reported first-quarter
profit of 2.63 billion rupees compared with analyst estimates of
2.68 billion rupees.  LIC Housing  LIC Housing Finance Ltd. (LICHF) , the home-loan arm of India’s
largest insurer, plunged 3.3 percent to 216.7 rupees after it
reported first-quarter profit of 2.57 billion rupees, less than
the 2.81 billion rupees estimated by analysts.  Companies on the Sensex may report a profit growth of 12
percent to 14 percent in the year to March 2012, less than the
consensus estimate of 17 percent, Rakesh Arora, head of research
at Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Pvt., said in a July 18
interview. Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its profit
estimate for Sensex companies to 17 percent from 21 percent,

percent to 178.8 rupees. Companies on the Sensex are valued at
14.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 10.9 for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index.  RBI Meeting  India’s inflation quickened to 9.44 percent in June from
9.06 percent in May, the government said on July 14. The rate
was less than the 9.68 percent median estimate of 28 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. India has persisted with the most
aggressive monetary tightening among  Asia ’s major economies even
as regional neighbors from  Malaysia  to the  Philippines  held
borrowing costs steady in recent weeks to protect growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India meets on July 26 to set policy
after raising rates 10 times since March last year to rein in
accelerating price gains.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the largest lender, paced decline
