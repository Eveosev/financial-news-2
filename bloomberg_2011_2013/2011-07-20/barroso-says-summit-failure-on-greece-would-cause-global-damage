European Commission President Jose Barroso comments on tomorrow’s meeting of euro-area leaders to
work out a second aid package for  Greece . He spoke to reporters
today in Brussels.  “Nobody should be under any illusion; the situation is
very serious. It requires a response. Otherwise, the negative
consequences will be felt in all corners of  Europe  and beyond.  “The situation requires full engagement by everyone at the
summit and I believe we’ll have it.”  “The minimum we must do tomorrow is to provide clarity on
the following: measures to ensure the sustainability of Greek
public finances; feasibility and limits of private-sector
involvement; scope for more flexible action through the European
Financial Stability Facility, the EFSF; repair of the banking
sector still needed; and measures to ensure the provision of
liquidity to our banking system.”  “Most of the decisions to be taken tomorrow belong to the
competence of the member states. They have reserved the
instruments to themselves and they have said they will do what
it takes to ensure the stability of the euro area. Well, now is
the time to make good on that promise.  “There is, of course, also the responsibility of the
 European Central Bank . A solution will require that all actors
exercise their responsibility to the full.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
