Cash premiums for U.S. corn shipped
in July to export terminals near  New Orleans  widened relative to
Chicago futures as farmers withheld supplies. The soybean basis
narrowed on slowing exports.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was $1.03 to $1.04 a bushel above September futures,
compared with $1 to $1.03 yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean premium declined to 77 cents
to 84 cents a bushel above August futures from 82 cents to 84
cents, the fourth drop in five sessions.  “Farmers are not selling” as  hot weather  from Oklahoma to
 New York  may damage crops that are reproducing, Brian Basting, a
market analyst for Advance Trading Inc. in Bloomington,
 Illinois , said by telephone.  “There’s a shortage of corn
available.”  Corn futures for September delivery fell 10 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $6.88 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
second decline this week. Yesterday, the price reached $7.235,
the highest since June 15.  Soybean futures for August delivery dropped 1 cent to
$13.7825 a bushel, the third straight loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
