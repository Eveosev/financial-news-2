Egypt  plans to raise 5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($838 million) at an auction of treasury bills
tomorrow  after yields dropped from the highest levels since
2008.  The country’s central bank, which holds the sales on behalf
of the  Finance Ministry , will seek bids for 1.5 billion pounds
in six-month notes and 3.5 billion pounds in one-year
securities, according to central bank data on Bloomberg.  The average yield on the six-month notes fell nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 12.544 at the last auction.
It had reached 12.791 last month, the highest since October
2008. The rate on the one-year notes has declined 13 basis
points at the last auction to 12.851 percent from this year’s
high in June.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 fell one basis point to 5.64 percent at 2:17 p.m. in
Cairo. The pound weakened 0.1 percent to 5.9661 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
