Cotton futures declined for the
fourth time in five sessions on signs that global demand will
continue to slump.  Orange juice  also dropped.  Cotton’s share of the global market for clothing, home
furnishings and industrial products will fall to 30 percent by
Dec. 31 from 40 percent a year earlier, Robert Antoshak, a
managing director at New York-based Olah Inc., an apparel
manufacturer and consulting group, said yesterday. Futures
tumbled as much as 57 percent since reaching a record $2.197 a
pound on March 7.  “There has been a demand destruction, and no one knew it
would be this severe,” Chris Kramedjian, a risk-management
consultant at FCStone Fibers & Textiles, said in a telephone
interview from Nashville,  Tennessee . “We are seeing a
resumption of the trend today.”  Cotton for December delivery slid 0.09 cent, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1.0075 at 2:47 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . On July 18, the price touched 94.46 cents, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Sept. 16.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 1.3 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2 a pound. Yesterday, the price reached
$2.0265, the highest since March 21, 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
