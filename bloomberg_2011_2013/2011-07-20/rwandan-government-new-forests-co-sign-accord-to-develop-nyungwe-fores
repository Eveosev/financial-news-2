Rwanda â€™s government signed an accord
with New Forests Co., a U.K.-based company, to develop the
Nyungwe Forest buffer zone in the East African country.  NFC will build wood-products manufacturing plants around
the forest to cater for the construction industry, the
government said in an e-mailed statement yesterday from Kigali,
the capital. The company may also build a 25-megawatt bio-mass
power plant in Rwanda if further agreements are reached with the
government, according to the statement.  Nyungwe Forest, situated in southeastern Rwanda, covers an
area of about 970 square kilometers (375 square miles),
according to the website of Rwanda Direct.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
