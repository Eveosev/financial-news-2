U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said that the U.S. financial system “is in much
stronger shape, not just relative to the depth of the crisis but
also relative to conditions that prevailed before it hit.”  In an op-ed piece appearing in the Wall Street Journal’s
online edition, Geithner wrote that some opponents of the
financial rules overhaul are “trying to slow down and weaken
rules, starve regulatory agencies of resources, and block
nominations so that they can ultimately kill reform.”  “We will not let that happen,” Geithner wrote. “Too many
Americans are still suffering from the pain of the financial
crisis. We owe them a financial system with better protections
against abuse and catastrophic risk. As secretary of the
Treasury, I will recommend that the president veto any
legislation passed by Congress that would undermine these vital
financial protections.”  He also wrote that in the government’s process of “winding
down”  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , “we are implementing reform
quickly but carefully.” He added: “Where we need more time to
get the substance right, we will take the time we need.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
