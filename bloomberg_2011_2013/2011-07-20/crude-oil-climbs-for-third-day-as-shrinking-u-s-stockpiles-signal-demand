Oil climbed for a third day in  New
York  as investors bet that shrinking U.S. crude stockpiles
indicate fuel demand will increase in the world’s biggest
consumer of the commodity.  Futures for September gained as much as 0.4 percent. The
contract rose 0.6 percent yesterday after the Energy Department
said inventories fell 3.73 million barrels to 351.7 million for
a seventh week of declines. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast a decrease of 2 million. Refineries operated at 90.3
percent of capacity, the highest in almost a year.  “The crude number was very strong,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Refineries are
operating at the highest rate this season, which suggests there
is pretty strong demand somewhere. It looks like U.S. refineries
are producing a great deal of fuel for export.”  Crude for September delivery gained as much as 40 cents to
$98.80 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $98.68 at 8:56 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday gained 54 cents to $98.40. Prices are 29
percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement rose $1.09, or 0.9
percent, to end the session at $118.15 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange yesterday. The European
benchmark contract traded at a premium of $19.75 a barrel to
U.S. futures, compared with a record close of $22.63 on July 14.  Cushing Supplies  Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the physical delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New
York, tumbled 977,000 barrels to 36.7 million, according to the
Energy Department report.  Refinery operations advanced 2.3 percentage points last
week, the report showed. Operating rates were forecast to be
unchanged, according to the median of 14 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies increased 757,000 barrels to 212.5
million, the first gain in five weeks. They were forecast to
decline 250,000 barrels, according to the survey. Inventories of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, rose 3.43 million barrels to 148.5 million barrels.  Profit margins for refiners, as expressed by the so-called
crack spread, climbed to a record $34.993 a barrel July 14,
based on New York futures prices. The hypothetical profit to
refine three barrels of oil into two barrels of gasoline and one
of heating oil was $32.10 a barrel, based on yesterday’s
settlement prices of September contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
