Kosovo imposed a trade embargo on
products from  Serbia  in retaliation for Serbiaâ€™s ban on goods
that bear signs of its former province, Beta  news agency 
reported, citing the government in Pristina.  Kosovo also imposed a 10 percent tax on imports from
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which also refuses to recognize Kosovo as a
state and government-issued documents and stamps, the report
said.  The decision came after talks between Serbian and Kosovo
officials over energy exchange trading, travel documents,
registration plates for vehicles, telecommunications and other
non-political issues were suspended until September, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
