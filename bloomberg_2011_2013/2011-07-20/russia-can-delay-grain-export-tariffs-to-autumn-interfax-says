Russia has no need to impose tariffs
on grain exports at least until autumn, Interfax reported,

6,000 rubles a metric ton, Zubkov said today in the Volgograd
region, according to the  news agency . A Russian ban on all grain
exports expired July 1 as scheduled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
