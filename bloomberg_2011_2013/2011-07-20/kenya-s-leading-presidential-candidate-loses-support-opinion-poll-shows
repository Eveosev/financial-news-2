Support for Kenyan Prime Minister
 Raila Odinga , the leading candidate in presidential elections
scheduled for next year, declined over the past four months,
according Synovate Ltd., a market-research company.  Odinga has the backing of 32 percent of the electorate,
according to a poll conducted from June 30 to July 8, compared
with 38 percent in March, Synovate Managing Director Maggie
Ireri told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta ’s support increased to 21 percent from
18 percent, while Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka’s popularity
declined to 11 percent from 13 percent, she said.  Factions of Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement have been
“getting out of his camp and influencing other people not to
support him,” Ireri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
