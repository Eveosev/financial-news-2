Crude oil premiums in the U.S. Gulf
fluctuated as the spread widened between the U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate and Brent.  The gap increased 55 cents to $19.75 a barrel based on
today’s settlement prices. The spread settled at a record high
of $22.63 a barrel July 14. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium rose 30 cents to $19.55 a
barrel over WTI as of 2:12 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed
$3.95 a barrel to $20.30 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend lost 70 cents to $17.30 while Poseidon’s narrowed 40 cents
to $16.85 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium retreated $2.55 to $13.95 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 8 cents to
37 cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium lost $1 to
$22.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $9.75. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the tar sands
in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$16.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
