Ethanol futures slipped from a
three-year high in  Chicago  as corn fell amid forecasts for heat
to ease in the Midwest.  The grain-based biofuel dipped as rain and cooler weather
is forecast to move into the corn-rich Midwest next week after
the region was barraged by a heat wave this week. Corn is the
primary input cost for U.S. ethanol producers.  “It was pretty quiet for corn and ethanol today,” said
Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in
Chicago. “Looks like there could be some good chances for rain
next week. If we don’t get those rains this crop could be in big
trouble.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 1.9 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.892 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices yesterday were at $2.911, the highest
settlement price since June 27, 2008. Futures are up 22 percent
this year.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 9.5 cents, or
1.4 percent, to settle at $6.7775 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
