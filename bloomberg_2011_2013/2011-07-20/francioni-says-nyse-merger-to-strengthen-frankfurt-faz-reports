Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  Chief Executive
Officer Reto Francioni said the exchange’s takeover of  NYSE
Euronext (NYX)  will “undoubtedly” strengthen Frankfurt as a
financial center, even though the new entity will also have
headquarters in New York,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported today, citing Francioni.  Some 70 percent of the merged company’s sales will be in
Europe, Francioni said, according to the newspaper. The CEO
added that dividend payments are likely to remain in a similar
span as where they have been previously, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
