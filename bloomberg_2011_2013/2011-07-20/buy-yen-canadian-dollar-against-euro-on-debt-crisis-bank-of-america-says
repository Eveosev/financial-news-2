Investors should buy the Canadian
dollar and the Japanese yen against the euro if they expect the
European debt crisis to escalate, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  “Despite our concerns about the sustainability of the euro
at its current level, we are reluctant to recommend selling it
against the dollar,” David Woo, head of global rates and
currency strategy, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “For
investors looking to sell the euro on expectations that policy
makers will not be able to stabilize the peripheral crisis soon,
we would recommend buying the Canadian dollar and yen against
it.”  The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.4201 as of 2:29 p.m. in
 London . It was little changed at 112.05 yen and C$1.3468. The
17-member common currency has weakened 2.1 percent this month
against a basket of nine developed-market peers, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
