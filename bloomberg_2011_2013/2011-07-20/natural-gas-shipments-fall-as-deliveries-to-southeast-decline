Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped for the first time in four
days as shipments to the Southeast declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 3.2 percent to 21.5 million
dekatherms (21 billion cubic feet) from 22.3 million yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Schedules for 704 of
742 pipelines had been reported as of 1:35 p.m. New York time.  Scheduled shipments to power generators in all or portions
of 16 central and southeastern states dropped 12 percent to 5.4
million dekatherms, with 185 of 196 pipelines in the region
having reported deliveries.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Transco 65, on the
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. line in Mississippi and
 Louisiana , gained 5.54 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.6482 per
million British thermal units as of 1:20 p.m. New York time on
the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
rose 3.72 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.6414 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
