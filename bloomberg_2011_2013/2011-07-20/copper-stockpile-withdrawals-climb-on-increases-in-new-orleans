Orders to withdraw copper from
warehouses tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange rose to the
highest in three weeks on bookings in  New Orleans .  Canceled warrants increased 2,625 metric tons to 23,175
tons, the highest since June 29, exchange data showed today. A
total of 2,675 tons were canceled in New Orleans, home to 26
percent of total LME copper stocks. Copper stockpiles rose 300
tons to 467,700 tons, the highest in three weeks.  Removing any metal from LME warehouses in New Orleans may
take as much as nine weeks at a current minimum daily removal
requirement, according to Duncan Hobbs, an analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd. in London. Current LME rules require most warehouses
to release at least 1,500 tons of any metal daily at each
location.  Zinc stockpiles fell for a fifth day, declining 3,825 tons
to 880,075 tons. Most withdrawals were registered in  Malaysia .
Canceled warrants declined 3,525 tons to 69,400 tons.  Lead stockpiles increased 1,025 tons to 310,275 tons,
driven by gains in Singapore and Malaysia. Total canceled
warrants were little changed at 17,100 tons, with 400 tons
canceled in Antwerp,  Belgium .  Aluminum stockpiles fell 8,875 tons to 4.41 million tons
after rising 12,200 tons yesterday. Canceled warrants fell 8,775
tons to 350,200 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
