Instability in the euro region will
affect Iceland’s decision on whether to join the European Union,
Finance Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson said.  The region’s sovereign-debt crisis “must have an impact on
our assessment on how Iceland’s interest is best secured,”
Sigfusson told state broadcaster  RUV  last night. “If we see a
lot of weaknesses within the euro union when it comes to
tackling the difficulties of small states that need support,
then of course that has a negative impact on one’s evaluation on
how feasible that relationship is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
