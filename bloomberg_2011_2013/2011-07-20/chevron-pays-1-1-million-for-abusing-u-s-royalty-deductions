Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. energy company, paid $1.1 million for improperly claiming
royalty deductions on some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil leases, the
Interior Department said.  Chevron repeatedly claimed transportation deductions even
though the department said the  San Ramon , California-based
company isnâ€™t eligible, the Interior Department said today in a
statement.  Chevron paid the fine July 14, according to the statement.  -- Editors: Steve Geimann, Judy Pasternak  To contact the reporter on this story:
