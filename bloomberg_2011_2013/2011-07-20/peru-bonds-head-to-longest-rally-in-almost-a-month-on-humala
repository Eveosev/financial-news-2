Peruvian bonds posted their longest
rally in almost a month as confidence grows that President-elect
Ollanta Humala will appoint officials who investors consider to
be good for business.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell for a fourth day, declining one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.26 percent at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
dropped six straight days in the period ending June 24.  The bonds are rallying because of increased investor
confidence that the Humala administration will include officials
who will allow “the macro environment to be very positive for
pro-market policies,”  Benito Berber , a strategist at Nomura
Securities Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview.  Central bank President Julio Velarde will remain in his
post for another five-year term to help maintain economic
stability after his term ends July 28, Humala said in an
interview with Lima-based America Television on July 17.  Peru’s sol was unchanged at 2.7370 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
