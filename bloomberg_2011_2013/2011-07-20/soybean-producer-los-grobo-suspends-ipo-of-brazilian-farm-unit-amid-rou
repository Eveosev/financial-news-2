Los Grobo SA,  Argentina ’s second-
biggest soybean producer, delayed plans to transfer some assets
to a new company and sell shares of the business in an initial
public offering in  Brazil .  Los Grobo announced the suspension of the sale in an e-
mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News today, without
giving a timeframe for the delay. The new company, LG
Agronegocios & Participacoes SA, announced the IPO plans in a
regulatory filing on May 31.  LG Agronegocios joins at least seven other companies that
have shelved first-time sales in Brazil this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and the securities regulator.
Copersucar SA, a Brazilian millers cooperative that accounts for
10 percent of global sugar exports, suspended a planned IPO for
60 days today because of market conditions.  Argentina’s Grobocopatel family, which controls Los Grobo,
and Brazil’s Grupo Vinci Partners, an  investment company  set up
by former Banco Pactual SA partner Gilberto Sayao, are among the
partners who set up LG Agronegocios.  Credit Suisse Grupo AG, Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco BTG
Pactual SA and Banco Bradesco BBI SA are managing the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
