The U.S. House approved a Republican
plan to slash spending and condition a $2.4 trillion debt-
ceiling increase on passage of a constitutional amendment to
balance the budget.  The measure, passed 234-190, stands little chance of being
endorsed by the Senate, and President  Barack Obama  said he would
veto it. The president and lawmakers are negotiating toward a
plan to meet an Aug. 2 deadline for raising the nationâ€™s $14.3
trillion debt limit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
