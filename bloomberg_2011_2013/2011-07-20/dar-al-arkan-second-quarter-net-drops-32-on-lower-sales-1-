Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN) , Saudi Arabia’s biggest property company by assets, reported
a bigger than expected decline in second-quarter profit as
demand for land slumped.  Net income dropped to 297.8 million riyals ($79.4 million),
from 437 million riyals a year earlier, on lower sales, the
Riyadh-based company said in a statement to the Saudi  bourse 
today. Dar Al Arkan was expected to post a profit of 321 million
riyals, according to the mean estimate of six analysts.  The decline in profit was for the sixth consecutive
quarter. Dar Al Arkan is seeking “to enhance the gross profit
margin of its land bank,” the statement said. Operating profit
fell 38 percent to 305.7 million riyals.  Dar Al Arkan had its ratings withdrawn from Moody’s
Investors Service in January after its ratings were lowered by
one level in November to Ba3, the third-highest non-investment
grade. Dar Al Arkan is required to repay 7.8 billion riyals of
debt maturing through 2015.  The stock has lost 16.7 percent this year compared with a
1.9 percent drop for  Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock index.  Dar Al Arkan announced its results after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
