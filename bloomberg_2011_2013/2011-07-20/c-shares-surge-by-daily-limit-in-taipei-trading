HTC Corp. (2498)  surged by the daily limit
in Taipei trading after the stock went ex-dividend, meaning the
company will probably start buying back its shares from today,
said Richard Ko, an analyst at KGI Securities Co.  The share jumped 7 percent to NT$872 in Taiwan. The
smartphone maker said it will buy back as much as 2.4 percent of
its outstanding shares.  “While the statement said it could start buying shares
from Monday, it should only start doing it from today because
regulators would prefer it to buy back shares after going ex-
dividend,” said Ko.  Separately, the United Daily News today cited  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
Chairman  Eric Schmidt  as saying the the smartphone maker didn’t
infringe any  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  patents.  Schmidt expressed his support for HTC, said Robin Moroney,
a Google spokesman in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
