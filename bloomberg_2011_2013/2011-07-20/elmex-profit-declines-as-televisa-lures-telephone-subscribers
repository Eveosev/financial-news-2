Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the
nation’s largest land-line phone company, said second-quarter
profit fell 12 percent as  Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) ’s cable units lured
users with packages of voice, TV and Internet service.  Net income dropped to 3.15 billion pesos ($270 million), or
17 centavos a share, from 3.57 billion pesos, or 20 centavos, a
year earlier, Mexico City-based Telmex said yesterday. Sales
fell 2.9 percent to 27.6 billion pesos, beating the 27.3
billion-peso estimate of Andrew Campbell, an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG in  Sao Paulo .  Telmex, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s America
Movil SAB, is fighting in court to overturn the Mexican
government’s decision to deny it a license to offer television
service over its phone lines. Meantime, it’s selling a package
of services with satellite-TV provider Dish  Mexico  to keep
clients from switching to Televisa’s cable units.  Phone lines operated by Telmex fell to 15.3 million, a loss
of 308,000 from the previous quarter, including 113,000
disconnected lines that were no longer being used because they
had been dedicated to technical support for dial-up Internet
services. High-speed Internet subscriptions increased 112,000 to
7.57 million.  Telmex gained 9 centavos to 9.41 pesos yesterday in Mexico
City trading before results were announced. The shares have lost
6 percent this year.  (The company plans to hold a conference call at 10 a.m. New
York time. To listen, call 866-270-6057 from the U.S. or
