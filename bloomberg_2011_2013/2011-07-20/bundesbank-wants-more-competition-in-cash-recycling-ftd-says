Carl-Ludwig Thiele, head of the
Bundesbank’s cash and payment systems departments, said there is
too little competition in  Germany ’s cash recycling business, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing Thiele.  The Bundesbank wants action on awarding licenses allowing
companies to recycle banknotes and coins as it hands over parts
of its cash recycling operations to private companies, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
