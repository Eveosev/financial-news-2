The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it will decide July 26 whether to establish a
system to watch the trading behavior of big market participants
including high-frequency trading firms and  hedge funds .  The system, proposed three weeks before the May 6 crash
that temporarily erased $862 billion in market value of U.S.
shares, would apply to firms that buy and sell at least 2
million shares a day. Traders that execute $20 million of
equities a day or $200 million in a month also would qualify.  Under the plan, the SEC would assign identification codes
to the firms. Non-public data would be available to the SEC the
day after a trade, allowing the agency to investigate
manipulative and abusive practices, according to the proposal
originally released April 14, 2010.  “The fact is that rapid technological advances have had an
impact on trading strategies and on the ways in which some
broker-dealers carry out their trades,” SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in a statement last year.  The SEC  said  it also will consider at its July 26 meeting a
rule requiring institutional investments managers to disclose
how they voted in non-binding executive compensation votes that
began this year and re-propose earlier rules related to shelf-
eligibility for asset-backed securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
