Prabhat Awasthi, head of  India 
research at Nomura Holdings Inc., comments on the outlook for
the nation’s stocks. He spoke in an interview with Bloomberg-UTV
in Mumbai.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
dropped 0.8 percent to 18,502.38 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai.  “We have become positive on a 12-month perspective. We
have acknowledged there are still headwinds in the short term.
We are still cautious about earnings and near-term data point on
inflation and the one or two rate hikes that might take place.
Valuations are not as stretched as they were looking when we
went underweight on the markets.”  “The  Reserve Bank  of India policy ultimately seems to be
starting to work on the demand side. Inflation is not going to
be as much of a problem as we go forward as it has been in the
last two years. It’s the inflation momentum we should be
bothered about. Given the slowdown in the economy you will see a
slowdown in the momentum. The hike in RBI policy will depend on
how inflation behaves. We are closer to peaking today than we
were couple of months back.  ‘‘Our fiscal 2013 forecast is below 8 percent and that is
again a reflection of incremental data points that have emerged.
Slow down in the investment cycle has been joined by consumption
slowdown.  ‘‘From current levels we expect 10 percent to 20 percent
returns over 12 months.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
