U.S. Bancorp Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Cecere said any acquisitions by the company,  Minnesota ’s
biggest bank, would be similar to previous purchases and not be
transformative.  “We are not going to change,” Cecere said today in an
interview after the Minneapolis-based company released second-
quarter earnings. “We like our mix of businesses, we like the
businesses we’re in. I would not expect us to change that
business mix as the result of a new deal.”  U.S. Bancorp, which reported a 57 percent increase in
second-quarter profit and a 3.8 increase in revenue, plans to
stick to its four business lines: wholesale, retail, payments,
and trust and securities services, Cecere said. Potential bank
targets are trading at a low valuation, though that’s not a
consideration for U.S. Bancorp, he said.  “We will look at any opportunity that is available and
make sure it makes both strategic and financial sense,” Cecere
said.  The lender has made three acquisitions since August 2010 in
payments transactions, small bank deals and corporate trust
transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, including
the January acquisition of First Community Bank, a subsidiary of
First State Bancorporation, from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Cecere said he expects the company to continue to focus on
similar opportunities in the bank’s geographical footprint.  Cecere said he doesn’t expect to eliminate employees,
noting that headcount has increased with revenue in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
