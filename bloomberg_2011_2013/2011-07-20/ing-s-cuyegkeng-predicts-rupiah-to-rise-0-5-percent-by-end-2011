Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING
Groep NV in  Manila , comments on the outlook for the Indonesian
rupiah in a research note released today.  ING predicts the currency will strengthen 0.5 percent to
8,500 per dollar by the end of the year. The rupiah climbed 0.1
percent to 8,541 as of 1:39 p.m. in Jakarta.  “The causes of the decline in Asian currencies last week
are likely to persist and keep currencies on a slightly weaker
bias. The two market themes, the European Union debt saga and
economic activity data surprises, remain influential to  market
sentiment .  “With inflation on a downtrend,  Bank Indonesia  does not
need to allow the rupiah to appreciate significantly. After the
surprise policy rate hike in February, the central bank has
relied on rupiah strength to moderate imported inflation
pressures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
