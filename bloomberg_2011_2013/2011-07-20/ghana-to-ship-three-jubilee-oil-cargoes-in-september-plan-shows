Ghana will ship three cargoes of
Jubilee crude in October, unchanged from September, according to
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  All shipments are 950,000 barrels each, the plan showed.  The Jubilee field is operated by U.K.-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) 
and started production in December. The crude is light and
sweet, or low sulfur, meaning it will produce more profitable
fuels such as gasoline and diesel.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
