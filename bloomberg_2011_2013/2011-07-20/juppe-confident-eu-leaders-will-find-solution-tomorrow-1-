French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe 
said European Union leaders are “committed to do all in our
hands” to ensure the bloc’s stability. “We hope to come up
with a decision over Greece tomorrow in order to calm the
markets,” he told reporters in Madrid today.  “We have found solutions to previous crises and we’ll find
a solution now as well,” he said. “A failure would be
catastrophic for the euro zone.”  Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez told journalists
that the bloc’s future “is at stake.”  Juppe, who earlier today said a cease-fire in Libya would
require  Muammar Qaddafi  giving up power, said also said France
intends to unify messages to the Libyan leader saying he needs
to step down in order to negotiate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
