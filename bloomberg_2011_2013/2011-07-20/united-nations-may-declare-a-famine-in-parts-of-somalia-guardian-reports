The  United Nations  may declare a
famine in parts of Somalia amid the worst drought in 60 years,
the Guardian reported, without citing anyone.  The UN humanitarian co-ordinator for the Horn of Africa
country is expected to make the announcement today based on data
from the  Food and Agriculture Organization , the London-based
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  There hasnâ€™t been an official famine since one occurred in
Ethiopia and  Sudan  in 1984-85 that left about 1 million people
dead, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
