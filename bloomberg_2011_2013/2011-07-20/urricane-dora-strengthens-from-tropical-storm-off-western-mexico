 Dora became the fourth named
hurricane of the Eastern Pacific season after strengthening from
a tropical storm off  Mexico , U.S. meteorologists said.  The system was about 240 miles (390 kilometers) south of
 Acapulco , Mexico, and should continue to intensify today and
tomorrow as it moves west-northwest at 17 miles per hour, the
National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory  issued at 9 p.m.
Pacific Daylight Time time yesterday. The weather system is
likely to move parallel to the southwestern Mexico coast over
“the next couple of days,” according to the bulletin.  Dora is a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, the weakest category for the
destructive storms. Maximum sustained winds were near 75 mph
“with higher gusts,” while hurricane-force winds extended 35
miles outward, the center said. It could become a “major
hurricane” by tomorrow.  The government of Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch
for the country’s southwestern coast from Lazaro Cardenas to
Cabo Corrientes.  Bret, the second tropical storm of the  Atlantic hurricane
season , may weaken today and could become a tropical depression
by tomorrow, the center said in a separate  advisory . The system
was about 320 miles south of Cape Hatteras,  North Carolina , and
was moving northeast at 8 mph, with maximum sustained winds near
50 mph.  A disturbance becomes tropical when it develops cyclonic
activity and becomes a named storm when sustained winds reach 39
mph. A storm reaches hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
