Japan ’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average
rose by the most this month on optimism U.S. lawmakers will
reach a deal to avoid a default on the government’s debt and
after  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s profit topped estimates, boosting the
earnings outlook for its suppliers.  Honda Motor Corp., which counts  North America  as its
largest market, climbed 1.3 percent.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , which makes
 machine tools  used to manufacture the iPhone, advanced 3.9
percent.  Teijin Ltd. (3401) , a maker of fibers used in products from
airplanes to bras, climbed 0.8 percent after the Nikkei
newspaper said first-quarter profit jumped 60 percent.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 percent to 10,005.90 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the most since June 29. The broader Topix index
gained 0.8 percent to 860.66, with nine stocks advancing for
every five that fell.  “The U.S. government looks like it’s moving forward to
solve the debt issue,” said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity
investment at Tokyo-based STB Asset Management Co. “That’s
taken a psychological weight off investors.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3
percent today as Apple’s profit topped estimates on record
iPhone and iPad sales. The index rose 1.6 percent yesterday as
President  Barack Obama  endorsed a deficit-reduction plan.  ‘Significant Step’  Obama embraced a $3.7 trillion debt-cutting plan by a
bipartisan group of senators that would combine tax increases
and spending cuts, saying it could end a congressional deadlock
over raising the U.S. borrowing limit. The news spurred optimism
lawmakers will reach an agreement that will help the nation
avoid default.  The plan is “a very significant step,” Obama said.  Honda climbed 1.3 percent to 3,185 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s largest carmaker, gained 0.6 percent to 3,325 yen.
 Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of solar panels which gets 17 percent of
its revenue in the U.S., advanced 2.1 percent to 8,300 yen.  Stocks also got a boost from a report that housing starts
in the U.S. rose more than forecast in June to the highest level
in five months. Work began on 629,000 houses, a 15 percent
increase from May, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The level of starts exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Building permits, a sign of
future construction, unexpectedly climbed 2.5 percent.  Apple Suppliers  Companies whose products are used to make Apple devices
rose after the California-based firm posted profit that beat
estimates. Fanuc jumped 3.9 percent to 14,460 yen.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,
a maker of memory chips used to store songs and photos in the
iPhone, advanced 2.7 percent to 413 yen.  Apple, the world’s biggest technology company by market
value, reported profit in the third-quarter increased to $7.79 a
share from a year earlier, exceeding the $5.87 predicted by
analysts on average. Sales climbed 82 percent to $28.6 billion.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest energy exploration company,
increased 1.9 percent to 600,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662) , the second-biggest oil driller, gained 1.2
percent to 3,945 yen.  Crude oil for August delivery climbed 1.6 percent to $97.50
a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the highest settlement since
July 13. Better-than-expected housing starts in the U.S. helped
boost confidence fuel demand will recover in the world’s biggest
oil-consuming country.  Carbon-fiber maker Teijin climbed 0.8 percent to 370 yen.
Net income jumped 60 percent to about 6.5 billion yen ($82
million) in the April-June period, compared with a year ago, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today, without saying where it got the
information. Demand increased for materials used in sporting
goods and auto parts, according to the report.  Among stocks that fell, Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co.,
a maker of chip equipment, declined 1.4 percent to 630 yen. The
company had its rating cut to “underweight” from “neutral”
at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Falling orders at  Tokyo  Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding N.V.,
other makers of gear used to make semiconductors, suggest
bookings for Dainippon’s wafer cleaning systems will also drop,
JPMorgan analyst Hisashi Moriyama said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
