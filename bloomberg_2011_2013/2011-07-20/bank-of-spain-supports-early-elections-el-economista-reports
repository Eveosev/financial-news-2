The Bank of  Spain  has advised the
government to hold general elections as early as October or
November rather than next March,  El Economista  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Bringing forward the vote would boost investor confidence
and ease credit flows, according to the regulator, the newspaper
reported. The government would also be able to take advantage of
jobless data in October that may be more favorable due to summer
hires, according to the report.  A spokesman for the Madrid-based central bank, contacted by
telephone, denied the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
