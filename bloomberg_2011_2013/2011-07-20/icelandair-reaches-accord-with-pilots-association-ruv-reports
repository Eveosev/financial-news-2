Icelandair Group hf reached an
agreement with the  Icelandic Air Line Pilots’ Association ,
averting further strikes, RUV reported, citing union Chairman
Hafsteinn Palsson.  Icelandair canceled about 20 flights in June after the
pilots’ union banned its members from working overtime. The
action had no impact on any flights in July, the Reykjavik-based
broadcaster quoted Icelandair spokesman Gudjon Arngrimsson as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
