Serbian units of  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and  Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) , which failed
European Union stress tests last week, remain well-capitalized
and stable, the newspaper  Blic  reported, citing central bank
Governor Dejan Soskic.  There is “no room for concern” about possible capital
flight from Serbia, Soskic told the Serbian newspaper. The only
risks Serbia faces as a result of the euro region’s sovereign-
debt crisis are a potential increase in risk premiums and
contraction of export markets, Blic cited Soskic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
