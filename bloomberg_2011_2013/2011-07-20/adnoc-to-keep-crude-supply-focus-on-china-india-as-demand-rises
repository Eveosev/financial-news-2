Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., the
state producer known as Adnoc, will remain focused on exporting
crude oil to  Asia  as demand from  China  and India increases, a
company official said.  Adnoc, based in the capital of the United Arab Emirates,
currently does not export crude to Europe or the U.S., Sultan A. Al Mehairi, marketing and refining director, said in an
interview in  Seoul  today.  “We are not diverting from our main market,” he said, “I
expect more demand to come from China and India.” Mehairi did
not provide details on the amount of crude the company expects
to ship to the world’s two fastest-growing major economies.  Adnoc signed a deal on July 13 with China National
Petroleum Corp., the country’s biggest oil producer, to provide
200,000 barrels of crude a day from 2014.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd.,  India ’s biggest
buyer of Iranian crude, is in talks with Saudi Arabian Oil Co.
and Adnoc to reduce the risk of a supply cut because of a
payment dispute with Iran, according to its annual report posted
on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
