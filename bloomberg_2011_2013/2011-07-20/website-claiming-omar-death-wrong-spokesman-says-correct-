(Corrects headline and first and second paragraphs to
reflect Taliban spokesmanâ€™s comment that the text message and
website posting were erroneous.)  A posting on a website claiming to
represent the Taliban that Mullah Omar, the leader and founder
of the group, had died was erroneous, Taliban spokesman
 Zabihullah Mujahid  said.  Mujahid also said that a text message purportedly coming
from him also saying that the leader had passed away was wrong,
and was the result of a hacking. The website had said Omar died
on July 15 of a heart illness.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
