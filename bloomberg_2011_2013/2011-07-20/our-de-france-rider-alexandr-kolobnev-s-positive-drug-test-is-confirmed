Cycling’s ruling body said a
positive drug test on Russian rider Alexandr Kolobnev was
confirmed by analysis of the “B” sample.  Kolobnev withdrew from the  Tour de France  on July 11 after
becoming the first cyclist to be accused of doping during this
year’s race. Kolobnev, who rode for the Katusha team, was found
with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in a urine sample taken
July 6.  Today, the  Union Cycliste Internationale , cycling’s ruling
body, said analysis of the “B” sample “confirmed the result
of the adverse analytical finding.”   “In accordance with the anti-doping rules, the UCI will 
request the Russian federation to open a disciplinary procedure
against the rider,” the UCI said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
