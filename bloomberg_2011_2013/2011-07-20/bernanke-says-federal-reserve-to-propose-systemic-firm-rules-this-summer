Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank will in the coming months propose
regulations on the oversight of systemically important financial
institutions.  “The Federal Reserve expects to issue proposed rules on
the oversight of SIFIs later this summer” and is “on
schedule” with other banking agencies to implement the Basel
III bank-capital requirements, Bernanke said in testimony
prepared for a Senate Banking Committee hearing tomorrow that
was posted on the Fed’s website.  The testimony is part of a hearing marking the one-year
anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act overhauling regulation to
prevent a repeat of 2008’s financial panic and ensuing
recession. Bernanke, who will appear with other bank-agency
chiefs, said the Fed is committed to making rules that “promote
the sound extension of credit in the service of economic growth
and development.”  “We must not lose sight of the reason that we began this
process: ensuring that events like those of 2008 and 2009 are
not repeated,” Bernanke said. “Our long-term economic health
requires that we do everything possible to achieve that goal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
