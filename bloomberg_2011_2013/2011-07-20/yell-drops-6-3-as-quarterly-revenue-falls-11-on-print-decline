(Corrects story published yesterday to remove incorrect
reference to yellowpages.com, which is not owned by Yell.)  Yell Group Plc (YELL) , the U.K. publisher
of Yellow Pages classified advertising, fell for a second day
after the company said quarterly revenue dropped 11.1 percent on
a decline in print and other directory sales.  Revenue slumped to 383.3 million pounds ($617.4 million) in
the quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, the Reading,
England-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today. Print and other directory sales fell 18.5
percent to 263.6 million pounds.  Shares dropped 13 percent to close at 6.48 pence at 4:30
p.m. in London, giving the company a market value of 153.4
million pounds. Yell has fallen 41 percent since it announced on
July 14 it won’t return to profit and revenue growth until 2015.  The company, which operates in the U.K., U.S.,  Spain  and
some Latin American countries, said last week it’s seeking to
change the revenue mix from 75 percent print and 25 percent
digital to 25 percent print and 75 percent digital by 2015.
Yell, which last week announced strategic partnerships with
Microsoft Corp and Bazaarvoice, a retail  software developer , and
bought Znode, a maker of e-commerce software, said earlier that
it will need four years to return to profit and revenue growth.  Rakesh Patel, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in London, said
today in a note that “significant ongoing revenue declines”
and increased online competition will cause earnings to continue
to decline. Debt refinancing is likely to become a “major
issue” in 2013, he said.  Patel, who has a “sell” rating on the stock, added in an
e-mail that he is “sceptical about the 2015 plan.”  Yell today said net debt dropped 58.3 million pounds since
year end 2010 to 2.7 billion pounds.  “Print trends were broadly unchanged and the weakness in
digital directories reported in Q4 has continued,” Chief
Executive Officer Mike Pocock said in the statement. Digital
sales continue to “grow strongly,” he said.  Revenue from digital directories fell 7.1 percent to 89.5
million pounds, while digital services revenue rose 165 percent
to 30.2 million pounds.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, for the quarter fell to 109.1 million
pounds, 20.2 million less than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
