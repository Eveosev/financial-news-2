Hong Kong  is the top location for
international businesses setting up overseas offices, according
to a study by property broker  CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG) , the
world’s biggest commercial real estate brokerage.  Some 68.2 percent of the global companies surveyed have
offices in the Chinese city, the highest among the 280 locations
included in the study, Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis said
in an e-mailed press release today.  The rapid growth of mainland  China , the city’s easy access
to other major Asian economies and a low tax regime “enabled
Hong Kong to act as a gateway between east and west,” CB
Richard Ellis said in today’s report.  The expansion of financial services companies in Hong Kong
is driving up rents in its Central business district, which has
the world’s highest office occupancy cost according to a
separate report by CB Richard Ellis. Prime office rents in the
district rose 8.5 percent from January to the end of May.  Singapore ranks second in the survey with 67.5 percent,
followed by  Tokyo ’s 63.9 percent. London and Shanghai take
fourth and fifth place respectively.  To contact the reporter for this story:
