Taiwan ’s dollar gained for a second
day after a government report showed export orders rose for a
21st month.  Orders for the island’s goods climbed 9.18 percent in June
from a year earlier, the government reported toward the end of
 currency trading  today. The  unemployment rate  fell to 4.40
percent, from 4.41 percent in May, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast before data due July 22. Yields on five-year
government notes climbed to the highest level since January 2009.  “Taiwan’s economic growth remains good,” said Eric Hsing,
a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“That’s supportive of the  Taiwan dollar .”  The Taiwan dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to NT$28.870
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It has strengthened 11.4 percent
over the past 12 months, the third-best performance among  Asia ’s
10 most-traded currencies.  Taiwan sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of five-year
securities at a yield of 1.18 percent on July 15, more than the
1.155 percent estimated by traders in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded government debt, rose one basis point to 1.195 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  “The market is still reacting to the worse-than-expected
bond sale,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Polaris Securities Co. “Buying appetite remains low, partly
due to expectations the central bank will continue to raise
 interest rates .”  Policy makers may increase borrowing costs another 12.5
basis points to 2 percent by year-end, according to the median
of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.376 percent from
0.375 percent yesterday, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
