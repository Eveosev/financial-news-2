SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as  Sallie Mae , reported earnings that exceeded estimates as it
increased loan originations and delinquencies declined.  A net loss of $6 million, or 2 cents per share, compares
with net income of $338 million, or 63 cents, in the year-
earlier period, the Newark, Delaware-based company said today in
a statement distributed by Business Wire. SLM’s core earnings
were 48 cents a share, the company said, compared with an
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of 42
cents.  Sallie Mae is overhauling its business after being knocked
out of government-guaranteed  student loans , which had been 80
percent of its business, when Congress passed legislation last
year prohibiting private companies from doing so.  The lender originated $264 million in private student debt
in the second quarter, up 21 percent from $219 million in the
same period of 2010, the company said. Late payments fell to 4.7
percent, compared with 5.8 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
