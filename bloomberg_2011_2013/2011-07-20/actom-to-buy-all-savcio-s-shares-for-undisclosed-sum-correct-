(Corrects spelling of Savcio in headline, first paragraph.)  Actom Ltd., a South African
electrical engineering company, agreed to buy the entire issued
share capital of Savcio Holdings Ltd., a rotating electrical
equipment and transformer maintenance and repair group, for an
undisclosed sum.  The transaction is still subject to regulatory approval and
once complete Savcio will comply with the obligations governing
its senior secured notes, Deutsche Bank said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
