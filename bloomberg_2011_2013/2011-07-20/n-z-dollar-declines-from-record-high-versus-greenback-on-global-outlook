The  New Zealand dollar  fell against
all of its major counterparts and dropped from a record against
the U.S. currency as the global outlook discouraged demand for
the South Pacific nation’s assets.  The kiwi slid as a technical indicator used by traders
indicated the currency may have risen too fast and was poised to
change direction.  Australia ’s dollar was little changed as
European leaders prepared to discuss the sovereign-debt crisis
tomorrow and U.S. politicians tried to break a deadlock over
budget deficits before an Aug. 2 deadline.  With “these currencies, while they might benefit from
periods of heightened risk appetite, there’s still going to be
some resistance to pushing them much higher given those
uncertainties,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in
 Washington  at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency
brokerage.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 85.59 U.S. cents at 1:57
p.m. in  New York , compared with 85.58 cents yesterday, when it
reached a record high 85.73 cents. The kiwi fell 0.5 percent to
67.40 yen. Australia’s currency was little changed at $1.0742.
The Aussie fell 0.5 percent to 84.60 yen.  The kiwi’s 14-day stochastic oscillator against the
greenback climbed to 96 today, above the 80 threshold that
indicates to some traders an asset’s price has risen too quickly
and is poised to reverse course.  To contact the reporters on this story:
