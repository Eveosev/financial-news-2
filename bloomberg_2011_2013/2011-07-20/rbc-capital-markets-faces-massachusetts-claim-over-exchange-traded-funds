RBC Capital Markets , the securities
unit of  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , inadequately supervised sales of
leveraged and inverse-leveraged exchange-traded funds to
clients, Massachusetts’s chief financial regulator said.  The firm made the funds available without training
employees or ensuring they understood the products’ function and
risks from at least January 2007, the state’s secretary of the
commonwealth, William Galvin, said today in a statement,
announcing an administrative complaint against the company and a
former broker.  “The dishonesty here is that the investors, and indeed the
agent soliciting their investment, did not understand the
workings of these funds,” Galvin wrote. “The firm failed in
its responsibility to train and supervise its agent, and this
failure led to investor harm.”  The state is seeking restitution for  Massachusetts 
investors and a fine, Galvin said.Katherine Gay, a spokeswoman
for Royal Bank, said she couldn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
