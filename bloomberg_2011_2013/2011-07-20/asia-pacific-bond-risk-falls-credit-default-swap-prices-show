The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 4 basis points to
122.5 basis points as of 9:55 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. Thatâ€™s on course for the biggest fall since
July 1, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in privately negotiated
markets.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 0.5 basis point to 122 basis
points as of 8:54 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole CIB prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 1 basis point to
123.5 as of 9:46 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
