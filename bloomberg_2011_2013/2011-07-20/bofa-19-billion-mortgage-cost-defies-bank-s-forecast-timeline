Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  has disclosed
more than $19 billion in costs on mortgage-buyback demands in
the nine months since the company projected expenses of $500
million a quarter.  Below is a timeline of how the company assessed the
severity of the housing market slump, its ability to fight
requests that the lender buy back faulty mortgages and how this
affected prospects of a dividend increase.  July 1, 2008: The bank buys Countrywide Financial Corp., the
largest subprime home lender, for $2.5 billion.  July 21, 2008: “We see sluggishness but not a recession,”
then-Chief Executive Officer Kenneth D. Lewis says. “We see
housing price depreciation being mostly over this year, maybe
going into next year.”  Sept. 30, 2008: MBIA Inc. files suit against Countrywide, saying
the lender is responsible for improper underwriting.  Oct. 6, 2008: The bank halves its quarterly dividend to 32 cents
a share, taking “one step backwards in order to take two steps
forward,” Lewis says.  Jan. 16, 2009: The bank cuts its dividend to a penny a share.  Sept. 30, 2009: The bank faces $7.5 billion of outstanding
claims from investors and insurers who said they were duped on
mortgage deals by misrepresentations such as inflated borrowers’
income or overstated property values. The firms are demanding
the bank buy back the loans.  Jan. 1, 2010:  Brian T. Moynihan  is promoted to CEO.  Feb. 26, 2010: Bank of America says the cost of resolving the
mortgage disputes rose to $1.9 billion in 2009 from $246 million
in 2008 on “deterioration in the economy and housing markets
combined with a higher rate of repurchase or similar requests.”  Oct. 8, 2010: The bank temporarily extends its freeze on
foreclosures to all 50 states as concern spreads among
regulators that homes are being seized based on false data.  Oct. 18, 2010: A bondholder group including Pacific Investment
Management Co. and BlackRock Inc. sends a  letter  demanding the
bank buy back mortgages packaged into $47 billion of bonds.  Oct. 19, 2010: The bank announces an  $872 million  third-quarter
provision to resolve claims. That compares with $455 million a
year earlier, $516 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, $526
million in the first quarter of 2010 and $1.25 billion in the
second. “It’s a half billion, half billion, half billion,”
Moynihan says. “Those are the kinds of numbers that would be
more recurring.”  Nov. 16, 2010: Moynihan says the bank is waging “hand-to-hand
combat” over investor demands that the firm buy back mortgages.  Dec. 7, 2010: Moynihan says Bank of America will increase its
dividend as fast as possible. “I don’t see anything that would
stop us” from raising the payment in 2011, he says.  Dec. 22, 2010: MBIA wins a judge’s permission to use statistical
sampling to pursue repurchase demands against the bank, freeing
the insurer from the need to assess mortgages individually, as
Moynihan had sought.  Jan. 3, 2011: The bank says it will take a $3 billion provision
to settle claims from government-sponsored enterprises Fannie
Mae and  Freddie Mac .  Jan. 21, 2011: “We are pleased to put the GSEs behind us this
quarter,” Moynihan says.  Then-Chief Financial Officer  Charles Noski  projects an
 “upper range”  of $7 billion to $10 billion in losses on
outstanding demands from private investors. The loss could be as
low as “zero,” he says.  Feb. 28, 2011: The group with Pimco and BlackRock says it is
fighting the bank over $84 billion in mortgage bonds after more
investors joined. The bank “has a number of questions about the
validity of the assertions, including whether the investors are
qualified to bring claims,” says spokesman  Jerry Dubrowski .  March 8, 2011: Bank of America “can generate significant excess
capital and return it to shareholders,” according to a
presentation at the company’s first investor day since 2007.  March 23, 2011: Bank of America says the  Federal Reserve 
objected to its request to raise its dividend.  April 13, 2011: The bank is among mortgage servicers that must
pay back homeowners for losses from foreclosures on loans that
were mishandled, regulators say.  April 15, 2011: The bank says it had a $1 billion first-quarter
provision, with more than half tied to Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac as the company’s Home Price Index declined. Moynihan
announces a $1.6 billion deal with Assured Guaranty Ltd. to
resolve claims tied to mortgage-backed securities covered by the
insurer. Outstanding buyback demands climb to  $13.6 billion .  May 5, 2011: The cost of private-investor demands may be $11
billion to $14 billion, or $4 billion more than the previous
range, if the bank made incorrect assumptions about bondholders’
prospects for making claims, according to a company filing.  Foreclosure delays cost the bank $874 million in the first
quarter as the company missed deadlines from  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac, the lender says. The cost climbed from $230 million
in the last three months of 2010.  May 24, 2011: Moynihan says, “we still have some work to do”
on buyback claims from Fannie Mae.  June 29, 2011: The bank says it agreed to pay $8.5 billion to
resolve claims from the Pimco, BlackRock group on $424 billion
of bonds and set aside $5.5 billion more for other demands.
Losses beyond that may be as much as $5 billion, the bank says.
Adjustments on cost estimates are partly the result of
fluctuations in  home prices , CFO  Bruce Thompson  says.  “The cost expense and the uncertainty are all taken off
the table for half of the private-label claims,” Moynihan says.
Settling is better for the bank because it avoids the “possible
outcome of being much more adverse to the company if we kept
fighting.”  The CEO says the deal accelerates payments that would
otherwise be made over several years. “It’s really pulling
forward stuff that would have occurred not only in ‘11, ‘12, but
also ‘13 and ‘14,” he says.  July 19, 2011: Bank of America posts a second-quarter loss of
$8.83 billion, the company’s worst ever. The company says
outstanding mortgage claims are $11.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
