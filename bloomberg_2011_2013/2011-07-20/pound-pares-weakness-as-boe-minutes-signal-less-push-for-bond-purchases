The British pound pared its decline
versus the euro and erased its drop versus the dollar as minutes
from the  Bank of England  suggested fewer policy makers are
considering calling for bond purchases.  Sterling was 0.3 percent weaker at 88.05 pence per euro as
of 10:07 a.m. in  London  after sliding as much as 0.6 percent
before the minutes were released. The pound was little changed
at $1.6114 after falling as much as 0.3 percent.  Bank of England officials voted 7-2 to keep the benchmark
interest rate on hold this month as a majority of policy makers
said recent developments meant there was less need for a near-
term tightening. There was a “range of views” among the majority
of the MPC on the outlook for inflation, the minutes said.  In contrast to the June meeting, there was no mention of
other policy makers favoring more bond purchases this month. In
June, some officials said it was “possible” further asset
purchases might become warranted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
