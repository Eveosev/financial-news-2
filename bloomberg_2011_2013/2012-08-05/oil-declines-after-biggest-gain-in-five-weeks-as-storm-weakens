Oil slid from the highest close in
two weeks in  New York  amid speculation that its biggest gain in
more than a month was excessive. Tropical Storm Ernesto slowed
as it headed westward in the Caribbean.  Futures slipped as much as 0.8 percent after closing 4.9
percent higher on Aug. 3, the most since June 29. Prices
finished last week with a gain of 1.4 percent after U.S.
payrolls rose more than estimated and service industries
expanded at a faster pace. Ernesto, located about 180 miles east
of the Nicaragua and Honduras border, had winds of about 50
miles per hour, down from 60 mph on Aug. 4, according to the
U.S. National Hurricane Center.  “This is a small correction after the massive move last
Friday,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity market research
at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Brent near $110 is a bit
excessive.”  Oil for September delivery slid as much as 77 cents to
$90.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $91.14 at 12:58 p.m. London time. It surged
$4.27 to $91.40 on Aug. 3, the highest settlement since July 20.
Prices are 7.8 percent lower this year.  Brent crude  for September settlement fell 50 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $108.44 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate was at $17.30, compared with $17.54 on Aug. 3.  Technical Resistance  WTI is retreating after reaching technical resistance
around $91.85 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
the higher of two so-called leading span lines that define an
“ichimoku cloud,” an area where buy orders tend to be
clustered. Futures halted their gain near this line on Aug. 3.  Oil futures rose on Aug. 3 after Labor Department data
showed payrolls gained 163,000 in July compared with a forecast
for a 100,000 increase by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing index
unexpectedly climbed.  Ernesto was moving west at 12 mph, the Miami-based center
said in a web advisory at 5 a.m. local time today, down from 15
mph earlier.  A  hurricane watch  is in place for the Yucatan Peninsula on
the east coast of  Mexico . The  Gulf of Mexico  to the north is
home to 29 percent of U.S. oil production, 6.5 percent of the
country’s natural-gas output and 40 percent of its refining
capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Department.  “The previous peak of around $93 for West Texas looms as a
bit of a psychological resistance level for the market,” said
Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
The weakening of tropical storm Ernesto “takes away a potential
supply disruption,” he said.  Bullish Bets  Hedge funds  and other money managers raised bullish bets on
Brent crude to the highest level in more than two months,
according to ICE data.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 86,065
contracts in the week ended July 31, the London-based exchange
said today in its weekly Commitment of Traders report. That’s an
increase of 8,555 lots. Net longs were at 91,208 on May 22, the
data show.  South Sudanese officials will meet their Sudanese
counterparts “soon” to conclude an oil deal and continue talks
on security issues, said  Pagan Amum , the south’s chief
negotiator.  South Sudan , which halted oil production in January
amid a dispute with  Sudan  over transit fees, is able to resume
production by September, he said in a statement published on the
government’s website.  At independence, South Sudan assumed 75 percent of the
previous country’s 490,000 barrels a day in oil production.  To contact the reporters on this story:
