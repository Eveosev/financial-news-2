Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  has become
the subject of takeover considerations, with banks in London
studying the prospect of financing a bid, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Institutions including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) â€™s Merrill
Lynch unit have assessed whether they could offer debt financing
for an approach for the retailer, the newspaper said. An
unidentified private-equity company is weighing a takeover of
the company, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with
the considerations.  A spokeswoman for Marks & Spencer declined to comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
