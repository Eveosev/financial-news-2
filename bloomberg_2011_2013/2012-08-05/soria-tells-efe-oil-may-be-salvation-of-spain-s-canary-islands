Jose Manuel Soria, Spanish Minister
for Industry, Energy and Tourism, said finding oil could be the
“salvation” of the Canary Islands economy where unemployment
is at 31 percent,  Efe reported .  Repsol SA is drilling for oil about 60 kilometers (37
miles) off the coast of the Spanish archipelago amid protests
from locals and environmentalists who say the work poses a
threat to the islands’ beaches.  Finding oil would be an “extraordinary opportunity
fundamentally for young workers,” Soria told Efe. “There are a
lot of engineers in the Canaries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
