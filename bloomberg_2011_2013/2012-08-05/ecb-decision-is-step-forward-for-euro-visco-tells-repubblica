The outcome of the Aug. 2 European
Central Bank meeting is “an important step forward for the
common currency and for spreads,”  Bank of Italy  Governor
Ignazio Visco told daily la Repubblica in an interview published
today.  Deciding that the ECB “can and must intervene” to remove
obstacles to the monetary union if there are risks for the euro
is a “turning point,” Visco said.  There wasn’t “division” between policy makers at the
meeting, just “discussion”, Visco said, adding that Bundesbank
President Jens Weidmann expressed “well-known perplexities”
regarding direct bond buying in the secondary market.  Asked why the ECB didn’t cut  interest rates  at the meeting,
Visco said that if the economy continues to slow down “we can
expect a more accomodating monetary policy in the next few
months”.  “For the moment Italy doesn’t need to tap” the temporary
European rescue fund, the Bank of  Italy  governor told the
newspaper. “Monti is on the right track, but now he needs to
speed up reforms,” he said. The economic emergency is not over,
Visco told the daily, adding that 2013 will be “a year of
recession” for the world economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
