Spain ’s Economy Minister Luis de
Guindos said the country won’t introduce more spending cuts or
tax increases because it’s on target to meet its budget  deficit
reduction  goals,  ABC newspaper  reported.  “There are no new measures because we believe that those
we have approved will be sufficient to deliver the pace of
deficit reduction we have committed to with Brussels,” De
Guindos told the newspaper in an interview.  De Guindos also said Spain will wait until the details of
the  European Central Bank ’s bond-buying proposal have been set
out before deciding whether to request aid, ABC said.  “We have time and we can wait until all the details become
clear,” ABC cited him as saying.  The economy minister added that Spain will on Aug. 24
approve the decree governing the so-called bad bank to manage
troubled financial assets, a condition of the bank bailout, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
