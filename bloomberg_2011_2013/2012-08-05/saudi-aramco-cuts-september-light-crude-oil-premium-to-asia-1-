Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, cut the premium used in determining
official selling prices for its Light, Medium and Heavy grades
to customers in  Asia  for September shipments while raising the
premium for Light crude to customers in the U.S.  Saudi Aramco , as the producer is known, raised the
differentials used to determine the prices for all grades for
sale to Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean region in
September, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Aramco set the premium for its Light crude for September
loadings for U.S. buyers at 45 cents a barrel more than the
 Argus Sour Crude Index , 10 cents more than the differential for
August cargoes. It cut the premium for  Light crude to Asia  by 80
cents a barrel to $1.25 more than the average of Oman and Dubai
grades, benchmarks for Persian Gulf crudes.  Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most of their
crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of the
region’s state oil companies price their oil at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  The following table gives differentials for the regions
into which Aramco sells in relation to benchmark prices, the
month-on-month change and the degrees of gravity as defined by
the  American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S. dollars a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
