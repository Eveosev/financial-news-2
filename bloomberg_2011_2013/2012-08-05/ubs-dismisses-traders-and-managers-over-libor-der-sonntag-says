UBS AG (UBSN)  has dismissed about two dozen
traders and managers in connection with an investigation of
manipulation of the London interbank offered rates, Der Sonntag
reported.  The Swiss bank terminated the traders for possible
involvement in a fraudulent ring across several banks and the
managers for not exercising controls or for boycotting an
internal investigation, the  newspaper  reported today, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the proceedings. Dominique
Gerster, a spokesman at UBS, declined to comment on the report.  UBS is among firms including Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Deutsche Bank AG being investigated
worldwide for practices in setting Libor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
