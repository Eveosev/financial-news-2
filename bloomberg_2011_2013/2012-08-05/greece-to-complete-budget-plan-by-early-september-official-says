The package of budget cuts  Greece  has
to make to qualify for international rescue funds and keep it in
the euro area will be completed by early September, a Greek
finance ministry official said today.  Talks between representatives of Greece’s
international creditors, the so-called troika, and the
government agreed on a “good proportion” of measures, said the
official, who declined to be identified because the talks are
ongoing.  Work will continue on the package this week, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
