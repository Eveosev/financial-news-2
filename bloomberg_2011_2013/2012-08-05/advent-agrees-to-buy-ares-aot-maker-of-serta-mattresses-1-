Advent International Corp., the
Boston-based leveraged buyout firm founded by Peter Brooke,
agreed to buy a majority stake in AOT Bedding Super Holdings,
the maker of Serta and Simmons mattresses.  The transaction values the mattress company at about $3
billion including debt, said a person with knowledge of the
matter. The purchase is expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter, Advent said in a statement sent by e-mail that didn’t
disclose terms.  Existing investors Ares Management LLC, based in  Los
Angeles , and the  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  will retain a
“significant” stake in AOT Bedding, the private equity firm
said in an e-mailed statement. Chuck Dohrenwend, a spokesman for
Advent International, declined to specify the size of its stake
or comment beyond the press release.  Competitors include Tempur-Pedic International Inc., a
pioneer of memory-foam mattresses that last year became the
biggest publicly traded mattress company by revenue as sales
rose 28 percent to $1.42 billion.  Sealy Corp. (ZZ) , a 131-year-old
company and user of coil-spring technology, fell to No. 2 with
sales of $1.23 billion, little changed from 2010.  Serta, in a June 11 statement on its website, said it had
become the “No. 1 mattress company in the U.S.” for the first
time after an 18 percent sales increase in 2011, without
specifying whether that was based on volume or dollar sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
