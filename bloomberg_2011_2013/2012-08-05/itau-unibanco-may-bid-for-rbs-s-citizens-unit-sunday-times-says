Brazilian bank  Itau Unibanco Holding
SA (ITUB4)  is planning a bid for  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s
U.S.-based Citizens unit, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Itau Unibanco hasn’t yet made an approach to RBS, the
newspaper said. It’s also interested in a potential bid for
 Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s Sovereign Bancorp Inc. and  Societe Generale
SA (GLE) ’s Bank West as it seeks to expand in the U.S., according to
the Sunday Times.  Canada’s  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s
Merrill Lynch unit and JPMorgan Chase & Co. may also be
interested in Citizens, the newspaper said.  A spokesman for RBS declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News today.  RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  said August 3
that the bank will retain Citizens Financial Group Inc., the
U.S. consumer and commercial lender RBS bought in 1988, because
it’s a “core” part of the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
