Repsol SA (REP)  will meet with Venezuelan
officials Aug. 9 to discuss the Spanish oil company’s dispute
over Argentina’s seizure of its majority stake in  YPF SA (YPFD) ,
newspaper Pagina 12  said today , citing Venezuela’s Oil Minister
 Rafael Ramirez .  Venezuelan authorities, who last month promised to invest
in Argentina to boost oil production, are calling for a friendly
solution to Repsol’s conflict with the Argentine government and
view the company’s threats to take legal action as a colonialist
attitude, the paper quoted Ramirez as saying. Repsol has stakes
in oil and gas fields in Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
