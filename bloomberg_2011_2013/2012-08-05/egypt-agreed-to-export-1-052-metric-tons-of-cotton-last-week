Egypt  agreed last week to export
1,052 metric tons of cotton in the week through August 2, the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association said.  The country has shipped 85,267 tons of the fiber, valued at
$265 million, since the marketing year began on Sept. 1, the
association said today in a weekly bulletin. Of last week’s
agreed sales, 275 tons were of the Giza 88 variety and 777 tons
were of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
