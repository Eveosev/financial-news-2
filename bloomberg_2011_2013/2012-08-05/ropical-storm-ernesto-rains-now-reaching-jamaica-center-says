Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth
named storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season , may slowly
strengthen again during the next 48 hours, the U.S.  National
Hurricane Center  said.  The weather system has weakened with maximum sustained
winds of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour and is moving west
at 22 mph, the Miami-based center said in its latest advisory.
The storm is about 240 miles southeast of Kingston,  Jamaica , the
center said.  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Jamaica later
today, and are possible along the coast of Honduras tomorrow,
according to the center.  A separate system, Tropical Storm Florence, which recorded
maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, has stopped strengthening for
now, the NHC said. Florence is 680 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
