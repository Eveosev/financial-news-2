German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere said he’s against foreign military intervention in
 Syria  to stop violations of human rights in the country, the
 Welt am Sonntag  newspaper reported today.  To stop the killing in Syria, a no-fly zone would not be
enough and the deployment of tens of thousands of ground troops
may be required, the newspaper cited de Maiziere as saying in an
interview. At the moment that’s neither “doable nor
justifiable,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
