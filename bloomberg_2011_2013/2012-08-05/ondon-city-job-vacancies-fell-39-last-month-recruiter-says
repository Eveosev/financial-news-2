Job vacancies at London financial-
services companies fell by more than a third in July from the
same month last year as  Europe ’s debt crisis continues to
undermine confidence in financial markets, recruitment firm
 Astbury Marsden  said.  New vacancies in the British capital’s City and Canary
Wharf financial districts dipped 39 percent to 2,985 in July
from 4,880 a year ago, the London-based recruiter said in a
statement today.  “The appetite to hire in the City remains pretty thin,”
said  Mark Cameron , chief operating officer at Astbury Marsden in
London “Banks are hiring new staff, although this is more often
than not to replace departing staff, as opposed to reacting to
anticipated growth in investment banking revenue.”  Securities firms have been shedding staff to reduce costs
as the debt crisis curbs trading and leads to a slump in stock
and bond offerings.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said last month it will cut
about 1,900 jobs by the end of 2012, including 1,500 positions
in its investment bank and related infrastructure areas, mostly
outside  Germany .  Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , the London-based inter-
dealer broker, said it has eliminated about 140 jobs in the
first half of 2012.  “With the uncertainty generated by the ongoing rumblings
from the Spanish banking sector and the seemingly ever-present
Eurozone problems, we’re not expecting things to improve
dramatically this year,” said Cameron.  Still, the number of jobs available in July 2012 rose 3
percent from a month ago, Astbury Marsden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
