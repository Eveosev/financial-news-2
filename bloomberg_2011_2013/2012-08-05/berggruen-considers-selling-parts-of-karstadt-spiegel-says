Nicolas Berggruen is considering
selling parts of the Karstadt department-store chain,  Spiegel 
magazine reported, without saying where it got the information.  One of Berggruen’s spokesmen rejected any intention to
sell, Spiegel said in an advance copy of an article in its print
edition, without naming the person.  Jared Bluestein, head of Karstadt’s supervisory board, is
in negotiations with Qatar Holding LLC and  George Weston Ltd. (WN) 
about a possible sale of Karstadt’s so-called premium stores,
Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
