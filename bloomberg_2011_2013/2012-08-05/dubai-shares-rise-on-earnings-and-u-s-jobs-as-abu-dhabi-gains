Dubai stocks rose to the highest
level since May after companies in the United Arab Emirates

were traded in Dubai, compared with the 12-month daily average
of 140 million shares.  “Investors are encouraged by the earnings reported by real
estate developers and banks,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at
Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “Also, the positive
momentum in international equity markets is helping boost
confidence.”  Dubai, the second-largest of seven emirates that make up
the U.A.E., relies on trade, tourism and property for growth.

Industrial Average the longest rally since October, after a
