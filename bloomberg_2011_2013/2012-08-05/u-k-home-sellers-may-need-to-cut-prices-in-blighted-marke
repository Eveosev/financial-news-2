U.K. home sellers may need to lower
their prices to lure buyers in a market restrained by waning
 consumer confidence  and tight lending conditions, according to a
survey by  Rightmove Plc. (RMV)   Forty-nine percent of potential buyers said prices in their
area are above a “fair and reasonable” level, Rightmove, the
operator of the U.K.’s biggest property website, said in a
report today. Only 36 percent of sellers have that view.  There is a “significant price gap” between the two
groups, said  Miles Shipside , commercial director of Rightmove.
“Sellers need to address this valuation mismatch in order to be
successful, at a time when the U.K. housing market continues to
be blighted by low transaction levels.”  Concerns about the euro-area crisis and a deepening
recession in the U.K. have damped demand for homes, with
 mortgage approvals  dropping to an 18-month low in June. The
government and the Bank of  England  started their Funding for
Lending program last week, which is aimed at boosting credit to
households and companies and spurring economic growth.  The Bank of England, which kept its  bond-purchase target  at
375 billion pounds ($585 billion) last week, will publish new
quarterly forecasts on Aug. 8. All 16 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey say the central bank will lower its 2012 economic
outlook, while all but one see a reduction in the 2013
projections. A majority of economists also forecast a cut to the
central bank’s 2012 and 2013 inflation projections.  In May, the  Bank of England  forecast average annual growth
of about 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2.3
percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. It predicted inflation at
2.9 percent and 1.7 percent.  Employment Outlook  Lloyds Bank said that an index of  job prospects  based on a
survey of 2,006 consumers rose to minus 51 in July from minus 53
in June. A measure of  job security  fell to minus 19, the lowest
in four months, from minus 14.  Separately today, the  Confederation of British Industry 
said a gauge of confidence at small- and medium-sized companies
fell to minus 13 in July from 22 in April due to “challenging
domestic conditions” and euro-area “uncertainty.”  The CBI also said a measure of output at SMEs fell to minus
5 in July from 1 in April. An expectations gauge for the next
three months was at 2, indicating “broadly flat” output. The
group surveyed 359 manufacturers between June 25 and July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
