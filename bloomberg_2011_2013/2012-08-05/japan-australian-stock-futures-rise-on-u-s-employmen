Japanese and Australian stock futures
rose after better-than-forecast jobs data in the U.S. eased
investor concern that growth is slowing in the world’s largest
economy.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese
machinery maker that gets a quarter of its sales in the
Americas, advanced 1.6 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest miner, may be active after metal prices advanced. ADRs
of Toyota Motor Corp. climbed 3.8 percent after Asia’s biggest
carmaker reported first-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates.  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) , Asia’s No. 1 listed carrier
by sales, may move after reporting profit increased.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,675 in Chicago Aug. 3, up from 8,540 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,680 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 1.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “The outlook that is priced into equities is overly
pessimistic,” said  Michael Kurtz , Hong Kong-based global chief
equity strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest
brokerage. “We maintain a bullish view on global equities.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. The S&P 500 surged 1.9 percent on Aug. 3 after a Labor
Department report showed American payrolls climbed more than
forecast even as the jobless rate unexpectedly rose.  Europe Debt  The rally in stocks gained strength as members of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition parties signaled they won’t
stand in the way of European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi ’s bond plan to relieve the region’s debt crisis.  Draghi has signaled the ECB intends to join forces with
governments to buy bonds, while conceding that Germany’s
Bundesbank had reservations about the plan.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  gained 7.3 percent from this year’s
lowest level in June through Aug. 3 amid speculation central
banks from the U.S. to China and Europe would step up efforts to
stimulate economic growth. The gauge climbed 2.8 percent this
year.  The regional benchmark traded at 12 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 11.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
climbed 2.1 percent Aug. 3. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum
gained 1.6 percent.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. rose 2 percent to 87.40 in  New
York  on Aug 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
