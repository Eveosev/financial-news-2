National Express  Group Plc Chief
Executive Officer Dean Finch has received more than one approach
to leave the transport company, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the  information .  FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  is believed to have made an offer and a
private equity company has made another, the newspaper reported.  FirstGroup said it hasn’t approached Finch and that it’s
“fully supportive” of CEO Tim O’Toole, the newspaper reported,
without identifying a person at the company.  A spokesman for National Express declined to comment when
reached by phone today, while FirstGroup didn’t respond to a
phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
