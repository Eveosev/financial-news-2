One51, a Dublin-based investment
company, has withdrawn the sale of its plastics business that
was expected to raise about 50 million euros ($62 million), the
 Sunday Business Post  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The company decided to pull the sale because of the price
and conditionality of the deal, the Dublin-based newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
