North Korea  said 400 people were
missing and about 212,000 were left homeless following heavy
rains and floods that lasted through July.  The floods killed 169 people and injured 144, while
destroying more than 8,600 houses and submerging 43,770
residential buildings, the official Korean Central News Agency
said yesterday. At least 65,280 hectares of farmland was
damaged, KCNA said.  Inundation of coal mines north of Pyongyang threatens to
hurt the isolated communist country that relies on exports of
underground minerals as one of few legitimate ways to earn
foreign currencies. North Korea, now under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has been grappling with decades of food shortages and
economic mismanagement, while its nuclear weapons and missile
programs have cut international support.  North Korean Premier Choe Yong Rim toured Anju, where
almost all public buildings and industrial facilities were
flooded or destroyed, with water and power supplies cut off,
KNCA said in a separate report. Choe was briefed on the damages
in the city and held a meeting, the agency said.  United Nations staff members based in North Korea made
visits on July 31 with the  Red Cross  and other non-governmental
organizations to two storm-struck counties to investigate and
assess damage and needs, Christopher de Bono, Unicef’s chief of
communications for  East Asia  and the Pacific, wrote in an e-mail
last week.  UN Visit  The visits were made at the request of the North Korean
government, according to a July 30  statement  on the website of
the UN’s North Korea office. The UN expanded sanctions against
the North after it conducted a long-range missile test on April
13.  The test also cost Kim a deal with the U.S. for 240,000
metric tons of food promised in exchange for a moratorium on
nuclear and missile tests.  North Korea’s rainy season began on July 18 as Typhoon
Khanun struck the Korean peninsula, hitting northwestern coastal
areas the hardest. The monsoon season set in after the country’s
worst drought in a century threatened wheat, barley and potato
harvests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
