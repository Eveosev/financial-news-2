Two  suicide bombers  suspected of
being members of the Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram
were killed today after setting off an explosion in the 
northeastern town of Damaturu, police said.  “The incident occurred this morning when some military
personnel on routine patrol suspected a particular vehicle to be
carrying some dangerous weapons,” Patrick Egbuniwe, a police
chief in Damaturu said by phone. “They tried to stop the
vehicle before the occupants who are suspected Boko Haram
members ignited an explosive which killed two of the suspects.”  Egbuniwe said he couldn’t confirm the number of military
casualties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
