Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  climbed
the most in a week as Wunderlich Securities Inc. said  Israel ’s
technology companies will extend gains as prospects of higher
spending in the industry outweigh global slowdown concerns.  Mellanox, the maker of technology used to transfer and
store data, rose 4.3 percent, the most since July 30, to 430.8
shekels at the close in Tel Aviv. The shares have more than
tripled this year.  Nice Systems Ltd. (NICE) , the maker of
telecommunications software, gained 5.6 percent, the most since
September. Israel’s TA-25 Index advanced 0.5 percent.  Worldwide spending on information technology products will
surpass $2 trillion for the first time this year, according to
data by research firm IDC. Companies are boosting IT spending to
improve performance while reducing costs, a trend that will
benefit Israeli developers, according to Wunderlich. Growing
concern about a global economic slowdown and a deterioration in
Europe’s debt crisis erased $601 billion from global markets in
the past month.  “The increase in IT spending is fueled by the simple fact
that it has a return on investment, which warrants its growth,”
Brian Freed, an analyst at Wunderlich, said by phone on Aug. 3
from Denver. “To an extent, a rising tide lifts all ships but
some companies like Mellanox and  Check Point  are well positioned
for outsized growth.”  Payroll Boost  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) , the world’s second-
largest security networks marker, gained 2.5 percent on Aug. 3.
The shares don’t trade in  Tel Aviv .  The  Bloomberg Israel-U.S. Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the biggest
Israeli companies traded in  New York  rose 1.8 percent, the most
in a week, on Aug. 3. Global equity assets rallied as a report
on payroll gains in the U.S. surpassed economists’ estimates.
The payrolls increase of 163,000 followed a revised 64,000 gain
in June, U.S. Labor Department figures showed in  Washington  last
week. The median estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a gain of 100,000.  Global spending on technology, from purchases of personal
computers to companies adopting advanced technology for high-
performance computing, will increase 6.5 percent this year, IDC
said in its mid-year report last week. That compares with 6.4
percent growth in the industry in 2011, data show.  Mellanox shares in Israel closed at the equivalent of
$108.45. The company’s U.S. stock rose to $106.92 last week, the
 highest  close on record. Barclays Plc increased its target price
on Mellanox for the second time within a month to $140 from
$105.  When the CEO began “mentioning $1 billion in revenues we
think investors were skeptical,”  Joseph Wolf , an analyst at
Barclays Plc in Tel Aviv, wrote in an Aug. 2 report. “With 2012
expected revenues of $530 million and 2013 expected of $666
million -- which we believe could be conservative -- we see a $1
billion revenue run rate by mid-2014.”  Nice Systems climbed to 126.5, or $31.85, in Tel Aviv
today. The New York shares on Aug. 3 closed at a  premium  of
$1.59 to the Tel Aviv shares, the biggest in almost five months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
