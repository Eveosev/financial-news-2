England drew the second cricket Test
match with South Africa, which retains a 1-0 lead in the three-
game series as it tries to replace its rival at the top of the
world rankings.  Both sides had an outside chance of winning when South
Africa declared at 258-9 after tea on the final day at
Headingley, Leeds.  Stuart Broad  took five wickets and batsman
 Kevin Pietersen  added three. That left England an unlikely
victory target of 253.  After re-jigging the batting order, the hosts lost the
wickets of opener Pietersen, for 12, captain Andrew Strauss, 22,
and  Alastair Cook , 46, to leave them on 90-3. Matt Prior was
moved up the order but was run out for 7, leaving England
focusing on not losing rather than winning.  Jonathan Trott, on 30, and Ian Bell, with 3 off 34 balls,
saw the hosts to safety, ending on 130-4 just after 7:30 p.m.  The visitors had resumed on 39-0 in their second innings
this morning after rain restricted play yesterday. The only
dismissal in the first session was Jacques Rudolph, leg-before-
wicket to Pietersen for 69.  Pietersen struck twice again after lunch, having both
captain  Graeme Smith  (52 runs) and Hashim Amla (28) caught out.
AB de Villiers, on 44, and JP Duminy then went in consecutive
balls to Broad, before Vernon Philander (6) and  Jacques Kallis 
(27) went to the same bowler. Smith declared after the quick
exits of  Dale Steyn  and Morne Morkel.  Pietersen’s Wickets  Man of the match Pietersen, who scored 149 in the first
innings, finished on 3-52, with Broad 5-69.  England was dismissed yesterday for 425, Pietersen failing
to add to his overnight score. Prior made 68 to help his team
post 425, a six-run lead. Alviro Petersen scored 182 in the
visitors’ first-innings 419.  South Africa won the first match at the Oval in London by
an innings and 12 runs. It could leapfrog No. 1 England in the
 International Cricket Council ’s Test rankings by winning the
series. The final Test starts Aug. 16 at Lord’s in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
