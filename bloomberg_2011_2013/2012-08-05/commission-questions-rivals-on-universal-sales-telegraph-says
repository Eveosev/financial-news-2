The European Commission has written
to  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music Group’s rivals questioning
whether they’re satisfied with proposed disposals, the Sunday
Telegraph said, without saying where it got the information.  Universal is seeking to soothe antitrust concerns over its
$1.2 billion ($1.9 billion) takeover of EMI Group’s recorded-
music business by selling assets. The commission sent a
questionnaire to competing music companies, record agencies and
record management companies, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
