Felix Hernandez  struck out six
batters in nine innings for his 10th victory as the Seattle
Mariners defeated the  New York  Yankees 1-0 to even their three-
game series at one game each.  Hernandez (10-5) allowed two hits in 101 pitches, which
included 69 strikes.  “That was just special stuff today,” Mariners manager
Eric Wedge told reporters after last night’s game. “I thought
it was the most impressive start that I’ve ever seen as a
manager.”  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said Hernandez stayed out of
trouble with his pitches.  “He was never in any bad counts,” Girardi said. “You
look up and he averaged about a ball per hitter. He just didn’t
give us anything to hit.”  Mike Carp hit a run-scoring single in the second inning for
the only score in the Major League Baseball contest at Yankee
Stadium.  Hiroki Kuroda (10-8) allowed one run on seven hits and
struck out four for the American League East-leading Yankees
(62-44).  To contact the reporter on this story:
