A fire at a petrochemical complex in
 Iran ’s southern port of Bandar Imam has been “fully contained”
after killing one person and injuring 15 others, the Oil
Ministry said.  The blaze broke out on Aug. 3 because of a leak in a
pipeline supplying natural gas to the facility, the ministry’s
news agency  Shana  said yesterday, citing Ghodratollah Nasiri,
the security director at Iran’s National Petrochemical Co. The
fire didn’t disrupt output at the complex though several units
are still out of operation, Nasiri said, without giving details.  A “minor fire” caused by technical problems struck the
same plant in December, Iranian officials said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
