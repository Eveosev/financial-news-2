Sharp Corp.’s biggest one-day stock
slide in 37 years sent its shares sold short in Japanese margin-
trading accounts to a daily  record  as investors bet volatility
will continue.  Sharp, maker of Aquos televisions and phones,  plummeted  28
percent, the most since at least September 1974, on Aug. 3 after
the company widened its loss forecast. The number of shares held
in  margin-trading  accounts that profit if the stock falls jumped
10 times on Aug. 3 to 24.65 million, the highest since  Japan 
Securities Finance Co. began reporting daily data in August
1997. Holdings in accounts that profit if shares go up rose the
same day to 6.69 million, the highest since 2004, according to
JSF data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The selling hasn’t reached its climax yet,” Hiroyuki Uekusa, general manager of trading at Meiji Yasuda Asset
Management Co., which manages about $37 billion, said Aug. 3.
“This may be a good time for traders who bet on volatility.”  Sharp slid 5.7 percent to 181 yen at the close in Tokyo
today, its lowest close since November 1974.  Japan’s consumer electronics makers have fallen amid
increased competition from companies such as  South Korea ’s
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  Investors
seeking a safe haven from  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis and
slowing global growth have driven the yen to post-World War Two
highs, further undermining competitiveness and reducing the
value of overseas sales when repatriated.  Record Volume  Sharp relied on overseas sales for 59 percent of revenue
during the three months through June 30, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The number of shares that changed hands
on Aug. 3 was the highest since at least 1992, the data show.  While margin account holdings that profit when stocks fall
surged on Aug. 3, those that make money when the company rises,
so called long positions, hit a record before Sharp’s earnings
announcement. Long holdings of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest
consumer electronics exporter, also surged to the highest since
1991, the earliest for which  Tokyo Stock Exchange (6753)  weekly data is
available, in July.  Sharp forecast an annual  loss  of 250 billion yen ($3.2
billion) after markets closed on Aug. 2, while Sony reduced its
full-year net income forecast to 20 billion yen from 30 billion
yen amid slumping demand for TVs and a strengthening yen. Sharp
also announced its  first layoffs  since the 1950s. Sony was
unchanged at 897 yen today.  A total of 41.5  million  Sharp shares were purchased through
margin accounts in the week ended July 27, while 16.7 million
shares were bought for Sony in the week ended July 20, the TSE
data show. Sony dropped 7 percent in  Tokyo  on Aug. 3 after
cutting its full-year profit forecast by 33 percent.  Cutting Losses  “There was expectation of earnings recovery for
electronics makers, but that hope was shattered after they cut
their forecasts,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, a market analyst at
Matsui Securities Co. “With piled up margin buying of Sony and
Sharp shares, there may be more selling as individual investors
who bought on margin try to cut losses prompted by margin
calls.”  Shares of Sharp fell 56 percent and Sony dropped 47 percent
from recent highs in March through Aug. 2. The electronics
makers, which both receive more than half their revenue from
overseas, declined as reports from the U.S., Europe and  China 
signaled weakness in the global economy. Long holdings in margin
accounts more than doubled for Sharp and Sony between the week
ended March 30 and the five days ended July 27.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , the world’s largest
contract manufacturer of electronics, intends to continue with
the investment in Sharp, spokesman Simon Hsing said on Aug. 3.
The Taipei-based company plans to renegotiate the price of its
investment in Sharp, expecting to pay less than the 550 yen per
share it had agreed in March, Hsing said.  “There will be dumping of shares prompted by margin
calls,” said  Meiji Yasuda ’s Uekusa said. “Margin buying tends
to increase during share weakness as investors take a contrarian
approach. Those who bought Sharp and Sony shares are now taking
a hit.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
