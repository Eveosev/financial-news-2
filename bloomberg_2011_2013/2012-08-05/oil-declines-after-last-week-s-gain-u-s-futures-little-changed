Oil fell in  New York  after posting
the biggest gain in five weeks and gold futures declined. U.S.
equity futures were little changed as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index closed at a three-month high last week.  Oil retreated 0.3 percent to $91.09 a barrel as of 7:23
a.m. in  Tokyo , paring the 4.9 percent rally on Aug. 3. Gold lost
0.2 percent. S&P 500 futures expiring in September added less
than 0.1 percent to 1,389.10. The euro traded at $1.2385 after
rising 0.5 percent last week.  Greece  and its international creditors agreed on the need
to strengthen policy efforts to support the economy and comply
with its bailout terms after more than a week of meetings in
 Athens . The trade deficit in the U.S. probably shrank in June as
cheaper oil reduced the import bill and slower global growth led
to reduced demand for American-made goods, economists said
before a report this week.  Representatives from the so-called troika of the European
Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International Monetary
Fund  met with Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras in Athens
at the conclusion of the meetings. The talks will determine
whether Greece continues receiving funds from the country’s 240
billion euros ($297 billion) of rescue packages.  The  U.S. trade deficit  narrowed to $47.5 billion, the
smallest in four months, from $48.7 billion in May, according to
the median forecast of 59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before the Commerce Department issues the data on Aug. 9.
Another report may show worker productivity rose and labor costs
eased in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
