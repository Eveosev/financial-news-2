Curtis Martin  and his former coach,
Bill Parcells, were reunited when the  National Football League ’s
fourth-leading rusher was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame.  Parcells, who coached the  New York Giants  to two Super Bowl
titles, failed for a third time to be elected to the Hall of
Fame, yet he was on hand for yesterday’s ceremonies in Canton,
 Ohio , to present Martin for enshrinement.  Martin, whose 14,101 rushing yards are the fourth-most in
NFL history, is among six inductees in the class of 2012. Martin
played four of his 11 seasons under Parcells, with both the  New
England Patriots  and  New York Jets , and said when he was elected
that “there’s God, then there is Parcells, as far as the
importance to my career.”  “Up until I met  Bill Parcells  when I entered the NFL,
there was no role model in my life,” Martin said, sporting a
vest made of silk embossed with the Hall of Fame symbol. “He
was the first guy I looked up to. I didn’t think I knew better
than him. If it wasn’t for Bill Parcells, my career wouldn’t be
half of what it is today.”  Martin, 39, is joined in the class of 2012 by Jack Butler,
a defensive back who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from
1951-59; Dermontti Dawson, a center who played for the Steelers
from 1988-2000; Chris Doleman, defensive end and linebacker who
was with the Minnesota Vikings, Atlanta Falcons and  San
Francisco 49ers  from 1985-99; Cortez Kennedy, a defensive tackle
for the  Seattle Seahawks  from 1990-2000; and Willie Roaf, an
offensive tackle who played for the  New Orleans Saints  and
Kansas City Chiefs from 1993-2005.  Bittersweet  Martin, who was drafted by Parcells and the Patriots in
1995, had said his selection to the Hall of Fame was bittersweet
because his former coach didn’t make it in.  Martin started 15 of 16 games for Parcells during his first
NFL season, rushing for 1,487 yards and 14 touchdowns in
garnering Rookie of the Year honors and the first of his five
trips to the Pro Bowl. Martin and fellow Hall of Fame member
 Barry Sanders  are the only NFL running backs to start their
careers with 10 straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons.  After spending three years with the Patriots, Martin
rejoined Parcells with the Jets in 1998 and played the final
eight seasons of his career in New York. Martin won his lone NFL
title during his last full NFL season in 2004, when he rushed
for a career-high 1,697 yards at age 31.  Career Ends  Martin’s career ended with a knee injury in 2005, when he
was limited to 735 yards in 12 games, failing to top 1,000 yards
for the only time in his career.  Emmitt Smith  (18,355), Walter Payton (16,726) and Sanders
(15,269) are the only players who have rushed for more yards
than Martin, whose 90 rushing touchdowns are tied with Eric Dickerson for the 12th most all-time.  Butler, 84, finished his career with 52 interceptions,
returning four for touchdowns. He was All-NFL three times.  Dawson, 47, also spent his entire career with the Steelers,
making the Pro Bowl seven times in 13 years after being taken in
the second round of the 1988 draft. He ranks second in team
history with 170 consecutive games played and twice helped
Pittsburgh lead the NFL in rushing.  Doleman, 50, was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection whose 150
1/2 sacks rank fourth all-time.  Kennedy, 43, made the  Pro Bowl  eight times in his 11-year
career with the Seahawks and in 1992 was named the NFL’s
defensive player of the year for a team that went 2-14.  Roaf, 42, was selected to the Pro Bowl 11 times in 13
seasons and was an All-Pro three times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
