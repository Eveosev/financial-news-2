Two New Zealand soldiers were killed
in a firefight with insurgents in the central Afghan province of
Bamyan, raising the nation’s military death toll from the
conflict to seven, the government said today.  The clash began at 7 p.m. New Zealand time last night when
troops went to aid local security forces under attack, Prime
Minister John Key said, adding two Afghan security personnel
died in the fighting. Six New Zealand soldiers were wounded in
the battle in the northeast of the province, while 10 local
security officers and a civilian were hurt, he said.  The deaths underscore “the danger faced daily by our
forces as they work tirelessly to restore stability to the
province,” Key said in a  statement  on the government’s website
today. “It is with enormous sadness that I acknowledge that
these soldiers have paid the highest price.”  The South Pacific nation of  4.4 million people  has about
140 soldiers in Bamyan province, central  Afghanistan ,
undertaking reconstruction work. Foreign Minister Murray McCully
said in May the force will be withdrawn in 2013, about a year
earlier than previously planned.  Two New Zealand Special Air Service personnel, part of a
contingent training a unit of the Afghan Army, were killed in
August and September last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
