Turkey ’s army killed 115 members of
the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, in battles in southeast
Turkey since July 23 and fighting is continuing, Interior
Minister Idris Sahin said.  The deaths occurred during clashes in areas including the
province of Semdinli, the state-run Anatolia news agency said in
Ankara, citing a statement by Sahin. The Semdinli region is
adjacent to the Iraqi border and about 150 kilometers from
 Syria .  The PKK has fought Turkey’s security forces for three
decades, seeking independence and more democracy for the
country’s 12 million Kurds. The deaths came after Kurds in
northern Syria, adjacent to Turkey, secured towns last week in a
push for autonomy from Damascus. Hundreds of PKK militants are
based in northern  Iraq , where Kurds have already established
their own autonomous region.  “Just as with the events in Syria, they’re trying to
create a weak spot in Turkey, Sahin said. ‘‘But they couldn’t
achieve that and they won’t achieve that.”  The PKK, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.
and European Union, also attacked three military posts in the
Hakkari region, also near the border with Iraq as the fighting
continued, NTV television reported.  Turkish troops are seeking to stop PKK members not killed
in the fighting from returning to Iraq, Sahin said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
