Citadel LLC and KKR & Co. are no
longer exploring an investment in  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) ,
according to people familiar with the matter.  Citadel walked away from talks yesterday, said one of the
people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are
private. Efforts to reach  Ken Griffin , founder of Chicago-based
Citadel, werenâ€™t immediately successful.  Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for New York-based KKR,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
