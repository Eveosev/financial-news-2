Kirk Urso, a midfielder for  Major
League Soccer ’s Columbus Crew, died early today from as yet
unknown causes. He was 22.  Police officers were dispatched to an address on Park
Street Patio in Columbus at 12:50 a.m. today, the Columbus
Dispatch reported. Urso was taken to Grant Hospital and
pronounced dead at 1:51 a.m., the newspaper said.  “MLS will hold a moment of silence for Kirk at today’s two
league matches,” league Commissioner Don Garber said in a
statement.  Urso was the 10th overall selection in January’s MLS
supplemental draft and started the Crew’s first five matches
this season in the absence of the injured Danny O’Rourke.  Urso underwent a surgery for adductor tendinitis on June 18
and last appeared for the Crew as a late substitute April 28.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
