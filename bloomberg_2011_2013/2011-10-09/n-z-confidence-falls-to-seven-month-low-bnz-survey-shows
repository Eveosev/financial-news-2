New Zealand company and householder
confidence fell to a seven-month low in October, according to a
Bank of New Zealand Ltd. survey.  A net 6.9 percent of 391 respondents expect the economy
will get better in the next year down from 36.3 percent in last
monthâ€™s survey, Auckland-based BNZ said in an report on its
website. The gauge was the lowest since March.  The net measure subtracts pessimists from optimists. The
survey was conducted Oct. 6-7, BNZ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
