Blackstone Group LP (BX)  may back the bid
for Iceland Foods Ltd. by Malcolm Walker, the retailer’s founder
and chief executive officer,  the Sunday Telegraph   reported.  The U.S. private equity firm has held talks with Walker
about backing his likely bid of as much as 1.5 billion pounds
for the 77 percent of Iceland Foods that he doesn’t already own,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified people.  The first-round bids are expected to be submitted by the
middle of this month and Walker may make a decision on how to
finance his bid as soon as this week, the Sunday Telegraph said.
The retailer is being sold by Icelandic banks Landsbanki Islands
HF and Glitnir Banki HF, according to the newspaper. Officials
at Blackstone declined to comment to the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
