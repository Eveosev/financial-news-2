London  Square, a residential
development company, is close to buying St. John’s Wood
Barracks, a former military base, the  Sunday Times  reported,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  The north London site has planning permission for 117 new
homes, including nine mansions, which could sell for more than 1
billion pounds ($1.6 billion), the newspaper reported. London
Square will buy the barracks from the Eyre Estate, a private
family trust, for “well in excess” of 225 million pounds,
according to the Sunday Times.  London Square is run by Mark Pain, previously  Barratt
Developments Plc (BDEV) ’s chief financial officer, and former regional
chairman Adam Lawrence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
