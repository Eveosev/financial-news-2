Agility (AGLTY) , the Kuwaiti storage and
transport company accused of overbilling the U.S. military, may
post better financial results in the third quarter compared to
the first and second quarters,  Al-Anba  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Agility has been approached about possibly competing for a
contract to supply logistics for a Canadian base in  Kuwait , the
newspaper said.  A company official was not immediately available for
comment on the report when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
