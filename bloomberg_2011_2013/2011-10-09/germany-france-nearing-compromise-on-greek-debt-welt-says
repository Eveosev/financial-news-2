Germany  and France are close to a
compromise on a potential restructuring of Greek government
debt,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing people familiar with the
negotiations without identifying them.  Germany may be prepared to show greater flexibility in
funding the European Financial Stability Facility bailout
mechanism and France may consent to partial writedowns in Greek
debt, the newspaper reported.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel also favors changing
European Union contracts sooner than in three years, as
previously planned, to enable the EU to enforce fiscal
discipline on its members, according to the newspaper. Merkel
wants such changes to apply to the entire EU while French Prime
Minister  Nicolas Sarkozy  wants to limit them to those members of
the bloc that share the euro currency, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
