German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy will talk about a Greek
bankruptcy, the country’s future in the euro area and contagion
risks,  Le Journal du Dimanche  said, citing an unidentified
person in Sarkozy’s office.  Sarkozy wants to save Greece and strengthen aid mechanisms
for troubled European nations, the newspaper said. A Greek
default would sink some banks and send the euro area back into
recession, while Greece’s exit from the euro would deter
investors from  Europe , leading to the same results, according to
Le Journal du Dimanche.  The French government believes creating a firewall with a
public entity to take Greece’s debt would reassure markets, the
newspaper said, adding that Merkel remains to be convinced of
that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
