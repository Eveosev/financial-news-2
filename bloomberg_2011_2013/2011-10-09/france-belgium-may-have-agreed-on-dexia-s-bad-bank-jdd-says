France and  Belgium  may have agreed on
the split of the burden of  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s “bad bank,” which will
hold 120 billion euros ($160 billion) of risky U.S., Italian,
Spanish, and Belgium loans,  Le Journal du Dimanche  said, without
citing anyone.  Belgium and France may guarantee 60 percent and 40 percent,
respectively, of the refinancing of these loans, the newspaper
said. The proceeds of the sale of Dexia’s profitable assets such
as its Belgian retail bank will go to the bad bank to mitigate
its losses, according to the newspaper.  Separately, Caisse des Depots et Consignations will take 74
billion euros of other loans to local governments, of which 10
billion euros are considered “risky,” and  France  will assume
part of the potential losses in the future, Le Journal du
Dimanche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
