The U.K. wants the European Union to
reduce  farm subsidies  and direct more spending into agricultural
methods that help the environment, a government official said.  The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s regulatory
arm, will probably propose keeping overall subsidies at about
the same level, said the U.K. official, who declined to be
identified, citing government policy. The commission is
scheduled to announce its proposals for changes to the Common
Agricultural Policy on Oct. 12. Existing regulations end in 2013
and the new policy will run into 2020.  The commission in November proposed cutting agriculture and
rural-development spending by 3 percent in 2011 to 56.4 billion
euros ($74 billion), or 41 percent of the bloc’s total budget.
Direct payments to farmers accounted for 75 percent of total
farm subsidies in 2009, the U.K. official said.  The U.K. will oppose capping payments to the largest
farmers because such a policy may lead to the largest holdings
being broken up, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
