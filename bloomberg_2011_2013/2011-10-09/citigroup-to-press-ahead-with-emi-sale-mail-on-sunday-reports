Citigroup Inc. (C)  will continue with its
plans to auction EMI Group Ltd. even as potential bidders walk
away from the process, the Mail on Sunday said, without saying
where it got the information.  Several potential owners of EMI, the London-based record
label of Coldplay and Katy Perry, have dropped out of the
bidding, the newspaper said. Citigroup could struggle to reach a
4 billion-pound ($6.2 billion) target price, according to the
Mail on Sunday.  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Universal Music Group  is interested
in EMI’s recorded music business, the newspaper said.  Citigroup could dispose of EMI as soon as the end of
October, according to the Mail on Sunday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
