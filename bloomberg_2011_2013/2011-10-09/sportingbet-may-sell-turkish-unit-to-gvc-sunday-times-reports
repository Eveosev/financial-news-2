Sportingbet Plc (SBT)  may sell its Turkish
business, a step that could spur Ladbrokes Plc to make a fresh
offer for the London-based bookmaker, the Sunday Times reported
today, without saying where it got the information.  Ladbrokes may offer 70 pence to 80 pence a share after
Sportingbet sells its Turkish unit to  GVC Holdings Plc (GVC) , the
Sunday Times reported. Such an approach would value Sportingbet
at about 530 million pounds ($825 million), according to the
newspaper.  Sportingbet’s shares closed on Oct. 7 at 45.75 pence,
giving the company a market value of 302 million pounds.
Ladbrokes, which wants to boost its internet business, made a
“highly preliminary” approach to Sportingbet in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
