Syria  is seeking technical assistance
from the Arab Petroleum Investments Corp. to develop its
refinery in the port of Banias, the official Syrian Arab News
Agency reported.  Oil Ministry officials met last week in Cairo with
representatives of the inter-governmental Arab energy lender to
discuss plans for a study of the project, the agency said,
citing Syrian Oil Minister Sufian Alao.  The Banias refinery, operated by Sytrol, the state-run  oil
company , is Syriaâ€™s largest, with a crude-processing capacity of
133,000 barrels a day. It processed 3.24 million metric tons of
crude in the first half of this year, according to an e-mailed
statement from the ministry on Aug. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
