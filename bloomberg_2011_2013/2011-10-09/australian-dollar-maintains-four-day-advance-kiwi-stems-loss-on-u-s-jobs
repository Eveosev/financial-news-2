The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose against the greenback and the yen before an Oct. 13
report projected to show Australian employers added jobs last
month for the first time since June.  The Aussie reached above parity with the dollar for the
first time since Sept. 22 as a rally in stocks spurred demand
for higher-yielding assets. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the
kiwi, strengthened as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  gave themselves three weeks to devise
a plan to recapitalize European banks and address the debt
crisis in  Greece .  “The payroll number takes some of the negativity away from
the U.S. economic outlook, but the  euro zone  will continue to
dominate sentiment,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in
Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp.,  Australia ’s second-largest
lender. “We should see a risk-on move this week helping the
Aussie and kiwi dollars track higher.”  Australia’s dollar rose 2.3 percent to 99.95 U.S. cents at
12:48 p.m. in  New York  and touched $1.001. The currency added
2.2 percent to 76.63 yen. New Zealand’s dollar gained 1.9
percent to 78.45 U.S. cents and strengthened 1.9 percent to
60.15 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities climbed 2.9
percent, while the MSCI World Index gained 2.5 percent.  U.S. payrolls increased by 103,000 in September after a
57,000 gain in August, the Labor Department said on Oct. 7. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called
for an increase of 60,000. The jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  Australian Jobs  Australian employers probably added 10,000 jobs in
September, after cutting 9,700 positions in August, the
statistics bureau will say this week, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Demand for the Australian and New Zealand currencies was
bolstered after Merkel said European leaders will do
“everything necessary” to ensure that banks have enough
capital. Sarkozy said they would deliver a plan by the Nov. 3
Group of 20 summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
