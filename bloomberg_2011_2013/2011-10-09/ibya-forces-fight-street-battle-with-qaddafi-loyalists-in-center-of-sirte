Libyan opposition forces engaged in a
second day of street battles with troops loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  in his hometown of Sirte.  Fighters were attempting to dislodge snipers in the coastal
city, the  BBC  reported today, citing the chairman of the
National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil. The fighting
continued a day after soldiers from Misrata gained control of
some buildings surrounding Ouagadougou Hall, the complex that
Qaddafi loyalists have been using as a base.  The armed forces of Libya’s new rulers have been trying to
capture Sirte since talks on its surrender broke down a month
ago. The NTC, which took control of most of the country in
August when Qaddafi lost Tripoli, the capital, has said for the
past two weeks that they were close to capturing the city.  The fall of Sirte would be a key step in  Libya ’s transition
to democracy. A new government to see the North African nation
through to elections will be announced only after the
transitional council’s forces take full control of the city,
Mahmoud Jibril, the acting prime minister, said on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
