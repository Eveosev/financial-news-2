International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  dismissed
proposals to connect  London ’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports with
a high-speed rail link,  the Sunday Telegraph  reported.  The proposals would be difficult to deliver and more
expensive than the previously rejected project to build a third
runway at Heathrow, the newspaper said, citing Walsh.  “I don’t know how long it would take to develop, I don’t
know how much it would cost,” the CEO was quoted as saying by
the Sunday Telegraph. “I struggle to see how it would be
funded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
