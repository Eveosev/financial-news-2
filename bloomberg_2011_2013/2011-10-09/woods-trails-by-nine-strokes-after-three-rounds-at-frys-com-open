Tiger Woods , seeking his first win in
23 starts, recorded a 3-under 68 yesterday to stand nine strokes
off the lead going into today’s final round of the second event
of the U.S.  PGA Tour ’s Fall Series.  Woods is 4-under par at 209 after three rounds, tied for
38th in the Frys.com Open at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin,
 California . It was his second straight round of 68.  Briny Baird, who hasn’t seen a win in his 347 starts in 12
years on the PGA Tour, fired a 7-under 64 to take the 56-hole
lead at 13-under, two shots ahead of Ernie Els and Paul Casey.  Woods, who has a 23-month winless streak, is playing in his
first event since missing the cut at the  PGA Championship  in
August and failing to qualify for the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup
playoffs.  The 35-year-old golfer is prepping for next month’s
Presidents Cup.  “I was very close to putting it together on that front
nine -- birdie 17 and 18, and all of a sudden, I’m 5 under,”
said Woods, who started his day on the back nine. “I wasn’t
that far away from really taking it deep. This golf course can
be had. A 62 or 63 is not out of the realm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
