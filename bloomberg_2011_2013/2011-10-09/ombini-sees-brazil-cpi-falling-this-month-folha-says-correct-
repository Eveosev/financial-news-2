(Corrects link to Folha article in first paragraph.)  Brazil ’s inflation rate will begin to
fall this month after reaching an annual rate of 7.31 percent in
September, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said,
according to newspaper  Folha de S.Paulo .  The central bank expects monthly inflation of 0.3 percent
to 0.4 percent in October, compared with 0.53 percent in
September, according to an interview with Tombini published in
the Sao Paulo-based paper. Inflation in October of last year was
0.75 percent, Tombini noted.  Tombini repeated the bank’s prediction that inflation will
converge to the 4.5 percent midpoint of the bank’s target range
by December 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
