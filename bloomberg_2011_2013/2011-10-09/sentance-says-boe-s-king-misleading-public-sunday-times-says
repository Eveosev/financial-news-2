Former Bank of England policy maker
 Andrew Sentance  said Governor  Mervyn King  is “misleading the
public” by saying the U.K. is potentially facing its worst
financial crisis ever, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing
Sentance.  “Members of the public do not make a clear distinction
between the financial system and the economy as a whole and they
may think he is saying his is the worst economic situation since
the 1930s or before,” Sentance said, according to the
newspaper. “I think this is very dangerous and it misleading
the public.”  King last week said the first loosening of U.K. monetary
policy since 2009, was a response to what may be the worst
financial crisis ever. The U.K. central bank raised the ceiling
for so-called quantitative easing to 275 billion pounds from 200
billion pounds.  “To talk in these terms is not really helpful,” said
Sentance. “What we need to do is the current environment is
sustain  consumer confidence .”  He reiterated that he didn’t think the higher asset
purchases “will help growth and it risks sustaining the surge
in inflation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
