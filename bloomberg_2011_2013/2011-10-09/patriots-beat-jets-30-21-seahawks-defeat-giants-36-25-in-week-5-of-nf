The  New England Patriots  beat the New
York Jets 30-21 in Week 5 of the National Football League.  The  Seattle Seahawks  ended a three-game winning run for the
New York Giants with a 36-25 win, their first on the road in
eight games.  The Indianapolis Colts remain winless after blowing a 24-7
lead in a 28-24 home loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, while the
Minnesota Vikings got their first win, 34-10 against the Arizona
Cardinals, to avoid matching their worst start to a season, set
in 1962.  Quarterback Michael Vick threw four interceptions as the
Philadelphia Eagles lost 31-24 to the Buffalo Bills and
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, playing with a sprained left
foot, threw five touchdown passes as the Pittsburgh Steelers
beat the Tennessee Titans 38-17.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
