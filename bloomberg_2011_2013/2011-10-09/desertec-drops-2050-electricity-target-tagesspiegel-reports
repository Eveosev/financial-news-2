The Desertec Industrial Initiative,
which plans to generate solar power in North Africa, is backing
away from a target of generating about 15 percent of  Europe ’s
electricity demand by 2050,  Tagesspiegel  reported, citing Aglaia
Wieland, the group’s chief strategist.  Wieland also said it doesn’t make sense to insist on
generating solar energy in  Greece  as conditions there aren’t
ideal, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
