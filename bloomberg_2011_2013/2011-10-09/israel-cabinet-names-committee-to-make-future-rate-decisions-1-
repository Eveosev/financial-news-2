Israel ’s Cabinet named a six-member
central bank committee today that will make monetary policy
decisions that were previously the sole authority of the central
bank governor.  The six-member committee will be chaired by  Bank of Israel 
Governor  Stanley Fischer , and will include two other senior
officials at the central bank and three professors of economics.
The new arrangement is part of a Bank of Israel Law that was
overhauled last year.  The next interest rate decision on Oct. 24 will be made by
the committee, the Bank of Israel said in a text message.  “The Cabinet decision symbolizes the beginning of a new
age at the Bank of Israel, in which the bank will begin to work
like a modern central bank within the framework of the new
law,” the central bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
