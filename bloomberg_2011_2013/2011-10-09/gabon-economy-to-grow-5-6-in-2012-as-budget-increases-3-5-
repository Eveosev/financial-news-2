Gabon expects economic growth to
accelerate to 5.6 percent in 2012 from 5 percent this year as
the budget in the central west African country increases 3.5
percent.  The budget will reach 2,453.1 billion  CFA francs  ($5
billion) next year after 2,370.8 billion CFA in 2011, the
Direction of Economy said in a press statement in the nation’s
capital Libreville yesterday.  The International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of 5.6
percent this year and 3.3 percent in 2012. Director General of
Economy Hamidou Okabe told reporters he believes “the IMF
figures don’t include all investments Gabon has done."  To contact the reporter on this story: Antoine Lawson in
