OPEC’s members are likely to decide to
keep their output target for oil unchanged when they meet in
December,  Iran ’s representative to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said.  Producers and consumers are satisfied with the current
price level for crude, Iran’s Governor to OPEC Mohammad Ali Khatibi said, according to  Shana , the Iranian Oil Ministry’s
news website. “The situation is such that most OPEC members are
expected to agree with maintaining the current level of oil
production,” Khatibi said.  OPEC is responsible for 40 percent of global oil output,
and the group’s 12 members are to meet Dec. 14 in Vienna to
review output policy. Iran is OPEC’s second-largest producer
after  Saudi Arabia . When the group last gathered on June 8, Iran
and five other members rejected a Saudi proposal to raise output
by 1.5 million barrels a day, and the meeting ended without
agreement for the first time in at least 20 years.  The average price for OPEC’s main crude oil grades fell
below $100 a barrel last week for the first time since Feb. 18,
before rising back above that level on Oct. 6. The price for the
so-called OPEC basket of crudes advanced to $101.63 from $99.90
on Oct. 5, according to OPEC’s website. The basket price is
calculated using one key export blend from each of the
organization’s members and weighting each according to
production.  Before last week, the OPEC price had exceeded $100 since
the beginning of 2011. “Prices aren’t expected to fluctuate
much,” Khatibi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
