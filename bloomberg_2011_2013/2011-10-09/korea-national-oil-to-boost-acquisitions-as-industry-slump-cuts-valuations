Korea National Oil Corp.,  South
Korea ’s most acquisitive company this year, plans to resume
buying overseas assets after a six-month hiatus as a slump in
the oil and gas industry makes valuations attractive.  The state-owned energy developer needs to buy more assets
to meet the government’s goal of achieving the capability of
producing 300,000 barrels of oil a day by 2012, Senior Executive
Vice President Kim Seong Hoon said in an interview. The company
known as KNOC is 62,000 barrels short of that target.  “The only way to achieve that goal next year is through
acquisitions,” Kim, 56, said by telephone Oct. 7 from the
company’s headquarters in Anyang, near Seoul.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Sanford C. Bernstein Co. have
predicted a surge of oil and gas takeovers after the industry’s
worst slump in three years. Crude in  New York  has declined 10
percent this year amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis and a
U.S. economic slowdown will drag the world back into recession.
KNOC has spent about $10 billion since 2009 to buy energy assets
abroad.  “Crude  oil prices  are falling, which is good,” Kim said.
“Given the uncertainties arising from debt problems in  Greece 
and other countries, we think we need to wait until financial
markets stabilize.”  Kim declined to identify assets and regions KNOC plans to
target. South Korea imports all the oil and natural gas it needs.  The KNOC official’s comments come after global energy
shares fell 21 percent in the third quarter, the worst three
months since 2008. Asian buyers may spend $150 billion by 2016
to secure energy resources for their faster-growing economies
and targets could include  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , Canadian Oil Sands Ltd.
and Kosmos Energy Ltd., according to Bernstein.  Acquisitions  KNOC announced four acquisitions this year, valued at $2.7
billion, the most by any company in South Korea, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The last deal was in March, when it
agreed to buy a stake in a Texas shale-oil block from Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. for $1.55 billion.  The South Korean company bought 95 percent of Altius
Holdings Inc. for $515 million and assets from Petro-Canada in
March, following the purchase of Canadian oil and gas assets
from Dallas-based Hunt Oil Co. for C$525 million ($505 million).  KNOC has focused on investing in producing fields rather
than buying companies, after completing a hostile takeover of
 Scotland ’s  Dana Petroleum Plc (DNX)  for 1.8 billion pounds ($2.8
billion) last year. It bought a 50 percent stake in Petro-Tech
Peruana SA of  Peru , now known as Savia Peru, for $450 million in
February 2009 and purchased Canada’s Harvest Energy Trust worth
$3.9 billion eight months later.  ‘Global Player’  KNOC is involved in 63 production projects, 12 development
projects and 135 exploration projects in 23 countries. The
company has had an 18 percent success rate in oil exploration in
the past five years and aims to increase it to more than 25
percent with the help of the acquired companies, Kim said.  Daily crude output from invested fields totaled 203,000
barrels a day as of August, including 53,000 barrels from Dana
and 55,000 barrels from Harvest. The state-run company aims to
boost the output to 300,000 barrels by 2012 and to 600,000
barrels by 2019.  “We have also set an aggressive target of becoming a
global player by 2019,” Kim said. “We will try to achieve the
target by boosting output and efficiency of assets we have
invested in, on top of acquisitions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
