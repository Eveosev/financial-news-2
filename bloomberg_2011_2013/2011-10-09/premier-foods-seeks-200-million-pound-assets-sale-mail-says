Premier Foods Plc (PFD)  will seek to raise
about 200 million pounds ($311 million) selling brands including
Hartley’s Jam, the Mail on Sunday reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Premier, which said Oct. 7 that full-year profit and debt
reduction would miss analysts’ estimates, has hired advisers to
sell businesses, including the RF Brookes chilled foods unit and
its Haywards pickle brand, the newspaper said. The advisers
include Spayne Lindsay, hired to sell Premier’s spreads
business, McQueen and Stamford Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
