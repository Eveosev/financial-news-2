BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Societe Generale (GLE) 
SA may seek to raise 7 billion euros ($9.4 billion) and up to 4
billion euros respectively as part of a Europe-wide plan to
shore up the regionâ€™s banking system,  Le Journal du Dimanche 
said, without citing anyone.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy , who are meeting today, will set up a timeframe
to reach equity goals in coming weeks because a signal must be
given to reassure markets, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified person close to Sarkozy.  Banks will have to seek funds from private investors,
according to Le Journal du Dimanche. If they fail to find
private investors, governments or the European Union will take
stakes in banks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
