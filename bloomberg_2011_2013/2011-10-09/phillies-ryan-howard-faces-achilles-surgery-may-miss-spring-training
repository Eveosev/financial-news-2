Philadelphia Phillies first baseman
Ryan Howard, who collapsed trying to run to first base in the
team’s playoff loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, has a ruptured
left Achilles tendon, the team said.  Howard, who collected 33 home runs during the season, 
stumbled leaving the batter’s box after hitting
toward second base with two outs in the final inning. The
Cardinals won 1-0 in the deciding fifth game of the National
League Division Series.  “I was trying to run and I just felt this pop, and the
whole thing went numb like it was on fire,” Howard, 31, told
reporters after the Oct. 7 game. “I tried to keep going and
went down. It literally felt like I was on a flat tire. I tried
to get up, [but I] just couldn’t go.”  Howard, who had an MRI on his foot yesterday, can’t have
surgery until the swelling resides, the team said.  “Recovery time won’t be known until after the surgery is
complete and there is no guarantee he will be ready for spring
training,” the Phillies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
