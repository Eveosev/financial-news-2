The Archbishop of Canterbury,  Rowan Williams , today appealed for peace at  Zimbabwe ’s next general
elections during a visit to the African state.  “We encourage the people to say no to violence, especially
as the next election approaches in this nation,” Williams said
during a prayer at a church service.  No dates have been set for Zimbabwe’s next election.  Williams is on three-nation African tour, and has already
been to Malawi and is expected to travel to Zambia after
Zimbabwe. Before he arrived a splinter Anglican faction led by
excommunicated bishop Nolbert Kunonga, demonstrated outside the
country’s main Cathedral in protest at the visit by Williams,
the spiritual leader of the Anglican church.  To contact the reporter on this story:
