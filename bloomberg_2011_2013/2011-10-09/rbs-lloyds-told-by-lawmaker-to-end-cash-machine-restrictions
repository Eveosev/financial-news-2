Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  should allow customers with basic
accounts full access to automated teller machines, said  Andrew Tyrie , chairman of the Treasury Committee of the U.K. House of
Commons.  Restricting the use of machines owned by other lenders
leaves many people without access to the majority of cash
dispensers in the U.K., the head of the cross-party panel of
lawmakers said. The practice may jeopardize universal access to
automated tellers and stifle competition, he said.  “We are concerned about the restrictions Lloyds and RBS
are placing on basic account holders,” Tyrie said in a
statement released by his office in London.  Basic bank accounts offer current-account banking services
to people with poor credit history without overdraft facilities.
RBS in August said it would limit access, while Lloyds already
has restrictions in place, Tyrie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
