Glencore International Plc may buy as
much as 20 percent of Indonesian coal producer Bumi Plc from PT
Bakrie & Brothers Tbk, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got its information.  Glencore may buy a stake in Bumi after its share price
fell, triggering repayment clauses on a $1.3 billion loan to the
Bakrie brothers which is secured on their stock, the newspaper
said. The terms of any deal could change or fall through, the
Sunday Times reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge
of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
