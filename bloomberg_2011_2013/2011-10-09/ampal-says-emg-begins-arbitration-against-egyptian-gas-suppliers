Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp. said its
12.5 percent-owned East Mediterranean Gas SAE submitted a
request for arbitration with the  International Chamber of
Commerce  to begin proceedings against Egyptian General Petroleum
Corp., Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. and Israel Electric
Corp.  The request is a result of “EGPC/EGAS’s prolonged
interruption of the gas supply to EMG as well as EGPC/EGAS’s
long-standing failure to supply the quantities of gas that they
contractually committed to supply to EMG.” The announcement was
made today in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
