Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
bank, will relocate Christopher Laing, head of equity capital
markets for the  Middle East  and Africa, back to London after
three years in Dubai, a person familiar with the matter said.  Laing will operate from London starting January to cover
equity capital markets for emerging markets and will continue to
cover the Middle East and Africa region, the person said.  Michael Lermer, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt,
declined to comment when contacted today.  Laing moved to Dubai from London in 2008 to help build the
bank’s regional business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
