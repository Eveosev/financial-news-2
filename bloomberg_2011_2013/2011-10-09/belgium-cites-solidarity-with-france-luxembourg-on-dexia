The Belgian, French and Luxembourg
governments are united in finding a solution to the future of
 Dexia SA (DEXB)  and support proposals on the matter by the bank’s
management, Prime Minister Yves Leterme of Belgium said.  “The suggested solution, which is also the result of
intense consultations with all partners involved, will be
submitted to Dexia’s board of directors for approval,” Leterme
said in an e-mailed statement today in Brussels.   Earlier, Leterme met French and Luxembourg authorities
including Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  of France. Dexia’s
