U.S. stocks advanced, giving the
 Standard & Poor’s 500  its biggest rally since August, after the
leaders of France and Germany pledged a plan to support European
banks and stem the region’s debt crisis.  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 advanced.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added more than 5.2 percent.
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  climbed at least 3.9 percent.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  increased more than 3.5 percent,
pacing gains in companies most-tied to the economy.  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)  tumbled 7.9 percent as at least seven analysts cut
their ratings after the carrier’s investor meeting.  The S&P 500 advanced 3.4 percent to 1,194.89 at 4 p.m. New
York time. It had the biggest rally over five days since March
2009, gaining 8.7 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
added 330.06 points, or 3 percent, to 11,433.18. The Russell
2000 Index of small companies surged 4.4 percent. About 6.9
billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges as of 4:27 p.m.,
the lowest volume since Aug. 29, according to Bloomberg data.  “Europe took a very good step,”  Peter Jankovskis , who
helps manage about $2.2 billion at Oakbrook Investments in
Lisle, Illinois, said in a telephone interview. “People talk
about a Greek default, but the real driver is not what happens
to Greece, but what happens to banks that hold its debt. As long
as the bank system can survive, it shouldn’t be a big problem.”  The  S&P 500  last week rose from the threshold of a bear
market on optimism Europe will tame its debt crisis and after
American economic data improved. The measure was up 5.6 percent
so far this month as gains were led by commodity, consumer
discretionary and industrial shares. Before October, the index
had fallen for five straight months.  Four-Year Anniversary  Yesterday marked the four-year anniversary of the all-time
closing high for the S&P 500 of 1,565.15. The gauge fell 57
percent to a 12-year low in March 2009. Since then, it more than
doubled through April 29, 2011. The measure is still down 24
percent from its record high.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted the biggest four-day gain
since 2008. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said yesterday they will deliver a plan to
recapitalize European banks and address the Greek debt crisis by
the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit. Belgium agreed to buy the local
consumer-lending unit of Dexia SA, ending a 15-year cross-border
experiment with  France .  Alcoa, the biggest U.S. aluminum producer will report
earnings tomorrow after U.S. markets close, the first company of
the Dow to do so for the third quarter. Earnings per share for
the S&P 500, excluding financial companies, rose 14 percent in
the third quarter, the smallest gain since the end of 2009,
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Strong Earnings Season’  “The earnings season should be a reasonably good one,”
 Stephen Wood , who helps oversee about $163 billion as the New
York-based chief market strategist for Russell Investments, said
in a telephone interview. “Are we going to continue to have
record earnings? I’d say -- probably not. But it should be a
strong earnings season.”  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth jumped 4 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average increased 3.9 percent. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  climbed 5.3
percent. Bank of America advanced 6.4 percent to $6.28. JPMorgan
rallied 5.2 percent to $32.30. Chevron rose 4 percent to $98.20.
Alcoa added 3.9 percent to $10.09. Caterpillar gained 4.8
percent to $79.13. Boeing climbed 3.6 percent to $64.03.  It’s time to “extend risk,”  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S.
market strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a note today. “As macro
concerns subside, stocks which have experienced the greatest
price declines are likely to snap back the quickest.”  Most Attractive  Golub said industrial, raw material and energy shares are
the most attractively valued. Since the S&P 500 dropped from a
three-year high at the end of April, those groups have fallen
more than 19 percent. The benchmark gauge has slumped 12 percent
during the same period.  Yahoo! Inc. climbed 2.4 percent to $15.84. Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. has talked with  Singapore ’s Temasek Holdings Pte
about providing financing to buy the 40 percent stake in itself
held by the U.S. Web portal, according to people familiar with
the matter. Yahoo’s stake in Alibaba may be worth about $13
billion, using a valuation by the Singapore investor last month.  Sprint tumbled 7.9 percent to $2.22, extending its two-day
decline to 26 percent, the most since November 2008. At its Oct.
7 meeting, the third-largest U.S. mobile carrier said it plans
to increase spending to pay for a new wireless network and
handsets, and also said it will need to raise capital.  Analyst Changes  Mizuho Securities USA Inc. cut its rating on Sprint to
“neutral” from “buy.” JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank AG, Collins
Stewart, Kaufman Bros., Atlantic Equities and Raymond James also
cut their recommendations.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  lost 4.8 percent to $111.62, after gaining as
much as 9.6 percent earlier. The company retreated from a
decision to split its mail-order DVD service from its Internet
streaming. “The real cause of the strategy shift could be
higher-than-expected customer churn rates in late September and
early October,” George Askew, an analyst with Stifel Financial
Corp. in Washington, wrote in a note today to investors.  Oppenheimer & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc cut
estimates for the S&P 500, citing Europe’s debt crisis and U.S.
budget battles.  “Against a backdrop of slowing global growth, ongoing
sovereign debt issues in Europe, uncertainty regarding U.S.
fiscal and regulatory policies and anemic labor market growth,
the market is likely to struggle for longer-term gains,”  Brian Belski , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, wrote in a
note dated Oct. 7.  S&P 500 Targets  Belski cut his year-end 2012 forecast for the equity gauge
to 1,400 from 1,475 and his profit forecast for next year to
$101 a share from $112. He also lifted his projection for
earnings this year to $96 from $94. Garry Evans, head of global
equity strategy at HSBC, slashed his prediction for the S&P
500’s close in 2011 by 21 percent to 1,130. Barclays’s Barry Knapp reduced his 2011 forecast for the index to 1,260 from
1,326 and his 2012 earnings estimate to $102 from $105.  The S&P 500 climbed above its 50-day average for the first
time since July, ending its longest streak below the threshold
since 2008 and sending a bullish sign to some analysts who study
charts. The benchmark gauge rose above 1,176, its average level
during the past 50 days. The index spent the previous 52 days
below the average, surpassing the 48-day stretch from May to
July of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
