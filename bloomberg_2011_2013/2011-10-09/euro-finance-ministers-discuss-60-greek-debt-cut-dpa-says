Euro-area finance ministers are
discussing scenarios for a Greek haircut of as much as 60
percent,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported, citing people in the
finance industry and people familiar with the negotiations.  Such a debt restructuring would affect both banks and tax
payers, DPA said.  People close to the German government said itâ€™s too early
for a definite assessment before the so-called troika delivers
its report on whether the Greek government is meeting the
conditions of its rescue, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
