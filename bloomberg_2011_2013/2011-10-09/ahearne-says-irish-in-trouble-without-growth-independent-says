Ireland’s debt is sustainable if
“the economy grows as forecast,” the  Sunday Independent  cited
 Alan Ahearne , who was an economic adviser to former Irish
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan, as saying in an interview.  “This economy desperately needs growth,” Ahearne, a
lecturer at  National University  of Ireland, Galway, and a former
Federal Reserve Economist, said, according to the newspaper.
“If we don’t get growth around Europe, all bets are off, we’re
in trouble.”  If Ireland misses economic growth forecasts, its debt will
fail the sustainability test, the Sunday Independent cited
Ahearne as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
