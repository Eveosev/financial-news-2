Moses Mosop of  Kenya  set a course
record at the  Chicago Marathon , while  Russia ’s Liliya Shobukhova
won the women’s title for the third straight year.  Mosop crossed the finish line in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 37
seconds to trim 4 seconds from the previous fastest time for the
race, set by the late Sammy Wanjiru in 2009. The run earned
Mosop a $50,000 bonus on top of the $100,000 first prize.  Shobukhova, 33, completed the 26.2-mile race in 2:18:20 to
become the first person to win in Chicago in three consecutive
years.  Paula Radcliffe of the U.K., who booked a world-best time
of 2:15:25 in  London  in April 2003 according to the
 International Association of Athletic Federations , is the only
woman to have run a faster marathon.  Mosop, 26, finished ahead of fellow Kenyans Wesley Korir
(2:06:15) and Bernard Kipyego (2:06:29). Ethiopia’s Bekana Daba
(2:07:59) and American Ryan Hall (2:08:04) completed the top
five.  Ejegayehu Dibaba of Ethiopia took second in the women’s
race in 2:22:09, and  Japan ’s Kayoko Fukushi was third in 2:24:38.  About 37,400 of the 45,000 registered runners made the
start.  Olympic marathon champion Wanjiru died in May after falling
from a balcony at his home in Kenya’s Rift Valley. He was 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
