More than 200 Palestinian inmates in
Israeli prisons have joined a hunger strike started almost two
weeks ago to protest their living conditions, the  Israel  Prison
Service said.  About 234 prisoners refusing food have been placed under
daily medical supervision, the prison service said in an e-
mailed statement. The inmates are drinking water and are in
“satisfactory” medical condition, it said.  The hunger strike started Sept. 27, three months after
Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  ordered harsher
conditions for prisoners who belong to the Islamic Hamas
movement, which rules the Gaza Strip.  The measure was in response to Hamas’s refusal to release
soldier Gilad Shalit five years after he was captured outside
Gaza, Netanyahu said June 23. Hamas, which is considered a
terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European
Union, has been negotiating for the release of hundreds of its
prisoners held by Israel in exchange for Shalit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
