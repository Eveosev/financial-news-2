ExxonMobil Corp. said it’s responding
to an oil sheen observed Oct. 7 near its Billings,  Montana ,
refinery, about 15 miles from an Exxon pipeline spill in July.  “ExxonMobil has no pipelines or similar oil containing
equipment in close proximity to the leak,” said Rachael Moore,
a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company, in an e-mail
today. The company has “no reason” to believe its facilities
were the source of the oil, she said.  A spill response team from the refinery laid boom to limit
potential environmental damage, and the “small amount of oil”
is contained in a side channel of the river, Moore said.  The company is investigating the source of the sheen, she
said. Moore declined to provide an estimate of how much oil is
in the sheen.  On July 1, Exxon’s Silvertip pipeline in Montana ruptured,
spilling as much as 1,000 barrels of crude into the Yellowstone
River. The cleanup effort, which is being led by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, has involved more than 600
people and is expected to cost the company an estimated $42.6
million, Exxon has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
