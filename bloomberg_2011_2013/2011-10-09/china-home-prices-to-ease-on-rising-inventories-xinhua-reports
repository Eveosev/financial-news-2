China home prices will gradually ease
due to rising inventories and a slump in property market
transactions, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The market declined during the week-long National Day
holiday, typically a strong period for housing sales, Xinhua
reported. Official statistics showed 1,039 housing units were
sold in Beijing during the holiday, 22.8 percent fewer than
during the same period last year, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
