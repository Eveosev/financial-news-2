Jeff Koons ,  Lucian Freud  and Gerhard Richter artworks will be among more than $500 million worth of
contemporary pieces on offer this week at auctions and fairs in
London. Dealers are hoping that demand holds up from billionaire
buyers after stocks dived on worries about government debts.  The evening auctions this week are valued at 56.8 million
pounds ($88.4 million), according to Bloomberg calculations. In
addition, hundreds of wealthy buyers are in the U.K. for  Frieze ,
 Europe ’s biggest commercial fair primarily devoted to living
artists, which has $350 million of works on offer, according to
insurer  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX)  Daytime auctions, gallery shows and
satellite fairs add to the total.  “There’s still momentum in the market,” said  Anders Petterson , founder of the London-based database  ArtTactic , which
is surveying confidence levels of buyers and sellers. “It could
well be business as usual. There’s been a shift in sentiment,
though. People think things could get worse in six months,
except for some high-end pieces at more than $1 million.”  Optimism about demand has been challenged by economic
stagnation in the U.S. and the Eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis.
Prices for some artists dropped by 50 percent in the art market
crash of 2009. Collectors were hailing a full recovery in June
this year when Sotheby’s London contemporary sale fetched a
record 108.8 million pounds.  The low estimate for the evening sales mounted by
Christie’s International,  Sotheby’s (BID)  and Phillips de Pury & Co is
the biggest for a Frieze Week since October 2008. The equivalent
events last year had a minimum estimate of 32.45 million pounds.  Christie’s Richter  The most valuable lot at Christie’s Oct. 14 sale is a 1982
Richter “Kerze” (Candle) painting, priced at 6 million pounds to
9 million pounds. The estimate, the highest of the week,
reflects the record 8 million pounds paid for another of the
German artist’s photo-based “memento mori” subjects at Sotheby’s
in February 2008. Christie’s owner had been encouraged to sell
by the opening of the Richter retrospective at  Tate Modern  on
Oct. 6. The Cologne-based artist himself is baffled by the
prices he fetches at auction.  “It’s just as absurd as the banking crisis,” Richter said
at the Tate press preview. “It’s impossible to understand, and 
it’s daft.”  Christie’s 53-lot evening event also includes the 2002
Richard Prince painting “Nurse Forrester’s Secret,” estimated at
2.1 million pounds to 3 million pounds. The European seller has
been guaranteed a minimum price by the auction house.  Sotheby’s Freud  The previous evening, Sotheby’s will offer three works by
Freud, who died in July, aged 88. The 1952 close-up portrait,
“Boy’s Head,” measuring just 6 inches (15 centimeters) high, has
been entered by a U.S. collector with a valuation of 3 million
pounds to 4 million pounds.  An 18-carat gold sculpture by Marc Quinn of  Kate Moss  in a
provocatively contorted yoga pose is billed in Sotheby’s 47-lot
sale as the “epitome of luxury and desirability.” From an
edition of four weighing 10 kilograms each, it has a low
estimate of 500,000 pounds -- about 20 times its current scrap
value.  London’s “Frieze Week” auctions are specifically aimed at
the estimated 60,000 visitors to the contemporary-art event.
Including day sales and sections of 20th century Italian
material, more than 950 lots will be looking for buyers. Works 
from the last three decades predominate.  “Nearly 1,000 lots is pushing the envelope, particularly
given the current economic climate,” said the New York-based art
adviser David Nisinson. “Though I think that buy-in rates may be
higher than desired and there may even be a few conspicuous
failures, I imagine that the auctions will perform reasonably
well and some prominent lots will probably bring high prices.”  Phillips's Koons  More than half the 36 lots at  Phillips  on Oct. 12 were
produced in the last 10 years. Koons’s painted aluminum-and-
steel “Sea Walrus Trashcans” sculpture from the “Popeye” series
-- from an edition of four, begun in 2002 -- has never appeared 
at auction and is valued at 2 million pounds to 3 million 
pounds.  “We're hoping the market can absorb this material,” Peter 
Sumner, Phillips's London-based head of contemporary art, said 
in an interview. “Last time, it was private debt that caused the 
problem. Now it's the sovereigns that are in trouble. Some 
individuals do have a lot of cash at the moment. They see the 
low returns on bonds and are looking to invest in tangible 
assets like art.”  A reflective 2010 silver monochrome by  New York 's Jacob 
Kassay -- the subject of a show at London's Institute of 
Contemporary Arts, opening on Oct. 12 -- is valued at 50,000 
pounds to 70,000 pounds.  Italian Art  Sotheby's  and Christie's evening sales will be bolstered by 
separately cataloged mixed-owner offerings of 20th-century 
Italian art, an area that has attracted a growing clientele of 
American and other international buyers in recent years.  A 36-lot private collection at Sotheby's features a 1959 
Piero Manzoni “Achrome” and a 1983 Alighiero Boetti “Mappa.” 
These “Arte Povera” works are each estimated at 700,000 pounds 
to 1 million pounds.  Boetti also looms large at the first Frieze Week auction of 
Bonhams's revamped contemporary art department. “1984” -- a 30-
foot-wide collage of 192 drawings of magazine covers -- is by 
far the most valuable work in the company's 20-lot sale on Oct. 
13 with a high valuation of 1.8 million pounds. The lot carries 
a symbol indicating that Bonhams either wholly or part owns, or 
has an economic interest in the work.  In the meantime, anyone wanting to buy a Volvo decorated by 
Banksy should contact  Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions .  The graffiti-artist's painting “Laugh Now But One Day We’ll 
Be In Charge” was commissioned in 2000 by the event organizers 
Turbo Zone for a 17-ton box lorry. The mobile spray mural, 
presciently adorned with images of rioters, has been 
authenticated byBanksy's Pest Control office. It is available 
for sale to private offers over the next six months. Bids should 
be more than 400,000 pounds, said the London-based auctioneers.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
