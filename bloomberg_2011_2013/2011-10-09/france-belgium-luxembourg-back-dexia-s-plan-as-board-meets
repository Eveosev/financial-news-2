France, Belgium and Luxembourg said
they back  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s management plan as the lender’s board meets
today to approve the proposals, paving the way for a dismantling
of the French-Belgian bank.  “The suggested solution, which is also the result of
intense consultations with all partners involved, will be
submitted to Dexia’s board of directors for approval,” Belgian
caretaker Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  and French Prime Minister
 Francois Fillon  said in a joint e-mail statement today.  Paris- and Brussels-based Dexia’s board of directors is due
to meet today at 3 p.m. in Brussels. Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis has caused the short-term funding of what used to be the
world’s largest municipal lender to evaporate.  Rescuing Dexia -- the first victim of the debt crisis at
the core of  Europe  -- has become critical to preventing
contagion in the region’s banking industry. Dexia’s balance
sheet, with total assets of about 518 billion euros ($693
billion) at the end of June, is about the size of the entire
banking system in Greece and larger than the combined assets of
financial institutions bailed out in Ireland in the last 2 1/2
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
