Talks between  Georgia  and Russia on
the Russian bid to join the  World Trade Organization  made no
progress at the latest meeting in Geneva, said Georgian Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergi Kapanadze.  Switzerland in March started mediating negotiations between
Russia and Georgia, which fought a five-day war in 2008 over the
breakaway Georgian region of  South Ossetia . Georgia has cited
disputes over customs checkpoints in South Ossetia and another
breakaway region, Abkhazia, as reasons to withhold its approval
for Russian WTO membership.  “We traveled there ready to talk about what kind of
monitoring there should be on the borders,” Kapanadze said late
yesterday by phone from Geneva, after two days of talks. “Sadly
Russia did not wish to talk about this, and if Russia continues
this attitude then there is no point to continue talks this
year.”  Russia, the largest economy outside the WTO, has been
seeking to join the Geneva-based trade arbiter since June 1993,
surpassing the 15 years  China  had to wait before becoming a
member. While talks with the U.S. and the European Union on
Russia’s entry are close to finalization, its southern neighbor
Georgia, already a member, has blocked its accession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
