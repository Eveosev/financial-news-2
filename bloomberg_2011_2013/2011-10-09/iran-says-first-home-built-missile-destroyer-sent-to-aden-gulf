Iran’s first domestically produced
guided-missile destroyer has been sent to the  Gulf of Aden  to
provide security to vessels in the area, a top Iranian navy
commander said.  “The presence of Iran’s navy is not only to counter piracy
but also to display Iran’s flag in the  Indian Ocean  as there are
currently around 25 countries pursuing their interests in the
region,” Iranian Navy Commander Habibollah Sayyari was quoted
as saying by the official  Islamic Republic News Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
