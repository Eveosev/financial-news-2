Officials from the  National
Basketball Association  and its players’ union will meet tonight
in an attempt to reach an agreement on a new labor contract and
avoid the cancelation of the first two weeks of the season, the
New York Times reported.  The meeting will involve the primary negotiators for each
side -- Commissioner David Stern and Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver for the league, with the union represented by its
President, Derek Fisher, and its Executive Director,  Billy Hunter , the newspaper said, citing an unidentified person
briefed on the meeting.  Stern said last week he’ll cancel the first two weeks of
the season tomorrow in the absence of progress. Play is
scheduled to begin Nov. 1.  The NBA locked out its players July 1 when their previous
six-year labor contract expired.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
