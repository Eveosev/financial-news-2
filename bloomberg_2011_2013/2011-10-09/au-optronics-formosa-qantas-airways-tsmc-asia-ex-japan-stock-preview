Stock symbols are in parentheses and share prices are from the
previous close, unless noted otherwise.  AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  (2409 TT): Taiwan’s second-largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays posted third-quarter sales that
missed analysts’ estimates after shipments climbed less than
expected. Third-quarter revenue was NT$98.9 billion ($3.2
billion), the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in an e-mailed
statement, less than the NT$106 billion average of 20 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares climbed 0.8 percent
to NT$12.30.  Fairfax Media Ltd. (FXJ)  : Fairfax said it agreed to sell
its regional radio assets to Grant Broadcasters. The transaction
should be completed later this month, Fairfax said in a
statement. Financial terms weren’t disclosed. Fairfax rose 2.9
percent to 89.5 Australian cents.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  (6505 TT): The oil refiner will
shut three units at its  oil refinery  in Taiwan for maintenance
in December, company spokesman Lin Keh-Yen said by telephone.
Formosa plans to close its 180,000-barrel-a-day No. 2 crude
distillation unit, a vacuum distillation plant with a capacity
of 80,000 barrels a day and a hydrotreater system capable of
processing 52,000 barrels of vacuum gasoil, Lin said. They will
be closed for 40 days starting in early December. The shares
advanced 2.9 percent to NT$90.  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  : More than 11,000 Qantas
passengers face delays and canceled flights today as engineers
hold four-hour strikes in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney. Qantas
will cancel 40 flights, delay 24 flights by as much as 3.5 hours
and bring forward 14 flights because of the strikes by the
engineers’ union, the company said in an e-mailed statement.
Qantas climbed 3.5 percent to A$1.495.  Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330 TT): The
world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips posted third-
quarter revenue that beat its own guidance and analyst estimates
because of rush orders. September consolidated revenue was
NT$33.4 billion, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in a
statement. That takes sales for the quarter to NT$106.5 billion,
surpassing the NT$105.8 billion average of 20 analyst estimates,
according to Bloomberg data. The stock added 0.1 percent to
NT$69.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
