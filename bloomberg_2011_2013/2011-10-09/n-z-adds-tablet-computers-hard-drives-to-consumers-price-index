New Zealand  added tablet computers,
external hard drives and flatbread in a three-yearly review of
the consumers price index, its primary inflation measure.  Electronic book readers and flatbread also joined the
index,  Statistics New Zealand  said in an e-mailed statement. Gas
heaters, dictionaries and envelopes have been removed.  The review is based on the Household Economic Survey,
conducted between June 2009 and June 2010, immediately after the
economy came out of recession, the statistics agency said. As a
result there were decreases in the relative importance of
furniture, cars, household appliances, real estate services and
home purchases, while food, electricity and house rentals became
more important, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
