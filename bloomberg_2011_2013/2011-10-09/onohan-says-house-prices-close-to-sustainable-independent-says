Irish Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said house prices are now close to “sustainable,” the
 Sunday Independent  reported, citing comments in a documentary to
be aired by Dublin-based RTE tomorrow.  “Banks will lend when both they and the borrowers and the
purchasers of houses are confident that they’re getting the
house at a fair, sustainable price, and I think we’re getting
close to that point,” Honohan said, according to the newspaper.  While the Central Statistics Office said Sept. 26 that
house prices have fallen 43 percent from their 2007 peak,
economist Dermot O’Leary at  Goodbody Stockbrokers  says official
prices lag behind market activity. Bank of Ireland Plc and
Allied Irish Banks Plc each assume a 55 percent peak-to-trough
decline in  house prices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
