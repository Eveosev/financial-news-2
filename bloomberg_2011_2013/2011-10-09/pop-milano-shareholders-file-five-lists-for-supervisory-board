Shareholders of  Banca Popolare di
Milano Scarl (PMI)  filed 5 lists of candidates for the new supervisory
board, the oldest Italian cooperative bank said.  Investors will vote on the candidates at a meeting on Oct.
22, the bank said in a regulatory statement late last night.  Pop. Milano approved last month the replacement of its
single board with supervisory and management panels after the
 Bank of Italy  requested the lender to limit the influence of
unions on decisions. The five members of the management board,
which will be responsible for bank strategy, will be appointed
by the new 17-member supervisory panel.  On Oct. 7 Pop. Milano said that the central bank wanted “a
complete renewal of corporate structure, with high profile
choices in clear break with the past, as a pre-requisite of an
effective change in the group’s management.” The lender is
selling assets and cutting costs after the central bank urged
Pop. Milano to bolster capital.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
