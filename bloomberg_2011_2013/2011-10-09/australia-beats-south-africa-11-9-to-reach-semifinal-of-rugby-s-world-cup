Australia beat defending champion
South Africa 11-9 to reach the Rugby World Cup semifinals for
the fifth time.  Wallabies captain  James Horwill  scored the only try and
 James O’Connor  kicked two penalties for Australia at Wellington
Regional Stadium. South Africa’s points came through the boot of
Morne Steyn.  Australia, seeking an unprecedented third world title after
lifting the Webb Ellis Cup in 1991 and 1999, will face the
winner of today’s last quarterfinal between top-ranked New
Zealand and Argentina in the final four.  France defeated England yesterday to set up a semifinal
clash against Wales on Oct. 15 in Auckland. The final is
scheduled Oct. 23 at Eden Park.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
