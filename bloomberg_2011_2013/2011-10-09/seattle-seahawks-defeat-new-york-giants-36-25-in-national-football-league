The  New England Patriots  beat the
New York Jets 30-21 to send their division rivals to a third
straight loss, while the  New York Giants  had a three-game win
streak halted and the  Green Bay Packers  remained undefeated.  BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushed for a career-high 136 yards
and two touchdowns and Tom Brady passed for 321 yards and
another score yesterday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough,
 Massachusetts . The Patriots improved to 4-1 on the National
Football League season and the Jets slumped to 2-3, with all
three losses coming on their three-game road trip.  “I never thought I would be here, losing three straight,
but that’s where we are at right now,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said
at a news conference. “We’ve got to get better.”  Mark Sanchez threw two touchdown passes for New York, which
didn’t have any turnovers for the first time this season, yet
was outgained 446-255 in total yards.  The Seattle Seahawks scored two touchdowns in the final
three minutes to stun the Giants 36-25 in East Rutherford,  New
Jersey , and snap a seven-game road losing skid.  Charlie Whitehurst took over at quarterback for Seattle
after an injury to  Tarvaris Jackson  and threw a 27-yard
touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin with 2:37 left to give the
Seahawks a 29-25 lead.  The Giants drove to the Seattle 10-yard line before  Eli Manning , who passed for 420 yards, had his third interception of
the game returned 94 yards by  Seattle ’s Brandon Browner for a
clinching touchdown with 1:08 left.  “It kind of came down to the one play at the end,”
Manning said. “It’s a shame to lose a game with that type of
play. I’d kind of rather get outplayed.”  The Giants fell to 3-2 and Seahawks improved to 2-3.  Packers Stay Perfect  The Super Bowl-champion Packers beat the Atlanta Falcons
25-14 last night after erasing a 14-0 first-half deficit.  Aaron Rodgers  passed for 396 yards and two touchdowns as the Packers
improved to 5-0 and dropped the Falcons to 2-3.  Week 5 play concludes tonight with the Chicago Bears (2-2)
visiting the unbeaten Detroit Lions, who are looking to go 5-0
for the first time since they began 6-0 in 1956.  The San Francisco 49ers won their third straight and
improved to 4-1 with a 48-3 rout of  Tampa Bay  (3-2). Alex Smith
threw three touchdown passes, including two to Vernon Davis, and
Frank Gore rushed for 125 yards and a score.  In a matchup between former Eagles quarterbacks Donovan McNabb and  Kevin Kolb , the Minnesota Vikings beat the Arizona
Cardinals 34-10.  Adrian Peterson scored three first-half touchdowns and
McNabb added a 4-yard scoring run as the Vikings won for the
first time to improve to 1-4 and avoid matching their worst
start to a season, set in 1962. The Cardinals dropped to 1-4
with their fourth straight defeat.  Colts Stay Winless  The Indianapolis Colts are 0-5 for the first time since
1997 after blowing a 24-7 lead in a 28-24 home loss to the
 Kansas City Chiefs . The Chiefs improved to 2-3 with their second
victory in a row and became the seventh team this season to win
after trailing by at least 17 points. It’s the most through the
first five weeks of any NFL season in history.  Quarterback Michael Vick threw four interceptions as the
 Philadelphia Eagles  lost 31-24 to the Buffalo Bills, who
recovered from their first defeat last week. Philadelphia falls
to 1-4 after losing a fourth straight game for the first time
since Nov. 20, 2005, while the Bills move to 4-1.  Drew Brees threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Thomas
with 50 seconds remaining to give the New Orleans Saints a
fourth consecutive victory, 30-27 against the Carolina Panthers,
who have now lost two in a row.  Panthers rookie quarterback Cam Newton threw for two
touchdowns and ran for another as Carolina (1-4) rallied to lead
27-23 with 12:43 to play at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte,
North Carolina.  5 Touchdown Passes  The Pittsburgh Steelers won 38-17 at home to snap the
Tennessee Titans’ three-game winning streak. Pittsburgh
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, playing with a sprained left
foot, threw five touchdown passes at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.  The  Oakland Raiders  held off the Houston Texans 25-20, a
day after announcing the death of owner Al Davis at 82. Both
teams have 3-2 records.  The San Diego Chargers withstood a fourth-quarter rally by
the Denver Broncos and backup quarterback  Tim Tebow , holding on
for a 29-24 win in Denver. The Chargers are 4-1 for the first
time since 2002, while Denver is 1-4 and has lost three straight.  The Cincinnati Bengals, who last week handed the Bills
their first defeat of the season, downed Jacksonville 30-20 to
improve to 3-2 for the season and drop the Jaguars to 1-4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
