Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co., a unit
of  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , said third-quarter profit
doubled on higher product prices, beating analysts’ estimates.  Net income surged to 1.21 billion riyals ($323 million)
from 604 million riyals a year ago, the Jubail-based company
known as Safco said in a  statement  to the Saudi bourse today.
The median estimate of three analysts was for a profit of 954
million riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Safco, 43 percent owned by Saudi Basic Industries, is
gaining from strong demand for fertilizers and petrochemicals in
Asian countries as oil traded about $90 a barrel in the third
quarter.  Saudi Arabia  is the holder of the world’s largest oil
reserves and demand for Saudi petrochemicals has been strong
this year, especially in Asia.  Profit increased as prices of the company’s products rose
in global markets,  Safco (SAFCO)  said in the statement. Third-quarter
operating income rose 98 percent to 1.1 billion riyals.  The shares have gained 16 percent this year compared with a
8.1 percent decline in the benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index. (SASEIDX) 
The stock rose 1.4 percent to 186 riyals yesterday, giving the
company a market value of 46.5 billion riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
