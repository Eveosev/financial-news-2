Glencore International Plc may
provide a debt facility for PT Bakrie & Brothers Tbk to help it
maintain a 47 percent stake in Bumi Plc, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Glencore may provide funding after Indonesian coal producer
Bumiâ€™s share price slumped, triggering repayment clauses on a
$1.3 billion loan to the Bakrie brothers by Credit Suisse AG
which is secured on their stock, the newspaper said. Glencore is
not interested in taking an equity stake in Bumi, according to
the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
