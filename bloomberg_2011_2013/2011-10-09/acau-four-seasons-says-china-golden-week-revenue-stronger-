Sands China Ltd. (1928) ’s Four Seasons Hotel
Macao said revenue during China’s week-long National Day holiday
was higher this year as an increase in visitors allowed the
hotelier to raise room rates in the gambling center.  Occupancy at the hotel in Macau’s Cotai Strip was “pretty
much” 100 percent during the so-called “Golden Week” holiday,
Julius Santos, the hotel’s director of marketing, said in a
phone interview today. He declined to give details on the
increase in visitors or room charges.  More tourists visited Macau during this year’s National
Week holiday than a year earlier, and the average length of stay
was longer, Santos said. Rivals including Wynn Macau Ltd. and
Mandarin Oriental last week reported full bookings for their
properties in Macau, the only place in  China  where casinos are
legal. Macau, neighboring Hong Kong, was handed back to China by
former colonial ruler Portugal in 1999.  “Business was definitely stronger,” Santos said. “The
majority of the city was booked up during Golden Week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
