U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will study results tomorrow of a probe into whether Defence
Secretary  Liam Fox  broke the ministerial code by allowing access
to his department by a former flatmate.  Fox today apologized for the way he had handled his
relationship with businessman Adam Werritty, who was best man at
his wedding. U.K. media, including the  Guardian newspaper , have
reported that Werritty presented himself as an adviser to the
defense chief, joined him on trips abroad and met with him 14
times in his office in the past year despite not being on the
government payroll or having any security clearance.  The Defense Secretary has denied any wrong doing and two
days ago asked his department’s top civil servant to conduct a
review. Cameron yesterday asked Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell
to report his conclusions on that report’s initial findings
tomorrow, the prime minister’s office said in a statement.  “I accept that mistakes were made, and I should not have
allowed the impression of wrongdoing to arise, and I’m very
sorry for that,” Fox told the BBC today. He said “the right
thing” was for the investigation to “run its course.”  If Fox, 50, resigns because of the links it would force
Cameron to reshuffle his Cabinet for the first time since the
May 2010 departure of Chief Secretary to the Treasury  David Laws .  To contact the reporter on this story:
