More than 3,000 people in  Hong Kong 
rallied to protest the appointment of Stephen Lam as chief
secretary,  Radio Television Hong Kong   reported , citing the
organizer of the demonstration.  Protesters marched on the government’s headquarters during
today’s rally, called by the Civil Human Rights Front, the Hong
Kong public-service broadcaster reported. Police estimated 1,200
people took part, RTHK said.  Lam scored the lowest-ever approval rating for a chief
secretary, according to a survey by the University of Hong Kong.
Formerly the secretary for constitutional affairs, Lam delayed
plans to reform laws on by-elections in July after public
protests. He was was promoted to the second-most senior role in
the government last month to replace Henry Tang.  “I notice that there are different views about my new
appointment as the chief secretary,” Lam said in a statement on
the government’s website today. “I shall take heed of people’s
opinions and strive to better communicate and cooperate with
different political parties.”  Lam had a support rating of 38.5, compared with 48.6 for
Tang before he left office, the University of Hong Kong’s Public
Opinion Programme said on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
