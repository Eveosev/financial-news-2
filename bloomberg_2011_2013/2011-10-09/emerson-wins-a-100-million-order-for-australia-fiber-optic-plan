Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) , a U.S. maker
of electrical products, said it won a A$100 million ($98
million) order to build facilities that form part of Australia’s
national optical fiber network.  Emerson will supply technology including power systems and
cooling to NBN Co., the St. Louis-based company said in an e-
mailed statement. NBN, formed by the Australian government to
build the A$36 billion telecommunications network, aims to
connect all residents to high-speed Internet in the nation’s
biggest-ever infrastructure project.  Emerson’s network power division, which won the deal,
competes with companies including France’s  Schneider Electric SA (SU) 
for systems used in communications networks and data centers.  NBN will lay fiber optical lines to 93 percent of the
population by 2018. The rest of the country will be served by
wireless and satellite connections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
