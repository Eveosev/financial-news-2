Britons’ confidence in the outlook
for employment fell for a third straight month in September to
its lowest since February, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets said.  An index of consumer sentiment about hiring prospects fell
1 point to minus 67 from August, taking its decline over the
third quarter to 17 points, the unit of Lloyds Banking
Group Plc said in an e-mailed statement in  London  today. A
measure of  job security  was unchanged at minus 21.  Lloyds economists Hann-Ju Ho and Jonathan Thomas said the
data point to further declines in the internationally agreed
measure of U.K. employment, which dropped by 69,000 between May
and July to 29.2 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
