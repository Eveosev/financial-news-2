Israeli foodmakers  Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS) 
and  Osem Investments Ltd. (OSEM)  slid as the cabinet adopted a
government panelâ€™s recommendations to lower the cost of living
by raising imports and boosting competition.  Strauss shares retreated 2.1 percent to 43.28 shekels at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Osem fell to its lowest level
since Sept. 19, dropping 2.7 percent to 49.73 shekels.  The panel was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in response to protests over the cost of living.
Strauss, which derives about a fifth of its revenue from dairy
products, last week lowered the price of some milk products by
12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
