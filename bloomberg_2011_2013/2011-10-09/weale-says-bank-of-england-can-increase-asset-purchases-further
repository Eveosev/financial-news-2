Bank of England policy maker  Martin Weale  said the central bank has “a lot of scope” to increase
asset purchases further to boost economic growth.  “There is quite a lot of scope for further quantitative
easing,” Weale said in an interview on  Sky News  today. “There
is quite a lot more than can be done.”  The U.K. central bank last week raised the ceiling for its
asset purchases, or so-called quantitative easing, to 275
billion pounds ($428 billion) from 200 billion pounds. Governor
 Mervyn King  said the move, the first loosening of U.K. monetary
policy since the depths of the recession in 2009, was a response
to what may be the worst financial crisis ever.  Asked if he agreed with King’s description, Weale said
there are similarities to the 1930s and the economic situation
is “very difficult.” He cautioned that central banks can’t
“resolve” all the world’s economic woes.  Still, “the case for support has grown in the autumn as
the financial situation has appeared to deteriorate,” Weale
said. “What we have seen since the summer is a sharp
deterioration in Britain’s economic prospects.”  Weale said  Bank of England  studies suggested the asset
buying does support the economy and he has not seen a
“convincing” argument that it only serves to bolster inflation
rather than growth.  As recently as July, Weale sought higher  interest rates  to
quell inflation, which was 4.5 percent in August, more than
double the Bank of England’s target.  While inflation is still likely to pass 5 percent, he said
today the prospect of price pressures in two to three years is
now “less worrying than I had thought” and “that justifies a
slacker policy.”  Britain’s economy grew less than initially estimated in the
second quarter, with gross domestic product rising 0.1 percent
rather than the initial estimate of 0.2 percent, data last week
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
