European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the European Union is convinced that a Greek
default would be more costly than the current bailout efforts,
 Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  The consequences of a  Greece ’s government defaulting on its
debt would be “incalculable” and there is a “large risk”
that the crisis would spread to other euro countries, Barroso
was quoted as saying.  Greece needs to speed up its reforms if it doesn’t want to
lose its credibility, he said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
