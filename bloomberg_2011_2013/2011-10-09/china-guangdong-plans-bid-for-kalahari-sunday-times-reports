China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group
Co. is preparing a 650 million-pound bid for  Kalahari Minerals
Plc (KAH) , a U.K.-based uranium miner,  the Sunday Times  reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  China Guangdong has reopened talks with Kalahari over a 270
pence-a-share bid after withdrawing an offer of 290 pence-a-
share made in March because of the crisis at  Japan ’s Fukushima
nuclear plant, according to the newspaper.  The Chinese company is being advised by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
while Kalahari has hired Ambrian Partners Ltd., the Sunday Times
said. An agreed transaction could be announced as soon as this
week, according to the newspaper.  Tony Friend, an outside spokesman for Guangdong Nuclear
with College Hill in London, said he couldn’t comment on the
report. Officials at Kalahari Minerals couldn’t be reached for
comment when called outside office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
