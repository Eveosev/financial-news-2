Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp. said its
12.5 percent-owned East Mediterranean Gas SAE filed a request
for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce after
repeated interruptions of gas supply from Egyptian suppliers.  EMG is seeking compensation from Egyptian General Petroleum
Corp. and Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. for damages incurred
as a result of contractual breaches and is asking the
international tribunal to order the Egyptian companies to meet
their obligations, Ampal said today in a statement filed with
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  “Ampal, as well as other international shareholders, are
determined to pursue every available avenue to secure the smooth
operation of EMG,” Ampal Chairman Yosef Maiman said in the
statement. “We will continue to take all necessary action to
protect our investments.”  Shipments to  Israel , which relies on  Egypt  for 40 percent
of its gas needs, were halted in July following an attack on the
pipeline network in Egypt’s northern Sinai desert. The network,
which includes a branch to Jordan, Lebanon and  Syria , has been
attacked six times since a popular uprising toppled Egypt’s
former President  Hosni Mubarak .  An official at Egyptian Natural Gas, also known as EGAS,
had no comment when asked by Bloomberg News what its response to
the arbitration would be, according to an e-mail.  Ampal and other shareholders of EMG also have taken the
formal steps required to initiate international arbitration
procedures against Egypt under several bilateral treaties for
the protection of investments, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
