Arsenal and Liverpool will compete to
sign forward Salomon Kalou from their Premier League soccer
rival Chelsea in Januaryâ€™s transfer window, the Sunday Mirror
reported.  Kalou, 26, is in the final year of his contract and talks
over a new deal have been put on hold, the Mirror said, without
citing anyone.  Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  is ready to offer 6 million
pounds ($9.3 million) in January, but faces competition from
Liverpool, the newspaper reported.   Kalou has struggled to command a regular spot at Chelsea
this season, starting only three games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
