Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  won’t bid for
 Lebara Group , a London-based mobile virtual network operator
whose owners are seeking 650 million pounds ($1.01 billion) for
the company,  the Observer  reported, citing an unidentified
person.  The sale has attracted about 20 expressions of interest
from European, Indian and African companies, including T-Mobile
and Royal KPN NV, according to the newspaper. Vodafone decided
not to bid for Lebara because its founders plan to leave the
company after its sale, the Observer said.  The sale process, conducted by the  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS) , is continuing, an unidentified Lebara press official
told the newspaper, declining to comment on the bidders.
Officials at Vodafone declined to comment, the Observer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
