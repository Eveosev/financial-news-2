Diageo Plc (DGE) ’s Chief Executive Officer
 Paul Walsh  is seen as a leading candidate to replace Unilever’s
Chairman Michael Treschow, the Sunday Times reported, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Walsh, who is a non-executive director at London- and
Rotterdam-based Unilever, the world’s second-biggest consumer-
goods company, is seen as the “internal candidate” to take
over from Treschow when he steps down, the newspaper said.
Treschow, however, is not expected to relinquish his role for at
least two years, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
