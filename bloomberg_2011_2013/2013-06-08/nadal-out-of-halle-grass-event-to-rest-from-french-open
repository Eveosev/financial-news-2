Rafael Nadal  has withdrawn from next
week’s grass-court tournament in Halle, Germany, to rest.  Nadal told organizers of the Gerry Weber Open this morning
he won’t be playing at the Wimbledon warm-up event in order to
recover from the French Open, where he meets fellow Spaniard
 David Ferrer  in tomorrow’s final.  Nadal, 27, yesterday beat top-ranked Novak Djokovic of
Serbia in a five-set semifinal match in Paris that lasted almost
five hours.  “After these past months and all the matches I have been
able to play, my doctors have recommended to rest after Roland
Garros,” Nadal said in on the tournament’s  website .  Wildcard Mischa Zverev of Germany will replace Nadal in the
tournament, which begins in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
