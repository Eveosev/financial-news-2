(Corrects third paragraph to show foam was applied to
tarmac after landing.)  An Airbus A320 jet with 165
passengers and six crew members aboard made an emergency landing
at  Rome ’s  Leonardo da Vinci airport  after landing gear failed to
deploy, Wizz Air Ltd., the flight’s operator, said.  No injuries were reported on flight W6 3141 from Bucharest,
Budapest-based Wizz Air said today in an e-mailed  statement . The
flight, diverted from Ciampino airport, landed at 8:15 a.m. and
exit slides were used to evacuate the passengers.  The jet coasted to a stop on the tarmac with one of its
underwing engines scraping against the landing strip, RAINews
reported, citing interviews with airport security officers.
Firefighters applied foam to the area after the landing,
according to the RAINews report.  “Wizz Air and Airbus are cooperating with the authorities
in the investigation of this landing gear failure,” Wizz Air
said in the statement. “Wizz Air sincerely apologized to all
affected passengers.”  Airbus SAS is owned by Blagnac, France-based European
Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co.  Medical attention was given to passengers suspected of
suffering stress, the airline said. RAINews said four passengers
were taken to the hospital for shock.  The airplane is 13 months old, and its last scheduled
maintenance was carried out by  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s Technik
unit, Wizz Air said. The pilot has accumulated 12,000 flight
hours with the Italian  air force  and commercial airlines, Wizz
Air said. The crew and both pilots are based in Bucharest, the
airline said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
