Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a rising
star in the Democratic party, said on his  website  that he’ll run
for the seat left open by the death of New Jersey’s five-term
U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg.  “There are those who say  Washington  is a lost cause, that
the system is broken,” Booker said on his website. “But I
believe that people who care can find solutions to even the most
difficult challenges.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
