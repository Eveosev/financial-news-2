Serena Williams  came back to win the
first set of her French Open final 6-4 against defending
champion  Maria Sharapova .  Sharapova won the first two games of the match, before
losing the next four on the main Court Philippe Chatrier at
 Roland Garros  in Paris. Sharapova held her serve to make it 4-3
and then broke the American when Williams hit a forehand long to
even the match.  Williams broke right back, winning a 20-shot rally to go up
30-15 and then took the game with a forehand into the corner.
She held her serve to win the set.  The second-seeded Sharapova hasnâ€™t defeated the American
since 2004, when she beat her at Wimbledon and later that year
in the season-ending WTA Championships. Until today, Williams
had won all of their 12 matches in the past nine years,
including a 6-0, 6-1 defeat in the gold medal match at the
London Olympics.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
