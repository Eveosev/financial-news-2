German government bonds dropped for a
third week as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said
the region’s economy should return to growth later this year,
damping demand for fixed-income assets.  Spanish and Italian securities fell for a fifth week as
Draghi also said after the ECB’s monthly policy meeting that he
saw no reason for any “immediate” additional measures to lower
borrowing costs. Portuguese bonds slumped, with 10-year yields
rising the most this week since July. U.S. Treasury  10-year
yields (USGG10YR)  climbed to the highest since April 2012 last month as
signs the world’s biggest economy is improving reduced the
allure of the safest securities.  “The ECB was much less dovish than what the market was
hoping for,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit Global Research in Milan. “Bond yields
in the euro region and in the U.S. are rising for the same
reason. Investors are contemplating the world where central
banks gradually turn off the liquidity tap.”  Germany ’s benchmark 10-year yield rose four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 1.55 percent after
increasing to 1.57 percent on June 3, the highest level since
Feb. 25. The 1.5 percent bund maturing in May 2023 fell 0.375,
or 3.75 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,322) face amount, to 99.58.  The ECB left its  main refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.5
percent on June 6 after reducing it by a quarter point last
month. The central bank lowered its forecast for the euro area’s
economy to show contraction of 0.6 percent this year from an
estimate of minus 0.5 percent made in March, while raising their
projection for next year to 1.1 percent from 1 percent.  ‘Should Stabilize’  “Euro-area economic activity should stabilize and recover
in the course of the year, albeit at a subdued pace,” Draghi
said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  after the policy
meeting. “We have a range of different instruments,” he said,
while adding that economic data since the previous meeting “were
not enough to grant immediate action.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  climbed 11 basis points this week to
4.55 percent, while Italy’s increased three basis points to 4.19
percent.  Portugal ’s 10-year rate jumped 53 basis points to 6.14
percent after rising to 6.31 percent yesterday, the highest
level since April 15.  U.S. employers added 175,000 workers last month after a
revised 149,000 increase in April, the Labor Department said
yesterday in  Washington . The number keeps alive speculation the
Federal Reserve will slow its bond-buying program.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 0.8
percent this year through June 6, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes. Italian bonds returned 2.7 percent and Spanish
securities gained 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
