Treasuries dropped for a sixth
straight week, the longest stretch of losses in four years, as
U.S. payrolls swelled while the jobless rate rose, keeping alive
bets the  Federal Reserve  will cut back on monetary stimulus.  A measure of Treasuries  volatility  climbed to the highest
in a year as investors weighed whether the central bank will
slow its bond buying under quantitative easing as the economy
improves. Ten- and 30-year yields approached 14-month highs. The
U.S. will auction $66 billion in notes and bonds next week.  “A lot of people are still expecting the Fed to start
talking about tapering in the near to intermediate term, but
there is still a lot of uncertainty,” said  Jay Mueller , who
manages about $3 billion of bonds at Wells Capital Management in
 Milwaukee . “There has been nothing that clearly points to an
acceleration or a slowdown in the Fed’s easing schedule just
yet, which means more uncertainty until we get more news.”  The benchmark  10-year note  yield rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.17 percent this week in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 1.75
percent security due in May 2023 fell 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000
face amount, to 96 1/4. The longest losing streak before this
ended on May 8, 2009, after yields increased for seven weeks.  Thirty-year bond  yields added six basis points to 3.33
percent in their sixth consecutive advance, the longest since
six weeks ended May 8, 2009.  Net Long  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
bets and wagered that 10- and 30-year Treasuries prices will
increase, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative long positions, or bets on a rise, on 10-year
notes outnumbered short positions by 19,684 contracts on the
Chicago Board of Trade in the week ended June 4. Last week,
traders were net-short 35,505 contracts.  On 30-year bonds, longs outnumbered shorts by 2,369
contracts. Traders were net-short 27,251 contracts last week.  Payrolls swelled by 175,000 jobs in May after a revised
149,000 increase in April, Labor Department data showed
yesterday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a
gain of 163,000. The  unemployment rate  rose to 7.6 percent from
7.5 percent, the lowest since December 2008, as more people
entered the  labor force .  U.S. employers added an average of 179,000 jobs a month to
payrolls in 2011 and 2012, according to Labor Department data.  U.S. Auctions  The Treasury will auction $32 billion in three-year notes
on June 11, $21 billion in 10-year debt the next day and $13
billion in 30-year bonds on June 13.  “With inflation low and the jobs number average, tapering
is not certain to be on the front burner, but it will probably
still happen at some point this year,” said Tom Tucci, managing
director and head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World
Markets Corp. “From here, it will be interesting to see if
these higher yield levels will attract buyers at next week’s
supply.”  The  consumer price index  increased 1.1 percent in April
from a year earlier. The Fed’s target is 2 percent.  Volatility in U.S. bonds as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index climbed to 84.8 on June 6, the highest
since June 2012. It averaged 62.4 over the past year.  Treasuries have lost 1.7 percent since the end of April,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, amid
speculation the Fed will taper its purchases. The U.S. central
bank, which next meets June 18-19, buys $85 billion of
government and mortgage securities each month to hold down
borrowing costs and spur economic growth.  Could Cut  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress May 22 policy
makers could cut the pace if the U.S. employment outlook shows a
sustainable improvement. He also said tightening policy too soon
would endanger the recovery.  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said
the Fed is unlikely to reduce asset purchases after the
 unemployment rate  climbed from a four-year low and the jobs data
showed hourly earnings were little changed at $23.89 in May from
the previous month.  “I don’t think today’s report says anything about tapering
at all,” Gross, co-founder and co-chief investment officer of
Pacific Investment Management Co., said yesterday in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and  Mike McKee . Bernanke “won’t taper. But I think ultimately in order
to get a more normal economy, the Fed has got to move  interest
rates  up to more normal levels.”  Reduction Forecast  The central bank will reduce its buying to $65 billion a
month at the Oct. 29-30 meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee , according to the median estimate in a survey of 59
economists this week. In a similar poll before the Fed’s April
30-May 1 meeting, economists expected it to cut purchases to $50
billion in the fourth quarter.  Treasuries due in a decade or more are at almost the
cheapest level since July 2011 relative to global peers with
comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Yields on  U.S. debt  were 50 basis points higher
than those in an index of other sovereign debt on June 6. Yields
climbed to 60 basis points in the two trading days ending June
3, the cheapest in almost two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
