A bus fire in the southeastern
Chinese city of Xiamen that killed at least 47 was not an
accident and was likely caused by a criminal act, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Police found evidence of gasoline even though the bus uses
diesel as fuel, Xinhua  reported , citing initial findings from
investigators. The fire, which took place at about 6:30 p.m.
yesterday, injured 34.  “According to on-site checks and findings by relevant
experts and the local police, the bus’s tires and fuel tank were
in complete form when the fire took place,” Xinhua reported,
citing a statement from the local government of Xiamen.
“Therefore, it can be ruled out that it’s a safety accident.
Initial findings conclude that it is a serious criminal case.”  Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun is in Xiamen to
lead a State Council team overseeing the investigation, with
instructions from President Xi Jinping and Premier  Li Keqiang ,
Xinhua said.  The deadly incident happened just days after another fire
in a poultry plant in the northeastern province of Jilin killed
120 people. Xiamen, a city on the west side of the  Taiwan
Strait , is a key port linking the mainland to  Taiwan  and a
tourist destination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
