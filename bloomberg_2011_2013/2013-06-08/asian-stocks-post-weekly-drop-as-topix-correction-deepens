Asian  stocks  fell for a third week,
with the regional benchmark index posting its biggest weekly
drop since May 2012, as the correction in Japanese shares
deepened after the yen surged and speculation grew that the
 Federal Reserve  may scale back stimulus.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a Japanese carmaker that gets about 73
percent of revenue from overseas, tumbled 16 percent, leading
Japanese exporters lower as a stronger yen crimped their
earnings outlook. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s biggest
smartphone maker, sank 7.2 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
cut profit estimates. Newcrest Mining Ltd.,  Australia ’s gold
biggest producer, slumped 15 percent after saying it will write
down the value of its mines after a slump in bullion prices.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 3.3 percent this week
to 130.37, 9.7 percent below this year’s high on May 20.
Japanese stocks extended losses for a third week as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth strategy failed to impress
investors and as mixed economic data from the U.S. added to
concerns the recovery will stall if there is a premature
withdrawal of stimulus. June futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average rose 4.1 percent, the most in two months, in  Chicago ,
signaling shares may surge June 10 in  Tokyo .  “It’s not that we’ve seen a dramatic shift in the Fed’s
exit discussion, but investors are using it as an excuse to
sell,” said Masahiko Ejiri, a Tokyo-based senior  fund manager 
at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$34 billion in assets. “Some long positions are being unwound
after the market rallied so fast.”  Buying Opportunity?  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is still up 0.8 percent this
year after the sell-off in the past three weeks. Shares on the
gauge  traded  at 12.6 times average estimated earnings yesterday,
compared with multiples of 15 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 13 for the Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s  Topix index  slumped 6.9 percent this week, the
biggest weekly drop since March 18, 2011 in the aftermath of
record earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 6.5 percent. Both gauges have
dropped more than 17 percent from their recent high on May 22,
close to the 20 percent threshold that some investors consider a
 bear market .  The country’s Government Pension Investment Fund, the
world’s biggest manager of retirement savings with 112 trillion
yen ($1.16 trillion) of assets, said after the market closed
yesterday that it will reduce its holdings of local bonds and
buy shares.  “The GPIF news could be used as a reason to buy shares,”
said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based fund manager at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $33 billion. “A lot of
investors think that stocks have fallen to such a low level that
it’s in a situation where buying resumes.”  Conflicting Signs  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index decreased 3.8 percent, while
 New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index lost 1.6 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi
Index slipped 3.9 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex index fell 1.9 percent.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 3.9 percent this
week as official and private reports on China’s factory activity
offered conflicting views of the economy. A report released by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics on June 3 showed a
contraction, while the official measure, released by the
government on June 1 indicated expansion.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index sank 3.7 percent, the biggest
weekly drop since May 2012, after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its
rating to underweight from overweight. Equities in the city,
whose currency is pegged to the  U.S. dollar , are most vulnerable
should the Federal Reserve start tightening monetary policy,
 Michael Kurtz , Nomura’s Hong Kong-based head of global equity
wrote in a note on June 6.  Exporters Drop  Japanese exporters dropped as the yen posted its biggest
weekly advance since October 2008. A stronger currency reduces
the overseas income of Japanese carmakers and electronics
manufacturers when repatriated.  Mazda tumbled 16 percent to 340 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
the world’s biggest carmaker, declined 8.8 percent to 5,480 yen
 Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese exporter of consumer electronics that
generates about 68 percent of its sales overseas, fell 9.5
percent to 1,854 yen.  Japanese brokerages slumped this week amid concern the
retreat in the nation’s stockmarket would crimp profits. Nomura,
Japan’s biggest brokerage, sank 9.8 percent to 712 yen. Daiwa
Securities Group Inc., the second-largest, fell 6.6 percent to
801 yen.  Samsung, Newcrest  Samsung Electronics slumped 7.2 percent to 1.427 million in
 Seoul  after analysts at JPMorgan cut profit estimates, citing
slowing demand for its flagship Galaxy S4.  Newcrest dropped 15 percent to A$12.35 in Sydney. The
company may write down the value of its mines by as much as A$6
billion ($5.7 billion) after a slump in  gold prices .  Cochlear Ltd. slumped 14 percent to A$55.65 after the maker
of hearing aid implants said sales were weaker in the second
half.  Hong Kong developers declined after a report on June 4
showed the number of home transactions in the city fell for a
third straight month in May. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the
biggest homebuilder in the Chinese territory, slid 4 percent to
HK$99.10. Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd., the real estate company
partly owned by billionaire  Li Ka-shing , sank 5.4 percent to
HK$103.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
