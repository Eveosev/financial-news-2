Warren Buffett ’s annual lunch
auction, a fundraiser for San Francisco’s Glide Foundation,
raised about $1 million, less than a third of last year’s total.  The event drew 106 bids from 8 people, according to EBay
Inc.’s website. The winner, who wasn’t immediately identified,
and seven companions get to dine with Buffett at the Smith &
Wollensky steakhouse in  New York .  Buffett, 82, the world’s third-richest man, has promised to
donate his fortune to charity and has sought similar commitments
from other billionaires under the  Giving Pledge  campaign. He has
helped raise $15 million for Glide with his lunch auctions,
including last year’s winning bid of $3.46 million.  Glide Lunch With Warren Buffett Results:
