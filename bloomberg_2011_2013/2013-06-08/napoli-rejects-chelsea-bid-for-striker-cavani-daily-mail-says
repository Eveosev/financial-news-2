Chelsea will make an improved bid for
Napoli striker Edinson Cavani after having its opening offer
rejected yesterday, the  Daily Mail  said.  The Blues’ offer of 40 million pounds ($62 million) plus
goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was on loan at Atletico Madrid
last season, was turned down by Napoli President Aurelio de
Laurentiis, who told Chelsea he won’t sell Cavani for less than
the 53 million pound release clause in his contract, the Mail
said.  Talks between the clubs will continue this weekend and
there were indications Chelsea may consider including striker
 Fernando Torres  in a deal, the Mail said. Should the Blues meet
the release clause, the fee would surpass the 50 million pounds
they paid Liverpool for Torres in 2011  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
