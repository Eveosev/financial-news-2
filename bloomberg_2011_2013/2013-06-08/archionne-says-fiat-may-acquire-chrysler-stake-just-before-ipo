Fiat SpA (F)  Chief Executive Officer
 Sergio Marchionne  said the automaker may buy the rest of
Chrysler Group LLC just before a public listing of the stake
held by the United Auto Workers’ retiree health-care trust.  “It’s technically possible,” that Fiat may buy out
Chrysler as the initial public offering nears completion,
Marchionne, who is also CEO of the U.S. carmaker, told reporters
at The Council for the United States and Italy in Venice today.
It’s one of several alternatives, he said.  Marchionne is in talks to acquire the UAW trust’s 41.5
percent stake after Italy’s biggest manufacturer  accumulated 
58.5 percent of Chrysler since 2009. An IPO requested by the UAW
trust may take place as soon as the fourth quarter of this year,
he said, adding that discussions on a sale to Fiat are
“fundamentally” about price.  The merger of the two companies, which would further the
CEO’s aim of developing a global automaker to compete with
 General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , will “not necessarily”
be completed this year, Marchionne said. That Exor SpA, the
Agnelli Family holding company which controls Fiat, is open to a
potential capital increase after the Chrysler acquisition is
“very positive,” he said.  Marchionne said Fiat should expand in Asia and may seek a
second partner for its Jeep brand in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
