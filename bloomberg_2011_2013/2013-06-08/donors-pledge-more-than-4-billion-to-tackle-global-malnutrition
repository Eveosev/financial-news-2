Donors pledged as much as 2.7 billion
pounds ($4.15 billion) to tackle global malnutrition at a summit
in  London , the U.K. government said.  The pledges made at the Nutrition for Growth summit
included 655 million pounds from the U.K. from 2013 to 2020, the
government said on its website today. The Children’s Investment
Fund Foundation, or CIFF, which is funded by Chris Hohn’s hedge
fund TCI, committed $787 million.  “Today marks the start of a sustained financial and
political commitment to ending under-nutrition within a
generation,” said Jamie Cooper-Hohn, president and chief
executive officer of CIFF.  Malnutrition is an underlying cause in 45 percent of the
deaths among children under the age of five, while nearly 165
million suffer from stunting that stops children’s bodies from
developing properly, according to the U.K. government. The World
Health Assembly plans to cut the number of stunted children by
40 percent by 2025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
