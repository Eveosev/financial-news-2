Asian currencies advanced, snapping a
four-week slump, as U.S. economic data that trailed estimates
tempered concern the  Federal Reserve  will cut asset purchases
that have boosted dollar supply.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  of 10 regional
currencies climbed 0.2 percent to 116.98, the biggest five-day
advance since May 3. Manufacturing in the world’s largest
economy unexpectedly shrank last month and gains in factory
orders missed forecasts, figures released this week show. Non-farm payrolls rose 175,000 in May from a revised 149,000
increase in April that was smaller than first estimated, Labor
Department figures showed yesterday. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for a gain of 163,000.  “The strong dollar dwindled a bit as investors are waiting
for the U.S. jobs data to determine the Fed’s exit strategy,”
said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst at Woori Futures Co. in  Seoul .  The won strengthened 1.1 percent this week to 1,116.79 per
dollar, after losing 2.9 percent in preceding four weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar jumped
0.6 percent to NT$29.871, the most since the five days ended
Sept. 14. The  dollar  lost 1.7 percent, according to the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index.  Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said June 3 that U.S.
policy makers are committed to record stimulus measures. The Fed
is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds each month
to keep borrowing costs low and spur the economy. The Fed may
reduce its purchase to $65 billion at the October policy meeting,
according to a Bloomberg News survey, compared with a reduction
to $50 billion forecast in an April survey.  Malaysian Exports  The won advanced as the yen appreciated 4.8 percent against
the dollar this week, making Korean goods cheaper versus those
of Japanese rivals in global markets. The government yesterday
reaffirmed that the Korean economy expanded 1.5 percent last
quarter from a year earlier.  Taiwan ’s currency gained after exports climbed 0.9 percent
in May from a year earlier, beating economists’ estimate for a
0.8 percent decline. Shipments fell 1.9 percent in April.  Malaysia’s ringgit was little changed at 3.0985 per dollar
for the week. It dropped 0.5 percent yesterday as the trade
ministry said overseas  shipments  contracted 3.3 percent in April.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 0.4 percent gain,
after a 2.9 percent decline in March.  Baht, Rupee  Thailand’s baht fell for a seventh week, losing 1 percent
to 30.60 per dollar. Foreign investors were net sellers of $568
million of local equities this week through June 6, exchange
data show.  India ’s rupee weakened for a fifth week, falling 1 percent
to 57.065 per dollar. The currency depreciated beyond 57 for the
first time since June 2012 as foreign funds withdrew $2.2
billion from the  bond market  since May 21, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Elsewhere,  China ’s  yuan  was little changed this week at
6.1335 per dollar. Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to
9,805, and the Philippine peso and Vietnam’s dong were steady at
42.26 and 21,016, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
