The pound had its biggest weekly gain
versus the dollar in more than three years as U.K.
manufacturing, services and home-price data beat economist
forecasts, boosting confidence in the economy.  Sterling appreciated for the first week in six against the
euro. It rallied to the strongest level in more than three
months versus the greenback, as the U.S. currency dropped versus
all but two of its 16 major counterparts. U.K. government bonds
fell for a third week after  Bank of England  policy makers kept
stimulus measures unchanged at Governor Mervyn King’s final
meeting.  “Sterling has enjoyed a happy combination of better-than-expected economic data at the same time as the bullish mood on
the  U.S. dollar  was on the retreat,” said  Daragh Maher , a
London-based currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “The
fact that it also outperformed the euro likely reflected the
more aggressively short position that the market had on the
pound when the week began.” A short position is a bet an asset
price will decline.  The pound advanced 2.3 percent to $1.5553 as of 5:12 p.m.
 London  time yesterday, the biggest weekly gain since October
2009. It jumped to $1.5684 on June 6, the strongest level since
Feb. 13. The U.K. currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 85.04
pence per euro.  Sterling has gained the most among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes in
the past three months amid waning speculation the U.K. central
bank will introduce new measures to spur the economy. It rose
5.3 percent in the period, the indexes show.  Economic Surprises  The currency was boosted after a June 5 report showed a
gauge of service industry activity from  Markit Economics  and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  rose to 54.9 for
May, the highest in 14 months. That’s more than the 53.1 median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. Separate Markit reports on manufacturing and
construction on the prior two days also rose more than
economists estimated. U.K. house prices rose for a fourth month
in May, Halifax said on June 6.  The Bank of England kept its  asset-purchase target  at 375
billion pounds and the benchmark  interest rate  at a record low
of 0.5 percent on June 6. King’s successor  Mark Carney  takes
over at the start of July.  “The next big thing that pound moves are going to be based
on is what the view is of Carney when he comes in,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional
treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London. “There’s going to
be nervousness over what he could do.”  The U.K.  10-year yield  climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, in the week to 2.07 percent. The price of the
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 declined to 97.325.  The U.K. Debt Management Office will auction 3.75 billion
pounds of new benchmark 10-year gilts on June 11 and 2.25
billion pounds of debt due in 2032 two days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
