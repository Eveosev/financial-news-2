The Syrian opposition ruled out “any
peaceful solution” to end the two-year conflict in the nation
after government forces backed by Lebanon’s Hezbollah ousted
rebels from al-Qusair.  “What is happening now in  Syria  has shut the door on any
peaceful solution,” George Sabra, acting leader of the Syrian
National Coalition, said today from Istanbul in a broadcast
shown by Al Jazeera satellite television. “I call upon the
Syrian people to resist invaders with all means.”  Russia and the U.S. are pushing for a conference in July in
Geneva to encourage negotiations between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and opposition leaders. Syrian government
forces and their Hezbollah allies on June 5 seized control of
al-Qusair, a city that controls the road from Damascus to
Lebanon and the coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
