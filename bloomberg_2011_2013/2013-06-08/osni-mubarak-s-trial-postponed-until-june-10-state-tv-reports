The trial of ousted Egyptian leader
 Hosni Mubarak  on charges of involvement in the deaths of at
least 846 protesters during the 2011 uprising was postponed
until June 10 to allow the court to review evidence.  Judge Mahmoud El-Rashidi announced the decision live on
state television today. Mubarak, his long-time interior
minister, Habib El-Adli, and six former security officials are
being retried after a court in January overturned a life
sentence handed down to the former president.  Mubarak is also being retried on separate corruption-related counts with his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, and escaped
businessman Hussein Salem, who’s being tried in absentia.  Mubarak, who ruled  Egypt  for three decades, was sentenced
in June last year for failing to prevent the killings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
