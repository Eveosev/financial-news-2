Domaine Clarence Dillon, owner of
Bordeaux first-growth wine estate Chateau Haut-Brion, said it
has acquired Chateau L’Arrosee, a Grand Cru Classe producer in
Saint-Emilion neighboring its Chateau Quintus vineyards.  L’Arrosee has been owned by Roger Caille and his family
since 2002, and the accord was signed by Robert de Luxembourg,
president of Dillon unit Quintus SAS, which owns and operates
the Saint-Emilion property, according to an e-mailed statement.  The purchase was reported earlier by  Decanter.com , which
said L’Arrosee’s estate of 9.5 hectares (23 acres) has 20
percent  Cabernet Sauvignon  grapes, unusually for Merlot-dominated Saint-Emilion, along with 20 percent Cabernet Franc.  The expansion of the Dillon business comes as wines direct
from its cellars dating back to 1891, including those from Haut-Brion, are poised to go on sale at a Sotheby’s auction in  Hong
Kong  in October.  Dillon’s founder, a  New York  financier, bought Haut-Brion
in 1935 and his family-owned estate includes neighboring Chateau
La Mission Haut-Brion, acquired in 1983.  Haut-Brion is one of the five left-bank first growths in
Bordeaux’s 1855 classification and has been making wine for more
than 350 years.  Haut-Brion’s most expensive wine of the past quarter-century remains its 1989 vintage, which was awarded a perfect
100-point score by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker . One case sold
for 10,925 pounds ($16,700) at a Christie’s International Plc
auction in  London  on Feb. 21 while another fetched 10,810 pounds
at a Sotheby’s U.K. sale the same month.  Sotheby’s will auction more than 500 lots from Domaine
Clarence Dillon in the Hong Kong sale, which the auction house
estimates may fetch as much as HK$14 million ($1.8 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
