China is seeking greater stability in
its relationship with the U.S., according to former Secretary of
State  Henry Kissinger  who spoke as leaders of the two countries
met in California.  Chinese President Xi Jinping is a “strong personality”
trying to define a new direction for China that would benefit
from its relationship with the U.S., Kissinger said on CNN’s
“Fareed Zakaria GPS” program, scheduled for broadcast
tomorrow.  “I think they are serious about making the exploration. We
similarly have to be serious,” Kissinger said. “If it works
well and both sides are lucky, then at the end of 10 years, this
may have become a habit that has transformed international
relations.”  U.S. President  Barack Obama  and Xi are meeting at a
California desert estate on cybersecurity,  climate change  and
North Korea. Obama and Xi have sought to characterize their two-day summit as a chance for a fresh start in relations, with the
Chinese leader saying the talks marked a “new historical
starting point.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
