The  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS) â€™s three retirement homes for its former staff may be on the
brink of closure amid financial losses, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The RBS Care Homes Foundation, a charity established to
provide housing for pensioners of the lender, has told residents
at the homes in Torquay, Harrogate and Canterbury that they are
looking at their future with a view to possible closure,
according to the Telegraph.  The foundation raised 2.25 million pounds ($3.65 million)
in the year to March 2010 through voluntary donations and
fundraising activities, but spent 3.13 million pounds on its
homes, the newspaper said, without citing a source.  To contact the reporter on this story:
