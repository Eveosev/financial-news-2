Simon Duckworth, the chairman of the
Barings Targeted Return Fund, will join the U.K. agency that
prosecutes white-collar crime as a non-executive director.  Duckworth, who is also a non-executive director of Fidelity
European Values Plc and chairman of the National Olympics
Security Oversight Group, will start in the role on July 1, the
U.K. Serious Fraud Office said in a statement. His role will be
to link the SFO with both the  London  police and business, the
agency said.  The SFO and City of London police are the two main agencies
for “identification, investigation and prosecution of major
economic crime in this country,” Duckworth said, “a form of
crime that has frequently been underestimated in terms of both
complexity and its impact on a huge range of individuals and
businesses.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
