Germany ’s Philipp Kohlschreiber won
tennis’s Gerry Weber Open in Halle today after his countryman
Philipp Petzschner was forced to quit the final during the
second set because of a back injury.  Petzschner quit whilst trailing 7-6 (7-5), 2-0 against
Kohlschreiber, who wins his third ATP title.  The 27-year-old Kohlschreiber, runnerup to Switzerland’s
 Roger Federer  at the German event in 2008, had not been past the
quarterfinals in a tournament this year. Today was the first
all-German ATP final since Tommy Haas defeated Nicolas Kiefer in
Los Angeles in 2004.  “It is a damned pity that Philipp could not play on,”
Kohlschreiber told  Agence France-Presse . “It is a shame for the
fans but you could see he was really suffering.”  At another warm-up event for Wimbledon, which starts June
20, the men’s final of the Aegon Championships in  London  was
postponed to tomorrow after no play was possible today because
of rain.  Britain’s Andy Murray and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France were
scheduled to start at noon local time at Queen’s Club, and the
match has been rescheduled for 12:30 p.m. tomorrow.  “It has been a very frustrating day for everyone,
particularly our ticket-holders, but we will be giving everyone
with a ticket today a full refund and an opportunity to buy
tickets for the final weekend next year,” tournament director
Chris Kermode said in a release.  World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark won the WTA
Copenhagen tournament, beating Lucie Safarova of the Czech
Republic 6-1, 6-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
