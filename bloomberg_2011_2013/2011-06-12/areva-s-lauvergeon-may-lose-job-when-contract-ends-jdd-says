Areva SA Chief Executive Officer
 Anne Lauvergeon  is unlikely to have her contract renewed after
her current term expires this month,  Le Journal du Dimanche 
reported today, citing anonymous sources.  The French government, which controls about 90 percent of
Areva directly or through other state-owned companies, may name
Lauvergeon’s successor this week, the weekly paper said. An
Areva spokeswoman didn’t immediately return calls and messages
from Bloomberg seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
