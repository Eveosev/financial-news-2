Markstone Capital Group LLC’s 
Chairman Dan Gillerman comments on the decision by Bank of
Israel Governor Stanley to seek the International Monetary
Fund’s top job. Gillerman spoke in a telephone interview from
 Tel Aviv , where the private-equity fund is  based .  Fischer, 67, the IMF’s first deputy managing director from
1994-2001, joins French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  and
Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens in the race to
succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned last month after he
was charged with attempted rape, as managing director. Strauss-
Kahn has pleaded not guilty.  “I think Stan feels this, as he said, is a once-in-a-
lifetime chance, he feels he’s well qualified, and knowing Stan,
he’s done his homework and maybe he thinks there is an
opportunity here.”  “We know Christine Lagarde has not secured a majority, and
there’s a desire for a candidate outside  Europe . The toolbox
Stan brings with him makes him the best candidate for the job,
he feels based on his experience he may have a chance, and it’s
something he probably wouldn’t forgive himself if he didn’t at
least try to do.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
