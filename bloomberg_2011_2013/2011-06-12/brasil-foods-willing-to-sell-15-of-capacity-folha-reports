BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , the world’s
largest poultry exporter, may propose selling at least 15
percent of its production capacity as it seeks approval from
Brazilian regulators for the purchase of rival Sadia SA two
years ago, Folha de S.Paulo reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The Sao Paulo-based company, created after Perdigao SA
bought Sadia, may also consider selling some of its brands,
including Batavo, to win antitrust approval, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper reported, without detailing how it got the
information.  Carlos Ragazzo, one of five antitrust commissioners who
will decide on the matter, recommended the agency block the deal
last week.  Officials at  Brasil Foods  weren’t immediately available for
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
