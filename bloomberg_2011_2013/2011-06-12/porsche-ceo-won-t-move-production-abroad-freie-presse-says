German  Porsche Automobil Holding SE (PAH3) 
will continue to produce its  sports cars  exclusively in Germany,
 Freie Presse  said, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Matthias Mueller.  The Porsche brand is authentic because it is seen as a
German company, the newspaper cites the CEO as saying, rebuffing
earlier reports the company was considering factories in the
U.S. or China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
