Glencore International Plc may make
a 12 billion-pound ($19.5-billion) bid for Kazakh metals
producer Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., the Sunday Times
said.  Glencore doesn’t comment on speculation,  Simon Buerk , a
company spokesman based in Baar, Switzerland said by telephone
today when asked about the Times report. ENRC declined to
comment.  Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore’s chief executive officer, has
held talks in recent weeks with three investors who control
about 45 percent of ENRC’s shares, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified person with knowledge of the discussions.  Glasenberg has also held talks about a possible deal with
the government of  Kazakhstan , which hold 12 percent of ENRC, the
Sunday Times said, citing a separate unidentified official.
Glencore has not made a formal bid, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
