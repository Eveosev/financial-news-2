Royal Philips Electronics NV plans
to buy a unit of Chinese home appliance maker  Shanghai  Povos
Enterprise Group Co. for 2.3 billion yuan ($355 million) to 2.5
billion yuan, the official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the transaction.  The unit, Povos Appliance (Shanghai) Co., will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Amsterdam-based Philips after the
deal,  Xinhua  said. Details of the acquisition will be announced
within one to two months after both companies complete relevant
procedures, it said.  Povos Appliance’s domestic sales rose 39 percent to 400
million yuan in the first five months of 2011, Xinhua said,
citing statistics reported by other media.  Joost Akkermans, an Amsterdam-based spokesman for Philips,
 Europe ’s largest consumer electronics company, declined to
