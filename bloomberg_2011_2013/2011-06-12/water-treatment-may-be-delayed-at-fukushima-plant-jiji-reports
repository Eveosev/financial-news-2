Tokyo Electric Power Co. will delay
the start of testing equipment to absorb cesium in highly
radioactive water at its crippled Fukushima No. 1 plant because
of problems identified late yesterday, Jiji Press reported,
citing the company.  Tepco found that low-level radioactive water used to test
the equipment did not flow through one of four lines of the
zeolite-containing cartridges that absorb radioactive cesium,
technetium and radioiodine, Jiji reported. The company may have
to further delay the launch of the water-treatment system from
the currently scheduled June 16 or 17, Jiji said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
