Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) â€™s may cut
15,000 jobs as part of a plan to save 1 billion pounds ($1.62
billion), the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The reductions are part of a new strategy for the bank that
will be announced by its chief executive officer Antonio Horta- Osorio on June 30, the London-based newspaper said.  Lloyds fired 28,000 people in the past two years after its
acquisition of mortgage lender HBOS Plc, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
