China  and  Taiwan  will start a pilot
travel program on June 28 letting mainland Chinese from selected
cities visit Taiwan as individuals, the official Xinhua News
Agency said today.  The program will extend first to residents from Beijing,
Shanghai and Xiamen, the report said, citing a speech from Wang
Yi, director of the State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office, at
the Straits Forum today in Xiamen. Fujian residents will be
allowed to visit Taiwan’s Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu as tourists,
it said.  China and Taiwan also agreed to strengthen cooperation and
exchanges on security of nuclear power plants and food safety,
Wang was quoted as saying. Experts on both sides hope that a
cross-strait agreement on nuclear safety will be reached as soon
as possible, according to the report.  The mainland and Taiwan also agreed to enhance supervision
and inspection on foods and “severely crack down on various
criminal activities in the food sector,” Wang said.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors: Jarrett Banks,  Jim McDonald   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
