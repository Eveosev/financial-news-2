European shares will gain as yields
from dividends rose to levels of those on bonds, a signal that
marked the 2003 recovery from the tech-bubble crash and the 2009
rebound from the credit crisis, according to Citigroup Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index rallied after dividend yields headed above bond yields in
March 2003, September 2008 and April 2010. The index has slumped
7.9 percent from its 2011 high on Feb. 17 on concern that the
global economic recovery is faltering, even as inflation picks
up, and that  Greece  may default on its debt.  “The dividend crossover means that an investor’s running
cash yield is higher in equities, an asset class that offers a
degree of inflation protection and also an option on future
growth,” Adrian Cattley, a Citigroup strategist in London, said
in an interview. “This headline sign of better value has helped
call the turn in better performance for equity and weaker
bonds.”  The gross dividend yield, or payments per share divided by
stock prices, for the Stoxx 600 is about 3.4 percent, a high for
this year, according to Bloomberg data. The benchmark German 10-
year bund yield was trading at 2.96 percent at 5:30 p.m. in
 London  on June 10, the lowest level since Jan. 12.  Of the 328 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
profit per share since April 11, 58 percent have beaten the
average analyst estimate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
