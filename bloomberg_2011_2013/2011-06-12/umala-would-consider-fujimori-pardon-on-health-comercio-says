President-elect Ollanta Humala says
he would consider pardoning former President  Alberto Fujimori  on
humanitarian grounds, daily  El Comercio  reported, citing an
interview with Humala.  Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for
human-rights abuses, was taken to the hospital June 9 after a
drop in his body weight, according to his personal doctor and
former health minister Alejandro Aguinaga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
