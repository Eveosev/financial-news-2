Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s
biggest economy, wants to have “a greater role” at the
 International Monetary Fund , the official Saudi Press Agency
reported, citing the kingdom’s Finance Minister Ibrahim al- Assaf.  The world’s largest oil supplier has played an “important
role” in stabilizing prices with its crude production, the  news
service  said today, citing al-Assaf as saying during a press
conference yesterday with French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  in Jeddah.  Saudi Arabia doesn’t want the IMF presidency limited to a
certain region, the news service said, citing al-Assaf. The
country will support the “best candidate" and ‘‘most efficient
one from its viewpoint,’’ the news service reported.  Lagarde, Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens and
Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer are in the race to
succeed  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who resigned last month after he
was charged with attempted rape, as managing director. Strauss-
Kahn has pleaded not guilty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
