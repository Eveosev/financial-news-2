Middle East shares fell, with
Dubai’s stocks retreating to the lowest this month, after data
from the U.S., India and China fueled concern global economic
growth is slowing, damping investor appetite for riskier assets.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, lost 1.3 percent and  Dubai Islamic Bank
PJSC (DIB) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank complying with
Shariah rules, slid for a third day. The 30-member  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  dropped 0.3 percent to 1,551.67, the lowest since May 30,
at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. Israel’s benchmark stock index
lost 1.3 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  “Regional markets appear to be taking cues from trends in
global markets,” said Sachin Mohindra, a  fund manager  at Invest
AD in  Abu Dhabi . Investors including “high net worth and
regional institutions, who are the providers of incremental
buying liquidity in regional markets, appear to be closely
tracking international market events,” he said.  China  on June 10 reported a $13.1 billion  trade surplus  for
May, missing the $19.3 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey, as export growth slowed.  India reported that output at factories, utilities and
mines rose 6.3 percent in April from a year earlier after an 8.8
percent gain in March. China and India are the world’s second-
and fourth-biggest oil-consuming countries. The six nations of
the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of the world’s
oil.  ‘Frustratingly Slow’  On June 8, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said the “uneven” and “frustratingly slow” economic recovery
warrants continued monetary stimulus. Even so, he gave no
indication that he plans a third round of asset purchases known
as quantitative easing.  The MSCI All-Country World Index slid 1.5 percent on June
10. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.4 percent and the
Stoxx Europe 600 index slumped 1.3 percent. Oil in  New York 
retreated 2.6 percent to $99.29 a barrel.  Emaar fell to 3.08 dirhams, the lowest since May 30. Dubai
Islamic decreased 1 percent to 2.05 dirhams, the lowest since
May 25.  Abu Dhabi’s measure lost 0.1 percent, while Saudi Arabia’s
 Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.6 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30) 
advanced 0.3 percent and Qatar’s measure increased 0.1 percent.
 Kuwait SE Price Index (KWSEIDX)  was little changed and Bahrain’s gauge
increased 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the
region’s stocks rose 0.3 percent. In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX
30 Index (EGX30)  gained 0.1 percent.  In the Levant, Israel’s benchmark TA-25 stock index fell to
1,204.19 the lowest level since Sept. 19 as Bank of Israel
Governor Stanley Fischer joined the race to head the
 International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
