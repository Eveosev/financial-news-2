Iran  thwarted efforts by  Saudi
Arabia  to increase oil production at last week’s meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, state-run  Fars 
news agency reported, citing the acting oil minister.  Many countries opposed Saudi Arabia’s proposals, Mohammad Aliabadi said, according to the report.  The 12 members of OPEC failed on June 8 in Vienna to agree
on production levels in what Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi
said was “one of the worst meetings” he had attended. Saudi
Arabia,  Kuwait , Qatar and the  United Arab Emirates  proposed a
1.5 million barrel-a-day increase in output targets.  Libya ,
 Angola ,  Ecuador ,  Algeria , Iran and  Venezuela  opposed the move,
al-Naimi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
