Saudi Arabia ’s petrochemical exports
increased 41 percent in April from the previous year, driven by
higher prices and stronger demand from  Asia .  The kingdom, holder of the world’s largest oil reserves,
shipped 3.8 billion riyals ($1.01 billion) of petrochemicals in
April compared with 2.7 billion riyals of products in the same
month of 2010, according to data from the Department of
Statistics and Information.  Exports in April declined on a month-to-month basis,
falling by 19 percent from 4.7 billion riyals in March, the
department reported on its  website  yesterday.  Petrochemicals accounted for 31 percent of the country’s
non-oil exports valued at 12.3 billion riyals in April. Plastics
comprised 34 percent of the total, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
