Strike action planned to start
tomorrow at  South Africa ’s Exarro Coal company has been
suspended, the National Union of Mineworkers said.  “Exarro was granted an interim interdict on Friday,” the
NUM said in an e-mailed statement today. “The National Union of
Mineworkers has instructed its attorneys to oppose the
application for a final court order preventing the strike
action. This is a temporary victory for Exarro.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
