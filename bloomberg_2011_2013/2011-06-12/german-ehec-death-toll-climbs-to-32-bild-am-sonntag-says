The number of people who have died
since May 1 from infections with E. coli bacteria has risen to
32,  Germany ’s  Bild am Sonntag  said, without saying where it got
the information.  A total of 4,000 people have become ill with the
enterohemorrhagic E. coli bacteria, known as EHEC, with 759 of
those suffering from a potentially fatal kidney complication,
known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, the newspaper said.  About 100 patients suffered damage to their kidneys,
meaning they will either need a donor organ or receive dialysis
treatment for the rest of their lives, the newspaper cites Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat lawmaker and former government
health adviser as saying.  About 1,000 people fall ill with EHEC on average every
year, the country’s Federal Centre for Health Education said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
