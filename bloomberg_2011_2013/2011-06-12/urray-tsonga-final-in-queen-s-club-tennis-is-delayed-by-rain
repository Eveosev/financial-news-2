The men’s final in tennis’s Aegon
Championships in  London , betweenAndy Murray and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, has been delayed by rain.  The match was due to start at noon local time and there
will now be no play before 3 p.m., organizers said.  “The intention of tournament organizers is to complete the
final today, but if that is not possible it will be rescheduled
for 12:30 p.m. (BST) on Monday,” they said in an e-mail.  Forecasts predict “a window of dry weather” late this
afternoon at Queen’s Club, tournament director Chris Kermode
said.  The event is a grass-court warm-up for Wimbledon, which
starts June 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
