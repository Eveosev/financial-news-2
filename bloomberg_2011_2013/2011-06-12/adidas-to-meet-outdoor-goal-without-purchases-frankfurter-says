Adidas AG (ADS)  aims to reach a goal of
500 million euros ($719 million) in sales of outdoor products by
2015 without acquisitions,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Herbert Hainer.  While many outdoor companies are for sale, there are no
“really large players” available, Heiner was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
