Australian Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd  said his country intends to fulfill its mission in
Afghanistan and that conditions in the region where Australian
troops are based are improving.  Australia  has about 1,500 troops in Afghanistan, most of
them in central Uruzgan province as part of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization-led force.  “We intend to remain there until our mission is
discharged,” Rudd told BBC Television’s Andrew Marr Show today.
“We’re mindful of what President  Hamid Karzai  has said about
the 2014 transition to Afghan-led security. We will work within
that framework and we intend to complete our mission in
Afghanistan.”  Rudd said there had been “quite a radical transformation”
in the delivery of basic services in Uruzgan, which he described
as  Afghanistan ’s poorest province. Roads are being built,
schools and small markets are reopening and local forces are
being trained, he said.  “On the Richter scale of one to 10, we began at one,”
Rudd said. “Ten is a fully functional Westminster democracy.
We’re nowhere near 10. We’re somewhere middling sub of five but
let me tell you we’re making progress.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
