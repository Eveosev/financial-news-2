Former French Socialist Party leader
Francois Hollande widened his poll lead over President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and current party head  Martine Aubry , according to an
Ifop survey published today by  Le Journal du Dimanche .  Hollande would command 26 percent of voting intentions if
the Socialist Party chose him as its presidential candidate,
compared with 23 percent a month ago, the poll showed. Sarkozy’s
share of votes in a contest against Hollande was unchanged at 22
percent.  If the Socialists choose Aubry to take on Sarkozy in 2012,
she would gain 23 percent of the votes, down from 24 percent last
month, the paper said. Sarkozy would win 21.5 percent, down from
22.5 percent.  The Paris-based polling company surveyed 923 adults online
June 9-10. It didn’t provide a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
