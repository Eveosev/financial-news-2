Best Buy Co., the largest consumer
electronics retailer, may postpone its European expansion plans,
the Sunday Times reported without citing its sources.  The Richfield, Minnesota-based company is falling short of
its target to open 80 “big-box” electronics stores in  Europe 
by 2013, the newspaper said.  Best Buy will open three more shops in Europe this year
after starting its  first U.K. store  in 2010, the Times reported.
The company has no plans to add more locations in the continent,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
