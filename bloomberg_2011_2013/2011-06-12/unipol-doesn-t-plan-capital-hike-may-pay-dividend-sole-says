Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI)  has no
plans to increase its capital, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer Carlo Cimbri.  The Italian insurer will pay a dividend on 2011 results if
the company reaches its financial targets, Cimbri said,
according to the newspaper. He added that he’s “convinced”
Unipol will meet its goals.  Cimbri didn’t rule out the possibility that Unipol may
transfer resources to its banking unit without “asking for any
capital from the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
