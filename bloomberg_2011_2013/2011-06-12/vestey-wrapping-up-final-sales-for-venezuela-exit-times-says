Vestey Group is in final
negotiations to exit  Venezuela  by selling 300,000 hectares of
land and 120,000 cattle to the government, the Sunday Times
reported, citing the company’s chief executive George Vestey.  The closely-held food company expects to receive more than
GBP22 million ($36 million) from the asset sale, the newspaper
said, citing the company. Vestey’s exit from Venezuela comes
after almost a century of cattle farming there, the Times
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
