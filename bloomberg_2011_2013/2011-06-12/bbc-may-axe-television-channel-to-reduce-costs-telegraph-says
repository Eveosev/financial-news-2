Chris Patten, chairman of the  BBC 
Trust, said the British broadcaster may axe a digital television
channel and sports events as part of spending cuts, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, citing an interview.  The newspaper reported Patten as saying that the BBC would
“not be the same” after initiatives to cut 20 percent from the
corporation’s budget are introduced later this year.  Patten said digital TV channels BBC 3 or BBC 4 could be
axed and one of its main sporting events lost, according to the
Telegraph.  The spending cuts must not impinge on the corporation’s
core services, particularly the World Service, the newspaper
reported Patten as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
