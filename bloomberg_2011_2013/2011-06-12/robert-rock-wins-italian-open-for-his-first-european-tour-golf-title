Robert Rock held off a final-round
charge from Thorbjorn Olesen to win golf’s Italian Open for a
maiden success on the European Tour.  England’s Rock finished on 21-under-par 267 in Turin after
a final-round 67, one shot ahead of countryman Gary Boyd and
 Denmark ’s Olesen.  Scotland ’s Peter Whiteford was fourth, a
further shot back.  Olesen had a 10-under round today but misses out on his
first European Tour success.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
