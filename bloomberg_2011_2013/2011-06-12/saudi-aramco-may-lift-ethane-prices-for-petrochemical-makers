Saudi Aramco  may start charging
higher prices next year for ethane gas used to produce
petrochemicals, a Saudi investment bank said in a report today.  Clients such as  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s
largest petrochemical maker known as Sabic, might pay over the
current price of $0.75 per million British Thermal Unit, or one
thousand cubic feet, of ethane from 2012, said  Al Rajhi Capital ,
the investment arm of Saudi’s largest lender by market value.
The Riyadh-based bank did not say how much prices might rise.  Saudi Aramco, the sole producer of ethane in  Saudi Arabia ,
will increase prices in response to anti-dumping concerns raised
by European countries as the local cost of ethane is lower than
elsewhere, the bank said.  Saudi Petrochemicals companies will probably continue to
pay less than others outside the kingdom for ethane, according
to the report. The average global market price for the gas is
about $4.5 per million British Thermal Units, Al Rajhi Capital
estimated.  A Dhahran, Saudi Arabia-based spokesman said he can’t
comment on ethane pricing as it is set by the ministry of
petroleum and minerals. Officials from the ministry were not
available immediately for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
