(Corrects newspaper’s name.)  The U.K. Treasury will intervene in
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s sale of more than 600 branches, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, without citing anyone.  The Treasury will seek information from the Independent
Commission on Banking over the group’s plans to push Lloyds to
sell additional branches, the newspaper said. The department’s
intervention, its first since the independent commission was
formed last year, would enable Lloyds to approach buyers and add
more branches to the current sale process, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
