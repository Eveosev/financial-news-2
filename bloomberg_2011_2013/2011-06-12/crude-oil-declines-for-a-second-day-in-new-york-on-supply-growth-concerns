Oil declined for a second day in  New

U.S. and China, curbing fuel demand in the world’s two largest
crude consumers.  Futures slid as much as 0.7 percent, after the biggest
single-session drop in four weeks on June 10. Sales at U.S.

and China’s industrial production slowed, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before reports scheduled for
tomorrow. Asian stocks extended losses after the longest streak
of weekly declines since October 2008.  “Weak economic data will subdue the oil market,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivative sales manager at broker Newedge

and that depends on the economic reports.”  Crude for July delivery fell as much as 66 cents to $98.63

barrel, the biggest drop since May 11. Oil is up 31 percent the

down 35 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

10. Brent traded at a record premium of $19.73 a barrel to U.S.

following a 0.5 percent gain in April, according to the median
forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of
Commerce Department data tomorrow. Chains including Limited
Brands Inc. missed analysts’ estimates for May as gasoline
prices climbed to the highest level in almost three years and
unemployment topped 9 percent.  China ’s industrial production growth may have slowed to
13.1 percent in May from 13.4 percent in April, according to a
separate Bloomberg survey. Consumer price inflation, also
scheduled for tomorrow, may have accelerated to 5.5 percent from
5.3 percent.  Japan ’s machinery orders fell for the first time in four
months in April. Factory orders declined 3.3 percent in April
from March, when they rose 1 percent, the Cabinet Office said
today in Tokyo. Orders, an indicator of  capital spending  in
three to six months, were projected to increase 1.7 percent,
according to the median forecast of 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Equities Slump  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much as 1.1 percent
today, extending last week’s 1.4 percent decline. The measure

amid disappointing economic data, capped by a jobs report last
week that showed U.S. companies hired fewer workers than
estimated. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  has declined for six
straight weeks, the most since 2002.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased

Commitments of Traders report. Net long positions fell by 33,467
contracts, or 14.91 percent, from a week earlier.  Twenty-two of 41 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or 54
percent, forecast oil will decline this week. Fourteen
respondents, or 34 percent, predicted prices will increase and
five estimated little change.  China’s oil processing volume in May rose 4.4 percent from
a year earlier to 34.9 million tons, the National Development
and Reform Commission said in a statement on its website today.  Crude oil output rose 1.1 percent to 17.26 million tons.
