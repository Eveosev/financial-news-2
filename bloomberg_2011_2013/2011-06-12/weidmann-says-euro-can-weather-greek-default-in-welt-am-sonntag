Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said the solvency of  Greece  will depend largely on its
willingness to push through reforms,  Welt am Sonntag  reported,
citing an interview with the central banker.  “If the commitments agreed upon are not met, that cancels
the basis for further support from the aid package,” the
newspaper cited Weidmann as saying. “This would be Greece’s
decision, and the country then would have to bear the surely
dramatic economic consequences of a default.”  A default would put Greece’s partner countries in a
“difficult situation” but it wouldn’t threaten the euro, which
would “even in this case remain stable,” Weidmann told the
paper.  Creditor participation in the planned bailout should be
“purely voluntary,” Weidmann was quoted as saying. The
handling of the Greek situation “touches on the fundamental
principles of the monetary union,” he said.  Buying Greek bonds was never meant to be a “lasting
solution,” and Weidman ruled out extending the emergency
program in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
