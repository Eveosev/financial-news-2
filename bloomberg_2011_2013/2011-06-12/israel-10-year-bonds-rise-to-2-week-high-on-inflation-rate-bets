Israel ’s 10-year government bond
yields climbed to the highest level in more than two weeks on
bets inflation accelerated in May, increasing the likelihood the
central bank will boost  interest rates  this month.  Yields rose to the highest since May 25 as the median
estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast annual
inflation may quicken to 4.2 percent in May from 4 percent in
April. The yield gap between inflation-linked bonds due June
2012 and fixed-rate notes of similar maturity has widened 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 350.1 since May 16, a
day after the statistics bureau said April inflation slowed from
4.3 percent the previous month. That implies expected inflation
of 3.5 percent, up from about 3.4 percent.  “Consumer prices in May are expected to be high because of
an increase in fruit and vegetable prices due to a seasonal
change to the summer, which is coming a little late,” Yaniv Hevron, head of macro-strategy at  Ramat Gan , Israel-based
Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd., said by telephone.
“If the CPI figures show a surprise increase of more than
what’s expected for the season, the yield can be expected to
move higher, raising bets the central bank will increase
borrowing costs.”  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 rose one basis point to 5.1 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close
in  Tel Aviv . The yield has gained 41 basis points this year as
Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  increased interest rates
by 2.75 percentage points since August 2009 in an attempt to
rein in inflation. The Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  will release the latest price data June 15.  Fischer said yesterday he’s a candidate for managing
director of the  International Monetary Fund .  The shekel weakened 0.7 percent to 3.4080 per dollar on
June 10.  Fund Redemptions  About 1.3 billion shekels ($381 million) were redeemed from
so-called traditional mutual funds so far this month, including
870 million shekels from corporate-bond funds, according to Tel
Aviv-based Meitav Investment House Ltd. Money-market funds
raised 1.06 billion shekels, while short-term  government bonds 
drew 262 million shekels.  “The pace of redemptions is picking up as global stock
markets are down and investors are pulling out of risky
assets,” Rony After, mutual funds analyst at Meitav, said by
telephone. “Outflows are continuing the trend from May amid
negative sentiment spurred by concern about recovery in the  U.S.
economy  and the Greek debt crisis.”  The  Tel Aviv 25 Index (TA-25)  of the country’s 25 biggest companies
fell 1.3 percent to 1,204.19. The gauge has dropped 5 percent
this month and 9.2 percent this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index is down 5.5 percent this month.  Outflows from Israeli corporate bond and mixed-securities
funds in May were the highest in almost three years, Meitav said
June 1. About 3.5 billion shekels were redeemed from traditional
mutual funds last month, including 2.6 billion shekels from
corporate-bond and mixed stock and bond funds, the biggest
redemption since November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
