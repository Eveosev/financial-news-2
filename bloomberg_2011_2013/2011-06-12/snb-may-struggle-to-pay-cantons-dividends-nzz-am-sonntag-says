The  Swiss National Bank  may struggle
to pay yearly dividends to all 26 of  Switzerland ’s cantons as
foreign exchange rates weigh on the central bank’s finances,  NZZ
am Sonntag  said, citing a survey of cantonal finance directors.  Three cantons are not budgeting for any income from the SNB
this year and 11 are expecting half of the usual total payment
of 1.67 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion), the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
