Carrefour SA (CA)  workers staged strikes
across  France  that disrupted work at 350 of the 540 supermarkets
in the retailer’s Carrefour Market chain,  Le Parisien  reported
today, citing unions.  By the company’s own count, only 50 stores were affected by
the protest, which began May 14 over pay and conditions, the
