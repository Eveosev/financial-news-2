Former BP Plc Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Hayward  may share in a 410 million-pound ($665
million) windfall as a result of a 15 million-pound “founders”
investment in Vallares Plc, the Sunday Telegraph reported,
citing documents shown to potential investors in the company.  Hayward, along with financiers  Nathaniel Rothschild  and Tom
Daniel and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Julian Metherell, may benefit from an arrangement designed to reward
the founders of the 1 billion-pound investment vehicle
established to buy oil and gas assets, the newspaper reported.  The four men will buy so-called ‘B’ shares that convert
into 6.67 percent of the vehicle’s share capital on completion
of the first transaction, the Telegraph said.  In an interview with the newspaper, Hayward said he
expected to create a company with a market value of $5 billion
to $10 billion. At the top end of that range, 6.67 percent would
equal 410 million pounds, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
