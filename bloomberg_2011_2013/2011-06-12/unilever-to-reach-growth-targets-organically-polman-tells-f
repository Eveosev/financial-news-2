Unilever Chief Executive Officer
Paul Polman said the company will meet growth targets without
making acquisitions, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Polman.  The company’s growth “really is coming 95 percent from our
own brands,” Polman said, according to the FT. “We don’t need
any M&A activity to achieve these objectives, plus or minus,”
he said, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
