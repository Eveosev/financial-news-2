Dubai, the Persian Gulf business hub
where real estate values have fallen for three years, has
cancelled 217 property projects in a two-year review of the
industry.  Out of more than 450 projects reviewed by the  Real Estate
Regulatory Agency , 237 will be completed, according to a Dubai
government bond prospectus that didn’t name the cancelled
developments. The value of property transactions fell to 119.5
billion dirhams ($32.5 billion) in 2010 from 152.9 billion
dirhams a year earlier, the document said.  Residential property prices in Dubai declined 1.2 percent
in May as the market failed to benefit from political turmoil in
other parts of the region, Deutsche Bank AG said last week.  Home
prices  have dropped 64 percent from their peak in mid-2008,
after the financial crisis ended a speculation-fueled boom and
construction outstripped demand.  The number of mortgage transactions dropped to 9,548 in
2010 from 9,859 the previous year, according to the prospectus.  The property market’s share of the Dubai economy shrank to
13.7 percent in 2010 from 14.4 percent the year before.
Construction fell to 9.4 percent of gross domestic product, from
11.2 percent in 2009, according to the document.  The Dubai Financial Market Real Estate Index was down 1
percent at 11:41 a.m. in Dubai. The measure declined 11 percent
this year has slumped 73 percent since mid-2008.  Dubai has 455 registered property developers and the
largest are wholly or partially owned by the government or
ruling family, according to the prospectus. The city had 893
registered real estate brokers at the end of May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
