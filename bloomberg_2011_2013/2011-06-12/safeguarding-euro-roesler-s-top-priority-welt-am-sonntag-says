 Safeguarding the euro amid a
potential new bailout package for  Greece  is his “highest
priority,” German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said in an
interview with  Welt am Sonntag .  His Free Democrats party will do “everything in their
power” to keep the euro stable, the newspaper cites Roesler as
saying. Any bailout package with Greece also needs private
investor participation, he said, according to Welt am Sonntag.  Such an aid package depends on Greece pushing through asset
sales, consolidating the country’s budget and regaining its
competitive strength, the minister is cited as saying. A new
program must ensure parliament has the final say over financial
support, he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
