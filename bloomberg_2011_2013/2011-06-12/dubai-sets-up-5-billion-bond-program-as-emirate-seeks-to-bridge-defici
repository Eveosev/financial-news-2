Dubai set up a $5 billion bond
program to help bridge its budget deficit and fund investments
as yields fell to the lowest in at least two years this month.  The Persian Gulf sheikhdom will use proceeds from the
dollar-denominated bonds for spending on construction and the
budget, according to a prospectus distributed by the Regulatory
News Service. Yields on Dubai’s $1.25 billion of sukuk bonds 
due in 2014 fell to the lowest level since their sale in 
October 2009 to 4.573 percent on June 1 from as high as 
6.69 percent on Jan. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The yield was last at 4.76 percent on June 10.  “There is likely to be solid demand for such a deal,”
Chavan Bhogaita, head of the markets strategy group at  National
Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , said in an e-mail today. “There has
been a marked improvement in investor sentiment toward the Dubai
credit story recently and credit default swaps spreads
demonstrate this very clearly.”  Dubai is returning to the  bond market  for the first time in
eight months after the government-owned Emirates, the world’s
biggest airline by international traffic, raised $1 billion from
the sale of five-year bonds June 1. The bonds were priced to
yield 330 basis points over the benchmark mid-swap rate.
Emirates and Dubai’s government have no credit ratings.  On June 2, Dubai’s credit default swaps fell to the lowest
level after they surged from 325 basis points on Nov. 24, 2009,
to 655 three days later as state-owned Dubai World announced
plans to restructure about $25 billion of debt. The swaps
climbed 4 basis points to 328 on June 10, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by  CME Group Inc (CME)  and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Budget Deficit  Dubai’s budget gap is set to narrow to 3.8 billion dirhams
($1 billion) this year, the lowest level since 2007, according
to the bond prospectus. The government hired UBS AG,  Emirates
NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , Mitsubishi UFJ Securities International Plc, Standard
Chartered Plc and National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC to manage the
deal. Deutsche Bank AG will act as the fiscal and paying agent.  The emirate plans to sell a “benchmark-sized” bond, three
bankers familiar with the deal said June 9. Benchmark bond
typically raise at least $500 million. A sale raising $750
million to $1 billion is “achievable,” Bhogaita said.  Dubai and its companies ran up debt of at least $129.3
billion, according to estimates by analysts at Credit Suisse
Group AG, as the emirate borrowed to develop its property,
tourism, trade and financial-services industries.  September Bond  The government raised $1.25 billion in September in its
first sovereign debt issue since the state-owned Dubai World
sought a delay on debt payments. The bonds generated orders
valued at about $5 billion, it said then.  Dubai sold $500 million of notes due 2015 at a yield of 6.7
percent and $750 million of 2020 bonds to yield 7.75 percent.
The 2015 yield declined to a low of 5.14 percent on May 19 and
was last at 5.24 percent, according to Bloomberg data. The 2020
yield sank to 6.72 percent on June 1 and was last at 6.84
percent.  Dubai, the second-biggest of the seven sheikhdoms that make
up the  United Arab Emirates , had to seek help from neighboring
Abu Dhabi after the global credit crisis pushed property prices
down by more than half from their peak in 2008, and frozen
credit markets forced some state-owned companies to delay loan
payments. State-owned Dubai World signed a final agreement with
its creditors in March to restructure debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
