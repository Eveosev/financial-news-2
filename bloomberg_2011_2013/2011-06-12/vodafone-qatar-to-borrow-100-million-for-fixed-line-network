Vodafone Qatar (VFQS) , a venture between
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and the state-owned Qatar Foundation, plans
to obtain a $100 million loan in the next 45 days to establish a
fixed-line phone network in the Persian Gulf emirate, said John Tombleson, the company’s acting chief executive officer.  The company borrows through the Vodafone Group at an
interest rate of 1.7 percent, Tombleson said today after the
company’s general assembly in the Qatari capital Doha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
