Middle East  and North Africa venture
capital funds raised $300 million last year after adding no
capital in 2009, an industry report shows.  “Raising capital continues to be a challenge for fund
managers in the region,” according to a report released today
by the Middle East and North Africa Private Equity Association
in Dubai.  Venture capital funds completed 14 deals in 2010 and 19 in
the previous year, the report shows.  Egypt  has accounted for 31
percent of deals since 2006, more than any other country, while
the information technology and software industries made up 45
percent of transactions in the period, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
