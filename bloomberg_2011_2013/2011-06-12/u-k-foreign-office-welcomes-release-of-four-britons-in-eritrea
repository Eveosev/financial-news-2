The U.K. Foreign Office welcomed the
release of four British men detained in Eritrea since December.  “We are pleased that the four British nationals have now
been able to leave Eritrea and can be reunited with family and
friends,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement
today. “We are very grateful to the government of the State of
Qatar for helping facilitate their return.”  The Eritrean government arrested the employees of British
maritime security firm Protection Vehicles International on
suspicion of espionage, terrorism and of using one of the
nation’s islands as an arms depot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
