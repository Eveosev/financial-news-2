U.K. Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne 
urged consumers to abandon energy companies that impose
substantial increases in the price of gas and electricity.  “Consumers don’t have to take price increases lying
down,” he told the Observer newspaper. “If an energy company
hits you with a price increase, you can hit them back where it
hurts -- by shopping around and voting with your feet.”  His comments come as energy companies prepare to follow
Scottish Power Ltd. and announce big price increases, the
London-based newspaper said. Scottish Power, a unit of  Iberdrola
SA (IBE) , said on June 7 it will raise domestic electricity bills by
10 percent and gas bills by 19 percent on average from August.  Huhne’s intervention underlines concern in government over
the impact of rising consumer prices on British  living
standards , the paper said. Inflation hit 4.5 percent in April,
more than double the Bank of England’s target, and is forecast
by the central bank to reach 5 percent in the coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
