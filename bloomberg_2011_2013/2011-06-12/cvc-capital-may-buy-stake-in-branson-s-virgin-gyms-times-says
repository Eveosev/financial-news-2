Private equity house CVC Capital
Partners Ltd. is in exclusive talks to buy a large stake in
 Richard Branson ’s fitness chain Virgin Active Ltd., the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The deal would value  Virgin Active  at 1 billion pounds
($1.6 billion), the newspaper said. Branson owns a 76 percent
stake in the leisure operator and will retain a large
shareholding after the sale, according to the Times.  As part of the deal, CVC is likely to buy out two other
private equity investors who own a minority stake in Virgin
Active, the newspaper reported. Cash raised by the sale will be
used to expand the fitness chain, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
