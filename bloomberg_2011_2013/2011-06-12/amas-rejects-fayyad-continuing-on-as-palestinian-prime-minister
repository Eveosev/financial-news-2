The Hamas Islamic movement that
rules the  Gaza Strip  said it doesn’t want  Palestinian Authority 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to continue in the post after it
forms a unity government with the Palestinian Authority.  “We won’t accept Salam Fayyad,” Hamas official Salah al- Bardaweel said in a statement e-mailed to reporters in Gaza.
“We won’t even accept him as a minister in the government,
because four years of siege, arrests and torture of Hamas
leaders were linked to Fayyad’s name.”  Hamas split with the Palestinian Authority, which controls
the  West Bank  and is headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, after a
violent clash between their forces in Gaza in June, 2007. Hamas
and Abbas’ Fatah faction signed a reconciliation agreement in
Cairo last month to set up a new unity government ahead of
elections later this year.  Fatah leaders yesterday met in Ramallah to discuss
nominations for the unity government’s new cabinet, and will
meet with Hamas in Cairo on June 14 to begin negotiations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
