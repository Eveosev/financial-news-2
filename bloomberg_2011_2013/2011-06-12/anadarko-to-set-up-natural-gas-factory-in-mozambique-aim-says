Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  will set up
a natural gas factory in Mozambique to produce at least 1
billion cubic feet per day, Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique
said, citing Operations Director John Peffer.  Anadarko of the U.S. has invested $750 million, which may
increase to $3 billion in 2013, the state-controlled  news agency 
reported yesterday. The installation of the natural gas factory
will increase Anadarkoâ€™s investments in the country to $15
billion by the end of 2018, Peffer was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
