Antinuclear protesters staged
nationwide demonstrations throughout  Japan  yesterday, three
months after a nuclear power plant damaged by natural disasters
began spewing radiation.  Demonstrations were held in about 140 places including
downtown Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Fukushima, where the
crippled Tokyo electric Power Co. reactors have yet to be
brought under control, media including the Asahi newspaper
reported.  As many as 20,000 people participated in the nationwide
protests, Asahi reported, citing organizers it didnâ€™t name.  Tokyo metropolitan police declined to provide any estimate
of numbers at demonstrations, when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
