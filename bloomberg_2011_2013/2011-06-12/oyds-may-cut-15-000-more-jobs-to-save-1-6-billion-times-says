Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) â€™s may cut
15,000 jobs as part of a plan to save 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion), the Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the
information.  The reductions are part of a strategy to be announced by
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio on June 30, the
newspaper said. The bank has cut 28,000 jobs in the past two
years after its acquisition of mortgage lender HBOS Plc,
according to the newspaper.  Lloyds spokeswoman Sarah Swailes declined to comment when
contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
