The  Congress of South African Trade
Unions  may withdraw its support for President  Jacob Zuma  because
of mounting corruption, the  Sunday Times  said, citing leaked
documents prepared for a Cosatu meeting at the end of the month.  According to the documents, the labor federation’s
Secretary-General Zwelinzima Vavi also warned that if efforts by
the youth league of the ruling  African National Congress  to
replace Zuma succeed next year, the country will become a
“banana republic” with institutionalized corruption, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported.  The Congress’s spokesman Patrick Craven declined to comment
when contacted on his mobile phone today.  The labor federation is part of the tripartite ruling
alliance with the  South African Communist Party  and the ANC. Its
support helped bring Zuma to power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
