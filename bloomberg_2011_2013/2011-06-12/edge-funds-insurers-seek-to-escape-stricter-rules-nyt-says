Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  and
Citadel LLC are among insurers,  hedge funds  and mutual-fund
companies that have tried to convince U.S. regulators that
stricter oversight intended to prevent future failures doesn’t
apply to them, the New York Times reported.  Other businesses that have made presentations to the
Treasury Department, the  Federal Reserve  and other regulators
include MassMutual Financial Group, Paulson & Co., D.E. Shaw &
Co., Elliott Management Corp. and Caxton Associates LLC, the
newspaper said, citing documents.  Jeffrey Goldstein, the Treasury undersecretary for domestic
finance, has begun to ask companies before they speak if they
want to be deemed “systemically important,” the Times said. He
told the newspaper he couldn’t recall any of them saying
“yes.”  Companies such as  Boeing Co. (BA) ,  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  that operate large financing
operations for their customers also have argued against
heightened regulation, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
