Holidaybreak Plc (HBR) , a U.K. travel
company, will sell off some leisure units and shift its focus to
education, the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The company has hired accountant KPMG LLP to find buyers
for several businesses, including Superbreak, which organizes
short trips and Explore, which arranges adventure holidays.  Holidaybreak’s PGL division is the U.K.’s largest provider
of trips for schools.  To contact the reporter on this story:
