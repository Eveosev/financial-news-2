Seacor Holdings Inc. (CKH) , operator of
support vessels for offshore oil and gas exploration, may bid
for London fire engine owner  Assetco Plc (ASTO) , the Sunday Times
reported, citing unidentified officials.  Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Seacor is carrying out due
diligence on Assetco, the newspaper said. The South Ruislip,
England-based fire engine company aims to have proposals from
Seacor and another bidder by the end of the month, the Times
said.  Assetco shares have fallen 94 percent this year. The
company is struggling to refinance 80 million pounds ($130
million) of debt with its main lender Lloyds Banking Group Plc,
the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
