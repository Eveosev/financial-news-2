Southern Cross  Healthcare Group Plc,
the U.K.’s largest operator of nursing homes, faces a 5.8-
billion-pound ($9.4 billion) bill for rental payments, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, citing the company’s accounts.  Southern Cross says it can no longer afford the rents
because of slower-than-expected increases in fees from local
authorities, the Telegraph said. The newspaper reported Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Buchan as saying the Darlington,
England-based company won’t pay 30 percent of rents due during
the summer and that it is trying to reach an agreement with
landlords.  To contact the reporter on this story:
