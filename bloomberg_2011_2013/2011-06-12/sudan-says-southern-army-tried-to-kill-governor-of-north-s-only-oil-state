The northern Sudanese army said the
country’s southern forces tried to assassinate the governor of
the Southern Kordofan border state, where the two armies have
clashed for a week.  The Southern Sudanese army bombarded the convoy of Ahmed Haroun, governor of northern Sudan’s only oil-producing state,
the Sudanese Armed Forces said today in a statement published on
the state-run  SUNA news agency  without saying when the attack
happened. It accused the southern forces of starting the
fighting.  Abdel-Aziz Adam Al-Hilu of the south’s ruling Sudan
People’s Liberation Movement lost to Haroun in last month’s vote
for Southern Kordofan’s governorship. Haroun is a member of
Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir’s ruling  National Congress
Party . Both he and the president are wanted by the  International
Criminal Court  over alleged involvement in  war crimes  in the
western Sudanese region of Darfur.  Southern Sudanese spokesman Philip Aguer didn’t answer calls
to his mobile phone seeking comment today.
 The clashes, which began on June 5, may have broken out when
northern forces tried to disarm members of the Nuba ethnic group
in Southern Kordofan who fought on the side of Southern  Sudan  in
the two-decade civil war that ended with a 2005 peace agreement,
Aguer said on June 7.  The fighting pits the northern Sudanese armed forces
against northern fighters from the state, and doesn’t involve
the Southern Sudanese army based in the regional capital, Juba,
according to Aguer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
