Iraq  raised the July prices for its
Basrah Light crude oil to customers in all markets, according to
an e-mailed statement.  The discount for Basrah Light crude to the U.S. narrowed to
$2 less than the  Argus Sour Crude Index , making the oil 10 cents
a barrel more expensive than in June, Iraqâ€™s State Oil Marketing
Organization said today in the statement.  Persian Gulf producers sell most of their crude to refiners
under long-term contracts. Most regional state-run  oil companies 
price their crudes at a premium or discount to a benchmark.  The following table gives price differentials to benchmarks
for the regions in which Iraq sells, as well as month-on-month
changes. Prices are in U.S. dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
