Switzerland  could double its solar
energy target,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an interview
with Peter Pauli, chief executive officer of  Meyer Burger
Technology AG. (MBTN)   Solar energy could account for at least 40 percent of the
nation’s power requirements by 2050, compared with the Federal
Council’s current target of 20 percent, Pauli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
