A failure to agree upon a new aid
package for Greece would be irresponsible and highly risky,
 Volker Kauder , the parliamentary leader of German Chancellor
Angela Merkelâ€™s Christian Democratic bloc, told  Bild am Sonntag 
newspaper.  The  Greek economy  would collapse, the country could not
repay its debt, and the financial systems of other countries
would be in danger, possibly resulting in a new financial and
economic crisis, Kauder said according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
