New Zealand ’s government may extend
 Sky City Entertainment Group Ltd. (SKC) ’s casino license and allow
more tables and machines at its Auckland site in exchange for
the company building a convention center.  Changes to gambling regulations and legislation will be
discussed as part of the negotiations with Sky City, Economic
Development Minister  David Carter  said in an e-mailed statement.
The government will not reduce the age of entry to casinos or
allow Sky City an Internet gaming license or additional casino
licenses, he said.  Sky City has been selected as preferred developer of a New
Zealand International Convention Center in Auckland, Chief
Executive Officer Nigel Morrison said yesterday. The company
will pay the full NZ$350 million ($287 million) construction
cost, the company said in a statement.  The 3,500 seat center would attract an estimated NZ$90
million of international spending a year and employ 800 people,
Carter said. Any changes to gambling legislation would be
subject to a full public submission process. Sky City’s license
expires in 2021.  To contact the reporter on this story:
