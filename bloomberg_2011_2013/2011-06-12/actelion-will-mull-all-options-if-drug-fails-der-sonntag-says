Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  will consider a sale
or any other strategic option if its experimental medicine
macitentan fails in tests,  Der Sonntag  reported, citing Roland Haefeli, head of  investor relations  at the company.  A decision on macitentan, a possible successor to the best-
selling lung medicine Tracleer, will be made by the end of the
year based on clinical trial results, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
