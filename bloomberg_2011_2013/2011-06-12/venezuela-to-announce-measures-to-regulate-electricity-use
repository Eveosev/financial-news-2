Venezuela  will announce measures
to ration the use of electricity in a press conference
tomorrow as rising demand outpaces generation capacity and
causes intermitent blackouts across the South American country,
Vice President Elias Jaua said.  Failures at five transformers at the Tablazo power plant in
Zulia state yesterday caused more than 3,000 megawatts to go
offline and left the countryâ€™s most populous state without
electricity. The government is replacing the transformers and
hopes to resolve the issue tonight, Jaua said in comments on
state television.  Jaua said that President  Hugo Chavez , who is currently
recovering from an unplanned surgery in Cuba, has been in
contact with his cabinet to design policies to resolve the
electricity problems.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
