A reduction in  Germany â€™s debt is
more important than tax cuts,  Welt am Sonntag  said, citing an
interview with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann.  Inflation in  Europe  has risen on higher energy costs,
pushing inflation higher in the short term, Weidmann told the
newspaper. There are no specific signs, so far, that this would
feed into higher wages, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
