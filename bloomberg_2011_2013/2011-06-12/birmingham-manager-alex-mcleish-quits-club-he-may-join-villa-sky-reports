Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish
resigned from the club, amid reports he may join arch-rival
 Aston Villa .  McLeish’s departure was announced on City’s website.  “Acting Chairman Peter Pannu received an e-mail
resignation from McLeish earlier today,” the Blues said, adding
that no further comment would be made at the moment.  McLeish, who joined City in November 2007, was unable
to prevent relegation from English soccer’s elite Premier League
last season. He led Birmingham to the League Cup title in
February.  The Scot would welcome the opportunity to take charge at
Midlands rival Villa,  Sky Sports  reported, citing sources it
didn’t identify. The Villa post is vacant after the departure of
Gerard Houllier amid health concerns.  Also today, Nottingham Forest said it terminated
the contract of manager Billy Davies with immediate effect,
ending the Scot’s 2 1/2-year spell at the Championship soccer
club.  Forest, which finished sixth in the second-tier league last
season and lost in the playoffs, is in talks with former England
manager Steve McClaren about succeeding Davies, the club said on
its website today  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
