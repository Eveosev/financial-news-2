Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.’s
listing on the  London  Stock Exchange in 2007 was a “mistake,”
according to Sir Richard Sykes, the former deputy chairman of
the Kazakh mining company, the Sunday Telegraph said.  Sykes said a governance review of the board of director’s
independence and functionality by the ICSA, a leading global
authority on corporate governance, gave ENRC the lowest rankings
its consultants had ever seen, the newspaper reported.  Sykes, a former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, said ENRC
should never have been listed, the Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
