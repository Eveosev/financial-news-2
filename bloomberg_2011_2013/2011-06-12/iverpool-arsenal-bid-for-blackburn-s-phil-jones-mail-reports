Liverpool has offered 22 million
pounds ($35.7 million) for Blackburn’s teenage defender Phil
Jones, who may be denied a move to  Manchester United  by his
club, the Mail on Sunday reported.  Blackburn’s owners have resolved to block a move to United
for the 19-year-old after being angered by the Premier League
soccer champion’s attitude, the newspaper said, without citing
anyone.  Arsenal has also made a bid, of more than United’s 16.5
million-pound offer, and Chelsea may be interested, the Mail
reported. Blackburn will attempt to persuade Jones to stay, the
newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
