(Corrects ratio measurement in second paragraph.)  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority may
require local banks to make more provisions and set aside some
profit as reserves, Apple Daily reported today, citing
unidentified people.  HKMA plans to set up a top-up provision ratio based on
banks’ total lending, the paper said. The ratio will be based on
the lenders’ worst writedown record since the financial crisis
in 1997 and will range from 1 to 1.5 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
