The Canadian dollar fluctuated
against its U.S. counterpart amid speculation the economy is
slowing after an unexpected jobs loss last month.  The currency fell last week versus the  U.S. dollar  after
 Canada  reported 54,500 fewer jobs in March, the biggest monthly
employment decline since the country was in recession in 2009.
The move was exacerbated by U.S. payroll data reported the same
day that came in below economists’ estimates.  “We’re basically still moving on flows from last week,”
Greg T. Moore, currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,
said by phone from Toronto. “There’s continued digestion of the
dual Canadian and U.S. employment reports last Friday.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, gained 0.1 percent to
C$1.0166 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after rising 0.2
percent and falling 0.4 percent. One loonie buys 98.36 U.S.
cents.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, with the yield rising 0.1
percent, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.76 percent. The 1.5
percent note maturing in June 2023 dropped 12 cents to C$97.57.
The  Bank of Canada  will auction C$2.7 billion ($2.7 billion) of
securities maturing August 2016 on April 10.  Oil, the country’s biggest export, increased 0.9 percent to
$93.55 a barrel in  New York . The  Standard & Poor’s 500   rose  0.6
percent to 1,563.07.  Futures Positions  Canada’s jobs figures brought the labor market more in line
with other parts of the economy, where  output growth  slowed to a
0.6 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter and inflation
has lagged behind the central bank’s 2 percent target since May.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators last week  increased 
their bets the Canadian dollar will decline against the
greenback, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers
on a decline in the Canadian dollar compared with those on a
gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 64,544 on April 2, compared
with net shorts of 62,645 a week earlier.  The cost to insure against declines in the Canadian dollar
versus its U.S. counterpart rose. The three-month so-called 25-
delta risk reversal rate rose to 1.02 percent after reaching
0.89 percent on April 2, matching its lowest in 10 weeks. Risk
reversals measure the premium on options contracts to sell
Canadian dollars versus buying U.S. contracts that do the
opposite.  BOC Statement  The Bank of Canada’s March 6 policy statement called for
the economy to “pick up through 2013” on its way to 2 percent
annual growth. The central bank reduced its forecast in  January 
from an October prediction of 2.3 percent, and said the economy
will reach full output in the second half of 2014, at least six
months later than it previously forecast.  Canada’s dollar resumed a bearish bias after touching a
six-week high on April 4,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-
exchange and interest-rates technical strategy at Bank of
America Merill Lynch in New York, wrote in a note to clients.
This trend may see the currency decline to C$1.0448, then to its
October 2011 low of C$1.0658, he said.  The loonie has fallen 2.9 percent in the past six months
against nine developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar gained 1.4 percent
and the euro rose 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
