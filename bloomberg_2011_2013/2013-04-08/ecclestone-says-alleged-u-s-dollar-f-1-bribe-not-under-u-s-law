The U.K.’s  Bernie Ecclestone ,
accused of paying a bribe to steer a Formula One racing stake to
CVC Capital Partners Ltd., says U.S. dollar wire transfers from
a Swiss bank to an Austrian bank don’t give U.S. courts
jurisdiction in the case, as the plaintiff claimed.  Bluewaters Communications Holdings LLC, newly incorporated
in New York, sued Ecclestone in  Manhattan  in November for $650
million, saying it was the high bidder for shares in the racing
company, which it values at $10 billion. Asking a U.S. judge to
take the case, the investment firm cited the U.S. dollar
transfers, also arguing that its lawsuit falls under New York
law because Ecclestone’s refusal of its bid caused a loss of
business in the state.  That “newly minted claim” doesn’t bestow jurisdiction on
a  New York  court either, as Bluewaters is suing the F-1 chief
over an alleged bribe, not over a loss of business in New York,
Ecclestone said in an April 5 filing in state court in
Manhattan, reiterating that he isn’t subject to U.S. law as he
has no residence or business in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
