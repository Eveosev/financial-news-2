U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry
said he was “intensely focused” on advancing the Mideast
process though given the delicacy of the issue he would not be
rushed or set a timeline.  “I am intensely focused on this issue and the region
because it is vital really to American interests and regional
interest to try and advance the peace process,” Kerry told
reporters in  Jerusalem . “This festering absence of peace is
used by groups everywhere to recruit and encourage extremism.”  While mistrust between the parties was very high, “it
would be irresponsible not to explore thoroughly the
possibilities for moving forward,” Kerry said.  “I am convinced that we can break that down but I am not
going to do it under guidelines and under time limits,” the top
U.S. diplomat said. “This process should not be rushed.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
