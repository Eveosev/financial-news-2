The world’s central banks will
continue to keep  interest rates  low as loose policy in  Japan 
risks to drive up their currencies, Morgan Stanley Chief
International Economist Joachim Fels predicted.  Central banks’ monetary policy will remain accommodative
partly to help support a regime change in Japan, he said, where
central bankers are seeking to reverse a decades-long policy of
allowing deflation to reduce the burden of public debt, which is
now at 245 percent of gross domestic product.  “What we’ll see playing out this year is the third
installment of great monetary easing,” he told executives and
financiers at a conference on aircraft finance sponsored by ICBI
in Barcelona today. Given the situation in Japan, “other
central banks will be forced to keep their own policies
expansionary to prevent too much appreciation of their own
currencies,” according to Fels.  Major currencies including the dollar, the euro and the
Korean won have already gained against the yen in response to
policies by the  Bank of Japan (8301) , Fels said, predicting that “it’s
not over yet.”  The Japanese currency is the worst performer of the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes this year, having declined more than 11
percent.  The global economy will only move to “daylight from
twilight” if “politicians don’t get in the way again, as they
have so often over the past several years,” he said.  Central banks are also likely to depart from
“independence,” he said, adding their autonomy over the last
20 years was a historical episode now drawing to an end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
