Russian  shares  rebounded from last
week’s drop as crude oil, the nation’s chief export earner, rose
and power stocks advanced.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 0.8 percent to 1,427.29 by 10:58
a.m. in Moscow after a 1.5 percent retreat last week. Trading
volumes were 75 percent above the 30-day average, while 10-day
 price swings  climbed to 9.112. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$) 
added 1 percent to 1,424.43.  Crude oil climbed 0.3 percent to $93.01 in  New York , the
first advance in four days. Russia receives about half its
budget revenue from oil and natural gas. Out of 50 stocks on the
Micex, 42 rose and 8 fell. OAO MRSK Holding, the nation’s
largest electricity distribution company, jumped as much as 3.4
percent, rising 1.9 percent to 1.547 rubles, as the board of
directors decided to set its additional share issuance price at
2.79 rubles. OAO Bashneft, an oil producer, surged 3.1 percent
to 1,979.90 rubles.  After three weekly declines “we expect  Russia  to try
consolidate,” Farhan Kazmi, the head of emerging-market
equities at Credit Suisse Group AG in Moscow, said by e-mail.
Oil gains are “helpful,” he said.  Oil producer OAO Lukoil increased 0.9 percent to 1,953.4
rubles, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised the stock to buy
on 2013 dividend increase prospects and added the company to its
emerging-market focus list, according to an e-mailed note.  Novatek Attraction  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, added 0.6
percent to 232.13 rubles. Goldman reinstated the stock at
neutral, citing no catalysts for further re-rating. OAO Gazprom,
the natural-gas export monopoly, increased 1.1 percent to 131.89
rubles. Goldman Sachs cut the stock to neutral from buy, saying
increased dividends are “not likely” as 2012 profit fell 37
percent based on domestic accounting standards.  OAO Novatek, Russia’s second-biggest natural gas producer,
added 0.5 percent to 317.22 rubles. Goldman maintained the stock
at buy, calling the company the “most attractive” opportunity
in the Russian  energy industry  on asset base, “strong”
execution track record, growth profile,“high” returns.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
 stock futures , rose 4.8 percent today. The Market Vectors Russia
ETF, the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, fell
0.3 percent to $26.98 on April 5. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index (RUS14BN)  slid 0.2 percent to 94.54 in New York on April 5.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.2
times estimated earnings and has lost 3.9 percent this year,
compared with 10.5 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,
which has slid 4.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
