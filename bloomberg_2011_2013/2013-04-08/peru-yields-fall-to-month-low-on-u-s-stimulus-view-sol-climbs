Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing yields to the lowest level in a month, on speculation
the U.S. central bank will maintain its stimulus effort,
boosting demand for emerging-market debt.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due in
August 2020 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 3.75 percent at 2:28 p.m. in Lima, the lowest level since
March 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
climbed 0.08 centimo to 125.89 centimos per sol.  “There’s going to be increasing appetite” for Peru’s
bonds among foreign investors, said Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist
at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria in New York. The Andean
country is “benefiting from a global environment that’s still
supportive for fixed income.”  The U.S. Labor Department reported on April 5 that payrolls
increased by 88,000 jobs in March, smaller than the most
pessimistic forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, giving
the Federal Reserve reason to press on with $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases.  The sol appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.5750 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to data from Datatec. The central
bank bought $80 million of U.S. currency today and said on its
website it paid an average of 2.5769 soles per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
