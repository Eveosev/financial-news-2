Ireland may delay introducing water
charges agreed to as part of its international bailout accord
until 2015 as not enough meters have been installed, Finance
Minister  Michael Noonan  said.  While Ireland is scheduled to impose water charges at the
start of next year, Noonan said in comments aired today by
state-owned broadcaster RTE Radio there won’t be sufficient
metering in place nationally by then.  “Whether it’s the back end of 2014 or extends into 2015,
we’re not quite sure yet,” Noonan said on RTE Radio. The
government agreed to charge households for water under its 67.5
billion-euro ($87 billion) rescue program entered into in 2010.  The ultimate start of water charges depends on the pace of
the rollout of water meters and talks with the country’s
creditors, including the European Commission,  International
Monetary Fund  and  European Central Bank , Noonan said. Irish
authorities expect water charges to generate about 500 million
euros in 2015, according to an IMF  report  on Dec. 11  The government decided last year to set up a new utility,
 Irish Water , within its existing state-owned gas company, Bord
Gais. It has committed to publishing water services legislation
as early as the third quarter to establish “the regulatory
framework for the water sector under a national public
utility,” the IMF said in a report published last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
