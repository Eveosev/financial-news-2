LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , billionaire  Eike Batista ’s port startup, fell the most since 2011 as investors
abandon his group of natural resources and logistics companies
after his oil unit failed to deliver on production goals.  LLX, based in Rio de Janeiro, dropped 13 percent to 1.78
reais at 1:27 p.m. in Sao Paulo after tumbling as much as 15
percent, the most since Aug. 8, 2011.  OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA , Batista’s oil producer, fell 11 percent to
1.53 reais in the fifth day of losses. His oil services and
shipbuilding company  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3)  fell 11 percent.  “Some investors are throwing in the towel,” Eric Conrads,
who oversees about $750 million in Latin American stocks at ING
Investment Management, said by phone from New York. “It’s all
these companies, they’re all going in the same direction.”  LLX’s Acu project in  Rio de Janeiro  was originally
showcased as an industrial complex that would become the world’s
third-largest port, catering to clients from iron-ore miners to
carmakers. Prospective deals with  Nissan Motor (7201)  Co., steelmaker
 Ternium SA (TX)  and oil service provider Subsea 7 SA to set up plants
in the hub failed to materialize over the past 18 months.  OGX is down 65 percent this year after production at its
first offshroe oil project came in at a fraction of original
estimates, casting doubts on the quality of the Rio-based
explorer’s discoveries in the Campos Basin. OGX said March 26 it
would reduce the estimated volumes at its Tubarao Azul field
from the original 110 million barrels. Oil and gas researcher
 Wood Mackenzie  calculated the field’s recoverable reserves at 51
million barrels in an April research report.  “You can’t change the geology, there’s no magic for
that,” Conrads said.  Batista planned to have OGX bolster profits at other
companies in his group. The explorer has ordered production
vessels from OSX and plans to store and export crude from LLX’s
port.  To contact the reporter on this story:
