Investcorp SA, a Manama, Bahrain-
based alternative asset manager, has “ambitious expansion
plans” in the Persian Gulf region, said Mohammed Al-Shroogi,
president for Gulf business.  Investcorp, which has $11.5 billion of assets under
management mostly in developed markets, is planning to open
offices in countries including the  United Arab Emirates  and
Qatar, pending regulatory approvals, Al-Shroogi said in
interview at the Bloomberg Doha Conference.  Investors in the  region have regained their appetite for
real estate,  hedge funds  and private equity in the past two
years, Al-Shroogi said.  The firm’s $1 billion Gulf Opportunity Fund will be closed
in the next couple of months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
