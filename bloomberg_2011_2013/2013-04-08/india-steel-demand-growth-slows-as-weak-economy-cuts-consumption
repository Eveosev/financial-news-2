Steel consumption in  India , the
world’s third-largest user, grew at the slowest rate in four
years as a faltering economy and lack of spending on cars and
infrastructure projects eroded demand.  Steel use in the year ended March 31 is estimated to have
risen 3.3 percent to 73.3 million metric tons from a year
earlier, according to initial data on the steel ministry’s joint
plant committee website. Production rose 2.5 percent to 77.58
million tons.  Steel demand growth was less than half of the Indian
government’s 8 percent estimate as home and car buyers delayed
purchases. The economy grew 5 percent in the year ended March 31,
the slowest pace since 2003. Car sales fell for the first time
in a decade, prompting producers to cut costs.  “This is a negative surprise -- way below what we
expected,” said Abhisar Jain, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt.
in Mumbai, who expected consumption to grow about 5 percent to
5.5 percent. “Subdued car sales, lack of  government spending  on
steel-intensive infrastructure projects could have triggered the
worse-than-expected drop in demand.”  Shares of  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest producer, fell
1.1 percent to 305.90 rupees at the close in Mumbai, while  JSW
Steel Ltd. (JSTL) , the third-largest producer, declined 0.6 percent to
671.50 rupees. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
