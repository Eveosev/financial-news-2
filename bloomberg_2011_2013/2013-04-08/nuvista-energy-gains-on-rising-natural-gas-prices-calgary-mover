NuVista Energy Ltd. (NVA) , a Canadian
natural gas producer, rose to the highest in a year-and-a-half
as prices for the heating- and power-plant fuel climbed.  NuVista, based in Calgary, gained 3.4 percent to C$6.96 at
the close in Toronto, the highest since September 2011. The
company, focused on the Deep Basin area of central  Alberta , is
benefiting from North American gas prices that have doubled from
a year ago, according to Matthew Taylor, an analyst at National
Bank Financial in Calgary.  “Guys are playing the name for a gas trade right now,”
Taylor, who  rates  the company the equivalent of a hold and owns
no shares, said in a phone interview today. “On a relative
basis, compared with some of the premium Deep Basin players like
 Tourmaline (TOU) , people see value in NuVista right now.”  North American gas prices have “rocketed” since mid-
February due to colder weather forecasts and as storage levels
have lowered, Taylor said. U.S. gas prices traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, which hit a decade low in April 2012,
rose to a 20-month high in New York today on predictions cold
weather will drive heating demand and as drilling falls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
