Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) 
is seeking to acquire about $3.7 billion of U.S. real-estate
loan assets from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  The bank’s San Francisco-based UnionBanCal Corp. unit plans
to buy non-recourse loans for commercial property development,
mainly on the U.S. East Coast, from the German bank, one of the
people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are
private.  Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s biggest bank, is seeking to  expand 
loan assets abroad to counter anemic lending demand at home as
European rivals scale back to comply with tighter capital rules.
The deal would follow the 3.8 billion-pound ($5.8 billion)
acquisition in 2010 of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
project financing assets in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa.  Mitsubishi UFJ rose 3.6 percent to 629 yen as of 10:44 a.m.
in Tokyo today, outpacing the 2.5 percent rise in the benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average. (NKY)   Takayuki Inoue, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Deutsche Bank,
and Tomohiro Kohsaka, a spokesman for the Japanese lender,
declined to comment on the deal.  The deal would give Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ a portfolio
of loans for commercial property mostly in New York and Chicago,
the Nikkei Newspaper reported earlier today. Some Deutsche Bank
sales staff would join the UnionBanCal unit, the report said,
without citing sources.  To contact the reporters on this story:
