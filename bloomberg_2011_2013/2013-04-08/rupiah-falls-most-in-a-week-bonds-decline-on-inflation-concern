Indonesia ’s rupiah declined by the
most in a week and  government bonds  fell amid concern inflation
will quicken from a 22-month high after the central bank
indicated a reluctance to raise  interest rates .  Consumer prices gained 5.9 percent from a year earlier in
March, exceeding Bank Indonesia’s 2013 inflation target of 3.5
percent to 5.5 percent, official figures show. Even with March’s
increase slightly exceeding Bank Indonesia’s goal, raising the
benchmark interest rate isn’t easy, Governor Darmin Nasution
said in Jakarta on April 5.  Core consumer prices , which exclude
food and energy costs, climbed 4.21 percent last month, the
least since September.  “The rupiah’s trend is toward weakening as investors are
growing more concerned over inflation,” said Fahrudin Haris
Prastowo, foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
“The central bank is unlikely to tighten in response as  core
inflation , an indicator for  money supply , is still low.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 9,759 per dollar as of 10:12
a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest loss since April 1, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at a 0.4
percent premium to its one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
slid 0.1 percent to 9,798, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,756 on April 5 by the Association of Banks in  Singapore , from
9,752 the previous day. Today’s price will be published at 11:30
a.m. in the city-state. One-month implied volatility for the
rupiah, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to
price options, fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 5.94 percent.  Bond Outflows  Global funds sold 3.99 trillion rupiah ($409 million) more
of Indonesia’s local-currency sovereign debt than they bought
since the holdings reached an all-time high of 284.85 trillion
rupiah on March 14, finance ministry data show.  The central bank will likely keep the  reference rate 
unchanged at a record-low 5.75 percent for a 14th month when it
meets on April 11, according to all 10 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. It may narrow the gap between the benchmark rate and the
deposit facility rate, or Fasbi, from the current 4 percent,
Societe Generale SA strategist Wee-Khoon Chong wrote in a note
today.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 was up two basis points at 5.59 percent, the highest since
March 27, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
