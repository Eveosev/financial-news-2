Colombia ’s peso bond yields dropped
on speculation policy makers will lower borrowing costs further
after consumer prices rose less than expected in March.  Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.96 percent at
8:53 a.m. in Bogota, according to the central bank.  The national statistics agency reported on April 5 after
markets closed that annual inflation accelerated to 1.91 percent
in March, less than the 1.99 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Results are consistent with weak domestic demand and
economic activity and keep the door open for the central bank to
cut the monetary policy interest rate” by 25 basis points to 3
percent at the April 26 meeting, Felipe Hernandez, a  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
wrote in a research note to clients today.  The economy will indicate how low rates should go, central
bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe told bankers in Medellin on April
4. Policy makers have cut the overnight rate by 2 percentage
points since reductions began in July to 3.25 percent, including
an unexpected half-percentage cut on March 22.  Colombia will lower the policy rate to 2.5 percent, Morgan
Stanley economist  Daniel Volberg  wrote in a report last week.  Inflation was at a 57-year low of 1.83 percent in February,
below the central bank’s target range of 2 percent to 4 percent.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,818.60 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring its drop this year to 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
