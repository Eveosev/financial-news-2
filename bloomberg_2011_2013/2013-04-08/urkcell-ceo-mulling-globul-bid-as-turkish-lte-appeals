Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL)  is
seeking investments in  Turkey  while looking at reviving its bid
for Bulgarian mobile operator Cosmote Bulgaria Mobile EAD, known
as Globul, Chief Executive Officer Sureyya Ciliv said.  “There is investment opportunity in fiber, and in a two or
three year’s time frame there will be LTE investments,” Ciliv
said in an April 5 interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New
York , referring to long-term evolution networks. “Instead of
having three different networks for LTE, there may be only one
network and Turkcell will be very interested in being the
network to provide.”  Should Turkey’s national lottery be privatized, Turkcell
would also consider buying it, Ciliv said.  Turkcell had  $7 billion  in cash and equivalents at the end
of 2012, the most since the Tepebasi, Istanbul-based company
went public in 2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Turkcell
made an initial non-binding bid in November for Globul, which is
owned by  Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA. (HTO)   The company won’t make a decision on its dividend until the
issue is considered by a new board and a general  shareholders’
meeting  comes to a final decision, Ciliv said in the interview.
Turkcell’s board convened April 4, the company said in a
statement April 5.  Shares of Turkcell declined 2 percent to 12 liras in
Istanbul April 5, the biggest drop since Jan. 30. The company’s
American depositary receipts slipped 1.2 percent in New York to
$16.69. Each ADR represents 2 1/2 shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
