DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , which bid
to acquire PT Bank Danamon Indonesia last year, extended a
deadline to complete the deal with Temasek Holdings Pte by two
months as the sale awaits approval from Indonesian regulators.  The parties set a tentative date of June 2, said  Karen Ngui , a Singapore-based spokeswoman for DBS. The earlier
agreement ran through April 2, she said. Jeffrey Fang, a
Singapore-based Temasek spokesman, confirmed the contract has
been extended.  The sale has been left on hold as Indonesia’s central bank
considers approval while seeking greater access for its own
lenders in Singapore. Regulatory approval would help DBS gain
access to more profitable lending opportunities and a faster-
growing economy.  Bank Indonesia is still processing DBS’s bid, central bank
Governor Darmin Nasution said last week.  DBS said last April it would acquire 99 percent Danamon for
66.4 trillion rupiah ($6.8 billion rupiah), with the equivalent
of 45.2 trillion rupiah of that to be paid to Temasek for its
67.4 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
