Japan ’s 20-year bonds fell after the
 Bank of Japan (8301) ’s operation to buy longer-dated year debt
attracted less demand than some traders expected.  Twenty- and 30-year securities declined for the first time
in three days after the BOJ carried out its first bond buying
operation since announcing last week that it would streamline
its asset purchase programs, temporarily suspend a cap on some
bond holdings and drop a limit on debt maturities. The central
bank said today that it offered to purchase from the market a
total of 1.2 trillion yen ($12.2 billion) in debt with more than
five years to maturity on April 10.  “The BOJ’s operation to buy debt with a maturity between 5
and 10 years was strong, while the one to purchase debt with
more than 10 years to maturity was weak, leading to the bearish
move in long-term bonds,” said Atsushi Ito, Tokyo-based chief
strategist for Japanese government debt at BNP Paribas, one of
the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at the nation’s auctions.  Twenty-year yields rose nine basis points to 1.225 percent,
while 30-year rates gained seven basis points to 1.28 percent as
of 6 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note was 0.525 percent after it touched a
record low of 0.315 percent on April 5.  Bond futures for June delivery jumped as much as 1.23 to
145.25, causing the Tokyo Stock Exchange to issue a circuit
breaker, before ending the afternoon session 0.2 percent higher
at 144.34 from last week’s close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The contract’s sudden surge caused the bourse to issue the
breaker from 12:35 p.m. to 12:46 p.m. The futures tend to track
debt with seven years to maturity.  Operation Results  In today’s operation, the BOJ’s offer to buy 1 trillion yen
of bonds with maturities between 5 and 10 years attracted 2.05
trillion yen in total bids. The central bank’s operation to
purchase 200 billion yen of bonds due in more than 10 years
attracted 633.7 billion yen in total bids.  The BOJ announced on April 4 that it will buy 7 trillion
yen of bonds a month. The central bank’s monthly purchases of
 government bonds  stood at an average of about 3.4 trillion yen
in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The BOJ said it had changed the target for money-market
operations from the overnight call rate to the monetary base.  To contact the reporters on this story:
