Mikhail Beketov, editor of a
newspaper in the Moscow suburb of Khimki who survived a near-
fatal beating in 2008, died today at a hospital after choking on
food. He was 55.  Beketov was in Khimki’s hospital No. 119 for a planned
health exam when he choked on a piece of food during lunch and
his heart stopped, his lawyer Stalina Gurevich said by phone.  “He started choking, his heart stopped and attempts to
resuscitate him weren’t successful,” Gurevich said.  Beketov had a leg amputated and lost his ability to speak
as a result of the assault, which also left him confined to a
wheelchair. The perpetrators haven’t been found. The 2004 murder
of Paul Klebnikov, the U.S. editor of Forbes Inc.’s Russian
edition, and the 2006 killing of opposition journalist  Anna Politkovskaya  are among recent murders of journalists in  Russia 
that remain unsolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
