 A meeting of European Union finance
ministers in Dublin this week will provide an opportunity to
discuss an automatic exchange of information between members’
tax authorities, German Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus told reporters in Berlin today.  Kotthaus said he assumes that the European Commission and
the EU’s rotating presidency will step up efforts to “broaden
and deepen” the cross-border savings-tax directive after
Luxembourg, one of the two EU members enjoying an opt-out,
signaled it’s loosening its banking secrecy laws.  “It’s certainly a nice opportunity at an informal meeting
to look again at how we can continue, how we’re working on it,”
Kotthaus said at a regular government press conference. “The
development is very clear, it’s moving toward an automatic
information exchange, it’s moving toward improved coordination
and cooperation between states.”  Luxembourg is ready for increased collaboration with tax
authorities from other countries, Finance Minister Luc Frieden
 told  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, and doesn’t reject
“as strictly as before” an automatic information exchange. The
focus is now on  Austria , the other opt-out country, said EU Tax
Commissioner Algirdas Semeta.  “The spotlight is now on Austria,” Semeta said in a
statement. “If it continues to resist this inevitable progress
towards greater transparency, it will find itself in a lonely
and quite unsustainable position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
