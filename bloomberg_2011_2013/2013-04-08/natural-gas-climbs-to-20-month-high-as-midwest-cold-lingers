Natural gas futures advanced to a
20-month high in  New York  as meteorologists predicted that cold
weather in the Midwest will keep heating demand strong through
late April as drilling declines.  Gas gained as much as 1.3 percent. Temperatures may be
below normal in parts of the central U.S. through April 22,
according to MDA Weather Services. The number of rigs drilling
for gas in the U.S. is the lowest since 1999, data from Baker
Hughes Inc. show. Prices for the fuel may average above $4 per
million British thermal units for the rest of the year, Morgan
Stanley said in a report today.  “It’s very chilly here in the Midwest and the below-normal
temperatures have definitely played into price gains,” said
 Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago . “The rig count is at a 14-year low and we need to see
prices come up a bit for production to meet demand.”  Natural gas for May delivery rose 2.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $4.153 per million Btu at 9:02 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have climbed 24 percent this
year. Trading volume was 48 percent above the average for the
time of day. Prices advanced to $4.18, the highest intraday
level since Aug. 3, 2011, in earlier trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
