Manila ’s 12 million residents, farms
and businesses will have enough water even with El Nino, the
season of drought the country experiences each year, the
Business Mirror reported, citing two water providers and an
interview with the National Water Resources Board.  Angat Dam, which provides for 98 percent of metropolitian
Manila’s water needs, and supplies from Maynilad Water Services
Inc. and  Manila Water Co. (MWC)  assure metropolitan Manila of adequate
potable water after the rainy season, NWRB Deputy Executive
Director Jorge Estioko told the newspaper.  Contingency plans by the water providers in case of need
include intensifying leak repairs to reduce waste, deploying
water tankers and mobile treatment plants, and putting deep
wells on standby, the paper also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
