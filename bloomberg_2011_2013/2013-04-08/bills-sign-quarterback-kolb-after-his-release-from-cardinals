The Buffalo Bills signed free-agent
quarterback Kevin Kolb three weeks after he was released by the
 Arizona  Cardinals.  Kolb won 6 games and lost 8 in 14 starts over two seasons
with Arizona. He was cut on March 15. The Cardinals traded a
second-round draft pick and cornerback Dominique Rodgers-
Cromartie to the Philadelphia Eagles for Kolb in July 2011. A
year ago, they elected to give Kolb a $7 million bonus and
dropped their pursuit of Peyton Manning.  Terms of the contract werenâ€™t disclosed, the Bills said in
a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
