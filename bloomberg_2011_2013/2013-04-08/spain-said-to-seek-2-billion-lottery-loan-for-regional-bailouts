Spain  is seeking to raise a 1.5
billion-euro ($2 billion) syndicated loan through the country’s
state-run lottery operator to help fund the bailouts of regional
governments, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The five-year deal will be part of a 6 billion-euro
financing package for Sociedad Estatal Loterias & Apuestas del
Estado SA, the people said, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private. Lenders have been asked to respond
to the company’s loan request by Friday and the transaction is
due to complete by the end of the month, the people said.  Loterias may raise the remaining 4.5 billion euros later
this year with a bridge loan that would be refinanced with
bonds, said the people.  The financing will contribute to the so-called regional
liquidity mechanism, known as FLA, the people said. Spain will
lend as much as 23 billion euros this year in emergency funds to
regions in exchange for closer budget supervision, it said in
December.  Officials at the Madrid-based company did not immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment on the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
