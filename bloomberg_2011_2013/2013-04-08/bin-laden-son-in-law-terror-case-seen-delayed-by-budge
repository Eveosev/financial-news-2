A Manhattan federal judge said it
was “extremely troublesome” that the terrorism trial of Osama Bin Laden’s son-in-law could be delayed by across-the-board
 federal budget  cuts.  U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan made the comment during a
hearing today in the case of Sulaiman Abu Ghayth, Bin Laden’s
former chief spokesman. Abu Ghayth is charged with conspiring to
kill Americans before and after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks. He pleaded not guilty last month.  Lawyers for both sides suggested trial be delayed until
2014, in part because federal public defenders said they don’t
have the ability to properly defend their client in such an
international case given budget cuts and mandatory furloughs
under so-called sequestration.  “I will take that into account but the irony is that it’s
extremely troublesome to contemplate a case of this nature being
delayed because of sequestration,” Kaplan said. “Let me say
that it’s stunning.”  Abu Ghayth faces as long as life in prison if convicted of
the most serious charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
