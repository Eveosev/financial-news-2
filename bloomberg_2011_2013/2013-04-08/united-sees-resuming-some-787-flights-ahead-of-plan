United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
the only U.S. carrier with  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner, expects
to resume service earlier than planned with a May 31 flight
between Houston-Denver route.  The previous goal was to restart that service with a 787 on
June 5, pending U.S. regulators’ approval of Boeing’s proposed
upgrades to the jet’s lithium-ion batteries, said Christen David, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based United.  Boeing finished its battery tests with an April 5 flight
and said it would submit the required materials to the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA will decide whether the
fix is enough after electrical failures on a Japan Airlines Co.
plane in Boston and an  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202)  flight in  Japan  spurred
an FAA grounding order on Jan. 16.  United “will be making additional schedule changes as we
gain visibility into the timeline for certification and
modification work,” David said in an e-mail.  The airline plans to begin flying between Denver and Tokyo
with a Dreamliner on June 10 and will start “temporary” 787
service between Houston and London’s Heathrow airport the same
day, David said. Denver and Houston are both United hubs.  “This will allow us to ramp up our international 787
operations,” she said, without providing specifics. United also
plans other unspecified domestic flights using the Dreamliner,
David said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
