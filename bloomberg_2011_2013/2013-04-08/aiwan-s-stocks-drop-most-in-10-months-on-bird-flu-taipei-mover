Taiwan  stocks  slumped the most in 10
months, led by airlines, after the U.S. released weaker-than-
estimated jobs data and China reported more infections from a
deadly bird influenza.  The  Taiex Index (TWSE)  dropped 2.1 percent to 7,773.01 as of 10:05
a.m. in Taipei, heading for its biggest decline since June 4 and
falling the most among Asian markets. Shares of the island’s
carriers slumped on concern bird flu will curb  travel demand .
 China Airlines Ltd. (2610)  tumbled 6.4 percent, the most since December
2011, while  EVA Airways Corp. (2618)  lost 6.8 percent.  China reported three more cases of the deadly H7N9 strain,
bringing the total number of infections to 21. The virus has
already killed six people. Taiwan’s markets resumed trading
after being closed on April 4-5 for the holidays. The MSCI
Emerging-Markets Index fell 1.7 percent during the period.  “China’s bird flu is having a big psychological impact on
investors as Taiwan now has much closer contacts with
the mainland,” Albert King, chief investment officer at Prophet
Capital Inc. in Taipei, said by phone. “The region of eastern
China, where the bird flu has broken out, has the closest
business contacts with      Taiwan.”  China, including  Hong Kong , accounts for 40 percent of the
island’s exports, while the U.S. takes up 10 percent. Data from
the Labor Department on April 5 showed employers added less than
half the number of jobs economists forecast in March.  Health-care stocks jumped on speculation bird flu will
boost demand for drugs.  Chunghwa Chemical Synthesis & Biotech
Co. (1762)  surged 6.9 percent to NY$56. Mao Bao Inc., a manufacturer of
cleaning products, advanced 7 percent to NT$16.85.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
