Shipments of North Sea Grane crude
will rise in May, supplies of Gullfaks will be stable at six
lots while Aasgard and Statfjord will both drop by one, four
separate loading programs obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Sales of Grane will be five lots of 600,000 barrels each in
May, one more than this month, according to the plan.  Statfjord loadings will total four consignments next month,
comprised of three lots of 800,000 barrels and one of 855,000
barrels, the program showed. That compares with three 800,000
barrel cargoes and two of 855,000 in April.  The six Gullfaks lots for May are all 800,000 barrel
cargoes, according to the schedule. That compares with five of
800,000 barrels and one of 855,000 this month.  Aasgard shipments will total six consignments of 855,000
barrels and one of 1 million next month, the plan showed. April
loadings are seven cargoes, each of 855,000 barrels.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the four fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules
of crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers
and sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
