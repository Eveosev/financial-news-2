South Africa ’s army said it will
contribute troops to the United Nations intervention force in
 Democratic Republic  of Congo, days after it withdrew from
another conflict in  Central African Republic .  Xolani Mabanga, spokesman for the South African National
Defense Force, commented on the deployment in an interview
broadcast on Johannesburg-based SAfm radio today.  The government on April 4 said it would withdraw troops
from Central African Republic after 13 soldiers died in clashes
with Seleka rebels when they entered the capital, Bangui, and
ousted President Francois Bozize last month.  “We know what is the conflict” in Congo, Mabanga said
today. “We cannot say the same with the situation in the
Central African Republic.”  The UN Security Council on March 28 unanimously approved
the creation of an “intervention brigade” that can hunt down
and open fire on armed rebels in eastern Congo. Rebels known as
the M23 in November seized control of Goma, the capital of the
eastern North Kivu province, even with a UN force of 20,000
soldiers deployed in Congo. M23 withdrew from Goma in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
