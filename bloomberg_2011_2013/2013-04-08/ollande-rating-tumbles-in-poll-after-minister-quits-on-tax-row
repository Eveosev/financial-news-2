French President Francois Hollande’s
approval rating fell to a record low after his budget minister
quit over an undeclared overseas bank account.  Hollande’s performance was approved by 26 percent and
disapproved by 70 percent, according to a monthly survey by
Ipsos for Le Point magazine. That’s the worst rating since the
series began in 1996. In March, his approval rating was 31
percent and disapproval was 64 percent.  Former Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac on April 2 admitted
to lying for months about the existence of a 600,000-euro
($780,000) bank account in Switzerland that he later transferred
to  Singapore . The allegations, which Cahuzac had initially
denied, first surfaced in December and Cahuzac quit March 19
when he was placed under formal investigation.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was approved by 28 percent
of the French and disapproved by 64 percent.  The poll questioned 976 people by telephone on April 5 and
6. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
