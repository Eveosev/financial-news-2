Florida ’s catastrophe fund is set to
sell $2 billion of taxable revenue bonds this week, the biggest
municipal-debt offer since 2007 in the state, which hasn’t been
struck by a major hurricane in seven years.  The Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corp., a
state-run nonprofit that sells protection to in-state insurers,
will have a cash balance of about $9.8 billion by year-end,
compared with a maximum liability of $17 billion, said Jack Nicholson, its chief operating officer. Bond proceeds will boost
cash on hand before the storm season begins in June.  From 1851 to 2004, 273 hurricanes hit the U.S., according
to the National Hurricane Center. Florida was pounded the most
with 110 strikes, of which 35 were major storms of Category 3 or
stronger, packing winds of at least 111 miles (179 kilometers)
per hour. Wilma was the last major storm to strike the U.S.,
hitting the fourth-most populous state in 2005.  The lack of such storms “has been great for us because we
started 2006 with zero cash balance,” Nicholson said in an
interview. “We’re just preparing so we have a little cushion
built into our situation.”  The bonds will be offered with maturities of three, five
and seven years. The sale will be the second-largest of 2013,
trailing only  California ’s $2.1 billion deal in March, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Taxable muni issuance surged to $9
billion through March 29, compared with $5.8 billion for the
same period last year, the data show.  The fund has $1.3 billion in debt sold in 2008 and 2010,
Bloomberg  data  show. It issued $3.5 billion in 2007 that matured
last year. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service both
give the entity their fourth-highest grades, according to
offering documents.  Florida’s benchmark of destruction is Hurricane Andrew,
which struck in 1992 as a Category 5, the most powerful,
according to the NHC. It caused about $46 billion in damage in
the U.S., according to an inflation-adjusted NHC estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
