Grand National-winning jockey Ryan
Mania will stay in the hospital for another 24 hours after a
fall at Hexham yesterday, Sky reported.  Mania was airlifted for medical treatment after the
incident at the northeast England course, when his mount
Stagecoach Jasper came down on the final circuit of a handicap
hurdle event.  The jockey, whoâ€™d been hoping to leave the hospital today,
is in stable condition and is due to have an MRI scan later, Sky
reported without identifying its sources. He has neck and back
injuries.  Mania won the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree near
Liverpool on 66-1 shot Auroras Encore two days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
