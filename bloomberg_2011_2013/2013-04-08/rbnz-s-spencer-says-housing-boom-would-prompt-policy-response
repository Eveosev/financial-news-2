New Zealand ’s central bank said it
would revise its stance on  interest rates  if rising demand for
property, particularly in Auckland, stokes a damaging housing
boom, Deputy Governor Grant Spencer said.  “If the house price and credit expansion begins to fuel
excessive consumption spending and inflationary pressures, a
monetary policy response would become more likely,” Spencer
said in a  speech  to business leaders in Auckland. “The  Reserve
Bank ’s flat interest rate outlook in our recent monetary policy
statement would need to be revisited.”  The  New Zealand dollar  pared declines after the speech,
trading at 84.23 U.S. cents as of 4:54 p.m. in Wellington, after
touching 84.06 cents earlier today, from 84.32 cents on April 5.
 Interest rates  have been at a record low 2.5 percent since March
2011. In Auckland, home to about a third of New Zealand’s 4.4
million people, house sales and prices rose to a record in
February, Barfoot & Thompson, the city’s largest realtor, said
last week.  “There are escalating demand pressures in the Auckland
market, particularly arising from low interest rates and an
easier supply of credit,” Spencer said. “It is important that
these pressures moderate in order to avoid a destabilizing
overshooting of house prices while additional supply is
gradually brought on stream.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
