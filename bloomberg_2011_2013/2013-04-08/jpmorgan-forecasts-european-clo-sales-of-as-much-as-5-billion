Collateralized loan obligations will
raise $3 billion to $5 billion in Europe this year, according to
a forecast from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   CLO formation in the region will increase global issuance
to as much as $75 billion, JPMorgan analysts led by London-based
Rishad Ahluwalia wrote in an April 5 report.  The spread for the AAA rated portion of European CLOs may
be at about 120 basis points by the end of 2013, according to
the research report, which cited the results of a survey from 81
clients. For U.S. deals, the respondents see spreads at 90 basis
points to 100 basis points.  Apollo Global Management LLC and Pramerica Investment
Management Ltd. are marketing European CLOs which may price the
top-ranked notes at about 135 basis points more than the euro
interbank offered rate, people with knowledge of the matter
said.  London-based Cairn Capital Ltd. sold its 300.5 million-euro
deal in February with the AAA piece at 140 basis points more
than Euribor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
