BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemical maker, will cut its 2015 sales and profit targets
should the asset swap with Gazprom take place as planned, said
Peter Spengler, an analyst at  DZ Bank  AG.  The chemical maker may cut its target for earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to 13 billion euros
($17 billion) from 14 billion euros, Spengler said today in a
note to clients. The 2015 sales forecast may be reduced to 70
billion euros from 80 billion euros and an earnings per share
target to 7 euros from 7.50 euros, he said.  BASF said last month the planned asset swap with Gazprom
wasn’t taken into account when it reduced its expectations for
2015 and 2020 because of accounting-rule changes. A further cut
of the size expected by Spengler would mean 2015 sales slipping
below 72.1 billion euros, the level of 2012 under the new
accounting rules.  Jennifer Moore-Braun, spokeswoman for Ludwigshafen,
Germany-based BASF, declined to comment on potential new
forecasts, reiterating the asset swap isn’t taken into account
under the existing ones.  The swap, to close by the end of 2013, involves an exit
from natural-gas trading and storage as well as assets in oil
exploration and production in the  North Sea  that contributed 10
billion euros to 2012 sales and about 500 million euros to
Ebitda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
