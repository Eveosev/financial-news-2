Japanese shares rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  recording its highest close in 4 1/2
years, after the yen weakened to its lowest level since June
2009, boosting the earnings outlook for exporters.  Honda Motor Co., which gets about 80 percent of its sales
outside of Japan, gained 3.7 percent as just four stocks fell on
the benchmark gauge. Tokyo Tatemono Co. jumped 16 percent, the
most on the Nikkei 225, after Credit Suisse AG named the
property developer among its top picks. Shinsei Bank Ltd. led a
gain by lenders. Takashimaya Co., Japan’s third-biggest
department-store operator by market value, advanced 9.7 percent
after the Nikkei newspaper said its operating profit rose.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2.8 percent to 13,192.59 at the close
of trading in Tokyo, its highest close since Aug. 12, 2008.
Volume on the measure was 39 percent higher than its 30-day
average as 218 companies advanced, the most since Jan. 4. The
 Topix Index (TPX)  rose 3.3 percent to 1,101.74, with about 12 shares
rising for each that fell.  “There are many more benefits to companies than there are
negatives if the yen trades at around 100 yen to the dollar,”
said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based fund manager at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $38 billion. “Exporters
that are globally competitive, such as car, tire and machinery
manufacturers, will benefit the most. The market hasn’t fully
priced in the positive earnings outlook for the fiscal year
ending March 2014.”  Topix Groups  All of the 33  industry groups  on the Topix rose today, led
by consumer-finance companies and brokerages. Banks and
exporters such as carmakers and consumer electronic
manufacturers provided the  biggest boost  to the Topix. The gauge
is trading at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Honda, Japan’s second-biggest automaker by market value,
gained 3.7 percent to 3,805 yen.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
biggest brokerage, jumped 10 percent to 663 yen, taking its
advance since November to 133 percent. Mitsui Fudosan Co.,
Japan’s largest property developer by sales, advanced 6 percent
to 3,510 yen, its highest level since July 2007.  The Topix jumped 48 percent from mid-November through April
5 as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation.  The yen touched 98.85 per dollar, its lowest level since
June 2009, amid concern Bank of Japan measures to fight
deflation, announced last week, will debase the currency.  BOJ Easing  BOJ officials said on April 4 the central bank will
increase its monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen ($76
billion), exceeding the 5.2 trillion yen forecast by economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. They also suspended a cap on some bond
holdings and dropped a limit on debt maturities, while also
setting a two-year horizon for their goal of 2 percent
inflation.  Among other stocks that rose, Tokyo Tatemono surged 16
percent to 994 yen, its highest level since January 2008. The
Bank of Japan’s quantitative easing measures mean that “now may
be the time to just swing for the fences in real estate
investment given the prospect of an easy home run,” wrote
Credit Suisse analyst Masahiro Mochizuki in a report today. He
named Tokyo Tatemono among his top picks for real estate stocks
on a likely improvement in quality for its property holdings.  Takashimaya jumped 9.7 percent to 1,099 yen, the most since
2007. The department store operator, up 22 percent through the
last five trading days, may report a 20 percent increase in
operating profit to 25.5 billion yen, the Nikkei reported.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4 percent to
29.79 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8.5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
