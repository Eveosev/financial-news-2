Avon Products Inc. (AVP) , the door-to-door
cosmetics seller, will exit Ireland and cut 400 jobs worldwide
as part of a plan to save $400 million by 2016.  Operations in smaller, underperforming markets, primarily
in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, will be restructured or
closed, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Avon expects $35 million to $40 million in pretax costs and
about $20 million will be booked in the first quarter.  Today’s reductions follow an announcement last year to
eliminate 1,500 jobs and leave the South Korean and Vietnam
markets as Chief Executive Officer Sheri McCoy works to cut
costs. In February, Avon said it would evaluate alternatives for
the Silpada jewelry unit, where sales fell 18 percent in the
 fourth quarter .  Avon  rose  1.7 percent to $20.61 at the close in New York.
The shares surged 44 percent this year, compared with a 9.6
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
