Tidal Lagoon Plc is seeking 10
million pounds ($15 million) from investors to start developing
a 650 million-pound project in the U.K.’s southwest that will
use the tide to produce power.  The company plans to build a 250-megawatt so-called tidal
lagoon across Swansea Bay in Wales that will produce enough
electricity to power as many as 107,000 homes a year, it said
today in a statement on its website. The project will use
changes in the tides to produce power.  Tidal Lagoon plans to raise the first 5 million pounds as
Enterprise Investment Scheme shares, a U.K. government-backed
system offering tax breaks to investors in “higher-risk”
companies. The remaining funds will be non-EIS qualifying shares
and will be used to help the company secure planning consent,
which is expected in October next year.  “The U.K. imports 65 percent of its energy needs from
sources such as Qatar LPG, French nuclear electricity,
Australian coal and Saudi oil,” Mark Shorrock, chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “We’re creating the world’s
first bi-directional hydropower plant and the lagoon will
produce carbon savings in excess of 200,000 tons of carbon
dioxide a year.”  Britain is aiming to get 15 percent of its energy from
clean sources by 2020.  If planning approval is granted, the company will need to
raise another 650 million pounds from pension funds and banks,
according to the statement. Once the project is working,
probably in the middle of 2017, Tidal Lagoon sees returns of
more than four-and-a-half times the initial investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
