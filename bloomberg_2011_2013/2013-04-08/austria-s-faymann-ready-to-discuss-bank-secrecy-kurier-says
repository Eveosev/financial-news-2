Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann
is ready to discuss with European Union partners how to better
share data on foreigners’ bank holdings in the country,  Kurier 
reported.  “We’re ready to negotiate to improve the transfer of bank-
account data to better fight tax fraud,” Faymann was cited as
saying in an interview with the Austrian newspaper. “How this
will be done will be the result of negotiations in the EU, but
we will definitely cooperate fully.”  Faymann’s comments come after Luxembourg’s Finance Minister
Luc Frieden signaled over the weekend the Duchy is loosening its
opposition against EU savings-tax proposals. Talks about the
plan have stalled since last year due to  Austria ’s and
Luxembourg’s vetoes on concerns that they would be forced to
give up bank-secrecy constraints.  Faymann said he will discuss the measures with his
conservative government-coalition partners, including Finance
Minister Maria Fekter. Fekter has said she opposes any easing of
Austrian bank-secrecy rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
