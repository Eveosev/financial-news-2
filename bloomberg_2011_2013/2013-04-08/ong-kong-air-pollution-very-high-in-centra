Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at the Central business district’s roadside-
monitoring station, according to the Environmental Protection
Department.  The index was 102 as of 6 a.m. local time, according to
data published on its website today. The reading for  Causeway
Bay  was 78 and  Mong Kok  was 92.  Roadside pollution of more than 100 triggers a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
