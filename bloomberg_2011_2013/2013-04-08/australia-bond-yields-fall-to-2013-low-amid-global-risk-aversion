Australia’s bond yields slid to the
lowest this year as bird influenza in  China , tension surrounding
 North Korea  and signs of a slowing U.S. economy boosted demand
for the safety of government debt.  The South Pacific nation’s currency, known as the Aussie,
fell to a three-week low after local data showed the
construction industry shrank at a faster pace in March than the
prior month. The currency declined to the weakest since February
against New Zealand’s dollar.  “I see the Aussie going lower,” said  Imre Speizer , a
strategist in Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s
second-biggest lender. “Global  risk aversion ” is pushing
Australian government yields lower, he said.  The rate on Australia’s current 10-year note declined eight
basis points to 3.23 percent as of 10:38 a.m. in Sydney after
touching 3.18 percent, the lowest since Dec. 12.  The Australian dollar slid to $1.0348, the weakest since
March 18, before trading at $1.0372, down 0.1 percent from the
close on April 5. It lost as much as 0.6 percent to NZ$1.2242, a
level unseen since Feb. 20. New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed
the kiwi, fell 0.2 percent to 84.16 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
