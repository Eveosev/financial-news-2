The Bank of Korea will keep its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged this week, running counter to
forecasts by some economists for a quarter-percentage point
reduction, according to Barclays Plc’s investment banking unit.  A central bank decision to hold borrowing costs may provide
some support to the won, which lost 6.6 percent against the
dollar this year as a slide in the yen threatened South Korean
exports and as tensions with North Korea increased, Barclays
analysts including London-based  Chris Walker  wrote in a report
yesterday. The BOK’s monetary committee, chaired by Governor Kim Choong Soo, meets April 11.  Government bond yields have fallen to record lows as nine
out of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted policy
makers will cut the seven-day repurchase rate to as low as 2.25
percent this quarter from 2.75 percent. The amount paid by
three-year government  bonds  fell four basis points to 2.44
percent on April 5, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yen tumbled to the lowest level since 2009 against the
dollar after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  under its new governor,  Haruhiko
Kuroda , announced a plan last week to double monthly bond
purchases to 7 trillion yen ($73 billion). The BOK said on April
4 that a sharp depreciation of the yen may hurt South Korean
exporters as relative gains in the won erode competitiveness.
 South Korea  said today the communist North may be preparing to
conduct simultaneous nuclear and missile tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
