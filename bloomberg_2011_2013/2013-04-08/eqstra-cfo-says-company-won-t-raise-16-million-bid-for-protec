Eqstra Holdings Ltd. (EQS) , a South
African mining equipment-leasing company, said it won’t increase
its 60 cents a share offer for  Protech Khuthele Holdings Ltd. (PKH) 
after the bid was rejected.  “We believe that 60 cents is a fair and reasonable price
that will unlock value for shareholders,” Johannesburg-based
Eqstra’s Chief Financial Officer Jannie Serfontein said in a
phone interview today. “We are not going to pay for prospects
which are on paper.”  The company already owns 32.77 percent of Protech, and is
offering to pay 146 million rand ($16 million) for the shares it
does not already own. That would value the company at 218
million rand, Eqstra said in a statement on Feb. 22.  Protech, which has interests in civil engineering and
mining, said on April 5 the offer “significantly undervalues
the company and is unfair and unreasonable.” Its shares fell as
much as 5.7 percent, the most in more than a month, and were
down 3.8 percent at 51 rand by 2:07 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Protech shareholders should now be left to decide on
whether to accept the offer, Serfontein said. Eqstra  shares 
traded 0.3 percent higher at 6.44 rand, valuing the company at
2.7 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
