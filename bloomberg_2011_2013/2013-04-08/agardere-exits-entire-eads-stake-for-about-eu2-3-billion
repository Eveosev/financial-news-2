Lagardere SCA (MMB)  said it is exiting
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. through a stake sale
today valued at about 2.3 billion euros ($2.9 billion).  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Bank of America 
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit are offering 61.1 million EADS shares
for Lagardere’s holding unit Sogeade in a price range between
37.35 euros and 37.95 euros apiece, according to a term sheet
obtained by  Bloomberg News . The stake is valued at 2.3 billion
euros at the high end of the range.  EADS, Europe’s largest aerospace company, will take part by
placing an order of 500 million euros, Lagardere said in a
statement today. Lagardere is selling its entire 7.35 percent
stake in EADS.  Lagardere, a Paris-based media company, said on April 5
that it would dispose its stake in EADS by July 31. The EADS
board appointed Denis Ranque as chairman and supported a 3.75
billion-euro stock buyback on April 2.  Additional share sales, including accelerated transactions,
have raised $24.8 billion in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa
this year, compared with $17.5 billion sold in the same period
in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stake is valued at about 2.4 billion euros based on
today’s closing price of 38.71 euro per share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
