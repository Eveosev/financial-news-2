English Premier League soccer teams
Chelsea and Manchester City will play an exhibition game at
Yankee Stadium in New York on May 25.  The end-of-season game is two days after a sold-out match
between the teams at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Chelsea said in
an e-mailed statement.  Chelsea played Paris Saint-Germain at Yankee Stadium last
year in the first soccer game at the baseball venue, which
opened in 2009.  Spending a week in St. Louis and New York “provides a
great opportunity for the club to reconnect with our U.S. fans
before we head to Asia in July for preseason,” Chelsea Chief
Executive Officer Ron Gourlay said in the statement.  Chelsea, which won  Europe ’s Champions League last year,
will meet City, last season’s Premier League champion, in the
semifinals of  England ’s F.A. Cup on April 14.  City trails Manchester United by 15 points in the league
this season and the teams meet tonight. Chelsea is four points
further back in third.  To contact the reporters on this story:
