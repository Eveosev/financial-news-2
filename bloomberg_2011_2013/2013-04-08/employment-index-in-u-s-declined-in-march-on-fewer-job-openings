A measure of U.S. job prospects in
March declined for the first time in six months, indicating a
pause in the recent progress of the labor market.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index decreased
0.2 percent to 111.2 after climbing in the prior month to a
revised 111.43, which was the highest level since June 2008, the
New York-based private research group said today. The measure
rose 3.7 percent from March 2012.  Today’s report follows Labor Department figures released
last week that showed the job market slipped in March as
employers hired fewer workers than forecast.  The index “is still signaling moderate job growth in the
coming months,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research
at the Conference Board, said today in a statement. “The
current trend suggests faster growth than the disappointing
increase of 88,000 jobs in March. At the same time, 200,000 new
jobs per month in the current economic environment is not in the
cards either.”  The 88,000 gain in payrolls was the smallest in nine months
and less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
survey, after a revised 268,000 February increase, Labor
Department figures showed on April 5. The jobless rate  fell  to
7.6 percent, the lowest since December 2008, from 7.7 percent.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. On average, it
can signal a rebound in hiring as little as three months before
the fact and can predict job declines six to nine months in
advance, the Conference Board said.  Four of the eight components in the index deteriorated last
month, led by a smaller share of firms with positions they’re
not able to fill right now, a pickup in initial jobless claims
and fewer  job openings .  To contact the reporter on this story:
