J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  surged in late
trading after CNBC reported that  Ron Johnson  was ousted as the
department-store chain’s chief executive officer.  The shares rose 8.1 percent to $17.15 at 5:02 p.m. in New
York. The Plano, Texas-based company had lost half of its market
value from Nov. 1, 2011, the day Johnson started, through the
close of regular trading today.  The departure comes after a dismal first year on the job
for Johnson, who arrived at J.C. Penney with great fanfare after
building Apple Inc.’s network of stores. Johnson has been trying
to transform most of the company’s stores into collections of
boutiques and removing sales and coupons in a shift to everyday
low prices.  J.C. Penney’s sales in the year ending Feb. 2, plunged 25
percent to $13 billion, the lowest since at least 1987.  The company will issue a press release shortly, Daphne
Avila, a company spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail while
declining to provide more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
