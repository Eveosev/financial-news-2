Hedge funds  reduced bets on a
commodity rally by the most since 2008 as rising supplies of
everything from copper to sugar and slowing U.S. growth drove
prices to the biggest slump in six months.  Speculators cut net-long  positions  across 18 U.S. futures
and options by 31 percent to 468,780 contracts in the week ended
April 2, the most since October 2008, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. Investors are betting on a decline
in  silver  for the first time and have record bearish positions
in copper and sugar. Corn wagers dropped the most since June
2010, leading the biggest ever decline in agricultural holdings.  Silver, rubber and corn entered bear markets last week,
joining declines in raw materials from coffee to wheat, on signs
that production will outpace demand. The commodities supercycle,
or longer-than-average period of rising prices, has ended and
returns are unlikely to match the performance of the past
decade, UBS AG said April 2. U.S. employers hired the fewest
workers in nine months in March, and the jobless rate in the 17-
nation euro area rose to a record.  “There has been a gradual buildup in supplies, and that is
especially challenging because slowdown concerns are growing,”
said Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist in  Seattle  at
U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees about $110 billion
of assets. “We’re awash in supplies, so I see prices remaining
under pressure until the growth issue gets resolved.”  GSCI Slump  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
slumped 4.1 percent last week, the most since September. The
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities fell 1.3 percent, while
the dollar slid 0.6 percent against a basket of six trading
partners. Treasuries returned 1 percent, a Bank of America Corp.
index shows. The GSCI index rose 0.3 percent today to 631.06 at
12:46 p.m. New York time.  Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Plc raised their
forecasts for this year’s copper surplus last week. Supplies
will also outpace demand for aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc
this year, Barclays Plc said April 4. U.S. crude-oil  stockpiles 
reached the highest in more than 22 years in the week ended
March 29, a government report showed April 3.  Payrolls in the U.S. grew by 88,000 workers last month,
less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
the Labor Department said April 5. American services industries,
which account for almost 90 percent of the economy, expanded in
March at the slowest pace in seven months, a private report
showed April 3. The U.S. is the top consumer of corn and crude
oil and the second-biggest metals user.  Worst Start  The GSCI gauge will be at 644 at the end of June, 2.2
percent higher than now, according to the median of nine
investor and analyst predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The
index has dropped 2.6 percent this year, the worst start since
2003, with 19 of the 24 raw materials dropping. Investors are
holding net-short positions in seven of the 18 commodities
tracked in the CFTC data.  Slowing economies will mean increased global stimulus
measures, boosting prospects for a commodity rebound, said
 Quincy Krosby , a market strategist for  Newark , New Jersey-based
Prudential Financial Inc., which oversees more than $1 trillion
of assets.  ECB, BOJ  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said April 4
that policy makers “stand ready to act” and the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
said last week it will double the monetary base by the end of
2014 through purchases of  government bonds , its biggest-ever
round of asset purchases. The  Federal Reserve  said March 20 that
it will continue with $85 billion in monthly bond buying.  The Fed, the ECB and the BOJ have more than doubled the
combined size of their balance sheets since the global financial
crisis erupted in 2007, expanding them by a total of $4.7
trillion. The programs helped revive economies and sent the GSCI
up 85 percent from the end of 2008 through 2012.  “The accommodative policy in the U.S. will continue,”
Krosby said. “With more stimulus in  Europe  and  Japan , we will
see the commodities basket gain traction.”  Contracts outstanding  across the members of the S&P GSCI
jumped 11 percent this year to 13.37 million, the highest since
the data begins in January 2006. Money managers boosted bullish
positions by 67 percent in the previous three weeks, the biggest
such advance since May 2009, on signs the U.S. was accelerating.  ‘Excess Optimism’  “There had been some excess optimism, and now with signs
of cooling, we are seeing some concerns emerge,” said  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management,
which oversees about $48 billion. “People will be looking at
every number that comes out of the U.S. very carefully.”  Fund managers withdrew $1.19 billion from commodity funds
in the week ended April 3,  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows, said in an e-mail. Outflows from gold funds
totaled $930 million.  Investors are holding a silver net-short position of 2,982
contracts, the CFTC data show. That compares with a long
position of 632 a week earlier and is the first bet on a decline
since the data begins in 2006. Bullish gold wagers tumbled 22
percent to 47,164, the lowest in three weeks.  Copper Bears  The copper net-short  holding  increased to 38,951 futures
and options, the most since at least 2006 and compares with
30,036 a week earlier. Supplies of the metal will outpace demand
by 97,000 metric tons this year, up from a March forecast of
92,000 tons, Barclays said in an April 4 report.  A  measure  of speculative positions across 11 agricultural
products plunged 67 percent to 101,646 contracts, the biggest
cut since the data begins in 2006.  The Standard & Poor’s Agriculture Index of eight
commodities declined 21 percent from a closing peak on July 20,
including a 24 percent slump in wheat, which entered a bear
market in early January. Soybeans, down 22 percent from a
closing high in September, first reached a bear market in
November. Coffee and sugar also are in bear markets.  U.S. corn, wheat and soybean inventories before the 2013
harvests probably will be larger than the government forecast
last month, according to a survey of as many as 35 analysts by
Bloomberg. The Department of Agriculture will update its crop
outlook on April 10. Farmers will plant the most corn this year
since 1936, the USDA forecasts.  “Supplies are rising at a time when fundamentals are
already weak,” said John Toohey, a  San Antonio , Texas-based
vice president of equity investments at USAA Investments, which
manages about $55 billion of assets. “The structural problems
in Europe remain and signs of slowdown in the U.S. do not augur
well for commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
