YPF SA (YPFD) , the state-run Argentine oil
company, fell to the lowest in a month after a flood and fire at
its largest refinery led it to cut its production outlook.  YPF  dropped  2.7 percent to 115.30 pesos at 3:43 p.m. in
Buenos Aires after declining to 114.80 pesos, the lowest
intraday since March 5, while its American depositary receipts
fell 2.5 percent to $13.63 in New York.  Argentina ’s benchmark
 Merval (MERVAL)  index rose 1.3 percent.  YPF’s La Plata refinery, the country’s largest, will cut
daily output of 28,500 cubic meters (180,000 barrels) by 15
percent until at least the end of this year, the company said
today in an e-mailed response to questions. YPF declined to
elaborate on the timing for repairs and for a full recovery of
production.  “Investors are punishing the stock because of an immense
lack of information,” Juan Pablo Vera, the chief analyst at
Buenos Aires-based brokerage Tavelli & Cia., said by telephone.
“It’s unclear if YPF will have to subsidize fuel imports to
supply the market.”  Pablo Dorfman, a YPF press official, declined to comment on
the stock’s performance in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
