Spanish bonds rose, pushing two-year
yields below 2 percent for the first time since 2010, as
investors sought the euro area’s higher-yielding government
securities, spurred by central bank plans to boost liquidity.  Italian two-year yields slipped to the least in more than
two months while Austrian and French borrowing costs fell to
records. A report today will show German  industrial production 
increased in February, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Portuguese bonds slumped, pushing yields to the most
in more than a month, after the  Constitutional Court  blocked a
plan to suspend a monthly salary payment to state workers and
pensioners.  “Investors are focusing on return,” said  Richard McGuire ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
 London . “It’s very hard to fight this liquidity rally and we
are in uncharted territory because you’ve got record lows and
record liquidity.”  The yield on Spain’s 2.75 percent securities maturing March
2015 declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
2.02 percent at 8:31 a.m. London time. It dropped earlier today
to 1.97 percent, the least since Oct. 26, 2010. The price
advanced 0.07 or 70 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,300) face
amount, to 101.4.  Italy’s two-year rates fell four basis points to 1.46
percent.  France ’s 10-year yield fell to a record-low 1.709 percent
and Austria’s declined to 1.46 percent.  Spanish bonds handed investors a return of 1.8 percent this
month through April 5, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bunds earned 0.7 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year bunds rose one basis point today to 1.22
percent. Portugal’s 10-year yield increased 14 basis points to
6.50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
