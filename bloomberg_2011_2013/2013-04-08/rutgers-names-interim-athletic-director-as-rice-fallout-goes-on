Rutgers University  named Carl Kirschner as interim athletic director to replace Tim Pernetti,
who resigned last week amid questions over his handling of
evidence that the men’s basketball coach physically and verbally
abused players.  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based university also
announced the formation of a search committee to seek a
permanent successor to Pernetti, President Robert Barchi said in
an e-mailed release.  Kirschner is special counsel for academic programs in the
Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, and
was dean of Rutgers College for 13 years. He also was  chairman
of a Rutgers committee that reviewed the applications of
prospective Rutgers athletes and monitored their academic
progress.  “His many years of  service  to the university community and
to our student athletes give me every confidence in his ability
to oversee the Rutgers athletics program until we find a new
athletic director,” Barchi said in the statement.  Pernetti resigned on April 5, three days after a national
telecast of a video showed coach Mike Rice physically punishing
players by throwing balls at their heads in practice and
verbally attacking them with vulgarities and gay slurs. Rice,
who was originally suspended for three games and fined $50,000
for what the school called “inappropriate behavior and
language,” was fired a day after the video went public.  The search committee for a permanent athletic director will
be led by Kate Sweeney, senior vice president and certified
financial planner with  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in  New Brunswick ,  New
Jersey , and Richard Edwards, executive vice president for
academic affairs, according to the release. The remainder of the
committee will be named in the near future, Barchi said in the
release, and will represent a “broad cross-section” of the
Rutgers community.  To contact the reporter on this story:
