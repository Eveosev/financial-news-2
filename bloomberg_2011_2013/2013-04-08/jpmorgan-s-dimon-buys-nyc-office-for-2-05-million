Jamie Dimon , chairman and chief
executive officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , bought a commercial
co-op unit on the ground floor of his Manhattan apartment
building for $2.05 million.  Dimon, 57, and his wife, Judy, completed the purchase of
the property at 1185 Park Ave. on March 22, according to records
made public today by the  New York  City Department of Finance.
The couple own a 16th-floor residence in the building.  The sellers of the commercial co-op were listed as Stephen
Marks and George Ellis, cardiologists whose practice was located
at the address. The unit is one of 11 on the ground floor of the
building, located between 93rd and 94th Streets.  “They’re professional offices” said  Jonathan Miller ,
president of New York-based appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. “Most
of the time it’s a doctor, a psychologist, any type of medical
practice. It’s not uncommon for it to be a place to write a
book, or just a place to work, or have a private office.”  Miller’s firm has appraised other ground-floor offices in
the building. He wasn’t involved in Dimon’s deal.  Daniela Kunen, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate
who listed the property for sale, didn’t immediately return a
telephone message seeking comment on the deal. Mark Kornblau, a
JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.  October Listing  Maintenance is $6,663 a month for the 2,577-square-foot
(239-square-meter) unit, which has 12 rooms and two half-baths.
It was put on the market in October for $2.4 million, according
to the listing.  The Dimons bought their apartment in the building in
November 2004 for $4.88 million, according to public records.  Dimon’s pay for 2012 was cut in half by JPMorgan’s board
after an internal review found him partly responsible for a
series of botched trades on  credit derivatives  that lost the
bank more than $6.2 billion.  The review also credited his leadership for the lender’s
performance. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, reported
a third straight year of record profits in 2012 with $21.3
billion in net income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
