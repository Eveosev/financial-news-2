Jamaica may receive as much as $958
million from the International Monetary Fund after the Caribbean
island restructured about $9 billion in local debt for the
second time in three years.  Jamaica, which reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF
for a $750 million loan last year, has made progress in reaching
a four-year accord that included “efforts to complete the prior
actions and structural benchmarks, and on the assembling of a
financing package,” the Washington-based IMF said today in an
e-mailed statement. The IMF’s board will consider approving the
loan by the end of April.  “The success of this program crucially depends on full and
timely policy implementation by Jamaica of a coordinated set of
reforms to strengthen the public finances, restore debt
sustainability, enhance growth, and bolster the resilience of
the financial sector,” the Washington-based lender said in the
statement.  Jamaica’s economy contracted 0.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year as the country struggled from the impact of
 Hurricane Sandy . Central bank reserves fell below $1 billion in
February for the first time since 2001.  In a national address on Feb. 11, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller said the drop in interest payments will enable
the government to cut its debt from 140 percent of gross
domestic product to 95 percent over the next seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
