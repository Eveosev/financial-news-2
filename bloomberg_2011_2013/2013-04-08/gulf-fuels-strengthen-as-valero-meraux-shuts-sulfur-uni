Gulf Coast spot fuels strengthened
versus futures as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a sulfur recovery
unit at its Meraux, Louisiana, refinery. Crack spreads gained
the most in more than six weeks.  Valero’s 135,000-barrel-a-day Meraux plant idled the unit
after a power interruption, said Bill Day, a company spokesman
based in San Antonio. The  3-2-1 crack spread  for Gulf
refineries, a rough measure of refining margins based on West
 Texas  Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , rose $2.17 to $24.15 a
barrel, the most since Feb. 22, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The sulfur unit closing, along with crude unit maintenance
at Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, may be
drawing from supplies along the Gulf. The area’s inventories of
gasoline were  74.2 million  barrels last week, while  distillate
stockpiles  were 36.1 million, Energy Information Administration
data showed.  The discount for  conventional , 87-octane gasoline narrowed
by 3 cents to 19.5 cents a gallon below futures traded on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:01 p.m., the lowest level in
two weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Reformulated
gasoline, or RBOB, strengthened 3.25 cents to 3 cents a gallon
below futures, while ultra-low-sulfur  diesel  increased 0.25 cent
to trade at a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
