Serbia is accepting bids for state-
owned farm-equipment maker Industrija Masina i Traktora AD in a
third attempt to sell its 94.5 percent stake.  The Belgrade-based company, known as IMT, had a 609
million-dinar ($7 million) operating loss last year on
production of just 1,000 tractors, according to a statement
posted today on the  Privatization Agency ’s website.  Potential suitors have a week to express interest in IMT’s
assets, which include a 36 hectare (89 acre) compound in a
residential area of the Serbian capital.  The government has already tried twice before to sell the
factory that used to make 40,000 tractors annually before the
collapse of the market in the former  Yugoslavia . Last month, the
government said Turkish tractor maker  Tumosan Motor Ve Traktor
Sanayi AS (TMSN) , part of  Albayrak  group, was interested in cooperating
with IMT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
