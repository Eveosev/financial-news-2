Palm oil gained as a survey showed
that inventories in  Malaysia  probably fell the most in more than
two years in March as exports increased for the first time in
five months from the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in June advanced as much as 1.3
percent to 2,390 ringgit ($783) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, before trading at 2,377 ringgit at 11:44
a.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures lost 0.8 percent last week.  Inventories declined 7 percent to 2.27 million tons from
February, the steepest monthly drop since January 2011,
according to the median of estimates from two plantation
companies and four analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Output gained
2.3 percent to 1.33 million tons, while exports rose 2.1 percent
to 1.43 million, the survey showed. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board
is scheduled to release the official data on April 10.  “If stockpiles were drawn down to somewhere below 2.3
million tons, that would be an encouraging figure,” said Donny Khor, associate director for futures and options at OSK
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Production is not likely
to rebound strongly in April, so as long as the export numbers
are about the same as March, I think stockpiles can be drawn
down another 50,000 tons.”  Inventories have fallen 7.2 percent to 2.44 million tons in
February from a record 2.63 million tons reached in December,
according to the board.  Soybean oil for May delivery gained 0.8 percent to 49.24
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in May climbed 0.9 percent to $13.745 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery rose 1.1 percent to
6,282  yuan  ($1,012) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained 0.7 percent to
7,916 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
