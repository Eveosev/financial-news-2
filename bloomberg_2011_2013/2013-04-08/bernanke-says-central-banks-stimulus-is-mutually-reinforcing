Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that expansionary monetary policies in the world’s
largest countries are “mutually constructive.”  Monetary stimulus from global central banks “is providing
additional support for other countries through stronger
financial markets, more exports,” Bernanke said in response to
audience questions at a conference in Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  Bernanke compared today’s policies to countries leaving the
gold standard during the Great Depression and reflating their
economies.  “The fact that every country was doing the same thing was
mutually reinforcing,” he said of the 1930s. “There’s an
analogy between this 1930s experience and what we’re seeing in
the world today.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
