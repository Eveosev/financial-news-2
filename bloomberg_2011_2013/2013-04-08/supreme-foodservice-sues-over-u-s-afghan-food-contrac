Supreme Foodservice AG sued the U.S.
government challenging the Defense Department’s awarding a
competitor a $10 billion contract for distributing food products
in  Afghanistan .  The suit was filed under seal in the  U.S. Court of Federal
Claims  in  Washington  so details of Amsterdam-based Supreme’s
complaint weren’t available.  A companion filing said that the suit is related to
Supreme’s litigation seeking to halt competitor Anham FZCO’s
work under the new contract awarded by the  Defense Logistics
Agency Troop Support .  While the cases “involve the same contract” and
“procurement and some background information could be common,
the present case challenges a different agency action -- DLA’s
contract award to Anham -- and, with some exceptions, is based
on different key documents,” wrote Thomas P. Humphrey, of
Crowell & Moring LLP, an attorney for Supreme.  Humphrey and David Bodenheimer, another attorney on the
case, didn’t return telephone calls seeking more information
about the suit.  Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for DLA, didn’t
immediately return a phone call requesting comment.  Anham today filed a motion to intervene in the case. Eric Marcotte, of Vedder Price PC, an attorney for Dubai-based Anham,
declined to comment, saying that because the complaint still is
under seal, he hadn’t had a chance to review it.  The current case is Supreme Foodservice v. U.S., 13-cv-
00245, and the earlier case is Supreme Foodservice v. U.S., 13-
cv-001, U.S. Court of Claims (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
