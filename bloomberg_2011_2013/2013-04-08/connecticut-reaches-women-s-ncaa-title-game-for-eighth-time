The University of  Connecticut 
reached the championship game of college basketball’s national
women’s tournament for the eighth time with an 83-65 win over
the University of Notre Dame.  Freshman Breanna Stewart scored a career-high 29 points
last night to lead UConn, which had lost seven of its previous
eight meetings against Notre Dame, including Final Four defeats
in each of the previous two seasons.  “For 40 minutes, we competed and played as hard as we’re
capable of,” Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma said at a news
conference. “I couldn’t be happier or more proud of them. We’ve
come a long way and this is really rewarding.”  Connecticut (34-4) will play Louisville (30-8) in tomorrow
night’s title game in New Orleans after the Cardinals beat
California 64-57 in yesterday’s other national semifinal. UConn
is 7-0 in NCAA championship games and can match  Tennessee  for
the most women’s titles in college basketball history.  Connecticut opened a 10-point halftime lead against Notre
Dame (35-2) and continued to pull away in ending the Fighting
Irish’s school-record 30-game win streak. The Huskies, who had
 lost all three previous meetings  against Notre Dame this season,
held Skylar Diggins to 10 points on 3-of-15 shooting. Diggins is
the leading scorer in Notre Dame history.  “Notre Dame is a great team,” Auriemma said. “You don’t
beat us seven out of eight times without being a great team. My
hat’s off to them for the kind of year they had, but tonight was
our night.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
