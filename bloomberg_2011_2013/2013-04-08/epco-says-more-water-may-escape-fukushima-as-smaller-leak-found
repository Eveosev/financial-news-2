Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  said 47
tons (12,500 gallons) more water may escape a storage pool at
the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant through a leak that has
been followed by another, smaller release of toxic water at a
nearby tank.  Yesterday, the company known as Tepco, estimated about 120
tons of radioactive water had already escaped the No. 2
underground pool. As much as 3 liters (0.79 gallons) of
radioactive water may have also escaped the No. 3 pool, Koji
Sakakibara, a Tokyo-based spokesman at the utility, said today.  The leaks have been found in the pools where highly
contaminated water is stored after being used to cool the
damaged reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. The
leaks are the latest stumble in efforts to stabilize the plant
after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused the
worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.  Japan ’s  Nuclear Regulation Authority  yesterday identified
the possibility of the second leak. Tepco plans to transfer some
of the contaminated water from the No. 3 tank to determine
whether the leak stops, Sakakibara said.  Tepco has built almost 1,000 tanks to hold water tainted in
the process of cooling the reactors. The utility has had several
radioactive water leaks from the Fukushima plant, raising
concerns about radiation effects on health and the environment.  Tepco found the first leak from the No. 2 underground pool
on the night of April 5, it said in a  report  the next day. The
utility estimates it will complete transferring the remaining
water stored in the No. 2 tank to other underground pools by
April 11, Tepco’s Sakakibara said.  About 276,000 tons of highly radioactive water is stored in
tanks at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, according to Tepco’s
latest data. That’s enough to fill about 110 Olympic-sized
swimming pools, according to Bloomberg News calculations.  Tepco shares were down 0.7 percent at 294 yen as of 10:46
a.m. local time on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
