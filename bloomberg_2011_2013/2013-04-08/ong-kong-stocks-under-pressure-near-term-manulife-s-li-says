Marco Li, Hong Kong-based portfolio
manager at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $238
billion globally, comments on the outlook for Hong Kong stocks
in the wake of an outbreak of a new strain of deadly bird flu in
 China .  “It’s tough because in investors’ minds a lot of people
can remember SARS in 2003. There’s a bit of fear from what
potentially can happen, especially in Hong Kong, because they do
remember the magnitude of it.  ‘‘Friday was clearly a bit of a panic sell, but it’s still
early to tell if the decline was premature.  ‘‘Some was trigger-happy-type of selling and you’ll get
some fundamental buying support to some of the overreactions.  ‘‘There’s going to be near-term pressure no matter how you
cut it. You have this overhang now, and until you get clarity,
people will see that as a potential risk for further
exacerbation.  ‘‘With some of the yen devaluing -- there’s a liquidity
chasing that particular market so it diverts some of the
attention away from North Asia as well as ASEAN. It creates a
new liquidity shift.  ‘‘In any type of market correction, you want to stay with
the quality names that have liquidity to give you flexibility as
an investor. There are longer-term inflation concerns, and
equities are still the place to be.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
