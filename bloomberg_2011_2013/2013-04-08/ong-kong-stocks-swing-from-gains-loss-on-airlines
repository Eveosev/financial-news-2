Hong Kong  stocks  swung between gains
and losses as airlines rebounded after plunging last week amid
an outbreak of a new strain of bird flu in China. Developers
slid after a housing provident fund said Beijing raised down
payments for some second-home purchases.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Asia’s largest international
carrier, climbed 3.4 percent after slumping to a seven-month low
last week.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , the second-biggest
mainland property company traded in Hong Kong, slid 1.2 percent.
 Prada SpA (1913) , an Italian maker of luxury handbags, retreated 5.3
percent after Barclays Plc cut its rating. Man Wah Holdings
Ltd., a sofa maker that gets half of its sales from the U.S.,
fell 2.3 percent after the nation’s payrolls rose less than
forecast.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent to 21,681.29 as of
11:19 a.m. in Hong Kong after rising less than 0.1 percent.
About three stocks fell for every two that advanced on the
gauge, with volume 9 percent below the 30-day intraday average.
The measure last week slumped to its lowest level since November
on concern an outbreak of bird flu in China may cause an
epidemic.  “There’s going to be near-term pressure no matter how you
cut it,” said Marco Li, Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at
Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $238 billion globally.
“You have this overhang now, and until you get clarity, people
will see that as a potential risk for further exacerbation.”  Mainland Shares  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
was little changed after dropping 3.1 percent on April 5.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index retreated 1.2 percent as it
opened for the first time since April 3.  The Hang Seng Index fell 8.8 percent through last week from
this year’s high in January as Hong Kong and mainland developers
led declines amid government efforts to rein in property prices,
and on concern Cyprus’s banking woes will reignite Europe’s debt
crisis. The measure traded at 10.4 times average  estimated
earnings  on April 5, compared with 14 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Resources Land dropped 1.2 percent to HK$20.75, while
 Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , a mainland developer controlled
by billionaire Hui Wing Mau, fell 0.8 percent to HK$14.84.
Beijing increased the minimum down payment on second-home
purchases to 70 percent for buyers who apply for loans from the
housing provident fund, according to a statement posted on the
fund management agency’s website today.  Wealth Distribution  Separately, China needs to impose a tax on existing
properties to ease the impact of unequal wealth distribution
after rapid growth in property prices, the China Securities
Journal said in a commentary.  China tried to ease concerns that a new strain of bird
influenza will spark an epidemic as authorities reported three
more infections of the deadly H7N9 virus that’s killed six
people since March. More than 600 people have been infected with
the H5N1 bird flu strain since 2003, and almost 60 percent have
died, according to the World Health Organization.  During the 2003 Sars outbreak, the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  hit its
lowest level since the Asian financial crisis. The gauge closed
at 8,409.01 on April 25, the lowest since Oct. 8, 1998.  Sars killed 300 people in Hong Kong, prompting governments
worldwide to impose travel restrictions on the city as mainland
authorities sought initially to cover up the disease’s spread.
Gross domestic product contracted 2.4 percent during the
quarter, the most until the depths of the global financial
crisis in 2009.  Property Prices  The Centaline Property Centa-City Monthly Index of home
prices fell to a record low of 31.37 in April 2003, prompting a
raft of support measures from the city’s government. The
Centaline gauge was at 116.48 at the end of January.  “It’s tough because in investors’ minds a lot of people
can remember Sars in 2003,” said Li. “There’s a bit of fear
from what potentially can happen, especially in Hong Kong,
because they do remember the magnitude of it.”  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  were little changed today. The gauge
dropped 0.4 percent April 5 after data showed the U.S. economy
added less than half the number of jobs economists forecast in
March.  Hang Seng Index futures climbed 0.1 percent to 21,667. The
 HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  gained 1.7 percent to 17.25, indicating
traders expect a swing of 4.9 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
