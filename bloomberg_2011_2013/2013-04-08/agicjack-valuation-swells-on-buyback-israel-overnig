MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL) , whose
founders pioneered voice-over-Internet technology, rose to the
most expensive level in three months after Chief Executive
Officer Gerald Vento signaled plans to buy back more shares.  Shares of MagicJack jumped 2 percent to $15.99 in  New York 
yesterday, swelling the Israeli company’s advance since
reporting 2012 results last week to 7 percent. MagicJack traded
at 8.7 times estimated earnings, up from a record-low 5.6 times
in February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company is
trading 32 percent below its average valuation since at least
2011. The  Bloomberg Israel-US Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli
companies in New York fell 0.1 percent to 88.66 yesterday.  “There’s opportunity that we see to build  shareholder
value ,” Vento said in an April 5 phone interview from  West Palm
Beach ,  Florida . “If that includes making more buybacks under
the existing program or going to the board, that’s all stuff
that can be on the table.”  The company, based in Netanya,  Israel , has $11.9 million
left from last year’s share buyback program and its stock is
“undervalued,” said Vento, who succeeded Daniel Borislow as
CEO Jan. 1. MagicJack posted an annual operating profit on April
2, the first since its 1996 listing. Net revenue, which the
company defines as net of returns and allowances, rose 43
percent.  MagicJack boosted stock buybacks by $23.7 million to $55.9
million in 2012, Kari Hernandez, president of Ink-PR, which
represents MagicJack, said by e-mail yesterday.  Free cash flow ,
after funding the share repurchases, was $65 million last
year,the company’s highest ever, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Short Interest  MagicJack shares have slumped 40 percent from a September
high and 59 percent of its tradeable stock was sold short by
investors as of the March 15 settlement date. That’s the highest
short interest percentage among all companies on the Nasdaq
Composite Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We had a very good year by any measurement,” CEO Vento
said. “But by any measurement, we’re undervalued. And it will
be our responsibility to continue to report accurately and
consistently, and with greater transparency, and hopefully we’ll
be rewarded for that.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US Index of the largest Israeli
companies traded in New York fell a second day yesterday.
Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index added 0.1 percent to 1,229.26 in
