A Sudanese court sentenced 11
military officers to between two and five years in prison for
their roles in an attempted coup against President Umar al- Bashir’s government, an army spokesman said.  They were found guilty yesterday of “attempting to
undermine the constitutional and security system and threaten
the country’s unity and harm the armed forces by the use of
force,” spokesman Al-Sawarmi Khaled said in a statement
reported by the state-run  news agency , Suna. They were expelled
from the army and have 15 days to appeal, he said.  Sudanese authorities in late November arrested the
country’s former spy chief, Salah Gosh, and other senior
security and military officials and said they had foiled a
“subversive plot.”  As a civilian, Gosh wasn’t included in the military trial
that began in mid-March and hasn’t been charged, his lawyer,
Nabil Adib Abdalla, said by phone from Khartoum today.  Al-Bashir has ruled the country since coming to power in a
military coup in 1989. He won an election in April 2010 in the
country’s first multiparty vote in 24 years. Observers from the
Atlanta-based  Carter Center  and the European Union said the vote
failed to meet international standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
