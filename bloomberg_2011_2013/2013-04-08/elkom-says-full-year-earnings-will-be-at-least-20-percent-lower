Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG) ,  Africa ’s
biggest fixed-line operator, said full-year earnings fell at
least 20 percent as it battled against tougher competition from
mobile and broadband companies.  Headline earnings per share, which were 324.7 cents in the
year through March 2012, will be more than a fifth lower in the
fiscal year just ended, the Pretoria, South Africa-based company
said in a statement today.  Bpi Capital has forecast headline earnings per share for
full-year 2013 to be 178.4 cents per share, 45 percent lower
than 2012, analyst Kate Turner-Smith said by e-mail.  Telkom  fell  as much as 4.6 percent, the most since March
15, and was down 1.6 percent at 14.45 rand at 4:27 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It will report a more specific earnings per share
guidance ahead of its full-year results, which will probably be
published on or about June 14, the company said.  Telkom, almost 40 percent owned by the South African
government, appointed former  Vodacom (VOD)  Group Ltd. Chief Operating
Officer Sipho Maseko as chief executive officer on March 28 as
it seeks to boost growth and meet a target to help deliver
broadband to all South African citizens by 2020.  Strategic Asset  The South African government blocked a bid by South Korean
telecommunications company  KT Corp. (030200)  to buy 20 percent of Telkom
last year, saying the company is a strategic asset to the
country. The previous CEO Nombulelo Moholi resigned in November
after Telkom struggled to raise capital to expand broadband and
mobile services.  The biggest challenge for new CEO Maseko will be to turn
around Telkom’s business in  South Africa , which has contributed
to three consecutive years of declining revenue.  Telkom’s fixed-line traffic, measured in millions of
minutes, fell 70 percent in eight years through September 2011,
according to Bloomberg calculations from Telkom earnings
statements, while the number of fixed lines dropped 15 percent.  “If I was the incoming CEO I would throw the kitchen sink
at the results,” Bruce Main, a  fund manager  at Ivy Asset
Management Ltd., said by e-mail. “I would want to see a decent
turnaround in six months; failing this at least a year. If there
is no material turnaround then I would be afraid that these
negative earnings would continue.”  Vodacom and  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , South Africa’s largest mobile-
phone operators, were growing data revenue three times faster
than Telkom in 2011, which started its 8ta mobile-phone unit a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
