Taiwan’s five-year bond yield fell
to a one-month low and the local dollar slid past NT$30 against
the greenback for the first time since August amid heightened
political tensions on the neighboring Korean peninsula.  The  Taiex index  of shares slumped the most in 10 months as
local financial markets reopened after holidays on April 4 and
5. South Korea said today the communist North may be preparing
to conduct simultaneous nuclear and missile tests. Consumer
prices rose 1.39 percent from a year earlier in March after
climbing a revised 2.96 percent in February, the statistics
bureau said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was
for a 1.82 percent gain.  “The Taiwan markets are reflecting a mix of geopolitical
and economic events that happened in the last four days,” said
Stanford Chen, a fixed-income manager at KGI Securities Co. in
Taipei. “And these events all favored bonds.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018
declined four basis points to 0.963 percent as of 10:19 a.m. in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest
level for the benchmark  five-year  yield since March 11.  The Taiwan dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to NT$30.002
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$30.09 earlier, the weakest level since Aug. 3. It was
0.2 percent stronger three minutes before the end of trading on
April 3 and finished little changed.  The central bank has sold the local currency in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.2 percent to
NT$30.007 per dollar from April 5, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 3.81
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
