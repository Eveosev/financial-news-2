Saudi Investment Bank (SIBC)  surged the
most in more than two years after a 48 percent jump in first-
quarter profit surpassed analysts’ estimates.  The shares soared 8.4 percent, the most since March 2011,
to 19.35 riyals at the close in Riyadh. The stock was the
second-biggest gainer on the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index,
which rose 0.7 percent.  About 1.2 million Saudi Investment shares were traded, 7.5
times the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The bank’s profit surged to 314 million riyals
($84 million) from 212 million a year earlier, as loans and
advanced climbed. That beat the 261 million-riyal median
estimate of three analysts, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The market anticipated a drop” in earnings after central
bank data showed profits of the kingdom’s lenders were
declining, Mohammed Al-Omran, a Riyadh-based financial analyst
and president of the Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy, said
by e-mail.  Cumulative profit of Saudi banks fell to 6.25 billion
riyals in the first two months of this year from 6.74 billion
riyals in the same period a year earlier, according to data of
the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
