European stocks  climbed, rebounding
from the biggest three-day selloff since July, as German
industrial production increased more than forecast and investors
awaited the start of U.S. earnings season.  Lundin Petroleum AB rallied the most in six weeks after
discovering oil in the North Sea. Novartis AG and Roche Holding
AG led health-care companies higher, rising more than 1.5
percent. Banco Espirito Santo SA,  Portugal ’s largest publicly
traded lender, fell 3.4 percent after a court blocked part of
the government’s deficit-reduction plan.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 0.2 percent to 287.64 at
the close of trading. The gauge slid 2.3 percent last week as
U.S. jobs data signaled the recovery in the world’s largest
economy has slowed. The measure has still advanced 2.9 percent
this year as central banks maintained stimulus measures.  “I am still bullish,” said Kevin Lilley, a fund manager
at Old Mutual Asset Managers U.K. in  London , which oversees
about 4 billion pounds ($6.2 billion). “With the economic data
that has been weaker, I will need to moderate that view a little
bit, but I still think it’s right to have a cyclically-biased
portfolio.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 13 of 18 markets in
western  Europe  today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.4 percent,
while  France ’s  CAC 40 (CAC)  and  Germany ’s DAX added 0.1 percent. The
volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies today was
27 percent less than the average over the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Season  Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer,
unofficially kicks of the American earnings-reporting season
after the close of  New York  markets today. Profits at companies
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are forecast to contract 1.8
percent in the first quarter, the first year-on-year decline
since 2009, analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lundin rose 3.6 percent to 145.60 kronor, after saying the
Luno II well, in which it owns a 40 percent stake, discovered
oil-bearing sands with a 40 meter column of “good quality”
crude. Pressure data showed a separate petroleum system to the
nearby Edvard Grieg and Johan Sverdrup fields.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , which has a 30 percent holding in Luno II,
climbed 6.1 percent to 385 pence in London while Statoil ASA,
which holds the remaining 30 percent, advanced 1.2 percent to
139.20 kroner in Oslo.  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  gained 3.3 percent to 282 pence.
Greenlight Capital Inc., the hedge fund founded by David
Einhorn, raised its  holdings  in the oil explorer to 3 percent of
voting rights, according to statement released on April 5.  Drugmakers Rise  A gauge of  health-care shares  had the biggest gain in the
Stoxx 600, advancing 1 percent. Novartis, Europe’s biggest
drugmaker, climbed 1.8 percent to 66.65 Swiss francs and Roche,
the largest maker of cancer medicines, increased 1.8 percent to
224 francs.  United Internet AG rallied 4.3 percent to 19.36 euros after
Morgan Stanley said the German broadband provider’s earnings
will probably gain and its dividend may double by 2015.  Portugal’s  PSI-20 Index (PSI20)  fell 1.4 percent as Banco Espirito
Santo slid 3.4 percent to 71 euro cents and Banco Comercial
Portugues SA lost 3.5 percent to 8.2 cents.  The Portuguese government said it will impose more spending
cuts to meet the terms of its 78 billion-euro ($101 billion)
bailout after the Constitutional Court overruled a plan to
suspend a monthly salary payment to state workers and
pensioners. The ruling delays completion of the seventh review
of the aid plan, and the corresponding disbursement of 2 billion
euros won’t be paid until that review is concluded, Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said.  Greek Banks  In  Athens ,  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  plummeted 10 percent
to 46.6 euro cents while Eurobank Ergasias SA gained 20 percent
to 18 cents. Regulators put the banks’ planned merger on hold
while they raise funds separately to avoid nationalization.  Pirelli & C. SpA dropped 6.3 percent to 7.70 euros in
Milan, the largest decline in almost 11 months. The tiremaker
delayed a 2013-2017 business-plan presentation to November from
May to help “provide better viability” on the economy. Pirelli
said Europe’s debt crisis is having a “clear impact” on
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
