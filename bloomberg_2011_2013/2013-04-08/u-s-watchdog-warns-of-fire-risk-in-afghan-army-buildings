A federal watchdog has urged the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop building structures for the
Afghan Army that “pose a serious fire and safety risk.”  John Sopko, the special inspector general for  Afghanistan 
reconstruction, faulted the Army Corps in an April 4 letter for
using foam insulation and thermal-barrier systems that don’t
comply with international building standards.  “We are alerting you to our concern over this serious fire
and life safety risk,” Sopko wrote.  He urged the Corps to reconsider its decision to proceed
with construction while posting warning signs and having a
“fire-watch during rest hours.”  Three of the so-called K-Span structures caught fire during
construction last year, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
in property damage, Sopko said.  In southern Afghanistan, 704 of the 1,002 K-Span structures
under construction use non-compliant foam insulation and barrier
systems, he said.  The Army Corps, in a March 10 “decision paper,”
acknowledged the fire risk while citing concerns about delays
and additional cost if the non-compliant materials had to be
removed.  The Army Corps didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed
request for comment. The K-Span structures, which are designed
to be rust- and weather-resistant, replaced concrete and masonry
structures for the Afghan Army beginning in 2010, according to
Sopko’s letter.  Sopko said he is opening an investigation of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
