A helicopter charted by French oil
company Perenco SA in  Peru  crashed today in the northern Amazon
jungle, killing all nine people on board, daily  El Comercio 
reported in its online edition.  The MI-8 chopper carrying four crew members and five oil
workers operated by Helicopteros del Pacifico fell to the ground
near the Arabela River near where Perenco is drilling in Block
67, the Lima-based newspaper said.  It was the deadliest helicopter accident in the country
since June 2010, when a chopper chartered by  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) 
and  Korea Engineering Consultants Corp. (023350)  crashed in the southern
jungle, killing 14, El Comercio said.  Telephone numbers listed for Perenco’s Lima office weren’t
answered outside business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
