Nordic Capital , a Swedish buyout
firm, hired banks to arrange leveraged loans to back its
acquisition of Unifeeder AS, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  Danske Bank A/S and UniCredit SpA are arranging debt of
more than 200 million euros ($260 million), said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the deal is private.  Katarina Janerud, a spokeswoman for Nordic Capital,
declined to comment on the financing.  Nordic Capital  said  on April 5 it agreed to buy Aarhus,
Denmark-based Unifeeder from Montagu Private Equity LLP.
Unifeeder transports containers from large hubs to regional
ports across Europe,  Russia  and Northern Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
