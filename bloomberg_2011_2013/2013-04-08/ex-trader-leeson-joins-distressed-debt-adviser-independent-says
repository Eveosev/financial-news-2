Nick Leeson , whose unauthorized
trades brought down U.K. bank Barings Plc in 1995, has become a
partner in distressed-debt adviser GDP, the Irish Independent
reported.  With partners Conor Devine, a chartered surveyor, and James
Gibbons, a solicitor, Leeson will advise clients with more than
1 million euros ($1.3 million) of debt on how to negotiate
agreements with lenders, the  newspaper said , citing an interview
with the former trader. Former derivatives trader Leeson racked
up $1.4 billion in losses for Barings.  Joining the Dublin-based firm is his first step back into
business after serving a prison sentence and overcoming cancer,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
