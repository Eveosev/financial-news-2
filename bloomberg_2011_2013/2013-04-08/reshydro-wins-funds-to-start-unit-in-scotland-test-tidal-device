ResHydro, a New York-based developer
of technology that uses ocean currents to generate electricity,
received a 100,000 pound ($153,000) grant from Scotland and
plans to set up a unit in the region.  The technology maker received the money from the local
state-backed agency Scottish Enterprise, according to an e-
mailed statement today from the government. The funds will be
used to help ResHydro establish a base in Glasgow and it will
work in partnership with the University of Strathclyde to
further research and develop its technology.  Scotland, seeking to get all of its electricity from clean
sources by 2020, is estimated to have as much as a quarter of
Europeâ€™s tidal resources. The government offers one of the
highest subsidies in the world for electricity generated from
the sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
