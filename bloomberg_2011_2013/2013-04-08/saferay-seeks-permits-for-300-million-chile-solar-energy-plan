Saferay GmbH, the German solar-
energy developer, plans to build a $300 million photovoltaic
power plant in the Atacama Desert in northern  Chile .  The company applied for permits for the 135-megawatt
Carrera Pinto project, the Berlin-based company said today in a
filing with the country’s environmental licensing agency
Servicio de Evaluacion Ambiental. Work is expected to start in
September.  The project is expected to produce 240 gigawatt-hours of
electricity a year for the country’s Sistema Interconectado
Central grid, according to the filing. It will have about
561,000 solar panels.  Saferay has built about 700 megawatts of projects on five
continents, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
