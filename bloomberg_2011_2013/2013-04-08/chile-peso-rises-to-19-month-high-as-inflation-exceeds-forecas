Chile’s peso rallied to its
strongest level in 19 months as a report showed consumer prices
rose more than forecast, spurring speculation that the central
bank will increase borrowing costs.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 467.66 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:13 a.m. in Santiago, the strongest level since
September 2011 on a closing basis.  “Inflation was higher than expected,” Francisca Roa, an
analyst at Netgociando SA, said in a telephone interview. “If
that trend were to continue, it would set up the scenario for a
rate increase.”  Consumer prices advanced 0.4 percent in March from a month
earlier, the fastest pace in five months, the National
Statistics Institute reported today. The pace was faster than
the 0.3 percent median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation accelerated to 1.5 percent from 1.3
percent in February.  The one-year breakeven rate, the difference between fixed
and inflation-linked swap rates and a reflection of the average
pace of consumer prices projected by traders during the period,
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.42
percent, the highest level this month.  The economy grew 3.8 percent in February from a year
earlier after 6.7 percent expansion in the prior month, the
central bank reported April 5. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 4.8 percent growth.  The price of copper,  Chile ’s main export, rose 0.9 percent
to $3.3925 per pound in  New York  today while the euro
strengthened 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
