Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE)  rose to a
record after other insurers in East Africa’s biggest economy
posted profit increases in 2012.  The stock surged 5.9 percent to 17.15 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the highest since at least August 2007 when
Bloomberg began compiling the data. About 342,600 shares traded,
1.4 times the three-month daily average. British American
Investment Co., the country’s biggest insurer, rose 3.3 percent
to 9.45 shillings, while  Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL) 
added 2.5 percent to 62 shillings today.  Kenya Re’s rise “is all about speculation on their 2012
numbers because the insurance companies have so far announced
good results,” Augustine Misoka, a research analyst at Nairobi-
based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone. “We actually
estimated that profit after tax will be 2.9 billion shillings”
($34 million). Net income was 1.91 billion shillings in 2011, it
said last year.  British American reported on March 14 a 2012 profit of 2.52
billion shillings from a year-earlier loss of 1.96 billion
shillings while Pan Africa said on Feb. 21 its net income rose
57 percent.  Kenya Re’s profit climbed 36 percent in the first half of
2012 as premiums and investment income increased, the Nairobi-
based company said in August. It will announce full-year results
later this month.  The stock has climbed 60 percent this year, outpacing the
27 percent advance on the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
