LT Group Inc. (LTG) , the company
controlled by Philippine billionaire Lucio Tan, plans to raise
as much as 32.8 billion pesos ($794 million) in a share sale
that could be the nation’s largest in nearly a year.  LT Group is offering 1.6 billion shares at between 18 pesos
and 20.5 pesos each, according to a term sheet obtained by
Bloomberg News. Shares of LT Group rose as much as 7.1 percent
today, before closing up  6.5 percent  at a record 19.48 pesos, in
Manila trading today.  The company has already lined up so-called cornerstone
investors for about 1 billion of the shares being sold, and the
offering may be enlarged by another 240 million shares, the term
sheet shows. The price for the share sale is expected to be set
on April 17, and UBS AG is managing the sale, the document
shows.  LT Group President Michael Tan didn’t reply to calls
seeking comment on the plan. The Philippine Daily Inquirer
earlier reported that the group may seek up to $800 million in
the sale.  Companies have raised about $4.4 billion selling shares in
the  Philippines  over the last twelve months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. LT Group’s may be the largest since  BDO Unibank
Inc. (BDO)  raised  about $1 billion  in a rights offering last June.  Lucio Tan’s investments include stakes in Philippine
National Bank and the nation’s second-largest brewer Asia
Brewery Inc. The 78-year-old tycoon is consolidating its assets
under LT Group, formerly Tanduay Holdings Inc.  LT Group in March said profit last year rose 29 percent to
7.51 billion pesos. Its shares have risen 43.5 percent so far
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
