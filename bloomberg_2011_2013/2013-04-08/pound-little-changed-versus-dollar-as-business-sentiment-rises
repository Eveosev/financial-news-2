U.K. gilts fell, with 10-year yields
rising from the lowest level in seven months, as gains in
European peripheral bond markets damped demand for the relative
safety of Britain’s government debt.  The pound weakened for the first time in three days versus
the euro even as a report showed U.K. business sentiment and
hiring intentions improved last month. Italy’s 10-year bonds
rose for a sixth day and  Spain ’s two-year yields fell to the
lowest since October 2010 amid bets the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s 7.5
trillion yen ($76 billion) of monthly bond purchases will boost
investor appetite for higher returns.  “With peripheral bond spreads tightening again it looks as
though the theme is that the effect of the BOJ intervention is
to boost bonds in the periphery relative to those of core safe-
haven governments,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “The data calendar is light”
in the U.K., he said.  The 10-year gilt yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.70 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time after
dropping to 1.63 percent, matching the April 5 low that was the
 least  since Sept. 5. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022
fell 0.59, or 5.90 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,530) face amount,
to 100.44.  Demand for the bonds of  Europe ’s so-called peripheral and
semi-core nations has been boosted after the BOJ also said on
April 4 it would set a two-year horizon for its inflation goal.
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the same day
policy makers “stand ready to act” to bolster the region’s
flagging economy.  Italian Bonds  Italian 10-year yields dropped four basis points to 4.34
percent, while Spanish two-year yield declined as much as nine
basis points to 1.97 percent, the lowest since October 2010.  U.K. gilts advanced last week as a U.S. report showing
employers added fewer jobs in March than economists forecast
boosted demand for Britain’s fixed-income assets.  The securities have returned more than any euro-denominated
government bond market since Cyprus shut its banks on March 16
after an agreement with international creditors to impose a levy
on deposits. Investors who chose gilts earned twice as much as
those who sought safety in U.S. Treasuries or German bunds.  The pound fell 0.6 percent to 85.23 pence per euro after
depreciating to 85.26, the weakest since March 25. The U.K.
currency declined 0.5 percent to $1.5253.  Confidence Improves  A U.K. confidence index climbed to 92.2 in March from 90.6
the previous month and a hiring gauge increased to 96 from 95,
accountancy firm BDO LLP said. Still, its output index, at 93,
remains below the 95 level that indicates positive growth one
quarter ahead.  The pound has declined 4.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-
nation currencies. The dollar has gained 2.6 percent and the
euro rose 0.9 percent.  Gilts returned 2.4 percent this year through April 5,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
1.1 percent and Treasuries rose 0.7 percent.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 3.5 billion
pounds of benchmark 10-year gilts tomorrow, before offering 1.6
billion on inflation-linked bonds due in 2024 on April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
