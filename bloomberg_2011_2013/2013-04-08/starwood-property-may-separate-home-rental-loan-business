Barry Sternlicht ’s  Starwood Property
Trust Inc. (STWD)  said it will consider separating its single-family
home rental business and investments in nonperforming
residential loans from the rest of the company.  As of March 31, Starwood owned a portfolio of 1,644
foreclosed homes in seven states, which it bought for $200
million, the real estate investment trust said today in a
regulatory  filing . Starwood has also acquired 1,318
nonperforming residential loans at an aggregate cost of $173.1
million, according to the filing. The unpaid balance on these
loans at the end of March was $363.2 million.  “The company’s board of directors has not formally
evaluated any such transaction, and there can be no assurance as
to the assets to be included or the timing, terms, structure or
completion of any such transaction,” Greenwich, Connecticut-
based Starwood said in the filing.  Real estate investors are buying up single-family homes,
seeking to capitalize on rising demand for rentals from people
who lost houses to  foreclosure , can’t qualify for a mortgage or
down want to own.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , based in New York and the
world’s largest private-equity firm, has spent more than $3.5
billion to buy 20,000 single-family rentals, while  Tom Barrack ’s
Santa Monica, California-based Colony Capital LLC has raised
$2.2 billion.  Starwood also invests in commercial mortgage-backed
securities and originates commercial-property loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
