Gasoline rebounded from the biggest
weekly drop in six months. Crack spreads widened.  Futures rose as much as 2.2 percent. Prices sank 7.8
percent in the week ended April 5, the largest weekly decline
since Oct 5. The May  crack spread  versus WTI widened $1.35 to
$28.92 a barrel. The  spread  against Brent oil on ICE Futures
Europe Exchange gained 96 cents to $17.11.  “Gasoline is doing better than most today, but it was one
of the worst performers last week so it was probably overdone,”
said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategy at Energy Aspects
Ltd, a research company in London.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 2.73 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.8909 a gallon at 9:47 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on trading volume that was 87 percent above the 100-day
average. It was the first gain in seven days.  Ultra-low-sulfur-diesel for May delivery climbed 2.57
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.9355 a gallon on trading volume
that was 16 percent above the 100-day average.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to
$3.593 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 19.3 cents from the year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb.
26 and are 33.6 cents below a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
