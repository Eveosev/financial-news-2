The yen must pass a technical level
to touch 100 per dollar for the first time in four years, Nomura
Securities Co. said, citing trading patterns.  Key support for the yen lies at 99.75, the 50 percent
retracement on the Fibonacci chart from the 2007 low on June 22
of 124.14 to the all-time high of 75.35 reached on Oct. 31,
2011. Fibonacci analysis theorizes that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a new high or low.  A break past 99.75 would open up 100 and beyond, according
to Yunosuke Ikeda, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Nomura
Securities in  Tokyo . It was at 98.39 as of 12:16 p.m. in Tokyo.  “From there, there won’t be any meaningful chart
targets,” Ikeda said today in a telephone interview. “By
significantly breaking that level, investors tend to believe the
yen has entered a new phase, as opposed to just a recovery from
irrational levels like 75 and 80.”  The last time the yen traded at 100 was April 14, 2009.  The Japanese currency has weakened more than 20 percent
against the dollar over the past six months as Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s party swept to power on a campaign of expanded
economic stimulus, and he chose Haruhiko Kuroda to lead a
monetary easing push at the  Bank of Japan. (8301)   In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
