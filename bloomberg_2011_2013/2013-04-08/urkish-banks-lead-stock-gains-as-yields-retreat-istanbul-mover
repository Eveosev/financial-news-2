Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR) ,  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) 
and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  led gains on the Borsa Istanbul
today as bond yields dropped the most in more than 14 months,
helping cut their funding costs.  Isbank, Turkey’s third-biggest lender by market value,
added 4.3 percent, rising for the first time in six days, to
close at 6.74 lira in Istanbul. Akbank climbed 1.8 percent, the
most since March 26, to 9.14 lira. Garanti, the lender co-owned
by Spain’s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , rose 3.1 percent,
also the first advance in six days, to 9.32 lira. The 16-member
 banking index  surged 2.4 percent in its biggest advance since
March 8, leading gains on the Borsa Istanbul  National 100 (XU100)  index,
which rallied 1.6 percent.  Two-year benchmark bond yields plunged as much as 31 basis
points, the most since January 2012, to 5.78 percent. Earlier in
the day, the Treasury in Ankara sold 3.08 billion liras ($1.72
billion) of five-year debt at an average yield of 6.38 percent,
down from 6.54 percent in a March 18 sale of the same-maturity
debt.  “The continuing decline in yields is having a positive
effect on banking stocks,” Alpay Dinckoc, an analyst at Oyak
Securities in Istanbul, said in a phone interview today. The
drop helps cut their cost of deposits, he said.  Upgrade Inflows  Standard & Poor’s upgraded Turkey to one level below
investment grade on March 27, matching the rating from Moody’s
Investors Service. Fitch Ratings raised  Turkey  to investment
grade in November.  “Until the last week of March, there was a pronounced
slowdown in foreign capital inflows,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an
economist at Garanti Investment in Istanbul, said in a note to
investors today. This picture changed after the March 27 rating
upgrade from S&P, Altinsac said, noting that the acceleration in
capital inflows would correspond to an “increase in loans and
recovery in the economy.”  The average annual interest rate that Turkish banks pay
savers for one-year deposits dropped to 6.63 percent today, down
from 7.05 percent at the start of the year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with investor expectations
of 5.64 percent annual inflation, as implied by the two-year
 breakeven rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
