Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317)  Co. plans
consignment production of solar panels in Japan as early as next
year, the Nikkei newspaper reported today.  The Taiwanese electronics maker will soon begin talks with
Japanese manufacturers of panels and parts to begin production
on a contract basis, according to the Nikkei.  Hon Hai can reduce currency risks by making panels in
Japan, the paper said, citing an unidentified Hon Hai executive.
The company, which made about 30 megawatts worth of solar panels
last year, has a less than one percent share in the global
market, according to the paper.  Hon Hai spokesman Simon Hsing declined to comment when
contacted by  Bloomberg News  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
