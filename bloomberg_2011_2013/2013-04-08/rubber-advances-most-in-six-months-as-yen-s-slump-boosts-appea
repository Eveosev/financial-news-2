Rubber jumped by the most in six
months after  Japan ’s currency slid to the lowest level since
June 2009, boosting the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in September advanced as much as
4.7 percent, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
Sept. 14, to 265.3 yen a kilogram ($2,693 a metric ton) and was
at 263.9 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 10:36 a.m.  The yen traded at 98.41 per dollar after touching 98.85,
the lowest since June 2009. The currency extended losses for a
third day after the  Bank of Japan  said last week it would double
bond buying to reach its target of 2 percent annual inflation
within two years. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest
carmaker, led a rally in Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average toward
its highest level in almost five years.  “The BOJ’s record stimulus sent the yen tumbling against
the dollar, which boosted investor appetite for futures,”
 Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said
today by phone.  Japan’s currency, traditionally considered a haven, fell
against the greenback even as a Labor Department report showed
U.S. payrolls grew by 88,000 workers in March, the least in nine
months. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
was for a gain of 190,000.  The contract for delivery in September fell 0.2 percent to
21,300  yuan  ($3,432) on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Thai rubber free-on-board fell 1.2 percent to 81.75 baht
($2.79) a kilogram on April 5, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . That was the lowest level since November
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
