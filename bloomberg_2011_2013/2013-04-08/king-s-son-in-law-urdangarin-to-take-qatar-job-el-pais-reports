Inaki Urdangarin, the son-in-law of
King Juan Carlos of  Spain , will take a job coaching handball in
Qatar,  El Pais  reported.  Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player, will work
alongside the Spanish coach Valero Rivera training the Qatari
national team and may be joined by his wife, Princess Cristina,

added.  A spokesman for the royal family declined to comment when
