Drake & Scull International (DSI)  PJSC
surged the most in almost three months amid bets projects won by
the supplier of engineering services to the construction
industry will boost profits.  The shares jumped 3.9 percent, the most since Jan. 17, to
77.6 fils at the close in Dubai. About 33.4 million shares
traded, the most of any stock on the benchmark  DFM General
Index (DFMGI) , which climbed 2.2 percent.  The Dubai-based company said last month it was awarded
contracts valued at 369 million dirhams ($100 million),
including for a data center in Saudi Arabia and a utility
project in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
Net income may increase 10 percent this year to 141 million
dirhams, according to the mean  estimate  of nine analysts on
Bloomberg.  “In general, investors are optimistic about the new
contracts and the prospects of the first quarter results,” said
Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  Drake & Scull shares have gained 10 percent this year,
trailing the 18 percent increase in Dubai’s measure after the
company reported a 42 percent drop in profit last year. First-
quarter profit may decline to 34 million dirhams, according to
NBK Capital estimates, after 37.6 million dirhams in the year-
earlier period.  Four analysts have a buy recommendation on the stock, five
say hold and three recommend selling, according to  data compiled
by Bloomberg.   To contact the reporter on this story:
