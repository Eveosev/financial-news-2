Cattle futures rose, heading for the
biggest gain in a week, on speculation that demand for U.S. beef
is increasing. Hog prices also climbed.  Temperatures across parts of the U.S. are expected to rise
in April, the first full month of the Northern Hemisphere
spring. Consumers tend to grill outdoors when the weather warms,
boosting meat purchases. U.S. exporters shipped 368.68 million
pounds of beef (167,228 metric tons) in the two months through
Feb. 28, up 1.3 percent from the same period a year earlier,
Department of Agriculture  data  showed today.  “There could be a little optimism” that demand will
improve, Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“We’re finally getting some warmer weather, and if exports were
a shade better than what people thought,” that may be
supporting prices, he said.  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$1.221 a pound at 10:30 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that price would be the biggest increase for the
most-active contract since March 28.  Spot  steers  averaged $1.2829 a pound in the first four days
of last week, up 5.2 percent from a year earlier, USDA data
show.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement gained 0.6 percent
to $1.452 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement rose 1.1 percent to 90.725
cents a pound. Prices on April 5 fell as much as 3 percent to
89.275 cents, a two-week low.  The previous session’s decline was “probably overdone,”
said  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity
Investments Co. in  Minneapolis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
