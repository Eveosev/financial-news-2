Mexico ’s auto  output  plunged 11.2
percent in the previous month, the first decline since April
2011, as Easter fell in March this year after occurring in April
last year, the head of an auto industry trade group said.  Production amounted to 238,519 vehicles in March, the
lowest monthly total since December, according to data released
today in Mexico City by the Mexican Automobile Industry
Association, or AMIA. Exports dropped 9.7 percent to 204,475
last month as shipments declined to the U.S.,  Canada ,  Latin
America  and  Europe .  The timing of Easter probably slowed Mexico’s car factories
as schools let out the last week of March and many people had
holidays on March 28 and 29, AMIA President Eduardo Solis told
reporters. Last year, Easter fell on April 8.  “These figures are very sensitive to the number of working
days and this always happens when we have Holy Week falling in
different months,” Solis said, referring to the week before
Easter. “We’ll have to compare the two-month period of March
and April with the same two-month period from last year.”  Domestic sales slid 1 percent to 82,767 in March, AMIA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
