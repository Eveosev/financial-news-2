U.K. stocks  advanced, rebounding
from the biggest three-day drop in more than eight months, as a
report showed German industrial production increased more than
forecast in February.  Weir Group Plc (WEIR)  jumped 4.2 percent after General Electric
Co. agreed to buy U.S. peer Lufkin Industries Inc. at a premium
to its share price. Polymetal International Plc climbed the most
since Sept. 14 after saying it will pay a 2012 final dividend of
31 cents a share. Mecom Ltd. plummeted the most in 10 months
after forecasting a drop in advertising sales.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 27.16 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,276.94 at the close in London. The gauge slid 3.7 percent in
the past three days, the most since July. The FTSE 100 has still
rallied 6.4 percent this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
compromise budget and data fueled optimism the world’s biggest
economy is recovering. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also
rose 0.4 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added less
than 0.1 percent.  “Investor sentiment remains quite elevated on a number of
metrics we track,” Ronan Carr, European equities strategist at
Morgan Stanley in  London , wrote in a note today. “Liquidity
conditions more broadly seem set to remain quite buoyant in 2Q13
as the major central banks seem likely to maintain or expand
their loose monetary policies.”  In  Germany , a report showed  industrial production  expanded
in February. Production rose 0.5 percent, following a revised
0.6 percent drop in January, the Economy Ministry in Berlin
said. That beat the 0.3 percent increase forecast on average by
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Earnings  Alcoa, the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, unofficially
kicks off the earnings season in the world’s largest economy
after the close of U.S. markets today. Earnings at companies in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may drop 1.8 percent in the
first quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Britain retained its top credit rating at S&P, according to
a statement in London late April 5. S&P affirmed the U.K.’s AAA
rating, saying the government has the ability to respond quickly
to challenges. It maintained a negative outlook on the economy.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 32 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Weir Group, the world’s largest maker of pumps for miners,
jumped 4.2 percent to 2,276 pence. GE agreed to buy Lufkin for
$3.3 billion, or $88.50 a share, 38 percent more than the Texas-
based oil-pump maker’s closing price on April 5.  Polymetal Dividend  Polymetal gained 5.3 percent to 882 pence after the company
said in a preliminary-results statement it will pay a final
dividend representing 30 percent of its earnings of $401 million
in 2012.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  climbed 6.1 percent to 385 pence. Lundin
Petroleum AB said its Luno II exploration well discovered oil in
the PL359 area of the North Sea, off the coast of  Norway .
Premier Oil owns 30 percent of the field and Lundin owns 40
percent.  A  gauge of oil and gas producers  in the FTSE 350 Index
advanced for the first time in four days.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  added
3.2 percent to 1,191 pence and  Afren Plc (AFR)  climbed 6.1 percent to
135 pence.  Mecom Group Plc (MEC)  plunged 34 percent to 55 pence, the most
since June, after saying it expects Dutch advertising revenues
in March and April to decline more than 20 percent, compared
with the year-earlier period.  “If the pattern of recent declines in advertising revenues
were to continue, total Dutch revenues would fall significantly
short of current market expectations,” the company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
