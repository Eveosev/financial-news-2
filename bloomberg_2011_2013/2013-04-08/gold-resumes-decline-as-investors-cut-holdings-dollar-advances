Gold futures declined for the fourth
time in five sessions as the dollar’s rebound reduced the appeal
of the metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback rose for the first time in four sessions
against a basket of major currencies. The gauge has climbed 3.7
percent this year, while gold has dropped 6.2 percent. Holdings
in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-traded-product
backed by the metal, fell 0.9 metric ton to 1,205.31 tons on
April 5, the lowest since June 2011.  “The strength in the dollar is working against gold,”
 Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port
St. Lucie, Florida, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for June delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,572.50 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Volume was 33 percent lower than the 100-day average at
this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last week,
the price dropped 1.2 percent.  “ETP outflows remain the largest downside risk to  gold
prices ,” Barclays Plc analysts including  Suki Cooper  said today
in a report. “Should outflows persist at this pace, they would
match the weakest month on record, which was set in February.”  Gold jumped 1.5 percent on April 5 after U.S. payrolls in
March trailed forecasts by economists, bolstering prospects for
prolonged monetary stimulus by the  Federal Reserve .  Silver futures for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$27.138 an ounce on the Comex. The price has slumped 10 percent
this year.  As of April 2,  hedge funds  held a net-short position of
2,982 contracts, the first  bet  on a decline since the data
begins in 2006, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
figures showed on April 5.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,537 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
$729.80 an ounce. Last week, the price tumbled 5.8 percent, the
most since May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
