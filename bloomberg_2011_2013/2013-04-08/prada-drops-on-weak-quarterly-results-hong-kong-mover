Prada SpA (1913) , the Milan-based fashion
goods maker, dropped to its lowest level in more than a month in
Hong Kong trading after fourth-quarter earnings disappointed
some analysts.  The maker of handbags, shoes and apparel fell 4 percent to
close at HK$74, the lowest level since Feb. 19. The benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  was little changed.  Prada’s same-store sales growth decelerated in the three
months ended Jan. 31, mainly because of the later timing of the
Chinese New Year in 2013, the designer said in a statement April
5 after the market closed. Margin as measured by earnings before
interest and tax widened to 27 percent of sales from 24.6
percent a year earlier, according to the statement.  A “lower-than-expected margin expansion” in the fourth
quarter led to operating profit that was below forecasts,
analyst Candy Huang, an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a
research note dated today. The outlook for sales at stores that
have been open at least a year is “moderate,” Huang wrote.  Barclays lowered its rating to equal-weight from
overweight.  Net income jumped 45 percent to to 625.7 million euros
($811 million), according to the statement. Fourth-quarter
profit gained 37 percent to 217 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
