Egypt , which needs to reduce
government expenditure, plans to introduce ration cards for
subsidized fuel in its next fiscal year, Oil Minister Osama Kamal said in an interview with Al Arabiya Television.  The government proposes allocating a fixed amount of
subsidized diesel or gasoline to each motorist. People will have
to pay market prices for any purchases that exceed the quota.
Egypt will introduce ration cards in its new fiscal year, which
begins on July 1, Kamal said.  “The main purpose of the coupons or the smart-card system
is for subsidies to reach those who deserve them and to curb the
smuggling phenomenon,” Kamal told the Dubai-based satellite
channel today.  The government had said it would gradually introduce ration
cards for fuel from April without giving any indication of how
much unsubsidized fuel would cost. Some Egyptians already use
the cards to buy other subsidized commodities, such as sugar and
rice. Subsidized loaves of bread, which are not covered by the
ration cards, cost 5 piasters (1 cent) each.  The Arab world’s most populous nation is seeking to obtain
a $4.8 billion loan from the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
