American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
warrants jumped to the highest since January 2011, the month the
contracts began trading, as the stock rallied on speculation
results will improve at the insurer’s largest business.  The  warrants  advanced 5.7 percent to $16.43. The contracts
allow investors to buy AIG common stock at $45 apiece by Jan.
19, 2021. Shares of the New York-based insurer climbed 3.8
percent to $40.09 and are up about 22 percent in the past year,
fueled by the repayment in late 2012 of a U.S. bailout.  AIG’s  stock  will probably climb to $44 in the next 12
months, Paul Newsome, of Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in
a note to investors last week after analysts met with leaders of
the property-casualty division. The operation,  AIG’s largest ,
has been seeking to increase sales outside the U.S. and to
individual consumers to boost returns.  “AIG’s property-casualty unit should see better
underwriting results in the near future,” Newsome said in the
April 2 note. “The company’s restructuring efforts remain on
track, and we should see improved profitability.”  The insurer, which was majority owned by the U.S. for more
than four years starting in 2008, unveiled a plan in 2010 to
issue warrants to shareholders. The transfer, which was made in
2011, was part of an effort to dissuade investors from dumping
the insurer’s stock amid its restructuring, people familiar with
the plan said at the time.  The AIG warrants changed hands for more than $23 in January
of 2011 in their first week of trading. They fell by more than
half that year as the insurer faced losses from the earthquake
and tsunami in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
