Ecotality Inc. (ECTY) , the operator of the
second-largest U.S. network of public electric-car charging
stations, rose to the highest in more than a year after
announcing plans to increase its number of chargers by 25
percent.  Ecotality gained 7.8 percent to $1.11 at the close in New
York, the highest since March 5, 2012. The shares have more than
doubled this year.  The company, based in San Francisco, said today it’s adding
about 225 chargers at  Kroger Co. (KR)  stores, mostly in California
and Arizona. The expansion is part of the company’s plan to
increase to 5,000 its network of about 4,000 public units, Chief
Executive Officer Ravi Brar said in an interview.  Ecotality last month announced an agreement to link its
network with Campbell, California-based ChargePoint Inc., the
largest operator of car-charging stations, giving drivers access
to about 90 percent of the approximately 15,000 stations in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
