Investment firm PCP Capital Partners
LLP and the Gulf investors it works with are interested in the
U.K.’s banking industry despite stricter rules imposed since the
financial crisis, said Chief Executive Officer Amanda Staveley.  “I’m always interested in the U.K. banking industry even
as it becomes more regulated,” said Staveley, who helped Abu
Dhabi invest 3 billion pounds ($4.6 billion ) in  Barclays Plc (BARC)  in
2008. “Once everything picks up, retail banking will start to
become interesting again. You could see more investors looking
at it.”  Staveley, seen as a broker for the Persian Gulf region’s
sovereign wealth funds, said any investment in the U.K.’s
banking industry would be adapted to the times.  “The U.K. regulatory market has changed, so the style of
investment will be different to the Barclays one we did in
2008.” The market backdrop to the Barclays investment was very
different from when Staveley and investors looked at  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group plc (RBS)  a little later, she said in an interview.  Staveley said PCP Capital and Gulf investors are also
interested in investing in Russian banks, without giving further
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
