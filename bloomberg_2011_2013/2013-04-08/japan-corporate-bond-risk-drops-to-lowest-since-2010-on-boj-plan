The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment extended declines to the lowest
level in 2 1/2 years after the central bank announced new steps
last week to fight deflation, credit-default swaps show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 4 basis points to 92
basis points as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge, which slid 7.7 basis points on April 5,
is set for its lowest close since November 2010, according to
data provider CMA.  Bank of Japan (8301)  officials said April 4 the central bank will
increase its monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen,
exceeding the 5.2 trillion yen forecast by economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. They also suspended a cap on some bond holdings
and dropped a limit on debt maturities. They set a two-year
horizon for their goal of 2 percent inflation.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1.5 to 117.9 as of
10:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices.
The benchmark is on track for its lowest close since the current
series of the index started trading on March 20, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 to 121 as of 8:48 a.m. in  Hong
Kong , Westpac prices show. The measure last closed lower on
April 4.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
