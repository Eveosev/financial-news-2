Mexico ’s peso advanced to its
strongest level since August 2011 as RBC Capital Markets raised
its forecasts for the currency for this year on prospects for
export growth and higher capital inflows.  The currency touched 12.1316 in intraday trading, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It traded little changed at
12.1705 at 9:18 a.m. in Mexico City. The peso has rallied 5.6
percent this year, the most among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts. Yields on benchmark local currency debt headed for
record lows.  Mexico’s peso has surged in 2013 as expectations that
government reforms will boost growth improve the outlook for
Latin America’s second-biggest economy and spur foreign inflows.
The peso will end the year at 12.15 per dollar, RBC wrote in a
note today to clients in which it raised the forecast from
12.25.  “The bias in terms of the currency’s direction is to
remain strong,”  Nick Chamie , RBC’s global head of foreign-
exchange strategy and the author of the report, said in a
telephone interview. “We would focus primarily on the
aggressive reform agenda and the likelihood that capital inflows
are likely to remain also solid alongside the gains that Mexico
is making in trade.”  Banorte’s View  President Enrique Pena Nieto said over the weekend that
Mexico’s economy could expand 6 percent if lawmakers approve the
reforms outlined by the nation’s three biggest political parties
in the so-called Pact for Mexico on Dec. 2, according to an
article from Mexican news agency Notimex published on the
website of CNNExpansion. Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB raised its
short-term outlook for the peso to “positive” from
“neutral,” according to a note to clients published today.  The most recent data from the central bank show the
percentage of fixed-rate government bonds held by global
investors is at a 13-year high of more than 56 percent.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bond due in 2024
tumbled eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 4.81
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
that level would be the lowest since the debt was issued in
2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
