Blades and a generator fell from a
wind tower in central  Japan  after the area was hit by a storm
yesterday, public broadcaster NHK said.  C-Tech Corp., which operates the plant in Mie prefecture,
is investigating the cause, NHK said on its website today. C-
Tech is the clean energy and telecommunications unit of  Chubu
Electric Power Co. (9502)   Each of the three blades is 40 meters (131 feet) long and
weighs about 6.5 metric tons, according to NHK. No injuries were
reported, the Yomiuri newspaper said today.  A call to C-Techâ€™s office in Aichi prefecture was
unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
