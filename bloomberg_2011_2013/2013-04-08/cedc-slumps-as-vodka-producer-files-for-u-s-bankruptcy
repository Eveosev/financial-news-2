Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC) ,
Poland’s second-biggest vodka producer, slumped to a record low
after filing for U.S. bankruptcy protection.  CEDC, as the Warsaw-based company is known, sent a
bankruptcy petition with a pre-approved restructuring plan aimed
at cutting $665.2 million in liabilities, it said in a statement
yesterday. The spirits maker took on debt to finance takeovers
in  Russia  and then faced falling revenues and management shifts.  The  shares  plunged 41 percent to 19 cents, the lowest price
since the company started trading in New York in 1998.  “The company may now conduct the restructuring but its
shareholders are ending up with nothing or almost nothing,”
after filing for bankruptcy, Jakub Krawczyk, an analyst at
Raiffeisen Centrobank AG in Vienna, said by e-mail today.  Once the bankruptcy is confirmed, the restructuring will
result in Roust Trading, controlled Roustam Tariko, a Russian
billionaire and CEDC Chairman, owning 100 percent of the
outstanding stock of the reorganized company, the distiller said
in a  statement  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
