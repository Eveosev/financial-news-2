BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, said copper supplies may exceed demand
this year and next on growing stockpiles and as the Melbourne-
based company ramps up output at its Escondida mine in Chile.  It’s “possible” that the market may have a “small
surplus” of supply in 2013 and 2014, Peter Beaven, head of the
company’s base metals operations, told reporters in Santiago
April 4. Escondida’s output will grow 10 percent a year through
2015 when it reaches a record 1.3 million metric tons, he said.  As copper executives gather in Santiago this week for an
annual dinner organized by industry group  Cesco , Chile, the top
producer, sees slowing demand growth in  China , the largest
consumer of the metal, Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac said
in an April 4 interview. Global copper usage will trail supplies
by 97,000 metric tons this year, Barclays Plc said April 4.  “We’ve seen a run up in the stock,” Beaven said. “We’re
are still selling everything we are contracted to sell in
China.”  Chinese purchases of copper, mainly used in power cables
and electrical wire, are set to rise 5 percent this year,
compared with 11.7 percent in 2012, de Solminihac said April 4
when he delivered an official government forecast.  Copper futures fell last week, dropping 1.7 percent to
334.40 cents per pound on April 5. Inventories in warehouses
monitored by the London Metal Exchange have risen more than 80
percent to 579,600 metric tons.  Spence Decision  BHP boosted output at Escondida in the Atacama Desert by 32
percent in 2012 by 1.076 million tons, compared with the year
before, according to  Chile ’s state-run copper statistics agency
 Cochilco .  BHP, the 57.5 percent owner of Escondida, dismantled a
crusher located inside the main pit that now spawns more than
2.5 kilometers (1.58 miles) wide to access richer ore.  The company may also be able to expand its Spence copper
mine, also in northern Chile, to more than 300,000 tons from
166,700 tons produced in 2012, Beaven said. BHP will need to
review the rising energy and labor costs of mining in Chile
before deciding to go ahead with an expansion at Spence, he
said.  Copper for delivery in May added 1.2 percent to $3.383 a
pound by 8:06 a.m. the Comex in  New York . Prices climbed as much
as 1.5 percent, the most since March 12, after three weeks of
declines. Copper for delivery in three months rose 1.2 percent
to $7,498 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
