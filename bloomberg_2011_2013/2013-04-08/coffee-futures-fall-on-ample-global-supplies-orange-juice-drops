Coffee futures fell on signs of
ample global supplies.  Orange juice , cotton and sugar dropped,
while cocoa rose.  In March, exports of green coffee from  Brazil , the world’s
top grower, rose 11 percent from a year earlier, while shipments
from  Colombia , the second-biggest producer of arabica beans,
jumped 12 percent, reports showed last week. World output this
year will rise 6.4 percent to a record 144.6 million bags, the
 International Coffee Organization  said today in a report.  “The damage caused by coffee leaf rust in Central America
has been compensated by increased production in other countries,
particularly Brazil, Indonesia and Ethiopia,” the London-based
group said.  Arabica coffee for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$1.397 a pound at 11:15 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Volume at this time was 58 percent above the average in the past
100 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Last week, the commodity climbed 2.2 percent, the second
straight gain. Most farmers in Brazil will start gathering beans
next month, and output may approach a record high even as trees
enter the low-yielding cycle of the biennial crop, the
government estimates. A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  “The new Brazilian harvest is just a couple of months
away, and traders expect big offers to develop on rallies,”
 Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group in
Chicago, said in a report.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery declined 1.1 percent
to $1.4615 a pound on ICE.  Cotton futures for May delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
86.39 cents a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery fell 0.5 percent to
17.57 cents a pound.  Cocoa futures for May delivery jumped 2.6 percent to $2,187
a metric ton, halting a four-session slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
