Reed Elsevier Plc (REL) , owner of the
LexisNexis database, acquired  Mendeley Ltd. , a cloud-based
research and collaboration service, to add to its scientific,
technical and medical publishing.  Elsevier, the Reed division buying London-based Mendeley,
will provide the acquired company’s customers greater access to
content, data and analytics tools, according to a statement
today. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  “Our vision is to make science more collaborative and
open, and now we have the support of the world’s largest science
information provider,” Victor Henning, Mendeley’s co-founder
and chief executive officer, said in the statement.  The company, started in 2008, developed a desktop app that
automatically pulls metadata and keywords from PDFs, creating a
searchable research-paper database online.  Reed Elsevier declined 0.7 percent to 750 pence as of 14:50
p.m. in London trading. The shares have advanced 17 percent this
year.  The Elsevier unit provides scientific, technical and
medical information products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
