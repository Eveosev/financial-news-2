SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , the
aquatic theme-park operator owned by Blackstone Group LP,
boosted the amount it plans to raise from an initial public
offering to $500 million.  The company disclosed the new placeholder amount in a
regulatory filing today, without setting a specific price range.
Orlando-based SeaWorld filed for a U.S. IPO with a $100 million
placeholder amount in December.  Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity firm, is
moving ahead with the IPO as soon as this month after rejecting
takeover bids for the theme-park operator, a person familiar
with the matter said last week.  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and
Onex Corp. each made bids for Orlando-based SeaWorld, people
with knowledge of the matter said in February.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are
leading the IPO for the theme-park company. SeaWorld plans to
list on the  New York  Stock Exchange under the symbol SEAS.  Blackstone took control of SeaWorld after agreeing in 2009
to buy  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s (ABI)  amusement-park business in a
deal then valued at as much as $2.7 billion. SeaWorld, which
competes with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  and Six Flags Entertainment Corp.,
runs almost a dozen amusement parks in states such as Florida,
California and Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
