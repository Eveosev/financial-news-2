Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund had
assets under management of more than $100 billion, helping the
Gulf nation’s pursuit of a AAA  credit rating , according to the
Qatar Financial Centre Authority.  A rating upgrade is possible because of the nation’s
financial strength, Abdulrahman Ahmad Al-Shaibi, managing
director of the government-run authority charged with expanding
the nation’s financial services, said in a presentation at the
Bloomberg Doha Conference today.  The country will invest $200 billion in infrastructure in
the next 10 years, he said.  Qatar wants its credit rating increased by two levels to
AAA, putting the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas on par with countries including Canada and Norway. Apart
from making investments in regions such as the U.K., the U.S and
 Europe , the country plans to spend $140 billion on
infrastructure by 2019, three years before hosting the World Cup
soccer tournament, to diversify its sources of wealth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
