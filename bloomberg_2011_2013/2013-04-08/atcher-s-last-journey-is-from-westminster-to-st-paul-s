The final journey of former U.K. Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher  will take her from Parliament in Westminster to  St. Paul’s Cathedral , in an event that will fall just one step short of a full state funeral.  Thatcher will be given a ceremonial funeral with military honors, Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s office said in a statement today. The occasion will echo the obsequies held for the Queen Mother in 2002. State funerals are generally reserved for monarchs, though they differ little. In a ceremonial funeral, the carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by horses, rather than sailors from the Royal Navy.  The last non-royal to receive a state funeral was  Winston Churchill , in recognition of his leadership as Britain’s prime minister during World War II. Others who have been given the honor include Admiral Horatio Nelson, who died during the Royal Navy’s victory over the French and Spanish fleets in 1805, and 19th-century prime ministers including William Gladstone.  “She specifically did not want a state funeral and nor did her family,” said Thatcher’s spokesman, Tim Bell. “She particularly did not wish to lie in state as she thought that was not appropriate.”  Commenting after some Tory lawmakers called for a state funeral, Bell, a member of the upper House of Lords, said Thatcher didn’t want a Royal Air Force fly-past “as she thought that was a waste of money -- somewhat in character, you might think.”  Private Church  Thatcher’s coffin will initially be taken to the  Chapel of St. Mary Undercroft,  a private church used by lawmakers in the 11th-century  Westminster Hall , the oldest part of Parliament. The Queen Mother’s coffin lay in state in the hall itself for the public to file past. The former prime minister’s remains will later be taken to the Royal Air Force chapel of  St. Clement Danes  on the Strand, just outside the  City of London  financial district.  On the day of the funeral, for which a date has yet to be named, her coffin will travel in procession to St. Paul’s, within the City, less than a mile away, in a carriage drawn by the  King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery . The route will be lined from military representatives. On the steps of St. Paul’s, Thatcher will receive a guard of honor from service personnel and retired military from the  Royal Hospital Chelsea , known as the Chelsea Pensioners.  Thatcher, who was prime minister from 1979 to 1990 and died today, will be cremated in a private ceremony following the funeral, Cameron’s office said.
