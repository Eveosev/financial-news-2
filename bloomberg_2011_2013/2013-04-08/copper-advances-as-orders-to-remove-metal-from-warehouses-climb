Copper gained, rebounding from three
consecutive weeks of losses, after data showed orders to remove
the metal from warehouses jumped to the highest level in more
than 15 years and amid concerns over strikes in  Chile .  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 1.2
percent to $7,494.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,480 at 3:44 p.m. Shanghai time. The metal
lost 4.5 percent in the past three weeks. The August contract on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 1.1 percent higher at
54,590  yuan  ($8,798) a ton.  LME canceled warrants, which indicate the orders to remove
metal from warehouses, climbed to 147,025 tons on April 5,
bourse data showed. That was the highest since at least October
1997, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. Copper miners
in Chile plan to announce the date of a nationwide strike today,
a miners’ union representing workers at state-owned Codelco said
in a statement e-mailed yesterday.  “After retreating 11 percent from its February high,
copper is witnessing a technical rebound,” Tong Ling, an
analyst at Essence Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing,
referring to the Feb. 4 intraday high of $8,346. “Seasonal
demand, as indicated by surging canceled warrants, will help the
temporary rally.”  Copper for May delivery on the Comex in  New York  gained 0.9
percent to $3.373 a pound. Net-short  positions , or wagers on
falling prices, held by funds advanced to 38,951 futures and
options contracts as of April 2 from 30,036 a week earlier,
according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  On the LME, aluminum gained as much as 1 percent to
$1,905.75 a ton, the highest level since March 28, while nickel
rebounded 1.2 percent to $16,140 after falling to the lowest
level in more than four months on April 5. Zinc, lead and tin
also advanced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
