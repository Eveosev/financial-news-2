Bakken’s differential to domestic
benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened more than any other
U.S.-produced crude with the approach of a turnaround at
Northern Tier Energy LP’s Minnesota refinery.  The crude produced in North Dakota’s Williston Basin lost
$2.75 a barrel against WTI, falling to a discount of $1.50 at 2
p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Northern Tier was planning to do some turnaround work,”
said Justin Kringstad, director of the North Dakota Pipeline
Authority. “Typically when we see refineries and things go down
for maintenance in the past, we see significant price
fluctuations.”  The company planned to begin a turnaround at the Minnesota
refinery this month, officials said on the fourth-quarter
earnings call last month. The work on its No. 2 crude unit and
hydrotreater will allow the refinery to process more North
Dakota light oil and increase capacity by 8,000 barrels a day
during periods of increased demand.  Christine Carnicelli, a Northern Tier spokeswoman in
Ridgefield, Connecticut, declined to comment on operations at
the refinery today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
