Aventicum Capital Management plans
to invest in equities and credit as the venture of  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  and Qatar Holding LLC seeks opportunities in  emerging
markets , its chief executive officer for Qatar said.  Aventicum will focus on listed securities in the  Middle
East , North Africa and Turkey, Hashem Montasser said in an
interview today at the Bloomberg Doha Conference.  “We’ll be looking at anything listed,” he said. “We’ll
be launching a number of funds dedicated to that region.”  Credit Suisse and Qatar Holding, a unit of the Persian Gulf
emirate’s sovereign-wealth fund, last year agreed to form the
asset manager to boost investments in emerging markets. The
venture will operate out of two hubs including a Doha-based unit
focusing on investments in the Middle East,  Turkey  and other
frontier markets, Credit Suisse said. Montasser, formerly head
of asset management at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, was appointed CEO
and chief investment officer of the Doha unit.  Montasser said Aventicum is waiting for license from the
Qatari regulator to set up the fund and expects to obtain it in
the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
