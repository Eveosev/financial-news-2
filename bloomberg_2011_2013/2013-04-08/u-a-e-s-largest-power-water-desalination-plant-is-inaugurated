The United Arab Emirates’s largest
power and water plant formally opened today, a facility with
nine gas and steam turbines and eight desalination units called
M Station that cost 10 billion dirham ($2.7 billion) to build.  The plant inaugurated in Jebel Ali can produce as much as
2,060 megawatts of electricity and 140 million imperial gallons
(168 million gallons) of potable water a day, about a fifth of
what’s required to meet demand in Dubai, DEWA or the Dubai
Electricity and Water Authority said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
