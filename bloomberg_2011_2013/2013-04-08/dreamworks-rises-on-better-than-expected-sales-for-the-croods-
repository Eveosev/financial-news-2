DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) , the
studio led by Jeffrey Katzenberg, advanced after a Lazard
Capital Markets analyst raised his estimate for total domestic
ticket sales for the film “The Croods.”  “The Croods,” which follows a prehistoric family
challenged by new discoveries such as fire, will likely take in
$192 million, up from a projection of $151 million,  Barton Crockett , a Lazard analyst in New York, wrote in a note
yesterday.  The first major animated film of the year, “The Croods”
opened at No. 1 in U.S. theaters the weekend of March 22, taking
in $43.6 million. Ticket sales last weekend fell 23 percent to
$20.7 million, bring its total sales to $125.4 million. Sony
Corp.’s “Evil Dead” ranked first with $26 million.  Glendale, California-based DreamWorks Animation  rose  5.2
percent to $19.33 at the close in New York. The shares have
increased 17 percent this year compared with a 9.6 percent gain
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
