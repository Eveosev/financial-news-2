Canadian and Indian regulators have
agreed to an arrangement that moves the two countries closer to
completing a pact that will enable the export of uranium and
other nuclear supplies for civilian use.  The agreement between the Canadian Nuclear Safety
Commission and  India â€™s Department of Atomic Energy will allow
the implementation of a nuclear cooperation pact first signed in
2010, Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said in a press
release.  The arrangement will take effect when the two nations bring
the 2010 cooperation deal into force, Oliver said in the
statement. That deal will allow companies such as Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan-based  Cameco Corp. (CCO)  to sell nuclear materials,
equipment and technology to India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
