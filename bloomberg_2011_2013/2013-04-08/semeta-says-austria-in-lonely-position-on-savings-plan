Austria  may find itself isolated if
it continues to resist European Union savings-tax proposals, EU
Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said.  Semeta said Luxembourg is loosening its opposition to
automatic exchange of information, citing comments from that
nation’s Finance Minister Luc Frieden to  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung . The tax chief said this “long-overdue” shift paves
the way to move ahead on the EU negotiations, which have been
stalled since last year.  “The spotlight is now on Austria,” Semeta said in a
statement. “If it continues to resist this inevitable progress
towards greater transparency, it will find itself in a lonely
and quite unsustainable position.”  Luxembourg and Austria last year vetoed negotiations over
the extension of a savings tax because of concerns that they
would be forced to give up banking secrecy measures that attract
foreign depositors. The two countries blocked the European Union
from starting talks on updating the seven-year-old tax accord
with  Switzerland , Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and  San Marino .  Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said April 5 that
her country’s opposition hasn’t changed. “I’m not interested in
an automated information exchange that creates a data graveyard
of sorts,” Fekter told reporters in Brussels.  Under a 2005 accord, Austria and Luxembourg withhold tax on
interest income paid to depositors from other EU states while
protecting their identities. Other EU states transfer the income
data to the depositor’s home tax authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
