The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
has asked the White House to approve a plan for the government
to boost sugar prices by buying excess inventory and selling it
to ethanol plants.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said no decision has been
made on the plan, which the agency said went to President  Barack
Obama ’s budget office last week. Prices for domestic sugar fell
37 percent in the past year as stockpiles climbed to the highest
level in a decade. The surplus may trigger federal purchases
under an unused program created in a 2008 agriculture bill.
Sugar-to-ethanol is one of several options the government is
weighing to steady prices, Vilsack said.  “We will make a decision following a review of all
circumstances,” Vilsack told reporters today at a conference in
 Washington .  The USDA will update its sugar-supply forecast on April 10.
The White House budget office has 90 days to review any proposed
regulations. The department is required to manage sugar supplies
under federal law. Use in biofuels is one tool that can help
prop up prices that are near levels that would require the
government to buy excess inventories.  The department would need to purchase 534,000 short tons
(484,000 metric tons), or 5.8 percent of this year’s  estimated
production , to reduce the surplus to the government’s desired
level, according to Frank Jenkins, president of Jenkins Sugar
Group in Wilton,  Connecticut , the largest broker of U.S. sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
