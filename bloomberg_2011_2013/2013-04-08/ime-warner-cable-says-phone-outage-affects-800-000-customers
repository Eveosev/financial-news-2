Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable company, said it has resolved intermittent
technical problems that had prevented some customers from using
its home-phone  service .  Service was restored at 3:15 a.m. New York time, Justin
Venech, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. He didn’t
provide a reason for the service interruption. More than 800,000
customers had been potentially affected, the New York-based
company said yesterday.  “There’s a technical issue preventing a limited number of
our home phone customers from placing or receiving calls on an
intermittent basis,” Time Warner Cable said at the time. “Our
engineers are working on the problem to restore service as
quickly as possible.”  Time Warner Cable served about 5 million residential phone
subscribers as of Dec. 31, according to its  annual report .  Shares of the company, which ranks second to Comcast Corp.
in cable subscribers, fell 1.6 percent to $95.97 at the close in
New York. The stock has climbed 19 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
