Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT) 
climbed the most in more than three months after  General
Electric Co. (GE)  agreed to buy  Lufkin Industries Inc. (LUFK) , another
provider of oilfield services, for about $3.3 billion.  Weatherford, based in Geneva, rose 4.2 percent to $12.55 at
10:59 a.m. in New York, after gaining as much as 6 percent, the
biggest intraday increase since Dec. 31. The increase was the
largest in the Bloomberg Americas Oil & Gas Services Index,
after Lufkin, which GE agreed to buy for a 38 percent premium to
its April 5 closing price.  Lufkin and Weatherford make up about 80 percent of the U.S.
market for rod-lift systems, which help pull oil out of existing
wells that lose pressure over time, J. David Anderson, a New
York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co. who rates the
company the equivalent of a buy, said in a note to investors
today.  With tax issues mostly resolved, Weatherford is still
undergoing an investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, “the main impediment for an acquisition or for activists
to get involved in this stock,” Anderson wrote. “Our
understanding is a mid-year resolution with the Department of
Justice is increasingly likely, at which time we believe a
takeover valuation premium is likely to develop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
