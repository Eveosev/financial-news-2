Brazil’s swap rates fell to a one-
month low as economists lowered their forecasts for growth and
inflation, spurring speculation that the central bank will
refrain from increasing borrowing costs next week  Swap rates due January 2015 dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 8.36 percent at 10:08 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since March 6. The
real rose less than 0.1 percent to 1.9846 per dollar.  Latin America ’s largest economy will expand 3 percent in
2013, according to the median estimate of about 100 analysts in
a central bank survey published today. They forecast growth of
3.01 percent last week. They cut their outlook for annual
inflation to 5.70 percent from 5.71 percent.  “The latest central bank economists’ survey showed a
modest decline in 2013 inflation and growth expectations,”
 Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America currency strategist at Bank of
 Nova Scotia  in Toronto, said in an e-mailed report to clients.  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting indicated
that an increase in the benchmark lending  rate  from a record low
7.25 percent wasn’t imminent as policy makers said “a cautious
management of monetary policy” was needed. Board members are
scheduled to meet April 16-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
