Germany  plans to probe 50 former
guards of the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing Kurt Schrimm, chief prosecutor at the
nationâ€™s central Nazi crime investigation unit.  After the 2011 conviction of  John Demjanjuk  by a Munich
court for aiding in the murder of at least 28,000 Jews at the
Sobibor camp, chances are good to bring other guards to justice
even if no eye witnesses can testify, the newspaper said. The 50
men are all around 90 years old and live in various places in
Germany, according to Sueddeutsche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
