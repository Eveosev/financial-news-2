Canada trade minister Ed Fast said
the next head of the  World Trade Organization  should be able to
bridge differences between poor and rich nations.  The new head will need to re-establish the organization’s
credibility as an institution that can advance multilateral
trade efforts at a time when countries have been pursuing
regional trade agreements, Fast said.  “Canada will support the selection of a candidate who has
a demonstrated ability to bridge the very difficult gaps between
developed, developing and least-developed countries in the
pursuit of successful multilateral trade outcomes,” Fast said
in a statement that outlines what he believes should be the
organization’s agenda. He said the selection process should be
“merit-based.”  WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy’s term expires Aug. 31 and
the organization’s General Council is expected to complete the
selection process no later than May 31, according to the
organization’s website.  Fast has met with seven of the contenders, which include
candidates from South Korea,  Mexico , Jordan, Costa Rica, Brazil,
 Ghana , Indonesia and  New Zealand , according to the minister’s
office. The Geneva-based trade arbiter has had only one leader
from a developing country since it was created in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
