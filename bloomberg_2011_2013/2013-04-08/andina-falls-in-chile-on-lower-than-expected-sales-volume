Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A) ,  Chile ’s
largest Coca-Cola bottler, fell to a two-week low after
reporting a decline in quarterly sales volume.  Andina retreated 1.4 percent to 3,135 pesos at 1:19 p.m. in
Santiago. A close at that level would be the lowest since March
26. The benchmark Ipsa index advanced 0.4 percent.  The company sold 189.6 million cases in the first quarter,
down 0.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, according
to a statement on its website dated April 5. The decline was led
by a 5.9 percent drop in Chile. Volumes in Brazil, the country’s
biggest market by sales, advanced 0.4 percent.  “We expect some negative pressure on the stock in the
short term as volumes were lower than expected in  Brazil ,”
analysts at the brokerage unit of lender Corpbanca, including
Cristobal Lyon and Pedro Letelier, said in an e-mailed note
today. “Volumes in Argentina and Chile were in line with our
expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
