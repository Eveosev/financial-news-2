Chilean consumer prices rose 0.4
percent in March from the month before, the fastest pace in five
months and more than analysts had forecast, led by a 4.3 percent
jump in education costs.  The median estimate of 12 analysts polled by Bloomberg was
for prices to rise 0.3 percent. Annual inflation was 1.5 percent
last month, up from 1.3 percent in February, the National
Statistics Institute said in a report today. Consumer prices
excluding fuel and produce increased 0.2 percent in the month.  Policy makers last week reduced their 2013 inflation
forecast to 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent while boosting economic
growth estimates by a quarter-point. Inflation in 2014 will
accelerate to 3 percent, matching the central bankâ€™s target.  Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent last year, compared with
4.4 percent in 2011, falling short of the target band for the
first time since 2010.  Two-year breakeven inflation, which is derived from the
difference between nominal and inflation-linked yields on swaps,
decreased seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.57
percent April 5 since the end of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
