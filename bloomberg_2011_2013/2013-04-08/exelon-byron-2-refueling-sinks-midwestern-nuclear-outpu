Exelon Corp. (EXC)  began a refueling
shutdown at the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2 reactor in  Illinois ,
sending  Midwestern nuclear-power  production to the lowest level
in almost a year.  Nationwide generation retreated 2.6 percent from yesterday
to  78,077 megawatts , or 77 percent of capacity, the biggest drop
in eight weeks, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
data compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 0.2 percent higher than
 one year ago  with 20 of 104 reactors offline.  Byron 2, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) west of  Chicago ,
halted for scheduled refueling and maintenance after operating
at 100 percent of capacity yesterday, according to Paul Dempsey,
an Exelon spokesman based at the plant.  The shuttered unit led the decline in Midwestern output,
which fell  6.4 percent  to 15,750 megawatts, the lowest level
since April 22, according to commission data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall, when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
