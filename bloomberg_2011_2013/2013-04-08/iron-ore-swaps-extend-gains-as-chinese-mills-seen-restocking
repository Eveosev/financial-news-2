Iron-ore swaps rose for a fifth
session as Chinese steel mills rebuilding stockpiles may keep
prices at current levels for the next few weeks, according to
Deutsche Bank AG.  May contracts rose 1.5 percent to $135.50 a dry metric ton
as of 10:07 a.m. in  London , according to GFI Group Inc., a
broker of the swaps used to hedge prices and bet on Chinese
growth. The derivatives also gained for the past four sessions,
according to data from SGX AsiaClear, the largest clearer of the
contracts.  Steelmakers in  China , the largest importer of the
steelmaking raw material, may be restocking, Deutsche Bank
analysts including Xiao Fu and Michael Hsueh said in an e-mailed
report today. Inventories at the country’s ports dropped 30
percent to 67.96 million tons in the past year, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Prices might fall
below $110 a ton by the middle of the year, Deutsche Bank
estimates.  “We expect that various Chinese  steel mills  may be buying
to replenish inventories and that there may be some mildly
positive sentiment emerging from evidence that there is some
ongoing restocking by Chinese manufacturers,” the analysts said
in the report. “We expect that prices could remain at these
levels for several weeks before the market sees further
weakness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
