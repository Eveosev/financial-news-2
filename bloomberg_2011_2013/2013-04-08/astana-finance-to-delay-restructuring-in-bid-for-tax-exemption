AO Astana Finance, the Kazakh
financial company that defaulted in 2009, said it plans to delay
completion of its debt restructuring for a second time as it
struggles to win an exemption on corporate income tax.  “We plan to extend a restructuring regime” as the company
makes a case to the government for amending Kazakh law and
freeing it from a tax payout of as much as $400 million on
expected profit from writedowns and the debt overhaul, Daniyar
Nurskenov, a managing director at the Astana-based company, said
by phone today.  It’s a “big sum” that may scuttle the restructuring if
Astana Finance is forced to make the payment, he said. The
company defaulted after it stopped servicing its international
debt in May 2009 as the central Asian nation slipped into its
first recession in a decade.  The company, whose creditors backed a plan to restructure
$1.9 billion of debt in June, planned to complete the
restructuring last year before delaying it until the end of
March, according to Nurskenov. Astana Finance creditors holding
79.6 percent of the company’s debt approved the plan in Almaty
on June 29, 2012. The government owns 25.5 percent of the
company, Kazakhstan Stock Exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
