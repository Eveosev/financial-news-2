India ’s government bonds rallied for
a fourth day, the longest winning streak in two months, on
speculation slowing economic growth will prompt the central bank
to cut  interest rates . The rupee strengthened.  The yield on the notes due 2022 reached the lowest level in
almost three weeks after a purchasing managers’ index released
April 1 showed manufacturing growth fell to a 16-month low in
March. The  Reserve Bank  of India reduced the  repurchase  rate by
25 basis points each in January and March, and the next review
is due on May 3.  “Growth worries are persisting and that could lead to more
rate cuts,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. An increase in cash
availability at lenders is also spurring purchases, he said.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.91 percent as of
10:02 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract
used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, dropped two
basis points to 7.42 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lenders  borrowed  an average of 560 billion rupees ($10.2
billion) a day from the central bank in the three days through
April 5, lower than 957 billion rupees a day in March, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rupee advanced a second day after  Raghuram Rajan , the
chief economic adviser in India’s  Finance Ministry , said on
April 6 the current-account deficit was probably
“significantly” narrower in the first quarter as overseas
sales recovered. The shortfall reached a record $32.6 billion in
the three months through December, official data show.  Rupee Strengthens  The rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 54.68 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has weakened 6.5
percent against the dollar in the past year, with only  Japan ’s
yen declining more among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies.
Commerzbank AG, the most accurate forecaster for the rupee in
the last four quarters, predicts a 9.4 percent gain to 50 by
year-end as lower interest rates help revive the economy.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
one basis point to 7.82 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.78 per
dollar, compared with 55.93 at the end of last week, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 55.71 versus 55.75. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
