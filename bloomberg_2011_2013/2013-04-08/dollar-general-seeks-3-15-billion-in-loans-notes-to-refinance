Dollar General Corp. (DG) , the discount
retailer acquired by KKR & Co. in 2007, sold $1.3 billion of
bonds and is planning to issue $1.9 billion of loans as it seeks
to refinance senior secured borrowings.  The company issued $900 million of 3.25 percent, 10-year
notes to yield 155 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $400 million of 1.875 percent, five-year
securities at a relative yield of 120 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt is expected to be rated
Baa3, the lowest level of investment grade, by Moody’s Investors
Service.  The bank debt is expected to consist of a $1 billion  term
loan  and an $850 million cash flow-based revolving credit line,
each due in five years,  Dollar General  said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire .  Dollar General, based in Goodlettsville,  Tennessee , plans
to use proceeds from the term loan and the note sale to pay off
a senior secured credit pact and for general corporate purposes,
according to the statement.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., U.S. Bancorp and  Wells Fargo & Co .
arranged the note offering, Bloomberg data show.  June Sale  Dollar General previously sold debt in June, issuing $500
million of 4.125 percent, five-year debentures to yield 340.6
basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The
bonds traded at 107.5 cents on the dollar to yield 2.28 percent
on March 26, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Dollar General had $2.77 billion of total debt as of Feb.
1, including $1.96 billion of loans, $500 million of notes and a
$1.2 billion asset-based revolver with $873.4 million available
for borrowing, according to a March 25 regulatory filing.  Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporters on this story:
