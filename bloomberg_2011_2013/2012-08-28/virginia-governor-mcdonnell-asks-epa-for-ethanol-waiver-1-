Virginia Governor  Bob McDonnell 
asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to suspend the
nation’s ethanol requirement, citing high grain prices.  McDonnell follows lawmakers from both political parties who
have called for a suspension of the mandate in the wake of the
worst U.S. drought in 56 years, prompting the U.S. Agriculture
Department to reduce its forecast for this year’s corn crop to
10.779 billion bushels.  The governors of  North Carolina , Arkansas, Maryland, Texas,
Delaware and Georgia have asked the Obama administration to halt
the law, which requires refiners to use 13.2 billion gallons of
ethanol this year and 13.8 billion in 2013.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.6 cent to
$2.58 a gallon at 2:16 p.m.  New York  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have gained 17 percent this year.  The EPA asked Aug. 20 for public comments on the waiver
requests and said it has 90 days to make a decision.  Growth Energy, an ethanol trade group, sent a letter
yesterday to Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe and the heads of the
other states who have called for a waiver, saying that the
measure isn’t needed.  Texas Governor  Rick Perry  was unsuccessful in a 2008
petition to the EPA to reduce the requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
