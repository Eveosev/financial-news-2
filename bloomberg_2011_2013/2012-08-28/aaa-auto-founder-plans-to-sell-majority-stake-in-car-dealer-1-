AAA Auto Group NV (AAA) ’s majority owner
Anthony Denny plans to sell most of his holdings in the Czech
chain of used-car dealerships over the next two years.  Denny, the former chief executive officer who owns about 77
percent of the shares, intends to sell as much as 73.8 percent
of the company, AAA Auto said today on its  website .  The move comes after Denny was  replaced  as CEO in July, two
decades after he founded the business. The sale will take
“approximately one to two years” and Denny may keep a minority
stake, the Amsterdam-registered company said.  “The departure of the long-term chief and majority owner
raises uncertainty about future developments, and therefore we
regard the news as slightly negative,” said Martin Krajhanzl,
an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS in  Prague , in a report today.  AAA Auto Shares jumped 3 percent to 19.46 koruna by 12:55
p.m. in Prague, making it the best performer in the 14-member  PX (PX) 
equity index, which traded down 0.4 percent. The stock earlier
dropped as much as 1.6 percent after the sale announcement.
Share turnover so far today has been more than three times the
daily average over the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
