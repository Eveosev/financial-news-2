What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
on speculation that rain from Hurricane Isaac may cause damage
and increase disease in immature crops,  Tim Hannagan , a grain
specialist at Alpari U.S. LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
higher as rain and wind from Isaac in the next five days
threaten yields, Hannagan said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that dry weather will reduce Australian production,
limiting global supplies, Hannagan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
