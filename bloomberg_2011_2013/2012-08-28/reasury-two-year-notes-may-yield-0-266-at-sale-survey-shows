The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.266
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2014, yielded 0.275
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The record auction low was 0.220 percent on July 24 at the
last sale of the maturity.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past 22
sales of two-year notes after peaking at $44 billion from
October 2009 through April 2010.  The July 24 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
4, the most since the record high of 4.07 in November. The
average ratio for the past 10 auctions is 3.75.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  30.9 percent of the notes at the
July sale after purchasing 31.7 percent at the June offering.
The average for the past 10 auctions is 33.4 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.9 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 10.8
percent at the past 10.  Two-year notes have returned 0.1 percent this year,
compared with a 2.1 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 1.5 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall rose 9.8 percent.  Three Auctions  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on Aug. 30.  The sales and a $14 billion auction of five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities on Aug. 23 will raise $62.6
billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the public
total $50.4 billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
