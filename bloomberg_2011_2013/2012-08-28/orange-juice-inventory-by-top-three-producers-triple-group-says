Orange-juice inventories held by the
worldâ€™s top three producers tripled to 662,452 metric tons on
June 30, an industry group said.  Stockpiles compare with 214,000 tons a year ago, the
CitrusBr industry association said in an e-mailed statement
today. The Sao Paulo-based association compiles global data from
inventories held by Sucocitrico Cutrale Ltda., Louis Dreyfus &
Cie SA and the company formed by the merger between Citrovita
and Citrosuco in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  Growers in the southeastern Brazilian states of  Sao Paulo 
and  Minas Gerais  will harvest 364 million boxes in the crop year
that started March 1, down from 428 million a year earlier,
CitrusBR said May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
