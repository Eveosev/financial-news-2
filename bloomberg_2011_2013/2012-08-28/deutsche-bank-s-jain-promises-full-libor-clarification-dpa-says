Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Co-Chief Executive
Officer Anshu Jain promised a full clarification of the Libor
case, saying his bank is making a huge effort to investigate
past procedures, DPA reported, citing comments by Jain at an
event in Berlin.  Jain reiterated that the lender is co-operating closely
with the relevant authorities and that the bank takes the issue
very seriously, DPA said. Jain referred to comments from
supervisory board head  Paul Achleitner  that no past and current
member of the board participated in the scandal, DPA said.  The Deutsche Bank executive also said that countries hit by
the sovereign debt crisis need more time and should get a chance
and said nothing is “free”, DPA reported.  Jain added that he believes the euro will survive,
according to the  news agency . While the economies of Spain and
Italy are generally on a sound footing, Jain said, the
probability of Italy defaulting increased 40 percent to 50
percent over the last 12 months, DPA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
