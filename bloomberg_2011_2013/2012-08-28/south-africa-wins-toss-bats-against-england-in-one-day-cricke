Hashim Amla scored 150 as South
Africa totaled 287-5 in its 50 overs against England in the
second one-day cricket match in Southampton.  Opening batsman Amla was dismissed in the last over, caught
by Tim Bresnan off Steven Finn.  Graeme Smith  scored 52 and
captain AB de Villiers made 28 after South Africa won the toss.
Graeme Swann took 2-50.  The day/night contest started at 1 p.m. local time. Four
days ago the opening match in a five-game series was washed out
by rain after just 5.3 overs in Cardiff.  The visitors fielded an unchanged team today while England
brought in spinner Samit Patel for  Chris Woakes .  South Africa previously won the Test series 2-0 to replace
England atop the International Cricket Council rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
