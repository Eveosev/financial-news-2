Italian and Spanish 10-year
government bonds fell amid concern policy makers at the  European
Central Bank  will fail to contain the region’s debt crisis as
they prepare to meet next week.  Spain ’s 10-year yield approached the highest in a week
after Catalonia said it planned to request 5 billion euros
($6.28 billion) from a regional financing facility. Italy’s
bonds dropped as the nation prepared to sell as much as 7.5
billion euros of securities maturing in five and 10 years this
week. Shorter-maturity Spanish and Italian two-year notes
advanced after borrowing costs fell at auctions.  “There’s a nervousness in the market before the ECB
meeting and what policy makers will be able to do,” said
Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV
in Amsterdam. “There is a lot of uncertainty in the market and
 Italy  and Spanish bonds are the most sensitive to this. The 10-
year Italian bond is losing ground before the supply. There will
probably be a selloff until that auction is out of the way.”  The Spanish  10-year yield  rose nine basis points to 6.47
percent at 4:28 p.m. London time after climbing to 6.49 percent
on Aug. 24, the highest level since Aug. 20. The 5.85 percent
bond due in January 2022 fell 0.62, or 6.20 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 95.64.  The Italian  10-year yield  climbed 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 5.82 percent.  ECB Purchases  Spanish and Italian 10-year yields dropped to three-month
lows last week on speculation the ECB and the region’s 17 member
nations will agree on a plan to use short-maturity sovereign
debt purchases to curb governments’ borrowing costs and win them
time to implement fiscal changes. ECB President  Mario Draghi 
said on Aug. 2 any central-bank bond purchases would focus “on
the short end of the yield curve.”  Italy’s two-year yield slid 10 basis points today to 3.03
percent, and similar-maturity Spanish yields fell nine basis
points to 3.66 percent.  Italy sold 3 billion euros of two-year zero-coupon notes at
a yield of 3.064 percent, down from 4.86 percent at the previous
auction on July 26. Demand rose to 1.95 times the amount
allotted, from 1.78 times. The nation also auctioned inflation-
linked bonds due in 2016 and 2019.  Spain Sale  The Spanish Treasury sold 3.6 billion euros of bills,
surpassing its 3.5 billion euros target. The yield for three-
month securities fell to 0.946 percent from 2.434 percent at the
last sale on July 24. The rate on the six-month bills dropped to
2.026 percent from 3.691 percent in July.  The auction results “illustrate that post Mario Draghi’s
comments regarding the ECB’s intention to concentrate purchases
on the short end, that demand for short-dated paper has been
relatively strong,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec
Bank Plc in London. “We’re seeing longer-dated paper of both
Spain and Italy underperform.”  Italy is scheduled to sell 9 billion euros of 181-day bills
tomorrow, and debt due in 2017 and 2022 on Aug. 30.  Catalonia will seek almost a third of the 18 billion-euro
fund created in July by the government of Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  to help shore up finances in Spain’s 17 autonomous
regions. Valencia was the first to tap the fund with an
unspecified request on July 20.  German Bunds  German bonds advanced as investors sought the region’s
safest assets.  The 10-year bund yield fell two basis points to 1.34
percent. It declined to 1.32 percent on Aug. 24, the lowest
level since Aug. 3.  The market is “going to continue to concentrate on how the
ECB is going to act,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “It’s got to
the stage where I wouldn’t want to be short bunds going into the
meeting.” A short position is a bet an asset will decline.  Finland sold 4 billion euros of 10-year bonds priced to
yield three basis points more than the mid-swap rate. Finnish
securities maturing in April 2021 yielded 1.51 percent.  Volatility in Italian government debt was the highest in
the euro area today, followed by Spain and  Germany , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  German bonds have returned 3.8 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities fell 2.3
percent, while Italy’s gained 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
