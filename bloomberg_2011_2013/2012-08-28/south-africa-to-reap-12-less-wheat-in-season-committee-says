South Africa  will probably reap 12
percent less wheat this season than a year earlier after it
planted the smallest area on record with the grain, according to
the Crop Estimates Committee.  Farmers are expected to harvest 1.76 million metric tons of
wheat in the season compared with 2.01 million tons last year,
Baldwin Netshifhefhe, the committee principal statistician, said
by phone in  Pretoria  today. This is the smallest production
since 2010 when it was 1.43 million tons, according to the
committee’s website. The median estimate of five analysts was
for 1.75 million tons.  The country planted 551,200 hectares (1.36 million acres)
of wheat this season, down from 604,700 hectares a year earlier
and the smallest since at least 1931 when records began,
according to the committee. The previous estimate was 546,700
hectares on July 24.  “The decrease in wheat tonnages is because of lower
prices,” Netshifhefhe said.  South African wheat prices have fallen 18 percent from
a record 4,304 rand ($511) a ton in March 2008 to 3,510 rand a
ton today.  The nation is a net importer of wheat and is sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . South
Africa is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Canola Production  Production of canola will rise 12 percent to 66,135 tons,
according to the committee. Soy output will be 1.3 percent
smaller at 646,950 tons while production of sunflower,
groundnuts, sorghum and dry beans will be unchanged. The revised
estimate of malting barley plantings increased 5.9 percent to
84,940 tons while canola’s area climbed 1.4 percent to 44,110
tons, it said.  The committee raised its forecast of corn production by
3.3 percent to 11.2 million tons for the season through April,
Netshifhefhe said. South Africa is the continent’s largest
producer of the grain.  The forecast includes 6.36 million tons of white corn and
4.83 million tons of yellow corn, he said. The expected output
compares with the July 24 forecast of 10.8 million tons and a
median estimate of 11 million tons by eight traders surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  “Producer deliveries are higher than expected,” he said.  The contract for December delivery of yellow corn, used
mainly as  animal feed  in Africa’s biggest economy, declined 1.8
percent to 2,626 rand in Johannesburg. White corn for delivery
in the same month dropped 2.4 percent to 2,641 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
