Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  named
directors to its board from three of the companies that rescued
the market maker after a computer malfunction caused a $440
million loss.  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  Chief Executive Officer Fred Tomczyk,  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  managing director Martin Brand and
Matthew Nimetz of General Atlantic LLC will all join the board
with immediate effect, Knight said today in a statement.  Knight’s computers bombarded the market with unintended
orders just after trading began on Aug. 1, causing volume to
surge and prices to swing in dozens of  securities . The company
faced insolvency in the days following the mishap as customers
of its market-making unit took business elsewhere.  The $440 million loss depleted Knight’s capital and forced
it into a rescue by investors who bought securities convertible
into a stake of more than 70 percent of the  Jersey City , New
Jersey-based firm. Blackstone, a private equity company, and
Getco LLC, the automated trading firm backed by General
Atlantic, each purchased $87.5 million of convertible stock,
while broker TD Ameritrade got $40 million, according to a
regulatory filing by Knight earlier this month.  Knight had announced plans to appoint three directors --one
selected by Blackstone, another by General Atlantic, and one
subject to approval by  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  -- in an Aug. 6
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
