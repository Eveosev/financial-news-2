President  Barack Obama  and Mitt Romney are essentially tied among registered voters as
Republicans gather for their national convention, a poll shows.  The CBS News poll shows Obama with support from 46 percent
of registered voters, while Romney is backed by 45 percent.
Eight in 10 voters say their mind is made up.  The finding comes as the Republican National Convention is
under way in Tampa, Florida. Democrats will assemble next week
for their national convention in Charlotte,  North Carolina .  Romney is seen as the candidate who will do a better job on
the economy, while voters say they think Obama will do more to
help the middle class, the poll shows.  A majority -- 55 percent -- say Obamaâ€™s presidency
has brought more disappointment than satisfaction. Most
Republicans are disappointed, as are 18 percent of Democrats.  The poll, which was conducted Aug. 22-26, has a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
