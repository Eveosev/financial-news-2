A Dubai court sanctioned the $2.2
billion debt restructuring of Drydocks World LLC, the  Middle
East ’s biggest shipyard, after creditors approved the plan.  The ruling by the special tribunal said 97.8 percent of
Drydocks’s creditors agreed to the terms. A government decree
allows the tribunal to enforce a restructuring proposal if at
least two-thirds of the creditors agree to it.  Drydocks World, part of the state-controlled Dubai World
group, filed an application to the Dubai tribunal in April to
block lawsuits after failing to win support from all lenders.  New York-based investment company Monarch Alternative
Capital LP, which won a $45.5 million claim against Drydocks in
a London court, did not vote on the proposal, while JP Morgan
Securities abstained, Adrian Cohen, partner at Clifford Chance
LLP, the  law firm  representing Drydocks, told the court today.  Drydocks proposes to repay $2.2 billion of principal in
full over five years under the restructuring plan. It borrowed
the money to finance two acquisitions in  Singapore  in 2008 to
gain ships and Asian shipbuilding sites. The company raised $1.7
billion for three years at 170 basis points, or 1.7 percentage
points, over the London interbank offered rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It borrowed another $500 million for
five years at 190 basis points over Libor, the data shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
