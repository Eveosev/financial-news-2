New York Times Co. (NYT) ’s outlook for its
corporate debt rating was reduced to “stable” from
“positive” by Moody’s Investors Service, citing falling print
sales and the company’s slow progress in reducing debt.  Times Co. may take several years to use its cash to cut
debt to a level sufficient for an upgrade, Moody’s said today in
a statement. Moody’s maintained Times Co.’s corporate rating at
B1, or four levels below investment grade.  The publisher of the third-biggest U.S. newspaper by
weekday circulation has been shedding ancillary businesses to
pay down debt and focus on its flagship product. Times Co.
agreed to sell its About.com unit to  IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI)  this
week for $300 million, adding to its cash reserves of $570.2
million.  “NY Times may be comfortable holding a sizable cash
position until economic uncertainty diminishes as a primary
objective of the board is to preserve liquidity and the
viability of the company’s news and information industry
leadership,” Moody’s said.  The publisher may introduce a “modest” recurring  dividend 
next year and may distribute cash to shareholders by other
methods, the ratings company said. The  New York  Times trails the
Wall Street Journal and USA Today in weekday circulation.  Times Co. rose less than 1 percent to $9.18 at the close in
New York. The shares have gained 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
