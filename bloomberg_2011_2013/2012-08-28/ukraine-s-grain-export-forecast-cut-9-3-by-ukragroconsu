Ukraine’s grain export forecast was
cut by 9.3 percent by agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult
because wheat and corn yields declined after a summer drought.  Grain exports will be 21.15 million metric tons in the
marketing year which started on July 1, the researcher said in a
statement e-mailed yesterday. This compares with a month-earlier
forecast of 23.33 million tons. The harvest forecast was cut to
42.4 million tons from 43.9 million tons in July, according to
the note.  Ukraine’s average grain yields have declined this year to
2.57 tons a hectare (2.47 acres) as of yesterday from 3.04 tons
a hectare in the same period last year, the researcher, which is
based in the capital, Kiev, said in another note e-mailed today.
The average yields for corn fell to 2.78 tons a hectare from 4
tons a hectare last year.  Wheat exports for August are expected to be 6.3 million
tons, corn 12.5 million tons and barley 2 million tons, the
researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
