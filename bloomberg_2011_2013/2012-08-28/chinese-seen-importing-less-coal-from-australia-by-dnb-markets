China , the world’s biggest coal
consumer, is poised to reduce imports of the commodity from
 Australia  after the gap with domestic prices narrowed, according
to DNB Markets.  The difference has closed to about $13 a metric ton from
$30 in June including freight costs, Oslo-based DNB Markets, a
unit of  Norway ’s largest bank, said in an e-mailed note today.
Based on a two-month time lag for changes in the spread, inbound
shipments will rise 10 percent in August before a “significant
drop” entering the fourth quarter, it said.  “Any arbitrage should be interpreted as an incentive to
import rather than buy domestically, which should employ more
dry-bulk vessels,” DNB Markets said.  Australia is the second-largest exporter of coal, with 164
million tons of the commodity burned to generate power and 149
million tons of the variety used in steelmaking to be shipped in
2012,  according  to the most recent government estimates.  China’s benchmark power-station coal price rose for the
first time in four months from the lowest level since October
2009. The commodity gained to a range of 625  yuan  ($98.30) to
635 yuan a ton as of Aug. 26, according to the China Coal
Transport and Distribution Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
