Chile’s Supreme Court blocked the
construction of a proposed coal plant by Brazil’s  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) 
on the northern coast of the South American country.  The court ordered MPX to resubmit an environmental impact
study that considers the construction of a port and the power
plant as a single project, Judge Sergio Munoz said in a
statement today. MPX, which had filed separate studies on the
port and the plant, will “reassess its business plan,” it said
in an e-mailed statement today.  MPX, controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ,
proposed the $5 billion project to boost regional power supplies
as mining companies including  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  and  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX)  plan new mines in Chile’s Atacama region. Chile has
been hampered by power blackouts since an 8.8-magnitude
earthquake struck in February 2010.  MPX rose 1.8 percent to 11.91 reais in Sao Paulo trading
today, reducing a year-to-date decline to 6.6 percent.  MPX planned to develop the project with EON AG, Germany’s
largest utility. The project, with capacity of 2,100 megawatts,
is part of a planned installation of 11,000 megawatts in Chile
and Brazil by the EON-MPX venture. MPX is 48.1 percent owned by
Brazilian billionaire, according to data Bloomberg compiled.
EON, which acquired an 11.7 percent stake in MPX by July, plans
to expand in  South America  through their venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
