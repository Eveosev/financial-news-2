The NCAA’s sanctions imposed on
 Pennsylvania State University  for its response to Jerry Sandusky’s molestation crimes are based on “unproven” findings
about the college’s culture, a group of former faculty leaders
said.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association ’s sanctions
are based on “sweeping and unsupported generalizations” made
by former FBI director  Louis Freeh , who was hired by Penn State
to investigate the Sandusky affair, according to a  statement 
yesterday from 30 former leaders of Penn State’s Faculty Senate.  After Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn
State, was found to have molested boys on and off campus for 15
years, the NCAA reprimanded the university with a $60 million
fine and a ban on playing in bowl games for at least four years.
The athletic association cited Freeh, whose investigation found
that top Penn State officials concealed allegations against
Sandusky.  While Penn State needs to examine and improve its
operations, “generalizations by the Freeh group and the NCAA do
not provide a satisfactory basis for productive change,” the
group of former faculty leaders said. “The sanctions are deeply
unjust to the university and unfair to its students.”  The NCAA also vacated all  Penn State ’s football wins from
1998 to 2011.  -- Editors: James Callan, Stephen West  To contact the reporter on this story:
