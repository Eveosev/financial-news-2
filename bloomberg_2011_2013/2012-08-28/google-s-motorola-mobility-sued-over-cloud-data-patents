The Motorola Mobility unit of  Google
Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s most popular Internet search engine, was sued
by a patent holder claiming infringement of two U.S. patents for
applications that allow remote-data access from handheld
devices.  Clouding IP LLC, of Greensboro, North Carolina, contends
Motorola Mobility, based in Libertyville, Illinois, is violating
the patents, awarded in 2005 and 2007, by marketing its ZumoCast
and MotoCast products, according to a complaint filed yesterday
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  To contact the reporter on this story:
