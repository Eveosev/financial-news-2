Cattle futures rose for the first
time in three sessions on signs of shrinking U.S. supplies. Hog
prices were steady.  Meatpackers processed 253,000 head of cattle in the first
two days of this week, down 2.3 percent from a week earlier,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The number of cattle
offered by feedlots for slaughter has dropped,  Lane Broadbent , a
vice president at KIS Futures in  Oklahoma City , said in a
telephone interview.  “Our showlist size, overall, has been lighter,” signaling
“less supply, and if we have steady demand, it should make our
prices increase,” Broadbent said.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1.2375 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The most-active contract dropped 1.2 percent in the
previous two sessions.  Steers  in the  spot market  averaged $1.1717 a pound last
week, up 4.6 percent from a year earlier, government data show.
Feedlots buy year-old animals that weigh 500 pounds (227
kilograms) to 800 pounds, and fatten them on corn until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to slaughterhouses.  Wholesale  beef  climbed 0.6 percent to $1.9322 a pound as of
midday, the biggest increase since Aug. 17, USDA data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.4
percent to settle at $1.44475 a pound on the CME, after reaching
$1.45525, the highest since Aug. 16.  Hog futures for October settlement settled unchanged at
73.25 cents a pound. The price has fallen 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
