Libya â€™s interior minister said today
that he was withdrawing his resignation due to security
concerns.  Fawzi Abdel-Aal submitted his resignation on Aug. 26 after
the legislature criticized him following a series of demolitions
of Sufi Muslim shrines by unknown attackers. Abdel-Aal told
reporters that he was staying in office as he felt that leaving
would create a security void.  To contact the reporters on this story:
