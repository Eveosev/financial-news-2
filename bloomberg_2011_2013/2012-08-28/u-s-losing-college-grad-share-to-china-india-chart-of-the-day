China  and  India  are increasing their
share of the world’s college graduates while the U.S. proportion
continues to fall as those emerging economies boost
opportunities by making larger investments in education.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the proportion of
graduating students who attend school in the U.S. is projected
to fall to 17.8 percent by 2020 from 23.8 in 2000, while China
will climb to 13.4 percent from 9 percent and India increases to
7.7 percent from 6.5 percent, according to data compiled by
researchers at the Center for American Progress.  China and India, which have larger populations of college
graduates than the U.S., also have educational attainment that’s
outstripping the world’s largest economy, meaning more people
are reaching higher levels of schooling, according to an
analysis of data by Donna Cooper, Adam Hersh and Ann O’Leary of
the Washington-based center.  “We’re not educating people at the pace we need to remain
globally competitive,” Hersh said. “The most important thing
for economic growth and competitiveness is to have a highly
skilled workforce and China’s investment in its workforce is at
the core of its strategy for economic growth while we in the
U.S. are looking away from education and cutting resources.”  The U.S. will probably lose its lead to China sometime
between 2030 and 2035 if the trends remain constant, said Hersh,
who used data from the U.S. Census Bureau,  Harvard University 
and Korea University.  To contact the reporters on this story:
