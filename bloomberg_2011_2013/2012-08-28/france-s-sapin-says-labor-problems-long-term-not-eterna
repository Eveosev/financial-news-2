France is in a difficult economic
situation and it will take time before conditions improve, Labor
Minister Michel Sapin said in an interview on radio station RTL.  French jobless claims rose to 2.99 million in July, the
highest in 13 years, the labor ministry reported yesterday, as
stalling growth prompted companies to trim payrolls.  “We’re in a very difficult situation,” Sapin said. “It’s
long-term, but not eternal.”  Sapin citied government programs he plans to put in place
to help cut long-term unemployment, particularly among young
people, and said stability must return to the  euro zone  so the
private sector can create jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
