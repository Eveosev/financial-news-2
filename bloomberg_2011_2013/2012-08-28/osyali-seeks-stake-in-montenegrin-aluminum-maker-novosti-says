Tosyali Holding of  Turkey  is in
talks to buy a stake in  Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica AD (KAPG) , a
Montenegrin aluminum producer, through its local unit Toscelik
Profil Ve Sac Endustrisi AS,  Vecernje Novosti  reported, citing
unidentified people.  Tosyali is negotiating with Oleg Deripaska’s En+ Group Ltd.
to buy its 29.36 percent stake in the aluminum plant and may
soon settle on a price that could be “significantly” lower
than the 40 million euros ($50 million) that it initially asked,
the report said. Tosyali Holding bought in April a steel mill in
 Montenegro .  To contact the reporter on this story:
