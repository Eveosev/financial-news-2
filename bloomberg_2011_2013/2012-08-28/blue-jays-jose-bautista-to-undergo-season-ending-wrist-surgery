Jose Bautista  of the  Toronto Blue
Jays , a two-time Major League Baseball home run champion, will
have season-ending surgery next week to stabilize a tendon in
his left wrist.  Bautista, 31, aggravated his left wrist on Aug. 25, his
second game back after spending more than five weeks on the
disabled list. He opted for surgery after meeting with a hand
specialist, who determined that the sheath that holds the wrist
ligament in place is damaged and causing discomfort.  “The only way I could have played again this year without
having surgery was to do what we did,” Bautista told reporters.
“I tried, there’s just too much instability in that tendon. It
got to the point where risking injuring the tendon wasn’t worth
it.”  Bautista, an outfielder, said he expects to be ready for
spring training in 2013. He hit .241 this season with 27 home
runs and 65 runs batted in over 92 games.  “Everything points to this being a three-to-four month
recovery and rehab to normal strength, likely a six-month total
return,” Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. “So that puts
him in line to be back in games for spring training, provided
all goes according to the protocol, which we fully expect.”  Bautista, who joined Toronto in 2008, led the majors with
 54 home runs  in 2010 and 43 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
