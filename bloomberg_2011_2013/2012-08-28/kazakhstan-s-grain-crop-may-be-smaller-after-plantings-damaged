Kazakhstan’s grain crop may be
smaller after 3.7 percent of plantings were damaged from
drought, Yevgeniy Aman, executive secretary of the  Agriculture
Ministry , said.  About 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres), out of 16.2
million hectares planted, will be “written off,” Aman said
today in the capital, Astana. Kazakhstan may gather about 13
million tons of grains this season, Aman said Aug. 15.  The country harvested 41 percent of the area planted with
grains, or 6.3 million hectares, since the harvest began last
month, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Average yields
were 740 kilograms (1,631 pounds) a hectare, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
