U.K. tax officials were urged to
gather more data on alcohol duty fraud after estimating they may
be losing as much as 1.2 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) a year.  Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee concluded in a
report published in  London  today that HM Revenue and Customs
wasn’t making the best use of intelligence and technology to cut
duty evasion and had had “very few” successful prosecutions.  “Since the criminal gangs who perpetrate major alcohol
duty fraud operate across national boundaries, the department
needs to strengthen its intelligence,” committee member Richard
Bacon, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said in an e-mailed
statement. “It should give more weight to the deterrent impact
of pursuing perpetrators through the courts.”  Among the knowledge gaps highlighted by the report, the tax
authority has no estimate of how much money is lost to duty
evasion on wine, according to the PAC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
