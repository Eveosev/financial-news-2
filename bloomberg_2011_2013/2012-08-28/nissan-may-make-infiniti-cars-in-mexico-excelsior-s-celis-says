Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  may start producing
Infiniti luxury cars in Mexico, business columnist Dario Celis
wrote  today  in Mexico City-based Excelsior newspaper, without
saying where he got the information.  Bill Krueger , Nissan’s vice chairman of the Americas, is
holding a press event in Mexico City tomorrow, according to an
invitation from the Yokohama, Japan-based automaker.  Automotive News reported  last week  that Johan de Nysschen,
head of the Infiniti brand, said Nissan is considering whether
to build a new car in Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
