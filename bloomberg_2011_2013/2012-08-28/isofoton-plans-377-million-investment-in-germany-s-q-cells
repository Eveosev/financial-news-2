Isofoton SA plans to team up with
Rocket Venture Fund to invest 300 million euros ($377 million)
in  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  as long as the creditors of the insolvent German
solar-cell manufacturer accept their offer.  One hundred million euros will be used to make high-
efficiency solar cells in Q-Cells’ plant in  Germany , Madrid-
based Isofoton said today in an e-mailed statement. Another 200
million euros will be used to boost production in  Malaysia .  Isofoton yesterday said it was approved to bid for Q-cells
after meeting with the company’s insolvency administrator
Henning Schorisch. That puts it in competition with Hanwha
Group, which is also seeking to take over Q-Cells, once the
biggest solar-cell maker. Isofoton Chief Executive Officer Angel Luis Serrano will present the offer to Q-Cells creditors
tomorrow, the company said.  “With this purchase, we’ll position ourselves closer to
our clients,” Serrano said in today’s statement. Q-Cells
bondholders will get “100 percent of the investment,” with an
initial payment of 30 million euros, according to the statement.
Isofoton and its collaborators will bring 40 million euros and a
1,500-megawatt project pipeline to Q-Cells, the company said.  Isofoton said if it succeeds, fewer than 10 percent of Q-
Cells’ 1,300 workers will lose their jobs. Rocket Venture Fund
is linked to the University of Toledo in  Ohio , where Isofoton
will open a plant in November, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
