Fourteen Nordic nuclear reactors run
by Vattenfall AB, EON AG,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj
are producing at a combined capacity of 70 percent, down 3
percentage points from yesterday, according to data from company
websites and calculations by Bloomberg.  Forsmark-1, Oskarshamn-1 and Ringhals-4 in Sweden and
Loviisa-1 in  Finland  are out of service for maintenance or
repairs. The remaining 10 are online.  EON AG will run tests at its 1,400-megawatt Oskarshamn-3
reactor starting today, with production falling as low as 200
megawatts, the company said in a filing via Nord Pool Spot AS on
Aug. 24. A test on the turbine on Aug. 30 will cut output
completely, with full production expected the next day, EON
said. The company also plans tests on Sept. 3, Sept. 6 and Sept.
21, it said.  Vattenfall AB has cut power output at its 865-megawatt
Ringhals-1 reactor in  Sweden  to 400 megawatts from yesterday to
Aug. 30 for maintenance on a turbine, the company said on Aug.
20 in a filing via the exchange.  The table below lists all units and their utilization rates
based on latest available data. It shows current output and
installed capacity in megawatts and utilization in percent.  
*Data for Loviisa reactors were not available on Fortumâ€™s
website. Figures are an estimate based on real-time production
from transmission system operator Fingrid Oyj.  To contact the reporter on this story:
