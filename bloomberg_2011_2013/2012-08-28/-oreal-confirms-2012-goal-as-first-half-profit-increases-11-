L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest
cosmetics maker, reported an 11 percent increase in first-half
profit as sales gained in Africa and  Asia , and said it still
expects revenue to grow faster than the market in 2012.  Operating income rose to 1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion),
the Paris-based company said today in a statement after the
stock market closed. The average of four analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was 1.92 billion euros.  The maker of Body Shop hemp hand-cream confirmed its target
of outperforming the global cosmetics market, which it has
estimated will grow about 4 percent this year. Like-for-like
sales should increase 5.6 percent in 2012, according to  Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.  “This performance reflects the group’s ability to build
solid and profitable growth,” L’Oreal Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said in today’s statement.  L’Oreal fell 0.2 percent to 101 euros at the close of
trading in Paris. The stock has gained 25 percent this year,
giving the company a market value of 61.3 billion euros.  Net income increased 10 percent to 1.66 billion euros.
Allowing for non-recurring items, net profit after controlling
interests reached 1.63 billion euros, up 11 percent.  The global cosmetics market is growing at an annual rate
exceeding 4 percent, L’Oreal’s director of financial
communications, Thierry Prevot, said on a call with reporters.  Wider Margin  The first-half operating margin widened to 16.9 percent of
sales from 16.2 percent at the end of 2011 as L’Oreal reduced
the amount it spent on advertising, promotions, selling,
administration and other activities relative to revenue.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales narrowed to 71
percent from 71.2 percent at the end of 2011. L’Oreal attributed
the decline to the weakening of the euro, the consolidation of
Clarisonic, a maker of sonic skincare devices that it agreed to
buy at the end of 2011, and an increase in promotional offers.  L’Oreal also said it will buy back as much as 500 million
euros of shares by the end of the year that it will then cancel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
