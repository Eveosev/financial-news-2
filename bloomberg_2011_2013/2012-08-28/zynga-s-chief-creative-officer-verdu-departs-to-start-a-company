Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  Chief Creative Officer
Mike Verdu is departing to found a new company, adding to the
list of top managers who have exited the social-game maker amid
a stock-price decline and  sales-growth  slowdown.  “Being at Zynga in the early days reminded me of how much
I love being an entrepreneur,” Verdu wrote in a  company blog .
“After a lot of soul-searching, I have decided to go back to my
roots and start a new company.”  Verdu is at least the fifth manager leaving the company
this month. Others include Ya-Bing Chu, a vice president, and
Jeremy Strauser, a general manager, two people said last week.
Through yesterday, shares of Zynga have  declined  69 percent
since the company’s December initial public offering, depressing
the value of equity used to compensate staff. The stock fell 2.3
percent to $3.01 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York .  Verdu, who joined Zynga more than three years ago from
 Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , previously co-founded game maker Legend
Entertainment.  Zynga plans to invest in Verdu’s next startup, which will
focus on mobile games, Dani Dudeck, a spokeswoman for San
Francisco-based Zynga, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
