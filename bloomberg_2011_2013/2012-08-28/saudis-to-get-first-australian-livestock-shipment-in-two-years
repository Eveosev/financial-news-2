Saudi Arabia  will tomorrow receive
the first shipment of livestock from  Australia , comprising
75,000 sheep and 6,000 cows, since imports dried up two years
ago, state-owned Saudi Press Agency said.  Australia used to send a million animals a year to Saudi
Arabia, making up 60 percent of its livestock imports. Importers
stopped buying shipments due to the appreciation of the
Australian dollar, Australiaâ€™s Ambassador Neil Hawkins told
Riyadh  newspaper  on July 31. Australia wants to recapture its
previous share of the Saudi market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
