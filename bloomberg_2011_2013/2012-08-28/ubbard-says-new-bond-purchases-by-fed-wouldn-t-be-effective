A third round of bond purchases by
the Federal Reserve would do little to spur U.S. economic
growth, according to  Glenn Hubbard , adviser to Republican
presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  “I don’t think QE3 would be very effective at all,”
Hubbard, dean of Columbia University’s business school, said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview, referring to a third
round of quantitative easing. “It would push the yield on 10-
year Treasury instruments down a little bit, but that’s not
what’s holding the American economy back,” he told  Trish Regan 
on “Street Smart.”  Fed officials said they’re prepared to provide new stimulus
“fairly soon” unless they’re convinced economy will grow at a
steady pace, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s July 31-Aug. 1 meeting. The policy makers are next
scheduled to meet Sept. 12-13.  Romney believes “we’re asking too much of the Fed” to
bolster the economy, Hubbard said. A return to the gold standard
isn’t “in the cards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
