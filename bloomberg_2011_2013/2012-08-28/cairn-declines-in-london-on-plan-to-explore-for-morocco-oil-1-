Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , a U.K. oil
explorer, fell in  London  trading after announcing plans to
search for crude in frontier acreage off the coast of  Morocco .  The company declined 4.3 percent, the most since May 4, to
283.7 pence. Cairn will buy 50 percent of the Foum Draa blocks
in Morocco, a third purchase this year after acquiring North Sea
explorers Agora Oil & Gas AS and Nautical Petroleum Plc.  Cairn is diversifying exploration after spending $1 billion
on a campaign in Greenland that failed to strike oil and gas. It
still owns about 18 percent of  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , which is down
13 percent since reaching a year-high on Feb. 21, after selling
a 40 percent stake and returning $3.5 billion to shareholders.  “The disappointment today was that the exploration
program, while active, doesn’t have much that can impact the
share price in the next three to six months,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec Securities Ltd. in London.
“There’s also the weakness of Cairn India, and the value of
that asset still underpins the share price.” Cairn expects to
have more than $500 million in cash at the end of the year.  “Cairn is actively re-balancing its portfolio to deliver
exploration-led growth,” Chief Executive Officer Simon Thomson
said. It’s trying to “offer investors exposure to capital
growth potential through future transformational exploration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
