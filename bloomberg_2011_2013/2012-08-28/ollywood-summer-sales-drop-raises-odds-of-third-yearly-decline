Hollywood studios will have to count
on holiday-season releases, including a new “ James Bond ,” to
head off a third year of shrinking U.S. box-office sales after
summer films failed to match the 2011 record.  Studios will end the summer with $4.27 billion in U.S. and
Canadian ticket sales, down 3 percent from the high of $4.4
billion set in 2011,  Hollywood.com  Box-Office said yesterday in
an e-mailed statement. They’re still up for the year.  Filmmakers had more misses this summer, as movies including
the Universal Pictures action adventure “Battleship” and Tom Cruise’s “Rock of Ages” from Warner Bros. held back results.
There were also fewer surprise hits. A year ago, sales were
bolstered by “The Help” and “Rise of the Planet of the
Apes.” The researcher counts revenue from the first weekend in
May to Sept. 3.  “It certainly puts additional pressure on the fall and
holiday periods to do well,”  Paul Dergarabedian , president of
Hollywood.com Box-Office, said in an interview. “It’s all
product-driven. You can’t have any misfires if you want to break
a record.”  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  will release the final film
in the “Twilight” teen-vampire series about Bella Swan and
Edward Cullen on Nov. 16.  Major releases in late 2012 also include “Skyfall,” the
new Bond film scheduled for Nov. 9 release by  Sony Corp. (SNE)  and
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. MGM is also a partner in the Dec. 14
picture “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” joining with  Time
Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros. to produce three films based on the
book by J.R.R. Tolkien.  Studio Rankings  Warner Bros., based in Burbank, California, leads the U.S.
box office with 2012 revenue of $1.2 billion as of Aug. 26,
according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher. The
studio’s top film is “The Dark Knight Rises.”  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s
 Universal Pictures  is second, at just less than $1.2 billion.  The top film of the summer was “Marvel’s The Avengers”
from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , which has collected almost $618 million in
domestic sales, according to Box Office Mojo.  Total 2012 domestic revenue stood at $7.43 billion as of
Aug. 26, up 3.8 percent from the same period a year earlier,
according to Hollywood.com. Attendance is up 2.6 percent. Full-
year 2011 sales were $10.2 billion, down 3.4 percent from 2010.
That year, revenue dropped less than 1 percent to $10.57 billion
from 2009’s $10.6 billion.  “Battleship,” made for an estimated $209 million, took in
$65.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and $303 million worldwide,
according to Box Office Mojo. “Rock of Ages,” with a $75
million production budget, had $38.5 million in domestic sales
and a global total of $50.1 million, according to Box Office
Mojo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
