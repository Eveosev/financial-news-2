Zuma owners Rainer Becker and Arjun
Waney are to open a rotisserie and grill as well as a bar on the
32nd floor of the Shard, while  Aqua Restaurant Group  will open
restaurants on the 31st and 33rd floors of the  London 
skyscraper.  Diners will use a dedicated entrance on St. Thomas Street
and two express lifts will take them directly to the restaurant
atrium on level 32. There will be a central triple-height atrium
bar. The venues are scheduled to open in March or April.  “We are delighted to have signed agreements,”  Irvine  Sellar, chairman of Sellar Property Group Ltd., said today in an
e-mailed release.  Becker and Waney, who co-founded Roka, are opening
restaurants internationally, as well as the new Banca in
Mayfair. Waney also owns La Petite Maison and Aurelia. Aqua owns
restaurants in  Hong Kong , Beijing and London.  The Shard is the tallest building in Western Europe and is
the centerpiece of an urban regeneration project, the London
Bridge Quarter. Designed by  Renzo Piano , the Shard was developed
by Sellar Property on behalf of LBQ Limited, a partnership
between majority owner the State of Qatar and Sellar.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
