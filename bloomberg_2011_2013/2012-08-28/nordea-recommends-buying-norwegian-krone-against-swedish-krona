Investors should buy the Norwegian
krone versus the Swedish counterpart on the view that Norges
Bank interest rates will be more supportive of the currency,
 Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ’s “Alpha Strategy” team said in a note.  “Looking into the likely trajectory of the policy rates we
judge that the differential will be supportive” for the
Norwegian krone versus Swedish krone, the bank said. “We think
Riksbank is very likely to resume the easing cycle, while there
are limited reasons for Norges Bank to do so.”  Nordea said it’s buying the krone at 1.1307 per krona and
targeting 1.18, according to the note.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
