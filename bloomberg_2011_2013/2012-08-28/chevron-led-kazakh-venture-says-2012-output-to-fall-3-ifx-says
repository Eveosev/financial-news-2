TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , cut oil output 3.8 percent in the
first half from a year earlier as it carried out maintenance.  Crude output fell to 12.5 million metric tons, or 100
million barrels, from 13 million tons, or 104 million barrels,
in the first half of last year, the venture said in a statement
published on its website.  TengizChevroil plans to produce 25 million tons of oil in
2012, a decline of about 3 percent from last year because of
capital repairs at the Caspian Sea project, the Interfax news
service said today, citing General Director  Tim Miller  in
Almaty,  Kazakhstan .  Tengiz is the Central Asian country’s biggest producing
field. The Kazakh venture plans to spend $5 billion to $6
billion drilling in the next five years to sustain output.
TengizChevroil will invest $1 billion of that amount on three to
four wells this year, Miller said on Feb. 14.  TengizChevroil produced 25.8 million metric tons of crude
last year, or almost 565,000 barrels a day, a decline of about
0.4 percent from 2010, according to the Kazakh venture’s
website.  Chevron, based in  San Ramon , California, holds 50 percent
of the TengizChevroil venture, while Exxon Mobil Corp. owns 25
percent, state-controlled KazMunaiGaz National Corp. has 20
percent, and OAO Lukoil has 5 percent.  The venture exports oil via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium
to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea , and via
the Batumi and Kulevi ports in Georgia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
