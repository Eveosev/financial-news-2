Indonesia’s rupiah led a decline
among Asian currencies on further evidence Europe’s debt crisis
is hurting demand for regional exports, threatening a deeper
slowdown from Japan to China and Thailand.  Japan downgraded its assessment on the economy for the
first time in 10 months today as overseas shipments slowed,
while China’s Vice Commerce Minister  Wang Chao  said at a forum
in Beijing that the global economic situation is “severe” and
“complicated.” Thai data tomorrow may show exports contracted
for a second month in July, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Europe’s debt crisis is lingering and hurting Asian
assets through actual damage on exports and risk sentiment,”
said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for
 Economic Research  in Tokyo. “Emerging currencies and risk
assets are likely to see some downward pressure.”  The rupiah fell 0.4 percent to 9,552 per dollar as of 3
p.m. in Jakarta, according to local bank prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit dropped 0.3 percent to 3.1185 and
the  Thai baht  fell 0.2 percent to 31.33, the most in two weeks.
South Korea’s won closed 0.1 percent weaker at 1,136.75 and
earlier touched 1,138.08, the lowest level this month.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (MXAP) , which tracks the
region’s currencies, declined for a third day. The index’s 60-
day historical volatility dropped to 3.47 percent from 3.61
percent yesterday. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks lost
0.4 percent.  Ifo, Bernanke  Data yesterday showed business confidence in Germany,
Europe’s biggest economy, fell for a fourth straight month in
August, the Ifo institute reported.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is due to deliver
a speech at an Aug. 31 forum for central bankers in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming, after he said last week there was room to ease
financial conditions.  “Nobody really wants to take on excessive risk positions
ahead of Jackson Hole,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The German Ifo’s fall
shows that the decay is spreading to the core.”  Thailand’s baht extended its retreat from a three-month
high as economists predict data will show exports decreased 3.8
percent in July from a year earlier, after a 4.2 percent slide
in June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  China’s Yuan  China’s  yuan  climbed 0.03 percent to 6.3551 per dollar in
Shanghai, snapping a three-day drop. The People’s Bank of China
weakened its  reference rate  for a second straight day, by 0.03
percent to 6.3411. Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell in
July by the most this year, the government reported yesterday.  The Philippine peso dropped 0.3 percent to 42.307 per
dollar after a report today showed the nation’s trade deficit
widened to $787 million in June from $454 million in May. A
report on Aug. 30 may show economic growth slowed to 5.5 percent
last quarter, compared with a 6.4 percent pace in the preceding
three months, a Bloomberg survey shows.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s currency fell 0.1 percent to NT$30.007,
reversing a 0.1 percent gain. India’s rupee slipped 0.1 percent
to 55.765 per dollar and  Vietnam ’s dong fell to 20,875 from
20,865 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
