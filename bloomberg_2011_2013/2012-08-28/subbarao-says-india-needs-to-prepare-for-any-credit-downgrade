Reserve Bank  of India Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said India needs to prepare for a downgrade in
its credit rating.  “It is still possible that we’ll maintain this rating,”
Subbarao said today in a speech at  Cornell University  in Ithaca,
New York. “However, we need to prepare for” any downgrade and
an outflow of investment.  “We have managed outflow in the past and we can manage,”
he said. “Should our rating be downgraded, I think we’re quite
prepared.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
