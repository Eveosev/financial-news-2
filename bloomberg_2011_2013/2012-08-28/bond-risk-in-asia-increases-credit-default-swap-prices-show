The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in Asia rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced one basis point to 150 basis
points as of 8:32 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. prices show. The gauge, which was down 10.5 this
month yesterday, is poised for its highest close since Aug. 3,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 198 basis
points as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The measure has increased from 185 on July 31, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was also unchanged at 158
basis points as of 10:07 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB)  prices show. The benchmark has traded between 148 and 168
basis points this month, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
