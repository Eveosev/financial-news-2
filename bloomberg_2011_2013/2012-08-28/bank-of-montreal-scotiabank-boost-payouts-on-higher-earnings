Bank of Montreal (BMO)  and  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS)  increased their dividends after posting third-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates on higher consumer lending.  Bank of Montreal , Canada’s fourth-biggest bank, raised its
dividend for the first time in five years after profit rose 37
percent to C$970 million ($981 million), or C$1.42 a share, in
the quarter ending July 31. Scotiabank had record profit of
C$2.05 billion, or C$1.69 a share, on a gain from selling its
Toronto headquarters.  “The  capital ratios  have improved to a degree that the
boards feel comfortable” raising dividends, said  Bob Decker  of
Aurion Capital, which manages about C$6 billion, including Bank
of Montreal and Scotiabank shares. “It’s not like this is about
the business prospects suddenly getting better for these
companies.”  Bank of Montreal, the last Canadian lender to boost its
payout since the financial crisis, raised its  dividend  2.9
percent to 72 cents a share. The bank also lowered its payout
range to between 40 percent and 50 percent of earnings from 45
percent to 55 percent. Scotiabank, Canada’s third-largest
lender, raised its payout 3.6 percent to 57 cents a share.  Bank of Montreal  rose  0.4 percent to C$57.93 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto. Scotiabank fell 0.1 percent to C$52.89.  ‘Dead Money’  The two banks raised their dividends six days after Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said he wanted corporations to
invest “dead money” from record cash reserves or pay it in
dividends to shareholders.  Bank of Montreal Chief Executive Officer Bill Downe said in
a conference call that the dividend increase reflects “our
strong capital position, the success of our business strategies
and our confidence in our continued ability to generate
sustained earnings growth.”  The lowered payout range is “consistent” with the
lender’s objective of maintaining flexibility to pursue growth
opportunities while acknowledging higher  capital requirements 
set by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , Downe said.  Bank of Montreal said it had profit excluding items of
C$1.49 a share, beating the C$1.38-a-share average  estimate  of
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Wisconsin Takeover  Profit was boosted by the July 2011 takeover of Marshall &
Ilsley Corp., the Wisconsin lender Bank of Montreal bought for
C$4.1 billion in the largest acquisition in its 195-year
history. The lender is integrating M&I into its Chicago-based
BMO Harris Bank  consumer-lending  unit.  Bank of Montreal set aside C$237 million for bad loans, up
3 percent from a year earlier.  Canadian consumer-banking profit rose 2.3 percent to C$453
million and profit from BMO Harris Bank rose 43 percent to C$129
million after adding M&I contributions.  The BMO Capital Markets investment-banking unit had profit
of C$232 million, 14 percent lower than a year earlier as
underwriting and advisory fees fell 13 percent to C$123 million.
Trading revenue rose 38 percent to C$213 million, led by
interest-rate contracts and commodities.  The private-client group, which includes insurance and
mutual funds, had profit of C$109 million, up 4.8 percent from a
year ago.  Scotiabank Gain  Scotiabank recorded an after-tax gain of C$614 million for
the sale of its Scotia Plaza office building in Toronto.
Excluding one-time items such as the real estate sale,
Scotiabank said it earned C$1.22 a share. That compares with the
C$1.19-a-share average  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  Domestic banking earnings rose 22 percent to C$521 million
because of asset and deposit growth. International profit surged
29 percent to C$442 million. Scotiabank has operations in 50
countries and this month announced  acquisitions  in Colombia and
Mexico.  “There’s no question” that growth will be higher in those
regions than in North America,  Tom Lewandowski , an analyst at
Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis , said in an interview before
results. “I think it’s one of the competitive advantages of
Bank of  Nova Scotia .”  Wealth Management  Wealth-management  profit climbed 9.2 percent to C$284
million and investment-banking net income gained 31 percent to
C$398 million. Scotiabank set aside C$402 million for soured
loans, compared with C$250 million a year earlier.  Scotiabank’s quarterly profit was the second-highest for a
Canadian bank, trailing  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s C$2.31 billion
in the first quarter of 2006. Scotiabank said today it expects
to meet its 2012 financial goals, including earnings per share
growth of between 5 percent and 10 percent.  Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s largest lender;
Toronto-Dominion, the No. 2 lender; Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, the fifth-biggest; and  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the
sixth-largest, report Aug. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
