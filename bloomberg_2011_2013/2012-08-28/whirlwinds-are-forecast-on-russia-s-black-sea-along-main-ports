Russia ’s Black Sea coast is forecast
to be at risk of whirlwinds on a route that passes along the
Novorossiysk and Tuapse ports later today and tomorrow, the
 Federal Hydrometeorological Center  said.  The whirlwind threats are seen along the route from Anapa
town to Shepsi village, both on the Black Sea shore in Krasnodar
region, the center said without providing details of potential
risks to the ports which operate Russia’s main southern grain
and crude handling terminals.  Rainstorms are forecast in Krasnodar region, and winds up

deputy head of agricultural forecasts at the center, said by
