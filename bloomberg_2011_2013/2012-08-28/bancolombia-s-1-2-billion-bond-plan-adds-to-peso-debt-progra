Bancolombia SA, the nation’s largest
bank, said its board approved a plan to sell as much as $1.2
billion of subordinated debt abroad in addition to a peso bond
program announced in May.  The dollar bond program is “independent” from a plan to
sell 3 trillion pesos ($1.6 billion) of debt denominated in the
local currency, the company said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement.  “These are approvals to be prepared in case the company
decides to issue debt down the road, but they are independent,”
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
