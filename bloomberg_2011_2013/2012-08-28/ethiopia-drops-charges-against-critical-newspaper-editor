Ethiopia’s Justice Ministry said it
won’t prosecute the editor of the weekly newspaper  Feteh , whose
distribution was blocked after it reported on the illness of
late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi before his death this month.  “After further investigation the prosecutors have decided
to drop the charges,” Desalegn Teressa, a ministry spokesman,
said in a phone interview today from the capital, Addis Ababa.  Ethiopia has been criticized by the  United Nations  and
advocacy groups including the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists over legislation that restricts freedom of
expression.  Feteh’s editor, Temesgen Desalegn, had been facing four
charges including attacking the state by defamation and inciting
young people to overthrow the government, based on articles
published between July 2011 and March,  Amnesty International 
said on August 24. He has been released from the prison where he
was held after his first appearance at court last week, said
Hailemeskel Beshewamyelhu, an editor at the newspaper.  Feteh, which distributed around 30,000 copies in Amharic
and was frequently critical of the government, has not been
printed by the state-owned Berhanena Selam Printing Enterprise
since the ministry ordered the impoundment of its July 20
edition. Last week the management said it is still not prepared
to publish the newspaper, Hailemeskel said.  A 2008 media law allows distribution of a newspaper to be
blocked if it presents “a clear and present grave danger to the
national security.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
