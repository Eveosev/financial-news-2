Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc’s (RDSA)  jet-fuel price increases in Argentina are being
challenged by the government at the Supreme Court, newspaper BAE
reported, citing an unnamed official at the country’s antitrust
agency.  The government is appealing a lower-court ruling granted to
the local units of the two companies last week, which allowed
them to raise prices, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
