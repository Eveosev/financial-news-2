Banco Popolare SC, (UBI)   Italy ’s fourth-
biggest bank by assets, said second-quarter profit rose 6.6
percent after a tax benefit offset lower operating income.  Net income  increased to 138.1 million euros ($173 million)
from 129.5 million euros a year earlier, beating the 81.3
million-euro  average estimate  of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Results benefitted from a 67 million-euro gain from
tax relief, the Verona, Italy-based bank said a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Pier Francesco Saviotti is selling
real-estate assets and cutting more than 1,000 jobs to boost
capital and profit as part of its five-year business plan
approved last year.  The lender’s core tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial
health, rose to 10.2 percent as of June 30 from 7.1 percent at
the end of December.  Operating profit declined 25 percent to 309.7 million euros
