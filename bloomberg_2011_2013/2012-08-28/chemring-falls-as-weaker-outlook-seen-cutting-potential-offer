Chemring Plc (CHG) , which received a
preliminary approach from  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , dropped in London
trading as investors saw a cut to this year’s profit target
reducing any offer for the maker of missile-avoidance systems.  The company fell as much as 13 percent to 322.3 pence, its
lowest level since announcing Carlyle’s interest on Aug. 17.
Problems with a cost-management system and delays to the debut
of an explosives clearing device will lower earnings by 15
million pounds ($24 million), Chemring said in a statement.  “Carlyle would have been unaware of the problems in their
initial approach,” Credit Suisse analyst Oliver Sleath said in
a note. “We think this would be more likely to result in a
lower price for the bid, than affecting the probability of the
takeover going ahead.”  Chemring’s order book shrank 9 percent at the end of July
from a year earlier because of the slow approval processes for
export licenses in many European countries and the early timing
of Ramadan and its impact on Middle East bookings. Overall,
quarterly sales advanced 4 percent.  The Fareham, England-based company traded at 325.3 pence as
of 9:09 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
