The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities climbed 0.2 percent to 668.23 at 7:23 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.4 percent to 1,588.1543.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for the first time in four days in New York as
U.S. crude inventories were forecast to drop, a storm headed for
the  Gulf of Mexico  and a fire continued to burn at  Venezuela ’s
biggest refinery.  Oil for October delivery advanced as much as 87 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $96.34 a barrel and was at $96.10 in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:27 a.m. London
time. The contract fell 68 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $95.47
yesterday, the lowest close since Aug. 15. Prices are 2.8
percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas fell for a fourth day on speculation that
production cuts in the Gulf of Mexico because of Tropical Storm
Isaac will do little to ease a supply glut.  Gas dropped as much as 1 percent in  New York  today. The
National Hurricane Center said Isaac, in the southeastern Gulf,
will become a hurricane before reaching U.S. Gulf Coast on Aug.
29. About 48 percent of offshore output was shut yesterday, the
government said. The Gulf accounted for 7 percent of U.S. gas
production in 2011, down from 17 percent in 2005.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of  Japan  naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell $20.33, or 16 percent, to $110.39 a metric ton at
6:33 p.m. Singapore time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of the profit from
making the gasoline and petrochemical feedstock, narrowed for
the first time in four days.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 10 cents
to $21.03 a barrel at 6:11 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference,
also known as the crack spread, yesterday was the widest since
November.  BASE METALS  Copper neared a one-week low in New York on signs Asian
economies are slowing and speculation that U.S. policy makers
will refrain from a fresh round of stimulus.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold was seen gaining for the first time in three days in
 London  on speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis and further central
bank stimulus will boost demand for a protection of wealth.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose 0.1 percent to $1,664.95 an
ounce by 10:20 a.m. in London. Prices reached $1,676.90
yesterday, the highest since April 13. December-delivery
futures were 0.5 percent lower at $1,667.20 on the Comex in New
York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to $7.985 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as of 10:46 a.m. in London.
The price, which touched a record $8.49 on Aug. 10, has slipped
4.8 percent in the past five sessions.  Soybeans for November delivery were little changed at
$17.18 a bushel, after rallying to a record $17.605 a bushel
yesterday. Thirty percent of the U.S. soybeans were in good-to-
excellent condition as of Aug. 26, down from 31 percent a week
earlier and the worst since 1988, the USDA said.  Wheat for delivery in December was little changed at
$8.8175 a bushel in Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling
wheat dropped 0.1 percent to 260 euros ($326) a metric ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Rubber declined, set for a sixth straight monthly loss,
after Japan’s government downgraded its assessment of the
world’s third-biggest economy, hurting demand for the raw
material used in tires.  January-delivery rubber fell 1.6 percent to settle at 225
yen a kilogram ($2,865 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange. Futures have dropped 2.1 percent this month, extending
this year’s loss to 15 percent. The February-delivery contract,
listed today, ended at 226.1 yen after opening at 230 yen.  Palm oil  dropped on concern that a rally to the highest
level in six weeks may crimp demand and as speculation
intensified that there may not be further stimulus from the
U.S., hurting commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
