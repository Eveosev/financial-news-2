Two U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission members faulted chairman  Mary Schapiro ’s handling of
discussions over rules governing money-market funds, saying she
misrepresented other commissioners’ dissents after proposing
regulations that could “severely compromise” the industry.  “The changes the Chairman advocated were not supported by
the requisite data and analysis, were unlikely to be effective
in achieving their primary purpose, and would impose significant
costs on issuers and investors while potentially introducing new
risks into the nation’s financial system,” Republican
commissioners Daniel Gallagher and Troy Paredes said today in a
statement.  The  statement  is the latest in a string of public barbs
among the SEC’s presidentially appointed commissioners following
Schapiro’s decision last week to scrap a vote on a proposal for
tighter money-market fund rules. In canceling the vote, Schapiro
said “the issue is too important to investors, to our economy
and to taxpayers to put our head in the sand and wish it away.”  Gallagher and Paredes, who had offered a counterproposal
that would allow firms running money funds to stop investor
flight in the event of a run, said they were “dismayed” by
Schapiro’s statement. They also commended  Luis Aguilar , a
Democratic commissioner, who called for further study before
proposing rules that could cause investors to move money from
money-market funds to other unregulated investment vehicles.  “The Chairman’s statement creates the misimpression that
three Commissioners -- a majority of the Commission -- are not
concerned with, or are somehow dismissive of, the goal of
strengthening money-market funds,” Gallagher and Paredes said.
