A year after  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) 
was humiliated by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  forcing it to remove a tablet on
display at the Berlin IFA fair, the world’s biggest consumer-
electronics companies are racing to avoid similar gaffes.  Makers of mobile phones, computers and television sets have
registered a record number of rights with German authorities
this year to weed out imitations, said Claudia Rossow-Scholl, a
customs officer who has worked at the annual gathering since
2005. Exhibitors have also taken licenses for more inventions
than ever from peers as they seek to avoid their devices being
drawn into scrutiny, she said.  Samsung,  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Acer Inc. (2353)  are among companies
preparing to show their wares at  Europe ’s largest consumer-
electronics fair, which generated 3.7 billion euros ($4.6
billion) in orders last year. The event kicks off as makers are
still digesting Apple’s $1 billion patent victory against
Samsung, a verdict that may lead to a U.S. sales ban of some of
the South Korean company’s phones.  “There are rights holders who approach us ahead of the
show and say, have a look at this or that rival product,”
Rossow-Scholl said in an interview after weeks of reviewing
gadgets that are delivered to Berlin to be displayed, declining
to name specific manufacturers. “Companies have become a lot
more watchful.”  Tablet Removed  Germany  is a hotspot for technology-patent litigation.
While companies including  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Motorola Mobility unit,
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , Apple and Samsung have sued each other around
the globe, one of the focus jurisdictions is Germany because its
courts allow for swift action and cover an important market for
mobile devices.  Following a decision by a Dusseldorf court last August in
favor of Apple to temporarily ban the sale of Samsung’s Galaxy
10.1 tablet in Germany, Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung
redesigned the device by relocating the speaker and changing the
shape. The smaller 7.7 model was removed a few weeks later
during IFA after Apple won an injunction.  Device makers are under pressure to woo customers with
machines that appeal to the masses while also having to dedicate
large development teams to differentiating their designs. Profit
margins are being squeezed as the economic slowdown hurts
demand, be it in the fast-growing $219 billion smartphone
market, or the laptop and television markets.  Fairground Investigators  Samsung, the losing party in the Aug. 24 U.S. verdict, is
set to unveil new products at IFA as it searches for a response
to the ruling against its phones and tablets running the Android
operating system. The company plans to show devices with
Microsoft’s new Windows 8 software, according to a person
familiar with the plan. Samsung will also display the next
version of its Galaxy Note tablet, which sold more than 10
million units in less than a year, the person said, asking not
to be identified because the plans are confidential.  Samsung  shares  gained 2.9 percent to 1,230,000 won at the
close of trading in  Seoul , compared with a 0.6 percent rise in
the benchmark Kospi index. That’s still 3.5 percent lower than
the stock’s 1,275,000  price  before the Aug. 24 verdict.  Franziska Heuer, a spokeswoman for Samsung in Germany,
declined to comment on the company’s legal strategy for IFA.
Sally Osman, a spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Sony, declined to
comment on any implications from the Apple ruling. A
representative in Germany for Taipei-based Acer also declined to
comment.  LG, Toshiba  Very-high-definition TVs from  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  and
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  will also be among products on display at the
event, which attracted 240,000 visitors last year, according to
the the event’s  organizers . This year’s IFA starts Aug. 31.  About one out of 20 devices that pass through customs are
set aside by officers for closer inspection by the company that
claims the patent violation, according to customs officials.
Such inspections can take about a week and some machines miss
the exhibition because of the delay, Rossow-Scholl said.  If customs officials are convinced that infringement is
involved, they will destroy the gadgets. The tools used to
render them unusable range from hammers to forklifts.  To scout for any hardware that may be infringing a patent
and hasn’t been caught by customs, companies send intellectual-
property lawyers, such as Magnus Hirsch from  SKW Schwarz
Rechtsanwaelte  in  Frankfurt , around the fair booths. It’s
possible to win and enforce an injunction within a day, he said.  Court Injunction  “With the help of the police or the customs, you get the
products taken right off the booth,” Hirsch said. “Sometimes
you can even get the complete booth closed down, but you’ll
achieve that only in extreme cases of infringements.”  Police and customs can step in because illegal copying can
be a crime under German law or a violation of import rules. The
officers will only act in obvious cases where a product is close
to identical with the protected original, Hirsch said. If the
infringement is more sophisticated lawyers need to get an
injunction from a court, he said.  Not clarifying the rights to use a certain technology, be
it a software function or a design element, is a gamble. In
making ad-hoc decisions on whether a product may be infringing a
patent, authorities rely on information from the company that’s
claiming the violation, Rossow-Scholl said.  Mediation Desk  To keep patent disputes from breaking into the open during
the fair, the organizers have set up a mediation desk to help
settle conflicts ahead of time. The desk, which was introduced
in 2009 to mainly assist Chinese companies, is adding mediators
this year because of increasing demand from non-Chinese
 exhibitors , said Nicole von der Ropp, an IFA spokeswoman. She
declined to name companies using the service.  The organizers’ and German authorities’ diligence has
helped make IFA a more heated patent battleground than many
other large exhibitions. The GSMA, which organizes the annual
 Mobile World Congress  in Barcelona, said it’s not offering any
services to mediate patent conflicts and products there would
only be removed from stands by court order.  IFA officials’ alertness has also made exhibitors more
obedient of patent rules. In 2008, more than 220 officials
hauled off five truckloads worth of illicit electronics from
IFA, according to Norbert Scheithauer from the Berlin-
Brandenburg customs investigation. This year, he said he expects
fewer than 30 items to be removed from the fair as companies
seek to avoid reputational damage.  Standby Judges  The Berlin Regional Court has also set up a special work
schedule making sure judges are always available during IFA to
handle bids for injunctions, court spokesman Ulrich Wimmer said.
Several extra court officers will be on duty to help execute
orders on the fair’s premises if needed, he said.  “If there’s a big clash during the event, it’s not
beneficial for any parties involved or for Germany as a
technology location,” said Maurice Shahd, a spokesman for the
 Bitkom  industry association, which represents technology
companies including device manufacturers. “That’s why it’s
important that infringements are dealt with in a proactive
way.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
