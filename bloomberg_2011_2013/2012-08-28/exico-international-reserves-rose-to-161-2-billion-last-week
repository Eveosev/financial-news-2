Mexico ’s international reserves rose
to 161.2 billion in the week ended Aug. 24, the central bank
reported today on its website.  Reserves registered a net increase of $1.4 billion, the
bank said, after falling $262 million the previous week.  Mexico’s reserves have climbed 13 percent this year, giving
central bank Governor Agustin Carstens greater leeway to
intervene in the foreign exchange market to buoy the peso. The
currency on June 1 touched the weakest level against the dollar
since March 2009 on concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis would
damp global economic growth.  Mexico uses dollar auctions to limit daily declines in the
peso after it tumbled 11 percent against the dollar in 2011, the
most among major Latin American currencies. Since November, the
central bank has been offering $400 million daily at an  exchange
rate  that’s at least 2 percent weaker than the previous day.  This year, the peso has strengthened 5.7 percent against
the dollar, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
