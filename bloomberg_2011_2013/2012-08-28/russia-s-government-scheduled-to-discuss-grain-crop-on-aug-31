Russian Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  is scheduled to lead a meeting with some government
members and agriculture industry experts and participants to
discuss harvesting data and grain exports on Aug. 31, according
to his press service.  The meeting is to follow up on a similar gathering on Aug.
8, after which Dvorkovich said the grain market had no need for
immediate interventions such as grain sales from state
stockpiles or export curbs in the 2012 calendar year.  Since then, Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov cut his
estimate of the national crop to the lower figure of a range
forecast by the ministry earlier this month. The country has
been gripped by a drought.  Russia , the world’s third-biggest wheat exporter last
season, may harvest 20 percent less grain this year as its crop
is now estimated at 75 million metric tons, Fedorov said Aug.
23. The previous estimate was 75 million to 80 million tons.  Fedorov said the harvest will be sufficient to meet
domestic needs “100 percent,” speaking at an agricultural
exhibition in  St. Petersburg  yesterday.  Russia which shipped 21.6 million tons of wheat in the last
season, may rank fifth among exporters after the U.S.,
Australia,  Canada  and the European Union and ship 8 million tons
in 2012-13, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimated.  Russia’s export potential is seen at 10 million to 12
million tons, Dvorkovich said Aug. 8. The country exported more
than 4 million tons of grains by Aug. 22, down from 4.9 million
tons a year earlier, according to data released on the
 Agriculture Ministry ’s website yesterday.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $8.74 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 11:36 a.m. Moscow time.
Prices are up 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
