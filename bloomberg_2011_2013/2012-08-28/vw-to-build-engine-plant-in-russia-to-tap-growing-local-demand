Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
carmaker, is investing 550 million euros ($691 million) in auto-
parts manufacturing in  Russia  and  China  to prepare for further
growth in the countries’ vehicle markets.  VW is spending 250 million euros at its auto plant in
Kaluga, Russia, for an assembly line that will build 600 engines
a day by 2015, Michael Macht, VW’s production chief, told
reporters in Moscow today. Separately, VW plans a 300 million-
euro transmission plant in Tianjin, China, a person familiar
with the matter said.  Volkswagen, which has a strategy to overtake  General Motors
Co. (GM)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to become the world’s largest
carmaker by 2018, is shifting focus away from western Europe,
where industrywide auto sales are forecast to shrink this year.
China is the company’s biggest national market globally, and
Russia may overtake  Germany  in industry sales by 2014.  “Russia is the primary strategic growth market in Europe
for the Volkswagen group” and by 2018, “we intend to sell a
half a million vehicles here annually,” Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Winterkorn  said at the press conference in advance of the
Moscow International Motor Show opening tomorrow.  VW, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, plans to spend 1
billion euros expanding capacity in Russia until 2018, Macht
said. Currently VW can produce 225,000 vehicles in the country.  Kaluga’s Capacity  The plant in Kaluga, about 170 kilometers (106 miles)
southwest of Moscow, opened in 2007, and last year it assembled
125,000 vehicles, including the Tiguan sport-utility vehicle,
Polo subcompact and the Skoda Octavia and Fabia cars. The
Russian auto market is forecast to rise 28 percent to 3.4
million vehicles in 2014, according to the country’s industry
ministry.  VW signed a deal in 2011 with billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s
OAO GAZ to produce 110,000 VW and Skoda vehicles a year at the
Russian manufacturer’s facility in  Nizhny Novgorod , 418
kilometers east from Moscow. Production of the Skoda Yeti SUV
will be the first vehicle from the partnership, with production
slated to start this year.  The Chinese transmission plant is scheduled to start
production in 2014 and create 1,500 jobs, the person familiar
with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the
German carmaker hasn’t yet made an official announcement.  Volkswagen produces more than 20 models in China for its
VW, Skoda and Audi brands. The company plans to invest 14
billion euros on Chinese production and models by 2016. VW sold
2.6 million vehicles in the Asia-Pacific region last year.  VW already runs 11 auto factories in China, with four
plants currently being set up. German newspaper  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported earlier  today  the China transmission
plant investment. A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment on
the carmaker’s plans in the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
