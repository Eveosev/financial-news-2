Palm oil  dropped on concern that a
rally to the highest level in six weeks may crimp demand, and as
speculation intensified that there may not be further stimulus
from the U.S., hurting commodities.  The November-delivery contract fell as much as 1.2 percent
to end the morning session at 3,055 ringgit ($978) a metric ton
on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange. Futures gained to 3,091
ringgit yesterday, the highest settlement for the most-active
contract since July 16, as the worst U.S. drought in a
generation drove soybeans to a record.  “On the macro-economic front, it’s about the stimulus
package,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte,
said by phone from Singapore. Investors had “probably priced in
the worst-case scenario” for the U.S. soybean crop, he said.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  probably won’t use
an Aug. 31 speech at the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, to suggest a third round of bond buying is imminent,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and High Frequency Economics.
Members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  have been divided
about whether to spur expansion.  Exports from Malaysia, the second-largest producer, rose
6.6 percent to 1.05 million tons in the first 25 days of August
compared with 986,829 tons in the same period the previous month,
surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance said yesterday.  November-delivery soybeans rose as much as 0.7 percent to
$17.31 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at
$17.2375. Soybeans surged to a record $17.605 yesterday. Soybean
oil for December delivery was little changed at 56.6 cents a
pound. Palm oil and soybean oil are used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for January delivery lost 0.9 percent to 8,206
 yuan  ($1,290) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month retreated 1.2 percent to
10,012 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
