BYD Co. (1211)  and  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (2238)  declined in  Hong Kong  trading after the two Chinese carmakers reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  BYD fell 2.4 percent to HK$13.04 at 9:47 a.m. in Hong Kong, heading for its lowest close in a month. Guangzhou Automobile declined 1.9 percent, heading for a three-week low.  BYD, the Chinese carmaker partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) , yesterday reported first-half profit plunged 94 percent, dragged down by its solar-cell and handset units. Guangzhou Auto, which makes cars with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , had its investment rating cut to neutral at CIMB Securities after the company delivered semiannual profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  BYD, whose first-half net income was 80 percent  below  the average of two analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg, forecast profit for the first nine months will fall as much as 95 percent to 17.6 million  yuan .  Guangzhou Auto’s operations with Honda and Toyota are expected to remain under pressure in the second half of this year, due to weak demand for its models, and high marketing expenses resulting from weak retail pricing, according to a UBS AG report today.
