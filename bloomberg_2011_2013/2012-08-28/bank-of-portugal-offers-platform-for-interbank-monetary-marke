Portugal ’s central bank said it will
provide a platform for resident financial institutions to trade
funds in euros among themselves as it tries to encourage the
domestic interbank monetary market.  Starting on Sept. 3, institutions can exchange funds for as
long as one year without the requirement for a guarantee, the
Bank of Portugal said in a  document  on its website dated Aug.
23.  “The interbank monetary market plays a fundamental role in
the mechanism of transmitting monetary policy decisions to the
real economy, and central banks assume the commitment of
contributing to the efficient functioning of that market,” the
Bank of Portugal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
