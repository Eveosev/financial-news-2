The Washington Redskins signed Pro
Bowl kicker  Billy Cundiff  two days after he was cut by the
Baltimore Ravens.  Cundiff, who made the Pro Bowl in 2010, missed a 32-yard
field goal for Baltimore with 11 seconds remaining in last
seasonâ€™s American Football Conference championship game against
the New England Patriots. The Patriots won 23-20 to reach the
Super Bowl.  Cundiff, 32, replaces Graham Gano, the National Football
League team said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
