Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened as
Venezuelan firefighters worked to contain the latest in a series
of fires at the South American countryâ€™s largest oil refinery.  Flames and smoke emerged from the Amuay plant at 10:05 a.m.
local time, about 30 minutes after Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez 
told state television that the fires had been extinguished.
Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, the state oil company known as PDVSA,
has put out two fires that began on Aug. 25 after a gas
explosion killed 48 people.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast fell 18 cents to 14 cents versus October futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:57 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery dropped
22.44 cents to $3.0456 a gallon.  Venezuelan product imports from the U.S. nearly doubled in
the first five months of 2012 to 38,000 barrels a day from
23,000 in the year-earlier period, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.  Amuay, which has the capacity to process 645,000 barrels a
day, forms part of the Paraguana complex 240 miles west of
Caracas. Damage was limited to the  storage tanks  and Venezuela
has had enough gasoline inventories to meet all commitments,
Ramirez said.  Venezuela has stockpiles of 4 million barrels of gasoline
and other petroleum products and continues to produce 735,000
barrels of the motor fuel a day at plants, including nearby
Cardon, according to Ramirez.  The differential for conventional gasoline to be blended
with ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor strengthened from
parity to 4 cents over futures. It is the highest level since
Aug. 7.  Europe inventories of the motor fuel are below the 5-year
average for this time of year. Gasoline stockpiles in
independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp, held at
718,000 metric tons, according to PJK International BV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
