The leu strengthened, posting its
longest winning streak in more than four months, as Romanian
President Traian Basescu returned to office after a 52-day
suspension.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 4.4527 per euro by
5:22 p.m. in Bucharest, the highest since July 4. The leu’s
four-day stretch of gains is the longest since April 9.  Basescu formally resumed his duties today after a
Constitutional Court ruling on Aug. 21 to invalidate an
impeachment referendum was published in the Official Journal
yesterday.  “The political scene has turned quiet over the past days
as the suspension of the president ended,” Vlad Muscalu, a
senior economist at ING Groep NV in Bucharest, wrote in a report
to clients today. “Thin volumes, most likely correlated with
the extended weekend in  London , helped the leu firm.”  U.K. markets reopened today after a public holiday
yesterday.  Romania , which has sold less debt than planned on the
domestic market since June, plans to sell bonds in euros in the
next two months, Deputy Finance Minister Enache Jiru told
Bloomberg on Aug. 23.  Yields on its euro-bonds due 2018 fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.054 percent. A close at this
level would be the lowest since the bonds started trading in
July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
