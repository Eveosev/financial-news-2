New Zealand’s central bank will keep
the  official cash rate  at a record-low 2.5 percent next year
even if food and fuel prices surge, the New Zealand Institute of
 Economic Research  said.  “The economy is slow, there is little inflation and global
risks are high,”  Shamubeel Eaqub , principal economist at the
Wellington-based organization, said in a report today. “The
 Reserve Bank  will look through a current spike in global food
and fuel prices as they are transitory.  Interest rates  will be
on hold until 2014.”  Commodity prices are rising amid a U.S. drought that has
curbed production, and the consequences might be higher prices
for dairy, meat and grocery products in New Zealand stores early
next year, Eaqub said. The central bank is allowed to ignore the
short-term boost to inflation and hold rates until broader price
pressures emerge, he said.  New Zealand’s economy will grow 1.7 percent this year and
2.7 percent in 2013 as reconstruction of earthquake-damaged
Christchurch and the surrounding province of Canterbury
accelerates, NZIER predicted. The outlook for next year is
little changed from a 2.5 percent forecast in May.  “Domestic growth is steady but unspectacular,” Eaqub
said. Households and the government are spending cautiously and
paying off debt, which is making for a “tough time” for
builders and retailers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
