Strabag SE (STR)  fell to the lowest level
in almost two years after Chief Executive Officer Hans-Peter Haselsteiner said that central  Europe ’s biggest construction
company may delist in 2014.  Shares  declined  1.7 percent to 17.2 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna, the lowest close since September
2010 and the biggest retreat since Aug. 21.  “The shareholders haven’t reached a decision on
delisting,” Haselsteiner told WirtschaftsBlatt newspaper in
today’s issue. “This is a question of how low the share price
actually falls. Because at some point it is uninteresting.”  Haselsteiner, whose family trust owns 29.2 percent of
Strabag, is retiring in 2014 and the company could delist after
that, he said in the WirtschaftsBlatt interview. About 14
percent of shares are in free float, with Haselsteiner,
Raiffeisen, Uniqa and Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska  owning
the rest, according to a graph on Strabag’s website dated July
18.  Strabag share sold at 47 euros a piece at its October 2007
IPO.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
