The New York Jets acquired  Jason Smith  from the  St. Louis Rams  for Wayne Hunter in an exchange of
offensive tackles who recently lost their starting jobs.  Smith, 26, was the second overall pick of the Rams in the
2009 National Football League draft behind Detroit Lions
quarterback Matt Stafford. The 6-foot-5, 308-pound lineman
started 26 of the 29 games he played with the Rams, yet had lost
his job in the preseason to Barry Richardson.  Hunter, 31, spent the past four years in New York and
allowed 11 sacks in his first season as the Jets’ starting right
tackle last season. In the Jets’ preseason loss to the  Carolina
Panthers  two days ago, Hunter was benched in favor of Austin Howard. The Jets, who have yet to score a touchdown in their
three preseason games, said on their website that Howard will
remain in the starting lineup.  The Jets’ acquisition of Smith comes one month after they
tried to get right tackle Jeff Otah from the Panthers. That
trade was nullified when Otah failed two physical exams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
