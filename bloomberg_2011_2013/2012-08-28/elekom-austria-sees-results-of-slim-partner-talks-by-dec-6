Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  will announce
first money-saving tactics with new investor America Movil SAB
at its Capital Markets Day on Dec. 6, according to Chief
Executive Officer Hannes Ametsreiter.  The companies are discussing potential synergies in
purchasing, wholesale and content, Ametsreiter told reporters in
Alpbach, Austria today.  Telekom Austria is also starting talks on synergies with
Royal  KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch telecommunications company where America
Movil took a 28 percent stake in June, Ametsreiter said.  Carlos Slim, the worldâ€™s richest man, is pushing his
wireless carrier America Movil into Europe to take advantage of
phone company valuations that have fallen during the euro-region
crisis. In June, Slim agreed to buy a 21 percent stake in
 Telekom Austria .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
