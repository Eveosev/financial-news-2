China’s stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index gaining the most in three weeks, as steelmakers
and oil refiners jumped amid speculation more state-owned
companies will announce share buybacks.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019)  climbed 10 percent after saying it
plans to spend as much as 5 billion yuan ($787 million)
purchasing its own shares.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
surged 5.4 percent, the most since December 2009, and PetroChina
Co. rallied 2.1 percent. The two refiners accounted for about 40
percent of today’s gain on the  Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP)   “More companies may follow Baoshan to buy back their
shares as stock prices are so low,” Wang Weijun, a strategist
at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.9 percent to 2,073.15
at the close, after falling yesterday to the lowest level since
Feb. 2, 2009. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 0.5 percent to
2,238.41. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese
companies traded in  Hong Kong  retreated 0.3 percent.  Baoshan Steel rallied 10 percent to 4.48  yuan  after closing
at its lowest level since 2006 yesterday. The company will buy
back the shares at as much as 5 yuan a share, Baoshan said. The
company reported second-quarter net income that was boosted by
the sale of two unprofitable units.  Other steelmakers advanced. Wuhan Iron & Steel Co. rose 2.4
percent to 2.55 yuan.  Angang Steel Co. (000898)  climbed 2 percent to 3.62
yuan.  ‘Obligation to Buy’  Publicly traded companies, especially those whose stock
prices are below their book values, have an obligation to buy
back their own shares, the  China  Securities Journal reported
Aug. 2, citing an unidentified official at the China Securities
Regulatory Commission.  China Petroleum, also known as Sinopec, rallied 5.4 percent
to 6.23 yuan. PetroChina added 2.1 percent to 8.95 yuan after
closing at its lowest level since November 2007 yesterday.
PetroChina’s spokesman  Mao Zefeng  and Sinopec’s spokesman Lv Dapeng, both based in Beijing, couldn’t be reached after three
calls to each of their office and mobile phones.  “There’s speculation that the parents of Sinopec and
PetroChina may buy back shares of the two companies,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi
Investment Management Co., which manages about $120 million.
“The state share buy-back will boost sentiment in the short
term and keep the index stabilizing at the current level.”  The Shanghai Composite slumped the most in six weeks
yesterday after the statistics bureau said industrial companies’
profits fell by the most this year in July. The equity measure
plunged 6.8 percent this quarter through yesterday, the worst
performer among the world’s biggest stock indexes tracked by
Bloomberg.  Stock Valuations  The Shanghai Composite is valued at 9.4 times estimated
earnings for this year, the lowest level since January. The
index has an average multiple of 17.4 since Bloomberg began
compiling the  data  in 2006. The 14-day relative strength measure
for the Shanghai Composite, measuring how rapidly prices have
advanced or dropped during a specified time period, was at 29.2
yesterday. Readings below 30 are a buy signal to some traders.  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (601238)  lost 0.8 percent to 6.19
yuan after saying first-half profit fell 14 percent.  A  gauge  tracking property stocks sank 0.6 percent, the only
decline among the Shanghai Composite’s five industry groups and
an eighth day of losses. Hexun.com said China may start a new
property tax trial in early 2013.  Poly Real Estate, China’s second-largest developer by
market value, retreated 1.9 percent to 9.24 yuan, its lowest
close since March 29. China Vanke Co., the biggest, dropped 1
percent to 8 yuan.  Trade Volumes  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 12.4
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 5.4
billion shares changed hands in the gauge today, 31 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  Chinese stocks  fell for a third day in  New York  yesterday,
led by state-owned companies, after industrial firms’ profits
declined at a faster pace in July.  “Investors were looking for a recovery in earnings to take
place in the second half, but they’re pushing that out one
quarter or even two,” Colin Bell, director of Global Emerging
Market Equities at Auerbach Grayson Co., said in a phone
interview in New York. “There’s more uncertainty about the
timing for a cyclical recovery, so expectations for a slight
rebound in equities have been put off.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slumped 1.5 percent to $33.51,
extending its decline to a ninth day, the longest losing stretch
since May.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
