Robert Bosch GmbH  will close a
solar-panel plant in eastern  Germany  by the end of the year as
the world’s biggest car-parts manufacturer trims back its solar-
energy business.  Production at the 30-megawatt silicon thin-film plant in
Erfurt, which has 130 employees, will be halted after the market
environment for the technology declined “sharply” in recent
months, Heide Traemann, a company spokeswoman for Bosch’s solar
unit, said today by phone.  Bosch is seeking to avoid firings by transferring as many
employees as possible to other positions within the company, she
said. The closing will have no effect on the company’s facility
in Arnstadt, where about 2,500 workers produce crystalline-based
photovoltaic panels, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
