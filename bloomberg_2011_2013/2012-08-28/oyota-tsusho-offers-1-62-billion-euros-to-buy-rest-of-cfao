Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015) , the trading arm
of  Japan ’s largest carmaker, offered 1.62 billion euros ($2
billion) to buy the remaining 70 percent of auto and drugs
distributor  CFAO SA (CFAO)  to expand its business in Africa.  Toyota Tsusho plans to buy shares for 37.50 euros apiece
through a public offer, the Nagoya, Japan-based company said in
a statement. The price, which is 1.6 percent higher than CFAO’s
latest close, matches the bid it made to buy a stake held by
 France ’s  PPR SA (PP)  last month. The companies said at the time
Toyota Tsusho was considering a general offer.  The deal, Toyota Tsusho’s biggest acquisition since its
purchase of Tomen Corp. in 2005, would pave the way for the
Japanese company to reduce its reliance on autos and expand its
business in  Africa . The sale gives Paris-based PPR, owner of the
Gucci luxury brand, an exit from assets that don’t fit its
strategy to focus on sporting and luxury goods.  “This is a good price, but not a very generous one,” said
Virginie Blin, an analyst at AlphaValue with an add
recommendation on CFAO. “They’d have to offer a little more.
The risk is that everyone might not accept the deal at this
price.” Blin said she valued CFAO at 41 euros per share.  Toyota Tsusho, which counts  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as its
biggest shareholder, fell 1.2 percent to 1,601 yen at the close
of trading in Tokyo before the announcement. CFAO rose 1.5
percent to 37.46 euros as of 11:24 a.m. in Paris trading. PPR
fell 0.8 percent to 125.35 euros.  Reducing Autos  CFAO distributes goods ranging from trucks to
pharmaceuticals in 34 countries, mainly in Africa and French
Overseas Territories. The company generated revenue of 3.1
billion euros in 2011.  “The company will now have access to the whole African
continent,” Jiro Iokibe, a Tokyo-based analyst at  Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. (8601) , said by phone. “The acquisition will
also help Toyota Tsusho expand its business away from autos.”  Toyota Tsusho, which generated 64 percent of its profit in
the last fiscal year from auto-related businesses, has  forecast 
it will reduce the proportion to 50 percent by March 2017.  PPR, which on Aug. 2 completed its 688 million euro sale of
a 30 percent stake in CFAO to Toyota Tsusho, agreed to unload
its remaining 12 percent holding to the Japanese company,
according to the statement. Toyota Tsusho said earlier this
month it registered to sell as much as 200 billion yen ($2.55
billion) in bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
