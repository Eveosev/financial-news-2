Spain’s two-year notes advanced for
the first time in five days after the nation’s  borrowing costs 
fell at a bill sale, fueling optimism the nation can contain its
debt crisis.  Italy’s notes also rose as it auctioned 3.75 billion euros
($4.71 billion) of zero-coupon and inflation-linked securities.
Spain’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is hosting European Union
President  Herman Van Rompuy  for the first in a series of
meetings aimed at helping the nation fulfill its funding needs.
European Central Bank policy makers are due to decide on
 interest rates  next week. Finland prepared to sell 4 billion
euros of 10-year benchmark securities via banks.  “We’ve had some pretty positive auction results,” said
 Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “They
illustrate demand for short-dated paper has remained relatively
strong.”  The Spanish  two-year yield  fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.66 percent at 12:56 p.m. London time. The
4.75 percent note due July 2014 rose 0.145, or 1.45 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.960.  Italy ’s  two-year note  yield
declined six basis points to 3.08 percent.  The Spanish Treasury sold 3.6 billion euros of bills today,
more than the 3.5 billion euros sought. The yield for three-
month securities fell to 0.946 percent from 2.434 percent at the
last sale on July 24. That’s the least paid for three-month
bills at auction since May 22. The rate on the six-month bills
fell to 2.026 percent from 3.691 percent last month.  Fiscal Changes  Yields on Spanish and Italian bonds have plunged to three-
month lows on optimism the ECB and the single currency’s 17
members will agree on a plan to use short-dated sovereign debt
purchases to curb governments’ borrowing costs and win them time
to implement fiscal changes.  Spain ’s Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria
said Aug. 24 that Rajoy has a full diplomatic agenda in the
coming months as “Spain is working so that mechanisms
guaranteeing the euro’s irreversibility are adopted.”  Italy sold 3 billion euros of zero-coupon 2014 debt to
yield 3.064 percent, down from 4.86 percent at the previous
auction on July 26. Investors bid for 1.95 times the amount
offered, compared with 1.78 times last month.  Italy also sold 750 million euros of 2016 and 2019
inflation-linked bonds. The nation is scheduled to sell 9
billion euros of 181-day bills tomorrow, and as much as 7.5
billion euros of debt due in 2017 and 2022 on Aug. 30.  A German consumer-sentiment index will remain at 5.9 next
month, Nuremberg-based  GfK SE (GFK)  said today. Economists predicted a
decline to 5.8, according to the median of 25 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey .  Finnish Bonds  Finland’s 10-year bonds will be priced to yield three basis
points more than the mid-swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the deal, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set. Finnish securities maturing in April 2021
yielded 1.52 percent.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market
Index, which monitors fixed-income assets worldwide, has
returned 0.06 percent this month. Less than two weeks ago the
index was headed for its worst monthly performance since 2010.  German bonds have returned 3.8 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities fell 2.3
percent, while Italy’s gained 11 percent.  Volatility in Portuguese government debt was the highest in
the euro area today, followed by Italy and Spain, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
