Fi Yapi AS , a Turkish low-cost mass
housing builder, canâ€™t complete its projects and is having
difficulty paying back 20 million liras ($11.1 million) owing to
contractors and the tax office,  Hurriyet  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Fi Yapi, based in Istanbul, has stopped projects in
Istanbul, Sakarya and Izmir provinces for about 4,000 apartments
in total, the newspaper said. Fikret Inan, owner of the company,
told the newspaper there were no financial problems.
