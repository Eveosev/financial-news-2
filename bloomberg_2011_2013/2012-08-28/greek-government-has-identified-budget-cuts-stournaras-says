The Greek government identified the
measures to be included in 11.5 billion euros ($14.5 billion) of
budget cuts in the next two years as demanded by its
international creditors, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras
said.  “We have settled on the package,” Stournaras said after a
meeting with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras today. “Tonight’s
meeting had to do with coordinating timetables and actions,” he
said, according to a transcript of his comments e-mailed from
Samaras’s office.  Samaras will meet tomorrow with the leaders of the
political parties supporting his coalition government,  Evangelos Venizelos  and Fotis Kouvelis, to discuss the package.
