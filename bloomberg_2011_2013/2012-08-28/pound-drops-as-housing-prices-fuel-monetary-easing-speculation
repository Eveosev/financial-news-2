The pound weakened against the euro
for the first time in three days amid speculation falling  house
prices  will push the economy deeper into recession, increasing
bets the Bank of England will buy more assets to spur growth.  Sterling reversed a decline versus the dollar on the first
trading day of a public-holiday shortened week. Home values
slipped 0.1 percent in August from July, when they also fell 0.1
percent, Hometrack Ltd. said yesterday. Gilts advanced as a
report showed  Spain ’s recession worsened in the second quarter,
boosting demand for U.K. securities as a haven from the euro
area’s debt crisis.  “When you have quantitative easing speculation, it’s
always a burden for the currency,”  Lutz Karpowitz , a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank AG, said by phone
from  Frankfurt , referring to the central bank’s bond-purchase
program. “There’s always speculation about it and it can’t be
ruled out.”  Sterling depreciated 0.3 percent to 79.38 pence per euro at
5:04 p.m. London time after touching 79.55 pence, the weakest
level since Aug. 7. The pound was 0.2 percent stronger at
$1.5827 after losing as much as 0.3 percent. It fell 0.1 percent
to 124.26 yen.  Britain’s currency has lost 1.3 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 1.6 percent and
the euro gained 0.6 percent.  Recession Deepened  A government report on Aug. 24 showed U.K.  gross domestic
product  contracted 0.5 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent drop
estimated on July 25. That marked the longest run of declines
since 2009. Net trade cut 1 percentage point from GDP, the most
since 1998.  Bank of England  policy makers cut their growth forecasts
this month and left the door open to more stimulus, with
Governor  Mervyn King  saying they will do all they can to spur
economic expansion. The central bank maintained its bond-buying
program at 375 billion pounds at its meeting on Aug. 2.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.49 percent, after
touching 1.48 percent, the lowest since Aug. 6. The 4 percent
bond maturing in March 2022 rose 0.495, or 4.95 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 122.225.  Gilts have returned 3.6 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained 3.8 percent
and  U.S. Treasuries  advanced 2.1 percent.  Debt Struggle  The British securities have been supported as the European
sovereign-debt crisis worsened and recessions in euro members
including Spain and  Italy  fueled speculation nations will
struggle to manage their debts.  Spain’s  gross domestic product  fell 0.4 percent from the
previous quarter, when it declined 0.3 percent, the Madrid-based
National Statistics Institute said today. That’s in line with an
estimate of 0.4 percent on July 30, before the institute
yesterday revised down data for 2010 and 2011.  Consumer spending 
dropped 1 percent in the quarter.  Catalonia plans to request five billion euros in aid from
Spain’s financing facility for regions, an official from the
region’s government confirmed in a telephone interview. Spain’s
cabinet approved on July 13 the creation of a mechanism to make
loans to regions to allow them to meet financial liabilities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
