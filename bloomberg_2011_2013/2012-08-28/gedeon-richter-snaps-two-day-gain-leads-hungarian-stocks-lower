Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., Hungary’s
biggest drugmaker, snapped two days of gains, leading the
country’s stocks lower, after Japan lowered its economic
assessment, sapping demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The shares fell 1.2 percent to 39,400 forint by 11:48 a.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  dropped 0.2 percent
to 17,464.67, matching the decline of the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
 index .  European and emerging-market stocks declined after the
Japanese government lowered its view on personal consumption,
home-building, exports, imports and industrial output, while
raising its assessment of the labor market.  Japan’s “picture on industrial output and exports is more
than gloomy,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based analyst at broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
