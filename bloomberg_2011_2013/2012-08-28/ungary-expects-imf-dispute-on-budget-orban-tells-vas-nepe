Hungary is facing a “big” debate
with the  International Monetary Fund  on whether it can finance
payroll-tax cuts to protect jobs, the newspaper Vas Nepe
 reported , citing Prime Minister  Viktor Orban .  Orban wants to win the “struggle” with the IMF and
economists who questioned whether the budget will be able to
provide enough funding for the jobs plan, he said, according to
Szombathely, Hungary-based Vas Nepe.  Hungary will only cooperate with multinational companies
that create local jobs and use Hungarian suppliers and raw
materials, not with those that “raze the market and destroy
small Hungarian companies,” Orban said in the interview, Vas
Nepe reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
