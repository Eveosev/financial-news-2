Mexico’s peso held at the lowest
level in three weeks after confidence among U.S. consumers fell
in August by the most in 10 months.  The peso was little changed at 13.1899 per  U.S. dollar  at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, settling at the weakest level since Aug. 7.
The peso has gained 5.7 percent this year, the most among the
dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Data today showed that confidence among U.S. consumers fell
in August by the most in 10 months as households grew more
pessimistic about the economic outlook. That wiped out earlier
gains in the currency after another report showed  home prices  in
20 U.S. cities climbed in June from a year earlier, the first
gain in almost two years. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its
exports to the U.S.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
decreased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.47
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.19 centavo to 140.54 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
