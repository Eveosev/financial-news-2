The global bond market has erased
its biggest monthly loss in 1 1/2 years as European leaders
struggle to solve the region’s debt crisis and investors
anticipate more debt purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Less than two weeks ago the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Global Broad Market Index was headed for its worst monthly
performance since November 2010, losing 0.64 percent through
Aug. 16. It has since recovered, with fixed-income assets
worldwide from government to corporate to mortgage securities
returning 0.06 percent, including reinvested interest. Stocks
have returned 2.7 percent when including reinvested dividends.  Optimism for growth is fading as European austerity
measures spur recessions from  Spain  to  Greece  while  China ’s
expansion may be slowing for a seventh quarter.  Japan  cut its
assessment for its economy for the first time in 10 months, and
last week economists at Morgan Stanley cut their 2012 global
growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.7 percent.  “Yields rose on the back of increasing confidence in a
European solution, but people have now realized that a temporary
fix isn’t going to solve everything and a global slowdown is
becoming inevitable,” said Mat McCrum, who helps manage A$2.7
billion ($2.8 billion) as investment director at Melbourne-based
Omega Global Investors Pty. “There is no clear path for global
growth and a lot of downside risk.”  Yield Gyrations  Yields on bonds rose to an average of 1.85 percent on Aug.
16 from 1.73 percent at the end of July before easing back to
1.74 percent yesterday, according to the Bank of America index,
which measures almost 20,000 securities with a par value of
$40.6 trillion.  Speculation is growing that Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
may signal the central bank is ready to conduct a third round of
bond purchases when he delivers a speech on Aug. 31 in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming .  Minutes from the July 31-Aug. 1 meeting of the  Federal Open
Market Committee  signaled policy makers are ready to add to
record stimulus unless they are convinced the recovery is
accelerating. The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and
mortgage-related securities since 2008 in two rounds of
quantitative easing, or QE.  Yield Target  “Global bond markets reversed course and rallied last week
after the Fed signaled further easing is close at hand,” said
Adam Donaldson, head of debt research at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , in a note to clients yesterday. “We look for the Fed
to embark on QE3 in September, helping take U.S. 10-year yields
down toward our 1.4 percent target.”  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury  yields  rose to 1.86 percent
on Aug. 21 from a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25. They
fell 2 basis points to 1.64 percent at 8:52 a.m.  New York  time,
while the rate on similar-maturity German debt fell for a fifth
day, dropping 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.35
percent.  German bonds have slipped 0.3 percent this month, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries fell 0.8 percent, while
Spanish securities gained 2.9 percent.  The global bond market has returned 4.24 percent this year,
compared with 5.9 percent in 2011. Government debt has returned
3.4 percent, while corporates have gained 8.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
