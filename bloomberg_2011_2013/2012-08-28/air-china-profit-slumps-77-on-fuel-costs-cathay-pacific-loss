Air China Ltd. (601111) , the nation’s biggest
international carrier, said first-half profit slumped 77 percent
because of slowing  travel demand , higher fuel costs, and a loss
from its stake in  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)   Net income  in the six months ended in June fell to 944.5
million ($149 million), under international accounting
standards, from 4.06 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-
based carrier said in a filing to Hong Kong stock exchange
today. That compares with the 665 million-yuan median profit
estimate of three analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Sales
rose 5.4 percent to 47.6 billion yuan.  The carrier filled a lower percentage of seats in the first
half than a year earlier as  China ’s cooling  growth  and the Euro-
zone debt crisis sapped travel demand. Air China also booked
losses from investment, mainly on about 30 percent stake in
Cathay, and yuan’s depreciation against the dollar. Rival  China
Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  yesterday posted a larger-than-expected 85
percent slump in profit in the period.  “It’s not surprising to see a bad first-half result
because of weaker demand and fuel costs,” Kelvin Lau, a Hong
Kong-based Daiwa Securities Group Inc. analyst, said before the
results were announced. “Profitability will likely improve in
the second half on cost-saving measures and demand recovery.”  Average Airfare  Passenger yield, a measure of average airfare, rose 3
percent in the first half. Passenger load factor, or the
percentage of seats filled by paying customers, fell 0.7
percentage point to 80.04 percent as capacity expansion outpaced
demand growth.  Air China fell 3.6 percent to close at HK$4.84 in Hong Kong
trading today, before the earnings were released. The stock has
declined 16 percent this year, compared with a 7.5 percent climb
for the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  It booked a loss of 177 million yuan from stake in Cathay
Pacific from a gain of 483 million yuan a year earlier. The Hong
Kong-based Cathay, which also owns about 20 percent of Air
China, earlier this month posted a surprise HK$935 million
first-half loss. Cathay suffered a HK$300 million loss from its
49 percent stake in the cargo venture with Air China.  Fuel costs  for Air China rose 13 percent to 17.8 billion
yuan. Average domestic fuel prices climbed about 15 percent in
the first half from a year earlier, according to China
Securities Co. analyst Li Lei. The average of international jet
fuel spot prices was little changed in the period, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  50 Percent  Air China said in July that first-half earnings will likely
fall more than 50 percent.  The  yuan  weakened 0.95 percent against the dollar in the
period, the first half-yearly decline since 2009, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. That compares with a
4.7 percent increase in 2011. Chinese carriers benefit from a
stronger yuan as it pares the repatriated value of dollar-
denominated debts used to buy planes and fuel overseas.  The company also made a 230.2 million yuan impairment for
bad loan of subsidiaries.  Air China, including units Shenzhen Airlines Co. and Air
Macau, introduced 23 new planes and retired 14 in the first
half. It had a fleet of 441 aircraft as of June 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
