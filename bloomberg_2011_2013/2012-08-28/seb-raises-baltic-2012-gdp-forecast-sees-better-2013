SEB AB, the second-largest lender in
the Baltics, raised its forecast for gross domestic product in
 Estonia , Latvia and  Lithuania  this year and said improving
domestic demand will boost economic growth in 2013.  GDP in Estonia, the newest euro-area member, may expand 2
percent this year and 3 percent in 2013, while both Latvia’s and
Lithuania’s economies will grow 3.5 percent this year and 4
percent in 2013, SEB said in its  Nordic Outlook  today.  “Gradually rising domestic demand will cushion the three
economies as the export engine sputters in 2013,” SEB said.
“So far this year, consumption and capital spending have turned
out to be somewhat stronger than expected.”  Baltic growth would reach its potential pace of between 4
and 4.5 percent in 2014, while the three countries will
“continue to struggle with significant structural problems in
the labor market,” the Stockholm-based bank said. It reiterated
 Latvia  will probably adopt the euro in 2014 while Lithuania’s
accession will be delayed until 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
