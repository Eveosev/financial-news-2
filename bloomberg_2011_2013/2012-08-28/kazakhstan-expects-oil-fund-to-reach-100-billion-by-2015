Kazakhstan’s government expects
assets held by its sovereign wealth fund to more than double to
$100 billion by 2015, Economic Development and Trade Ministry
said in a statement distributed today in the capital, Astana.  The value of assets held by the National Oil Fund reached
$53.3 billion in July, the  Central bank  said Aug 6.  Kazakhstan, which holds about 3 percent of the world’s oil
reserves according to  BP Plc (BP/) , created the National Oil Fund in
2000 to guard against declines in the price of crude. The fund
holds 80 percent of its assets in bonds and 20 percent in
stocks, the central bank said in November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
