India’s bonds gained a third day on
speculation slowing economic growth will prompt the central bank
to reduce  interest rates .  Official figures due on Aug. 31 will probably show the
economy grew 5.3 percent last quarter, matching the preceding
period’s slowest pace since 2009, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Bonds also gained as a revival in monsoon
rains and lower  oil prices  tempered speculation inflation will
accelerate, according to Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income
trader in Mumbai at Development Credit Bank.  “Given the weak growth, monetary easing has to take place
sometime in future,” said Dash. “Any reduction in price
pressures would also be a positive for bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.18 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the lowest level since Aug. 10.  The  Reserve Bank  of India kept the repurchase  rate 
unchanged at 8 percent at a policy meeting July 31 and the next
review is scheduled on Sept. 17. The rate was last cut by 50
basis points in April. Gross domestic product may rise 6.7
percent in the year that began April 1, less than the 7.6
percent gain forecast in February, Prime Minister  Manmohan
Singh ’s economic panel said in a report this month.  The seasonal deficit in monsoon rains has dropped to 13
percent of a 50-year average from 19 percent at the end of July,
the weather bureau said on its website yesterday.  The wholesale price  index  rose 6.87 percent in July, the
slowest pace in 32 months, commerce ministry data show.  Brent
crude  has fallen 0.9 percent this week to $112.59 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.79 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
