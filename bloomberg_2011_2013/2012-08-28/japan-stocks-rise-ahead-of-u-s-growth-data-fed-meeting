Japan  stocks  slid, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index falling the most in more than three weeks, after the
government downgraded its assessment of the economy amid slowing
growth in China, and on speculation  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  will refrain from announcing stimulus this week.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction-machinery maker that gets 14
percent of its sales from China, dropped 2.1 percent. Chubu
Electric Power Co. paced declines among utilities after
companies in the sector were downgraded by Credit Suisse Group
AG.  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  surged 14 percent, the most since December
2009, on the lender’s plans to repay public funds.  The Topix lost 1.2 percent to 746.30 at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, the biggest drop since Aug. 3, with more than five shares
falling for each that rose. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid
0.6 percent to 9,033.29 after rising as much as 0.6 percent
earlier. Volume was 6.9 percent above the 30-day average ahead
of the Fed’s economic symposium at the end of the week in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  “Last week, stocks markets rose and the dollar weakened
after the Fed’s minutes raised easing speculation, but the
markets are short of catalysts to maintain such expectations,”
said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust
Bank Ltd., which has 33 trillion yen ($420 billion) in assets.
“That’s why investors are focusing on Bernanke’s speech in
Jackson Hole at the end of this week.”  The Topix has rebounded 7.3 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 as central banks around the world ease policy to support
growth. The price of shares on the gauge stood at 0.9 times book
value, compared with 2.2 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number
less than one means that companies can be bought for less than
the value of their assets.  Easing Expectations  Stocks fell on expectations Bernanke won’t announce a third
round of quantitative easing at his Aug. 31 speech at Jackson
Hole, economists including  Michael Feroli  of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and  James O’Sullivan  at High Frequency Economics.  “Markets are now correcting excessive expectations for
stimulus,” said Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank’s Sera. “Investors
will have a hard time deciding whether to buy or sell until they
confirm Bernanke’s stance on easing.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge fell 0.1 percent yesterday in New York as
investors awaited indications on whether the Federal Reserve
will provide further stimulus.  Shares also fell after Japan’s government downgraded its
assessment of the world’s third-biggest economy as some analysts
forecast gross domestic product will shrink this quarter as
slowing growth in China and recession in Europe hurts demand.  Economic Assessment  Risks include a “further slowing down of overseas
economies and sharp fluctuations in the financial and capital
markets,” the Cabinet Office said in a monthly report released
in Tokyo today.  The yen appreciated to as high as 78.49 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 78.74 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 97.89 from 98.45. A stronger yen cuts overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Komatsu fell 2.1 percent to 1,630 yen. Nikon Corp., a
camera maker counts Europe as its biggest market, slipped 1.5
percent to 2,210 yen.  Chubu Electric Power and  Kansai Electric  Power Co. declined
 the most  on the Nikkei 225 after Credit Suisse cut the utilities
to “neutral” from “outperform,” citing high dependence on
nuclear power and concerns about dividend payouts. Chubu
Electric sank 10 percent to 920 yen. Kansai Electric lost 10
percent to 594 yen. Power companies declined the most among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Aozora Bank gained the most on the Nikkei 225, rising 14
percent to 238 yen after the lender unveiled a plan to spend
227.6 billion yen ($2.9 billion) to repay a taxpayer bailout
over 10 years and buy back common stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
