Volatility on near-term crude
options fell as futures rose after Hurricane Isaac reduced
offshore oil production in the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Implied volatility for options expiring in October, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 28.64 percent at 4:06 p.m. in  New York , down
from 28.79 percent yesterday. Bets that prices would fall
accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading today.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 86 cents to settle at
$96.33 a barrel on the Nymex, the first gain in four days.  The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported
that 93 percent of crude production from the Gulf has been shut
in as Isaac was expected to strike the Louisiana coast near  New
Orleans  today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $90 puts, which slipped 19 cents to 59 cents a barrel at
4:46 p.m. with 1,888 lots trading. October $86 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,356 lots changing hands as
they fell 8 cents to 20 cents a barrel. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 54
percent of contracts traded.  October $90 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 4,234 lots changing hands. They rose 7 cents to
78 cents a barrel. October $95 puts advanced 21 cents to $2.40
on volume of 2,856.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
45,986 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 43,703 lots
and December $120 calls with 41,353.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
