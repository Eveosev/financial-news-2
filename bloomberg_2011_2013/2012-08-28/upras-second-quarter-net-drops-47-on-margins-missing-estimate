Tupras Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) ,
 Turkey ’s sole refiner, said net income plunged 47 percent in the
second quarter, missing estimates, as Iran oil sanctions shrank
its refining margins.  Net income fell to 135.7 million liras ($75.4 million) from
258.1 million liras in the second quarter of last year, the oil
refiner, owned by  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , said today in a filing to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange . That missed the average estimate of
142.4 million liras from 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Tupras cut oil purchases from Iran in the second quarter as
the U.S. and  Europe  planned sanctions against the Persian Gulf
country. Turkey pledged in March to reduce Iranian oil imports
by 20 percent, earning a place among seven countries exempted
from the U.S. sanctions for renewable six-month period.  “Refineries’ production costs have increased because of
Iranian sanctions,” Tupras said in an e-mailed statement.
Inventories lost value as oil and product prices fell, while
rising natural gas boosted production costs, which also
contributed to narrower refining margins, the company said.  The shares fell 0.3 percent to 40.7 liras at 3:19 p.m. in
Istanbul trade.  Sales Rise  Tupras said Aug. 14 that its net refining margin fell to
$3.65 a barrel compared with a second-quarter Mediterranean
regional benchmark of $5.73 a barrel and from $4.34 in the same
period last year. Production fell 0.6 percent in the first half
of this year, the company said at the time.  Sales rose to 11.9 billion liras from 10.2 billion liras a
year earlier, according to today’s statement.  Tupras aims to make products with a low sulfur content such
as diesel and gasoline from higher-content products such as
fuel-oil through a so-called residuum upgrade project. Tupras
spent $584.5 million on the project in the first half of this
year, carrying out about a quarter of the $2.4 billion project,
which is scheduled for completion by 2014, it said.  Tupras is cutting oil purchases 20 percent from  Iran , after
signing a contract in August 2011 to buy 9 million metric tons,
or 180,000 barrels a day, of crude for a year. Iran’s share of
Turkish crude oil imports dropped to 37 percent in June from 50
percent in May and 66 percent in April, according to data from
Turkey’s energy market regulator. Turkey imported 1.87 million
tons of crude from all nations in June, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
