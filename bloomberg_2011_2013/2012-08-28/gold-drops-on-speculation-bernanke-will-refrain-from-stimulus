Gold dropped the most in two weeks
on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will delay announcing
stimulus measures amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering.  Home prices in 20 U.S. cities climbed in June for the first
time in almost two years, a private report showed today.  The
Commerce Department’s first revision to second-quarter gross
domestic product tomorrow may show faster growth than earlier
reported, according to the Bloomberg survey median. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  will speak on Aug. 31 at an annual meeting in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming. At the event in 2010, he foreshadowed a
$600 billion second round of bond buying.  “The market is in a wait-and-watch mode ahead of the
meeting,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We are
also witnessing some profit taking.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,669.70 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest loss for a most-active contract since Aug. 14.  Prices surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  The metal gained 3.3 percent last week, the most since
January, amid expectations that any new stimulus measure would
boost economic growth and spur rising consumer prices.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$30.963 an ounce on the Comex. The price climbed in the previous
six sessions, the longest rally since October.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery declined 2.1 percent to $1,520.40 an ounce.  Palladium futures for September delivery retreated 2.3
percent to $640.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
