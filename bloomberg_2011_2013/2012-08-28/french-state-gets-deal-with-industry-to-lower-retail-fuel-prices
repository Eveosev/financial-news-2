France seeks “more lasting
measures” to cut  oil prices  after the government agreed on a
three-month reduction to help shore up the economy.  “We are calling on producing countries to raise production
to lower prices,” Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said today
outside Paris.  Asked whether France supports a release of strategic crude
reserves, he replied: “Within an international context we have
to examine all measures that would allow a decrease in oil
prices.”  The Group of Seven nations has called on oil-producing
countries to increase output and is monitoring the threats to
their economies  posed by high oil prices, according to a joint
statement issued yesterday by the U.S. Treasury Department. Oil
has advanced 24 percent since reaching a 2012 low in June.  The International Energy Agency made available 60 million
barrels of crude and oil products in June 2011 after Libyan
output was disrupted by an armed uprising against Muammar
Qaddafi.  French retail fuel prices will drop as much as six cents a
liter under the deal struck with suppliers yesterday. The
government will reduce a tax on fuel by three cents a liter
while distributors including  Total SA (FP)  and supermarket chains
such as  Carrefour SA (CA)  and E.Leclerc will implement cuts of the
same size, Moscovici said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
