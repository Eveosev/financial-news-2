Slovakiaâ€™s  Economy Ministry  proposes
granting state aid to a unit of Mondi Group, a paper and
packaging company, to cover part of the cost of an investment
and to prevent job cuts,  Sme  reported.  The ministry is asking the government to approve 25 million
euros ($31 million) of tax breaks for Mondi SCP, based in
Ruzomberok, the newspaper said, citing a ministry document. The
papermaker promised to invest 95 million euros in expanding
production and to retain 383 jobs if it gets the aid, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
