 The failure of  China ’s government
to minimize deadly man-made road accidents may “in the worst
case scenario” cause it to lose the people’s trust, the state-
owned Xinhua News Agency said in a report today.  The report cited a series of fatal accidents that happened
across China this month, including a tanker truck collision that
killed 36 passengers in Shaanxi province, and the collapse of a
new bridge collapsed in Heilongjiang province, which killed
three people and injured five others.  “For much of the general public, the more fatal accidents
occur, the greater the government’s credibility is undermined,”
Xinhua said in the report.  This “may prove to be the biggest challenge” for the
ruling Communist Party of China when it meets for a national
congress later this year to chart the future of the Party and
the country, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
