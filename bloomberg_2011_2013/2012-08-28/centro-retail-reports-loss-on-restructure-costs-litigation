Centro Retail Australia (CRF)  reported a
A$222.9 million ($230.8 million) loss in its first seven months
of operations, primarily due to costs related to its restructure
and shareholder litigation.  Underlying earnings in the period to June 30 was A$123.2
million, driven by income from its malls, the Melbourne-based
company said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  Centro Retail began trading in December following the
restructure of  Centro Properties Group  and its affiliated funds.
Shares of the property trust, which sold full and partial stakes
in some of its malls as it sought to simplify its business and
boost income, have risen 21 percent since it began trading on
Dec. 5,  compared  with a 0.9 percent advance in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index in the period.  “Centro Retail exceeded both its distributions and
underlying earnings forecasts,” Chief Executive Officer Steven Sewell said in the statement. “This solid operating profit
performance was achieved through a combination of good property
level performance, control of costs and savings on Centro
Retail’s finance facilities.”  The company will pay a dividend of 6.5 Australian cents per
security, it said. The group expects underlying profit of
between 15.3 and 15.6 cents for fiscal year 2013, it said.  Centro shares climbed 0.5 percent to A$2.10 as of the close
of trading in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
