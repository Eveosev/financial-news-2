Hungarian policy makers may cut
rates once or twice more even before the country obtains an aid
package from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union,  Capital Economics  said.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank today unexpectedly cut the
 benchmark two-week deposit rate  by 25 basis points to 6.75
percent, lowering it for the first time since April 2010 after
the economy slipped into a recession and talks on a credit line
of about 15 billion euros ($18.9 billion) got under way in July.  Policy makers have begun to roll back 100 basis points of
rate increases they carried out in November and December to stem
a sell-off of Hungarian assets after the IMF and the EU
suspended aid talks over a disputed central-bank law and all
three major rating companies downgraded the country’s debt to
junk status.  “Hungarian policy makers appear more willing to ease
policy than we had initially expected,”  William Jackson ,
economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London  wrote in an e-mail
today. “We wouldn’t rule out a further one or two 25 basis-
point rate cuts over the next few months.”  Given “the external financing risks,” deeper cuts to
rates would only be forthcoming following the completion of the
bailout talks, Capital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
