Peru will invite local and foreign
pension providers to bid for new customers at an auction
scheduled for mid-December, said Daniel Schydlowsky, the
countryâ€™s chief financial regulator.  Companies from countries including Chile, Colombia and
 Brazil  may participate in the bidding, he told reporters in
Lima. The provider with the lowest commission will win exclusive
rights to sign up Peruvians in the next two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
