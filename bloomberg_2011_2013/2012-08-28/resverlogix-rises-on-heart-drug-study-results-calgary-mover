Resverlogix Corp. (RVX)  rose the most in
more than six months after the Canadian drugmaker said its
experimental treatment for cardiovascular disease met the
primary goal of a study.  Resverlogix rose 11 percent to C$1.75 at 12:05 p.m. in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading, after gaining 20 percent in the
shares’ biggest intraday gain since Feb. 13. The Calgary-based
company’s stock had increased 19 percent this year through
yesterday.  The medicine, RVX-208, raised the level of good cholesterol
in the trial, dubbed SUSTAIN, the company said today. The study
of 176 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was
conducted in  South Africa  and directed by investigators
including  Steven Nissen , chief of cardiology at the  Cleveland
Clinic  in Ohio. Results were from the second of three stages of
human tests generally required for regulatory approval.  “The data support that RVX-208 is suitable for chronic
use,” said Chief Executive Officer Donald McCaffrey. “We
believe that based on the collective knowledge gained from our
recent trials, our company is well positioned as we approach the
key plaque regression data expected in our ongoing ASSURE
trial.”  Full results will be submitted for publication in a medical
journal, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
