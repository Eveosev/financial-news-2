Wheat fell, capping the longest
slump in 11 months, after  Egypt , the world’s biggest importer of
the grain, shunned U.S. inventories and bought supplies from
Russia.  Egypt on Aug. 25 bought 120,000 metric tons of Russian
wheat and 60,000 tons of Romanian wheat, the state-run  General
Authority  for Supply Commodities said. Russian production of the
grain may fall 27 percent this year after drought cut yields.
The U.S. is expected in 2012-2013 to be the biggest exporter of
wheat, followed by Australia, Canada and Russia.  “The biggest problem with wheat is the market rallied on
exports expected to come our way because of small Russian
exports, but they continue to sell to Egypt,”  Brian Hoops , the
president of Midwest Market Solutions in Springfield, Missouri,
said by telephone. “Despite rumors that they’re out of the
export market, they’re a competing force with the U.S.”  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
settle at $8.755 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price fell for the fifth straight session, the
longest slide since September.  The grain has gained 34 percent this year amid expectations
that livestock producers would use more wheat for feed after
corn prices surged. Drought also reduced the Russian crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
