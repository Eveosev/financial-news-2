Egypt  has no plans to devalue its
currency and will rely on investment, tourism and exports to
help revive the country’s economy, President Mohamed Mursi said
in an interview with Reuters.  Asked whether the government had given any thought to
devaluing the currency, an issue that has been raised by
economists as it seeks a $4.8 billion International Monetary
Fund loan, Mursi said: “No. Definitely not. That’s completely
out of the question.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
