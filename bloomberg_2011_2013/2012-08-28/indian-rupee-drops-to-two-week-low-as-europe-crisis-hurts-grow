India ’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in almost two weeks on further signs  Europe ’s debt crisis
is hurting growth in Asia’s third-largest economy.  The currency declined for a third day before a report on
Aug. 31 that economists predict will show India’s  gross domestic
product  increased last quarter at the slowest pace in three
years. The data comes out the same day as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  meets with global central bank heads in
Jackson Hole,  Wyoming .  “The environment is glum,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a
currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The
markets seem indecisive and this is likely to continue through
the week until the  Jackson Hole  meeting.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 55.8250 per dollar as of
10:03 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 55.8850 earlier, the weakest level since Aug. 16. The
currency is likely to trade between 55.55 and 55.95 today,
according to Raghuvanshi.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 9.95 percent.  The economy grew 5.3 percent in the quarter ended June from
a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 34
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. That matches the growth
rate in the previous quarter, which was the slowest since the
three months through March 2009.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.85 per
dollar, compared with 56.69 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.78 from 56.65. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
