Dubai’s non-oil foreign trade rose
12 percent to a record 602 billion dirhams ($164 billion) in the
first half of 2012 from the year-earlier period, state-run  news
agency   Wam  said yesterday citing data from Dubai Customs.  India remains Dubai’s top foreign trade partner accounting
for 13 percent of the emirate’s total foreign trade exchange
during the first six months of the year, or 77 billion dirhams,
followed by  China  and the U.S., the news agency said.  Dubai’s imports climbed 12 percent in the first half of
2012, while value of exports and re-exports increased 13 percent
in the period, Wam reported. Gold was Dubai’s biggest import
reaching 59 billion dirhams, followed by jewelry at 25 billion
dirhams, the news agency said. Gold was also the sheikhdom’s top
exported product, Wam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
