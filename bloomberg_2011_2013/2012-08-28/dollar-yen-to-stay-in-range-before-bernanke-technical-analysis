The dollar will probably stay in a
one-yen range as investors look for policy signals from the U.S.
Federal Reserve later this week, IG Markets Securities Ltd.
said, citing trading patterns.  The U.S. currency has traded between a support level at
about 78.15 yen and the upper end of its daily ichimoku cloud of
79.14 yen this month, according to Junichi Ishikawa, a Tokyo-
based analyst at IG Markets. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will
speak in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming  on Aug. 31.  “Before the Fed event, the dollar doesn’t have enough
power to break the range,” Ishikawa said. “You may have to
wait until September to see moves to the upside or downside.”  The dollar slid 0.2 percent to 78.55 yen at 12:03 p.m. in
Tokyo today, ending a two-day gain. Support refers to an area
where analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The so-
called cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines and is used to show an area where buy orders
may be clustered.  In technical  analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
