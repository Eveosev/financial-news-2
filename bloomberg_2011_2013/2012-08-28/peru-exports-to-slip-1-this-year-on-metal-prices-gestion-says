Peru’s government expects exports to
decline 1 percent to $45.8 billion this year, Gestion  reported ,
citing Trade Minister Jose Silva.  Commodity exports probably will decline on lower copper,
zinc and tin prices while non-commodity exports are projected to
rise, the Lima-based newspaper said, citing Silva’s comments
before a Congressional panel yesterday.  The government initially had forecast exports would rise to
$49.3 billion this year from $46.3 billion in 2011, Gestion
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
