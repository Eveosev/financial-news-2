Stocks in Mauritius fell for a fifth
day to a two-year low on speculation the effects of a drop in
tourists will spread from hotel operators to banks.  The  39-member SEMDEX index  dropped as much as 0.6 percent
to 1,683.25 and closed 0.4 percent down to 1,686.79 by 1:30
p.m., in  Port Louis , the capital, the lowest on a closing basis
since July 2010. The Semdex is the worst-performing index in
 Africa  this year, declining 14 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Tourist arrivals to the $10-billion Indian Ocean island-
economy will probably decline 0.5 percent this year, the
nation’s statistics agency said on Aug. 23. Loans to the  tourism
industry  amounted to 43.3 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) at end
of June, accounting for 16 percent of credit to companies,
according to Bank of Mauritius data.  Investors are “taking full stock of the woes in the
tourism industry,” Neeraj Umanee, manager of the Port Louis-
based Anglo-Mauritius Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone. “There
is the threat that the tourism problems trickle down the
economy, affecting lenders who have loans exposure in the
industry.”  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the biggest leisure operator,
retreated as much as 5.3 percent and traded 1.8 percent lower to
56 rupees, the lowest since February 2005.  Sun Resorts Ltd. (SUN) 
decreased 2 percent to 29.90 rupees, a 10-year low.  State Bank
of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the second biggest-lender by market value,
fell 0.6 percent to 81.50 rupees, the lowest since July 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
