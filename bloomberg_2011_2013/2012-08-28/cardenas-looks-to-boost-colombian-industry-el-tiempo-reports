Incoming Colombian Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  wants growth in the Andean nation to be more
“balanced,” with industry growing at a similar pace to the oil
and mining sectors, according to an  interview  published in El
Tiempo.  It is “not necessarily good news” that oil and mining now
account for 75 percent of Colombia’s exports, the Bogota-based
newspaper quoted Cardenas as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
