GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , eastern  Australia ’s
largest grain handler, agreed to buy Gardner Smith Group and
Integro Foods for about A$472 million ($489 million) in shares
and debt to expand its edible oils unit.  Gardner Smith holders will get between A$110 million and
A$121 million of GrainCorp shares priced at A$9.79 each, Sydney-
based GrainCorp said today in a statement. The balance will be
funded by debt and about A$159 million from selling new stock to
existing shareholders.  Buying Gardner Smith, Australia’s second-largest oilseed
crusher, and Integro gives GrainCorp 13 bulk liquid terminals
and plants from Australia to  China . The acquisitions add to
deals in agriculture this year including  Glencore International
Plc (GLEN) ’s C$6.1 billion ($6.2 billion) takeover of  Viterra Inc. (VT)  as
companies seek to meet global food demand.  Edible oils “is a relatively stable sector with relatively
good demand,” said Tom Bourne, an analyst at Melbourne-based
Lonsec Ltd. with a “hold” rating for GrainCorp. “They are
paying a full price for the assets so integration will be the
key in delivering value for shareholders.”  The purchase price represents a transaction multiple of 7.4
times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of A$64 million excluding cost savings, GrainCorp
said. The company is targeting A$4 million a year of savings
before tax after the first 12 months.  The acquisitions make “us a stronger company by giving us
an end-to-end vertically integrated position right across the
supply chain,” Managing Director Alison Watkins said today on a
media call. It will also reduce earnings volatility, she said.  GrainCorp Oils  Goodman Fielder Ltd. (GFF) , Australia’s biggest baker, will sell
Integro Foods for A$170 million with the proceeds used to reduce
its debt, Sydney-based Goodman said in a separate statement.
Greenhill Caliburn was the financial adviser to the breadmaker.
GrainCorp will supply products including margarine and bottled
oils to Goodman Fielder equivalent to about 40 percent of
Integro’s total annual volume, GrainCorp said in a presentation.  Gardner Smith and Integro, Australia and  New Zealand ’s
largest refiner and packager of edible fats and oils, will be
combined under one entity called GrainCorp Oils, Watkins said.
The company expects the transaction to be completed in October.  GrainCorp last traded at A$9.85 yesterday before the shares
were halted. The stock will resume trading on Aug. 31. The
company also said today underlying full-year  net income  will be
at the upper end of its estimate of A$185 million to A$205
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
