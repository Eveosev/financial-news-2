Nigel McCue, chief executive officer
of oil rig engineer  Lamprell Plc (LAM) , said he has the board’s
backing after shares plunged 67 percent this year.  The company today reported a loss of $47.1 million for the
first half after delays on its Windcarrier projects, and a
disruption in the supply chain hurt the delivery of jackup rigs.
The Douglas, Isle of Man-based company, whose main facilities
are in Dubai, fell 0.3 percent to 89.75 pence in  London  today.  “I’ve got the support of the board to continue,” McCue
said in a telephone interview. “Behind the scenes we’re
implementing reorganization. In 2013, we’ll be back to
profitability.”  Lamprell received banking waivers at the end of June
following covenant breaches, and it said today it will have to
negotiate with lenders again to avoid breaking loan conditions
at the end of the year. While the company predicts a full-year
loss of as much as $17 million, its order book stands at the
“historically high level” of $1.5 billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
