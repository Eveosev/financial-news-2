Universal Entertainment Corp. (6425) , the
Japanese company controlled by billionaire Kazuo Okada, said it
sued  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  and its officials for defamation in a
Tokyo court.  The pachinko company is seeking 11.2 billion yen ($142
million) in damages through a lawsuit filed in Tokyo District
Court on Aug. 28, it said in a stock exchange statement today.
Wynn Resorts sued Okada on Feb. 19, saying he breached his
fiduciary duty by making improper payments to gaming regulators
in the Philippines.  The Feb. 19 statement defamed Universal Entertainment and
caused it damage, the  Japanese company claims in its latest
lawsuit. The legal filing is the latest development in an
escalating courtroom battle between Okada and the U.S. casino
operator’s Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Wynn .  Okada held the largest single stake in Wynn Resorts through
his Tokyo-based Universal Entertainment until February, when his
20 percent stake in the Las Vegas-based company was forcibly
redeemed after the casino operator said he was “unsuitable.”  A phone call made to Deanna Pettit, a spokeswoman for Wynn
Resorts, was not answered outside normal working hours in the
U.S.  Pachinko involves mechanical games similar to slot
machines.  The filing couldn’t be immediately confirmed in court
records.  To contact the reporters on this story:
