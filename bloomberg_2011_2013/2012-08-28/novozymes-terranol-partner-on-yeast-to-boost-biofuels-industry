Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  agreement to market
Terranol A/S’s yeast technology as the world’s biggest maker of
enzymes seeks to make biofuels from energy crops and
agricultural waste commercially viable.  The agreement will enable Novozymes to speed up global
deployment of Terranol’s yeast technology used in the production
of cellulosic ethanol, Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novozymes said
today in a  statement .  Cellulosic ethanol is a biofuel produced from agricultural
waste and energy crops. Novozymes supplies enzymes to break down
matter such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse and wheat straw
into two types of sugars, C5 and C6, that biofuel producers
ferment into ethanol.  The C5 sugars are tougher to ferment. Terranol has
developed yeasts that process both types of sugars and deliver
optimal ethanol yields, according to the company’s website.  “The fermentation of C5 sugars are proving something of an
Achilles heel in the development of a cellulosic biofuels
industry,” said Harry Boyle, an analyst at London-based
research company Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Improved C5
fermentation performance will considerably boost ethanol yields
from corn stover and wheat straw, while further helping the
industry to scale.”  High-performing and cost-efficient yeast helps speed up the
transition from demonstration scale projects to large scale
commercialization, Novozymes said in the statement. Novozymes
and Denmark-based Terranol’s combined research and development
will ensure “final optimization” of the yeast strain,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
