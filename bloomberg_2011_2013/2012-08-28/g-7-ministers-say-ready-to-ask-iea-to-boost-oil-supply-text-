Following is the text of a Group of
Seven finance ministers statement on  oil prices  and the global
economy.  “We remain vigilant of the risks to the global economy. In this
context and mindful of the substantial risks posed by elevated
oil prices, we are monitoring the situation in oil markets
closely. The current rise in oil prices reflects geopolitical
concerns and certain supply disruptions. We encourage oil-
producing countries to increase their output to meet demand,
while drawing prudently on excess capacity, and welcome Saudi
Arabia’s commitment in Los Cabos to mobilize, as necessary,
existing spare capacity to ensure adequate supply. We stand
ready to call upon the  International Energy Agency  to take
appropriate action to ensure that the market is fully and timely
supplied. We remain committed to well-functioning and
transparent energy markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
