General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S.
automaker, aims to double the 2010 sales of its Cadillac luxury
brand within two years,  Don Butler , the brand’s vice president
for marketing, said today.  GM sold 146,925 Cadillac cars and sport-utility vehicles in
2010, according to Autodata Corp., an industry researcher. The
leader that year was  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus with 229,329
deliveries. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s namesake BMW brand led
last year with 247,907 sales.  Cadillac, which last ranked as the top-selling U.S. luxury
brand in 1997, aims to compete for the title again, Butler told
reporters in Birmingham, Michigan. Detroit-based GM’s brand can
gain market share with new models, such as the ATS compact
sedan, he said. That car is one of 10 new or refreshed models
the brand will introduce over three years.  “We have a track record of success when it comes to new
products,” Butler said referring to vehicles such as the SRX
sport-utility vehicle and CTS car models.  GM will show redesigned CTS and Escalade SUV models in the
next year, Butler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
