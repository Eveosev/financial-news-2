Egypt  sold 513 million euros of one-
year treasury bills in the first offering of euro-denominated
domestic debt, exceeding its goal of 400 million euros,
according to an e-mailed statement from the central bank.  The country sold the notes at an average yield of 3.245
percent, according to the statement. That compares with the 3.05
percent average forecast of nine fixed-income traders and
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Foreign investors bought 20
percent of the amount sold, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
