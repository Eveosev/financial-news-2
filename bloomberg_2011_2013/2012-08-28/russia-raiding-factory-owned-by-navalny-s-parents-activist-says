Alexey Navalny, an anti-corruption
activist who helped organize mass protests against President
 Vladimir Putin ,  said  Russian investigators are raiding a willow-
weaving  factory  owned by his parents near Moscow.  The Investigative Committee is searching for documents and
evidence linked to an embezzlement case against Navalny,
according to comments published on his Twitter Inc.  account 
today. The law-enforcement  agency ’s press service official
confirmed that a search was carried out in connection with the
charges against Navalny, declining to comment further and asking
not to be named in line with policy.  Navalny faces as many as 10 years in jail after the
Investigative Committee increased the severity of the charges
against him on July 31, accusing him of defrauding a state
timber company of 16 million rubles ($499,000) in the Kirov
region. Navalny, 36, previously risked a maximum sentence of
five years for causing a 1.3 million-ruble loss to the firm.  Putin, who returned to the presidency for his third term in
May, has responded to the largest demonstrations of his 12-year
rule by tightening controls over the Internet and prosecuting
opposition activists and leaders. After the accusations were
leveled against Navalny last month, the activist was barred from
leaving  Russia  by investigators, who said that two more people
linked to the case will soon be charged. The accusations are
“astonishing,” Navalny has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
