Clashes between Peruvian police and
growers opposing the governmentâ€™s coca-eradication program left
five people dead, Radio Programas  reported .  As many as 18 people were injured during the unrest, Luis
Picon, the president of Huanuco, a jungle region in the center
of the country, told the Lima-based radio station. Coca
eradication in the area should be suspended to avoid further
bloodshed, Picon said according to Radio Programas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
