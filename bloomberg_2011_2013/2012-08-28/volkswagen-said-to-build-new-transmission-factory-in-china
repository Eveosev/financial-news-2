Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe â€™s largest
carmaker, will build a transmission plant in the Chinese city of
Tianjin to expand capacity in its biggest market, a person
familiar with the matter said.  The new manufacturing facility, which will start production
in 2014, will cost 300 million euros ($377 million) and create
1,500 jobs, the person said, who asked not to be identified
because the carmaker has not yet made an official announcement.
A company spokesman declined to comment.  The German manufacturer produces more than 20 models in
China for its VW, Skoda and Audi brands. The Wolfsburg, Germany-
based automaker plans to invest 14 billion euros on Chinese
production and models by 2016. VW sold 2.6 million vehicles in
the Asia-Pacific region last year.  VW already runs 11 auto factories in  China , with four
plants currently being set up.  German newspaper  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported
earlier today the China transmission plant investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
