Indonesia  plans to sign an agreement
to import rice from  Cambodia  if needed to supplement
domestically produced supply, Iman Pambagyo, director general of
international trade cooperation at the Trade Ministry, today.  “The agreement will be similar with the ones Indonesia has
with Thailand and Vietnam”, he said, without providing further
details. Thailand and Vietnam agreed to supply rice to Indonesia
when needed, he added.  Indonesia, which was self-sufficient in rice in 2008 and
2009, turned to imports the next year after stockpiles fell and
output failed to meet targets.  Indonesia doesn’t need to import rice this year because
stock levels are adequate, Trade Minister  Gita Wirjawan  said on
Aug 14.  Indonesia’s buffer stock amounts to 2.2 million tons to 2.3
million tons, which is enough for the year, Wirjawan said. The
stock levels are reviewed every month, he said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
