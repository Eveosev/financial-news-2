Apple (AAPL)  Inc.’s court victory over Samsung Electronics Co. may provide another milestone for share outperformance relative to its South Korean competitor, along with  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   The CHART OF THE DAY shows the market capitalization of the Cupertino, California-based company compared with weekly totals for Samsung, Google and Microsoft since 2001. Apple surpassed Samsung after unveiling the iPhone in 2007, and overtook Google and Microsoft separately in 2010, when the iPad tablet computer was released. Apple extended its lead since January after posting record profit, with its value on Aug. 27 about $480 billion higher than Samsung, $414 billion above Google and $376 billion more than Microsoft, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Samsung was ordered Aug. 24 to pay Apple about $1 billion after a jury found the Suwon, South Korea-based company infringed six of seven patents at stake in the trial. Apple, which may release its newest iPhone as early as next month, is seeking a U.S. sales ban on eight models of Samsung smartphones. Samsung shares fell 7.5 percent in Seoul on Aug. 27, while Apple rose 1.9 percent to its highest ever in the U.S.  “Apple is expected to make all-out efforts to stop sales of Samsung’s smartphones and tablet computers,” Shin Hyun Joon, an analyst at Dongbu Securities Co., wrote in a note dated Aug. 27. “Samsung’s stock will likely continue struggling,” with the California jury ruling heightening concern about the Korean company’s position before the iPhone 5 release, Shin said.  Apple will unveil the new model on Sept. 12, two people with knowledge of the company’s plans said last month. Apple also intends to introduce a smaller, cheaper iPad this year, people familiar with the plans said in July. The iPhone and iPad contributed more than 60 percent of  revenue  in the latest fiscal year, compared with 7 percent from the iPod music player.  Apple’s world-leading market capitalization exceeded No. 2 Exxon Mobil Corp. by more than $200 billion on Aug. 27. Microsoft was next at $257.3 billion, 58 percent less than the software company’s peak on Dec. 27, 1999. Samsung shares plunged 16 percent through Aug. 27 from their record high reached on May 2. The company is among the top 30.
