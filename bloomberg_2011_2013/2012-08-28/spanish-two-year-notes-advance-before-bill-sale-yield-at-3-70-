Spanish two-year notes advanced for
the first time in five days before the nation sells as much as
3.5 billion euros of 84- and 168-day bills today.  Spain â€™s two-year rate was four basis points lower at 3.70
percent as of 9:20 a.m. London time. The yield on similar-
maturitiy Italian notes was little changed at 3.13 percent
before the nation auctions zero-coupon and inflation-linked
securities.  Spain sold 84-day securities on July 24 at an average yield
of 2.434 percent, and 175-day debt the same day at 3.691
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
