South Korea’s won dropped to a four-
week low before the  Bank of Korea  releases minutes today of its
July policy meeting, which resulted in a surprise interest-rate
cut.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The won slid 0.2 percent to 1,137.55 per dollar as of 10:01
a.m. in Seoul, the lowest level since July 30, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency pared losses yesterday after
Moody’s Investors Service raised South Korea’s debt rating one
step to Aa3, the fourth-highest grade.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will deliver a
speech on Aug. 31 in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming that may shed light
on the possibility of further monetary easing in the world’s
biggest economy. A third round of bond purchases that boost the
supply of dollars may spur demand for higher-yielding assets
outside of the U.S. and Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo in
June called for global cooperation on reducing risks posed by
central-bank easing.  “All currency investors are waiting for comments by
Bernanke this week, and we’re unlikely to see strong one-sided
bets,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency dealer for
 Industrial Bank of Korea. (024110)  “In Korea, we may see exporters
selling the dollar as the end of the month nears.”  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 28 basis
points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 7.61 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 held at 2.91 percent, the lowest in almost three weeks,
Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt futures slid
0.02 to 106.11 and the one-year interest-rate swap was steady at
2.89 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
