South Korean  lenders’ capital
adequacy ratio as measured by Bank for International Settlements
standards declined for a fourth straight quarter as riskier
loans increased.  Reserves against assets at risk under so-called Basel II
rules retreated to 13.83 percent on a preliminary basis as of
June from 13.88 percent three months earlier, the  Financial
Supervisory Service  said in an e-mailed statement.  Banks’ non-performing loan ratio for households rose to
almost a six-year high in the second quarter as South Korea’s
slowing economy weighed on property values. Regulators are
urging local lenders to maintain their buffers as uncertainty
around Europe’s crisis persists and banks prepare to adopt
stricter Basel III rules next year.  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s South Korean unit posted the highest BIS
ratio of 16.79 percent, followed by 15.57 percent at  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s local subsidiary, according to the statement.
The levels for all 18 banks were above the regulator’s 10
percent guideline, the FSS said.  The average Tier 1 ratio slipped to 11.02 percent from
11.05 percent at the end of March, the regulator said.  South Korean banks must report their capital adequacy under
Basel III rules starting next year, while bank holding companies
will shift starting in 2014, the regulator said on Aug. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
