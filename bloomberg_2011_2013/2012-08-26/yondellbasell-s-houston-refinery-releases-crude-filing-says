LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ’s
Houston refinery discharged an unknown amount of crude oil from
a pipeline, a filing with the  National Response Center  showed.  The crude was released at 3:12 p.m. local time yesterday
and lasted about 26 minutes, according to the filing. The cause
was unknown.  U.S. refineries must notify the center if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News  couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
