An attack by unidentified gunmen on
a military checkpoint in southern  Ivory Coast  left four people
dead, including one civilian, a government official said.  Four armed men in a car carried out the attack yesterday in
Irobo, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Abidjan, the
commercial capital, Paul Koffi Koffi, the minister delegate for
defense, said by phone today.  One soldier, two assailants and a civilian hit by a stray
bullet were killed in a subsequent gunfight, he said, adding
that troops were searching the area. The assailants may be part
of the “same group” that carried out an attack on a military
checkpoint in the southern town of Dabou last week that left one
civilian dead, Koffi Koffi said.  Ivory Coast has faced a series of attacks on military
targets since the beginning of August. As many as 10 soldiers
were killed earlier this month in Abidjan in attacks against a
police station, an army checkpoint and a military base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
