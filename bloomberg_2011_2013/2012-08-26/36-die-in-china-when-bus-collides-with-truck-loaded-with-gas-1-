A tanker truck carrying methanol
collided with a bus full of passengers in northwest  China ,
killing 36 people and prompting a government investigation.  The double-decker sleeper bus burst into flame after
slamming into the truck on a highway at 2 a.m., the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said, citing local police. Three people on
the bus survived the crash, while the two people in the tanker
were unhurt and have been taken into custody, it said.  Mishandling of disasters by local authorities has sparked
public discontent in China in recent years. Last year, criticism
of the government spread on microblogs after two high-speed
trains collided in Wenzhou, killing 40 people. A bus crash in
 Gansu province  in November killed 21 people, mostly children.  The bus that crashed today was traveling from the city of
Hohhot to Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi province, according to
the report. The State Council, China’s Cabinet, will investigate
the accident and guide local authorities in rescue work, Xinhua
said.  Also today, ten people were killed and two were hurt when a
van crashed into a truck in southwest China, Xinhua said, citing
local authorities.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Aipeng Soo in
