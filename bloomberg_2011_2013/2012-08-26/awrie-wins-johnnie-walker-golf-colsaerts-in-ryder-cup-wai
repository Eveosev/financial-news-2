Paul Lawrie  won the Johnnie Walker
Championship on golf’s European Tour by four shots for his
second victory this year, while Nicolas Colsaerts missed out on
a chance to guarantee a Ryder Cup spot.  Lawrie finished at 16-under-par 272 after shooting 4-under
in today’s final round at Gleneagles in Perthshire, Scotland.  Australia’s Brett Rumford finished second at 12-under, with
Sweden’s Fredrik Andersson Hed, Maarten Lafeber of the
Netherlands and France’s Romain Wattel another shot back.  Belgium’s Colsaerts needed a top-two finish to edge Martin Kaymer of Germany for the last automatic Ryder Cup spot.
Colsaerts was 19th and must now wait to see if he is given one
of two wildcards by captain Jose Maria Olazabal tomorrow.  Europe faces the U.S. in this year’s Ryder Cup at Medinah
Country Club outside Chicago on  Sept. 28-30 . Europe won the last
edition in 2010 by one point.  Scotland’s Lawrie won three and tied one of his five
matches in his only prior appearance at the Ryder Cup in 1999,
the year he won the British Open.  Rory McIlroy, Luke Donald,  Lee Westwood ,  Justin Rose ,
Graeme McDowell,  Francesco Molinari , Sergio Garcia and Peter Hanson are the other players assured of selection for the
European team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
