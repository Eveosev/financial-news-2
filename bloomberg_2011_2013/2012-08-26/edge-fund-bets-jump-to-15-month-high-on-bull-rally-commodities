Hedge funds  boosted bets on rising
commodities to the highest in 15 months, driving prices into a
 bull market  as the U.S. drought worsened and the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it may take more steps to spur economic growth.  Money managers’ net-long  position  across 18 U.S. raw
materials rose 10 percent to 1.32 million futures and options in
the week ended Aug. 21, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Holdings doubled in two months to the
highest since May 2011. Bets on corn are the most bullish in 15
months amid the worst U.S. drought in 56 years, while wagers on
gold rebounded and platinum more than doubled.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
ended the week up 20 percent from a June low, the common
definition of a bull market. Minutes of the Fed’s last meeting,
released Aug. 22, showed many policy makers favored “additional
monetary accommodation” soon unless growth strengthens.
Purchases of new U.S. homes rose more than forecast in July,
matching a two-year high. People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou
Xiaochuan  said Aug. 23 that stimulus measures “can’t be ruled
out” in the world’s second-largest economy.  “The economic situation globally has improved,” said
Adrian Day, the president of Adrian Day Asset Management in
Annapolis,  Maryland . “You have global growth, and prospects for
added stimulus, and that’s good for commodities.”  Extending Rally  The S&P GSCI gained 0.4 percent last week, the fourth
consecutive weekly gain, after touching a three-month high Aug.
23. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities slid 0.4
percent, and the dollar lost 1.2 percent against a measure of
six major trading partners. Treasuries gained 0.7 percent, a
Bank of America Corp. index showed. The GSCI commodity index
fell 0.5 percent today as of 3:24 p.m. in  New York .  Fifteen commodities tracked by the gauge rose last week,
led by metals and soybeans. Silver futures jumped 9.3 percent,
the biggest weekly gain since October, and gold’s 3.3 percent
rally was the most since January. Bullion holdings in exchange-
traded products backed by the precious metal rose to a  record 
four times last week, reaching 2,448.64 metric tons on Aug. 24,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Evidence that the Fed stands ready to deliver additional
growth measures “should be very good for markets,”  Warren Hogan , the chief economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview Aug. 23.
Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report the same day that
increased expectations for so-called quantitative easing by
central banks will boost prices.  ‘Crazy Low’  Further easing in the U.S. isn’t a good idea because
 interest rates  are already “crazy low,” said  Jack Ablin , who
helps oversee about $60 billion of assets as chief investment
officer of BMO Harris Private Bank in  Chicago . Stimulus measures
“should be off the table,” he said. “The super-cycle for
commodities is going to flatline.”  The peak of the resources boom will probably be within one
to two years,  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens 
told a parliamentary committee in Canberra on Aug. 24.  The S&P 500 Index of U.S. equities fell 0.8 percent on Aug.
23 after the government reported that the number of Americans
filing applications for  unemployment benefits  climbed to a one-
month high, showing little progress in the labor market. Jobless
claims rose by 4,000 for a second week to reach 372,000 in the
period ended Aug. 18, Labor Department figures showed. The
median of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 365,000.  Adding Commodities  Investors added $1.47 billion to commodity funds in the
week ended Aug. 22, the third inflow of money in the past four
weeks, according to data from Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
EPFR Global. Precious metals including gold, silver, platinum
and palladium accounted for $1.26 billion of the inflows, said
 Cameron Brandt , the director of research.  “I interpret that as meaning the Fed will come through for
some” with regard to the “long-anticipated QE3,” said  Brad Durham , a managing director for EPFR.  Bank of China’s Zhou said Aug. 23 that adjustments to
borrowing costs and lenders’ reserve requirements are possible.
The central bank lowered interest rates in June and July for the
first time since 2008 and made three cuts in banks’ reserve
requirements starting in November. China is the world’s biggest
consumer of everything from copper to pork to soybeans, and the
U.S. is the largest user of crude oil and corn.  Gold Bulls  Speculator holdings in gold futures and options jumped 35
percent in the week ended Aug. 22, the first increase in three
weeks, to 110,623 contracts, the most since May 1, CFTC data
show. Traders were the most bullish in nine months, with 29 of
35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expecting prices to rise this
week. Three were bearish, and three were neutral, making the
proportion of bulls the highest since Nov. 11.  Investors bought 53.26 metric tons of the precious metal
valued at about $2.77 billion through  gold-backed  exchange-
traded products this month, the most since November, overtaking
 France  as the world’s fourth-largest hoard when compared with
national reserves.  Bullish platinum wagers more than doubled to 15,365
contracts, CFTC data show. Prices rallied 5.5 percent last week,
the most since January, on concern that clashes between police
and striking miners will spread in South Africa, the biggest
producer of the metal. Police killed 34 striking workers at
Lonmin Plc’s Marikana mine Aug. 16.  Oil Bets  Investors raised bullish oil bets by 18 percent to 179,526
contracts, the most since early May, CFTC data show. Prices
advanced 0.1 percent last week to $96.15 a barrel in New York,
the fourth consecutive gain, amid speculation that European
leaders will make progress in resolving the debt crisis and
central banks will spur economic growth. The commodity touched a
15-week high of $98.29 on Aug. 23, and gained 0.9 percent today
to $97.04, as Tropical Storm Isaac strengthened, crimping output
in the  Gulf of Mexico .  A  measure  of 11 U.S. farm goods showed speculators
increased bullish bets in agricultural commodities by 7.1
percent to an 11-month high of 912,186 contracts, the 10th gain
in 11 weeks.  Money managers raised corn holdings by 13 percent to
342,893 contracts, the most since the end of April 2011. Wagers
have increased for 11 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch of
gains since at least June 2006, when the data starts.  Corn surged 60 percent since June 15, reaching a record
$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10, as the drought parched millions of
acres. Soybeans gained 33 percent since mid-June and reached a
record $17.605 a bushel today.  Crop Yields  Yields from this year’s corn harvest probably will drop to
120.25 bushels an acre, down 18 percent from 2011 and less than
forecast Aug. 10 by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , the
Professional Farmers of America said Aug. 24 after a weeklong
sampling of fields in seven states. Soybean growers may harvest
34.8 bushels an acre, down 16 percent, the farmers said.  “The stage is set for commodities to continue higher,”
said Jason Votruba, the co-manager for small-cap equities at
Scout Investment Advisors in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , which
manages about $22 billion of assets. “If we get more stimulus
in the U.S., that’s going to be bullish.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
