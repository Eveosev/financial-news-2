Libya ’s interior minister resigned
after legislators criticized him following a series of
demolitions of shrines and a library by unknown attackers over
the past few days.  Fawzi Abdel-Aal’s resignation was announced today by
Ibrahim el-Sharkasiya, a senior official with the country’s
higher security committee.  Abdel-Aal came under criticism from the newly-seated
legislature after attackers demolished a Sufi Muslim shrine and
mosque in the capital, Tripoli, yesterday.  Another shrine and a library were razed a day earlier,
underscoring continuing instability and violence in the country
almost a year after former dictator  Muammar Qaddafi  was ousted
from power and killed in a bloody uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
