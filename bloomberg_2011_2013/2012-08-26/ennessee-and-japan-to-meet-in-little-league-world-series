Brock Myers hit a two-run double in
the seventh inning to give Goodlettsville, Tennessee the go-
ahead runs in a 24-16 victory over Petaluma, California to
advance to the  Little League World Series  in South Williamsport,
Pennsylvania.  Tennessee’s Lorenzo Butler had the biggest day at the plate,
setting a single-game record with nine RBIs and tying a record
with three, three-run home runs.  Meanwhile, Japan hit five home runs, including two from 13-
year-old Kotaro Kiyomiya, to beat Aguadulce, Panama for the
international championship.  Kiyomiya stands 6 feet (183 centimeters) tall and is known
for his power. Fans hold what’s known as a “Kotaro Target”
with a red bull’s-eye behind the right field wall.  Japan has won the international bracket five times in the
past seven years, but only captured the championship once during
that span, in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
