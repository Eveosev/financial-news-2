The Seattle Seahawks terminated the
contract of 38-year-old receiver  Terrell Owens  and agreed on a
trade to send quarterback  Tarvaris Jackson  to the Buffalo Bills.  Owens has been seeking a return to the National Football
League after missing last season while recovering from knee
surgery. He was among three vested veterans cut yesterday, while
the Seahawks said they also waived nine other players.  Owens, a five-time All-Pro, ranks second to Jerry Rice in
NFL history with 15,934 yards receiving. Owens is tied with
Randy Moss behind Rice for the NFL’s second-most touchdown
catches with 153 and is sixth with 1,078 career receptions.  The Seahawks are close to completing a trade that will send
Jackson, their starting quarterback from last season, to the
Bills, coach  Pete Carroll  said last night during a conference
call without disclosing specifics.  Jackson became expendable in Seattle after the Seahawks
acquired  Matt Flynn  in free agency and drafted Russell Wilson in
the third round. Carroll said last night that Wilson will be the
Seahawks’ starter for the Sept. 9 regular-season opener against
the Arizona Cardinals with Flynn as the backup.  Jackson, who passed for 3,091 yards and 14 touchdowns last
season, will probably compete with Vince Young and Tyler Thigpen
as the backup to Bills starter Ryan Fitzpatrick.  “Because of our situation and the opportunity with the
guys that we have, he deserves a chance to be playing,” Carroll
said of Jackson. “Buffalo came after him and I hope it’s a good
thing for him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
