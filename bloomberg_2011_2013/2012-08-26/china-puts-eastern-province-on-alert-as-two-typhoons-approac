China  put the  eastern province  of
Zhejiang on alert as two typhoons approach the coast, bringing
strong winds and heavy rains, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.  The State Oceanic Administration warned of high seas along
the eastern coast and issued an orange alert, the second-highest
level of its four-color warning system, Xinhua said.  Typhoon Bolaven, the 15th named storm of the 2012 Pacific
typhoon season, is heading northwest at 15 to 20 kilometers an
hour (9-12 mph) and is forecast to reach the East China Sea
later today, Xinhua said, citing the National Meteorological
Center.  Bolaven was located over the northwestern Pacific Ocean
yesterday, 1,064 kilometers southeast of Zhejiang, Xinhua said.
The provincial weather bureau forecast strong winds and heavy
rains in Zhejiang from today until Aug. 28, Xinhua said.  Tembin, the yearâ€™s 14th named typhoon, which was 200
kilometers southeast between Guangdong and Fujian provinces
early yesterday, will affect northeastern areas of the  South
China Sea  in the next two days, Xinhua said.  The meteorological center has forecast moderate to heavy
rains in the central and western parts of a region along the
Yellow and Huaihe rivers, as well as the southeastern part of
north China in the next two days, Xinhua said.  Southeastern Fujian province yesterday recalled all its
fishing boats to shore as Tembin approached the coast carrying
winds as strong as 87 kilometers an hour (54 miles per hour).  Tembin hit  Taiwan  on Aug. 24, forcing Taiwanese authorities
to evacuate 4,800 people and close schools.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
