Sergio Garcia  of Spain leads
American  Nick Watney  by two strokes heading into the final round
of the U.S. PGA Tour’s  The Barclays  tournament at the Bethpage
Black course in Farmingdale, New York.  Garcia, is 10-under 203, two ahead of Watney and three
ahead of Kevin Stadler.  Tiger Woods , who leads the  FedExCup
standings , is tied with several players in 10th place at 4-under
209.  The Barclays tournament is the first in the four-event
FedExCup playoff, which features a $10 million bonus for the
champion. The field will be trimmed to the top 100 golfers in
the point standings heading into next week’s event.  Garcia made no bogeys over his final eight holes and shot a
2-under 69 in the third round. Watney made  five putts  of more
than 15 feet, but on the 18th hole his ball rolled long and he
had his only three-putt of the round, bringing him to an even-
par 71 for the day.  In search of his third career title at The Barclays, Garcia
converted a two-stroke, 54-hold lead into victory in 2001 and
overcame a four-stroke deficit to win in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
