BHP Billiton Ltd. said today that it
is evacuating its Shenzi and Neptune operations in the Southern
Green Canyon area of the  Gulf of Mexico  because of the approach
of Tropical Storm Isaac.  “We will continue to monitor the progress of the storm in
order to remobilize our offshore teams as soon as the conditions
allow us,” said Victor M. Cock, a company spokesman, in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
