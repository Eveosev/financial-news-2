Egypt  agreed last week to export
2,455 metric tons of cotton in the week through August 23, the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association said.  The country has shipped 88,814 tons of the fiber, valued at
$275.3 million, since the marketing year began on Sept. 1, the
association said today in a weekly bulletin. Of last week’s
agreed sales, 433 tons were of the Giza 88 variety and 2,022
tons were of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
