Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
said his meetings last week with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
and French President Francois Hollande allowed the country to
slowly start to reverse negative views of the nation,  ERT 
reported.  Samaras said it’s very important for Greece to remain in
the euro area and that’s what the country is fighting for, the
state-run broadcaster cited Samaras as saying in an interview
with its NET FM radio station. Samaras also met with Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  as part of a series of talks
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
