The  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , the
single largest entry point for crude coming into the U.S., plans
to suspend offloading oil tankers tomorrow afternoon as Tropical
Storm Isaac moves through the Gulf of Mexico.  “Tomorrow afternoon, we think that conditions will
deteriorate enough that we will have to shut down marine
operations,” Barb Hestermann, a spokeswoman for the port, said
by phone yesterday. “Our oil is stored in caverns and tanks
onshore, so we’ll be continuing to make deliveries to customers,
but we’ll stop offloading tankers.”  Between 900,000 and 1 million barrels of oil a day is
offloaded at the LOOP, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
