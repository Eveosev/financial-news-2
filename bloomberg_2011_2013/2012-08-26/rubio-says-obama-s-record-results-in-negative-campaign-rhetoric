President  Barack Obama  is resorting
to negative rhetoric in his political campaign because he
doesn’t have a record of achievements to run on, Senator Marco Rubio said.  “Barack Obama can’t run by saying, ‘Vote for me because
things have gotten better,’” Rubio, a Florida Republican, said
in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” according to a
transcript. “I think you’re going to see more and more of this
type of rhetoric on his behalf.”  Rubio was responding to a question about Obama’s interview
with the Associated Press yesterday, in which the president said
 Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
has ascribed to “extreme positions” taken by some members of
the party. Republicans are seeking to gain an edge over the
president as they prepare for their national political
convention, which begins in Tampa, Florida, this week.  “He can’t run on his record,” Rubio said of Obama. “He
can’t look at the American people with a straight face and say,
‘You are better off today than you were four years ago.’”  Rubio said that Romney and Representative Paul Ryan of
Wisconsin, the party’s presumptive vice presidential nominee,
have a plan to ensure that Medicare doesn’t run out of money.  The election in November will set a course for the future
direction of the U.S., Rubio said.  “We’re not just voting for the person we like more,” he
said. “We are also voting for two very different directions for
our country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
