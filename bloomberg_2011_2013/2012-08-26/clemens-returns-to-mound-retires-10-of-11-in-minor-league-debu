Roger Clemens  returned to
professional baseball tonight, retiring 10 of 11 Bridgeport
Bluefish batters in 3 1/3 innings for the  Sugar Land Skeeters  of
the independent Atlantic League.  Clemens, 50, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner who last
pitched for the  New York  Yankees in 2007, threw 24 of his 37
pitches for strikes and hit 88 miles an hour with his fastball.  An 11-time All-Star, Clemens started the game by striking
out former major leaguers Joey Gathright and Prentice Redman in
the first inning.  He gave up a two-out single to James Simmons in the top of
the second, and retired the side in the third. After Luis
Figueroa flied out to left field in the fourth, Skeeters manager
Gary Gaetti, a former major league player himself, pulled
Clemens from the game.  Clemens in June was acquitted of charges he lied to
Congress in denying use of performance-enhancing drugs. A
federal jury of eight women and four men in  Washington  acquitted
Clemens of all six counts he faced.  The player has denied using steroids and human-growth
hormone since a 2007 report by former U.S. Senator  George
Mitchell  accused him of using the drugs in 1998, 2000 and 2001.  Clemens hasnâ€™t committed to playing more than one game with
the Skeeters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
