A team from  Japan  captured the
 Little League World Series  baseball title for the second time in
three years as Noriatsu  Osaka  hit three home runs in a 12-2
victory over Goodlettsville, Tennessee.  Osaka also had a triple and drove in four runs as the All-
Star team from Kitasuna Little League in Tokyo scored in all
five innings yesterday in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.  It’s the eighth Little League World Series title for Japan
and the second for the Kitasuna All-Stars, who also won a world
championship in 2001 by beating a team from Apopka,  Florida .  “I just told them to play as usual,” manager Yoichi Kubo,
who also led the 2001 team, said yesterday through an
interpreter, according to  Little League ’s website. “I tried to
manage as usual, too. I didn’t want to change a thing.”  Osaka, Japan’s leadoff hitter, drove in four runs while
Yuta Ishida and Rintaro Hirano each had three runs batted in.
Starting pitcher Kotaro Kiyomiya allowed one hit and one run
over four innings with eight strikeouts.  Brock Meyers and Lorenzo Butler hit solo homers for
Tennessee, which two days ago defeated Petaluma, California,
24-16 in the U.S. championship game.  “We’ll be remembered more for that game,” Tennessee
manager Joey Hale said. “They showed a lot of heart, character
and determination, and I couldn’t be more proud of them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
