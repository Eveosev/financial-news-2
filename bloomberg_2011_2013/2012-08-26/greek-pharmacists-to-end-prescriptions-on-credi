The  Pan-Hellenic Pharmaceutical
Association , which represents  Greece ’s 12,000 pharmacies, said
its members will no longer supply drugs prescribed by the
country’s National Organization for Health Care Provision
without immediate payment in cash starting Sept. 1.  Pharmacists called on the organization, Greece’s largest
state-run health care provider known as  Eopyy , to pay
outstanding debts of more than 85 days. They also want the
government to immediately start financing Eopyy with an amount
equal to 0.6 percent of gross domestic product as well as to
guarantee bank loans taken by pharmacists, the association said
late yesterday in a  statement  on its website.  Eopyy has only made part payment to pharmacists for
providing medicines in May and hasn’t paid for any prescription
drugs since June, the association said Aug. 8. Eopyy still owes
money from 2011 at a time when international drug companies no
longer offer credit to Greek pharmacists, the association said
at the time. It didn’t give a figure for the total debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
