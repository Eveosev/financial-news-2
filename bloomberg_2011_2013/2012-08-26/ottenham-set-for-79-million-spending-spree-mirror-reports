Tottenham is set to spend up to 50
million pounds ($79 million) on players before the transfer
window shuts at the end of next week, the Sunday Mirror
 reported .   The Premier League soccer club has made enquiries about
more than 10 players and plans to sign at least three, the
newspaper said, without citing anyone.   Tottenham is in talks with Shakhtar Donetsk over midfielder
Willian and is set to bid for Fulham’s Moussa Dembele if Porto
won’t reduce its 25 million-pound valuation for Joao Moutinho,
the Mirror said. Chelsea’s Raul Meireles and Rennes’s Yann
M’Vila are among other midfield options, the newspaper added.  The club also wants to sign a goalkeeper, with Hugo Lloris
of Lyon and Roma’s Maarten Stekelenburg both targets, the Mirror
reported. A striker will be signed if Jermain Defoe can be sold,
the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
