An anthrax outbreak in a Siberian
village left one person dead and 10 others hospitalized as the
Russian government declared a state of emergency in the area in
a bid to prevent an epidemic.  There were at least two other confirmed cases of anthrax
infection in the village of Druzhba in the Altai region, state-
run Rossiya 24 television reported, citing unidentified
officials. The death was  reported  in a statement today by the
Moscow-based Emergency Situations Ministry, which didn’t say
whether it was caused by anthrax.  Roads around the village have been closed off, Yevgenia
Belikova, a spokeswoman for investigators in Altai, said in
comments broadcast on Rossiya 24. Veterinary officials killed
several heads of cattle infected with anthrax and vaccinated
another 187, as well as 21 horses and pigs, the Altai region’s
press office said on its website.  The anthrax outbreak is “under control and localized,”
Deputy Governor Daniil Bessarabov said in the statement.  The anthrax bacteria, known as Bacillus anthracis, occurs
most commonly in cattle, sheep and goats and can be lethal to
humans. The bacteria, which can cause skin infections and more
severe lung infections, may survive in soil decades after an
outbreak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
