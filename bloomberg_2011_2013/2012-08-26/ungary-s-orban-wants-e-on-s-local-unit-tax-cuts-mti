Hungary’s government will buy back
the domestic natural-gas business owned by German utility EON AG
“within seconds,” state news service  MTI  cited Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  as saying late yesterday.  “We bought back Mol shares from the Russians, we partially
bought back the waterworks from the French, we will buy back
E.ON within seconds from the Germans,” Orban said, according to
MTI.  Orban wants to cut personal-income and corporate taxes
further and sees no need to change the direction of economic
policy as it’s the “only viable option,” MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
