Denmark ’s domestic borrowing need
for next year will decline 29 percent as the AAA rated nation
defends its status as a haven from  Europe ’s debt crisis and
reins in its finances.  The domestic borrowing need will fall to 136 billion kroner
($22.8 billion) in 2013 from 191 billion kroner in 2012, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a  statement on its website  late
yesterday. The ministry raised this year’s estimate from a
previous projection of 150 billion kroner. This year’s total
financing need is seen at 224 billion kroner, while next year’s
overall requirement will fall to 161 billion kroner, the
ministry said. The government is due to publish the details of
its budget proposal at 10 a.m. in Copenhagen.  “It’s unlikely that this will have a major effect on
Danish  government bonds  when the market opens,” Jens Peter Soerensen, chief bond analyst at Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s
biggest bank, said in a phone interview. “If you’ve been
targeting Denmark as a safe haven, that trade is intact after
these figures and it seems as though the government is sticking
to its very conservative pattern of steering its finances.”  Denmark, which pays less than  Germany  to borrow, has
charged investors to hold its two-year debt through most of July
and August as the country’s fiscal restraint attracts capital
fleeing the euro area. The government’s deficit will narrow next
year to less than 37 billion kroner, compared with 73.4 billion
kroner in 2012, national broadcaster Danmarks Radio reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  Boosting Workforce  The Social Democrat-led government of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt has said it targets initiatives designed to get
more people into the labor market without stretching the  budget
deficit . Denmark’s Employment Ministry said yesterday it will
spend 1 billion kroner to reduce sick leave and work-related
accidents to help boost the Nordic country’s workforce.  Denmark in June raised its 2012 bond-sale target by 33
percent, taking advantage of demand for its top-rated debt. The
debt management department, a unit of the Copenhagen-based
central bank, said June 21 it will issue 100 billion kroner in
bonds in 2012, up from a goal of 75 billion kroner, after also
funding a “large portion” of the financing needs for 2013 in
the first six months of this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
