(Corrects reference to Akoun in first paragraph to show he
is party’s second-ranking official.)  Laurent Akoun, the second-ranking
official in  Ivory Coast  ex-president Laurent Gbagbo’s opposition
political party, was arrested today, a party spokesman said.  Akoun, the general secretary of the Front Populaire
Ivoirien, was arrested after he attended a rally in Adzope,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Abidjan, the commercial
capital. He has been transferred to the investigation unit of
the nation’s paramilitary forces in Abidjan, party official
Sebastien Dano Djedje said by phone today.  Paul Koffi Koffi, the minister delegate for defense, didn’t
answer a call made to his mobile-phone seeking a comment.  Ivory Coast has faced a series of attacks on military
targets since the beginning of August. As many as 10 soldiers
were killed earlier this month in Abidjan in attacks against a
police station, an army checkpoint and a military base.  Authorities say Gbagbo’s supporters are behind the attacks,
which they say are to destabilize the West African nation. The
country is recovering from a post-election crisis that killed at
least 3,000 people last year.  Gbagbo’s party denies that it’s behind the attacks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
