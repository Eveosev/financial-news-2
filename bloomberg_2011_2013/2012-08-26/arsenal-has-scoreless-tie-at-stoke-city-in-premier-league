Arsenal tied 0-0 at Stoke City
today, its second straight scoreless draw at the start of this
season in soccer’s Premier League.  The Gunners and Stoke, which also tied both of its games
this season, struggled to create chances at the Britannia
Stadium.  “For me we lost two points again today,” Arsenal
midfielder Mikel Arteta told Sky Sports.  In today’s other game, defending champion Manchester City
is at Liverpool.  Arsenal was rarely troubled in defense, but has yet to
score since the sale of Robin van Persie, last season’s top-
scorer with 30 league goals.  Olivier Giroud and  Lukas Podolski , two of Arsenal’s new
attacking signings, both started with Giroud having his best
effort from a long-range lob after 89 minutes which just cleared
the crossbar.  Podolski had an effort early in the first half blocked by
fullback Andy Wilkinson, while Santi Cazorla tested goalkeeper
Asmir Begovic with a 25-yard shot. Abou Diaby failed to score
from close range.  Stoke, the lowest-scoring team in the league last season,
had a goal ruled out on six minutes when  Jonathan Walters  put
the ball into the net but was offside. Walters also had a late
opportunity which he failed to convert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
