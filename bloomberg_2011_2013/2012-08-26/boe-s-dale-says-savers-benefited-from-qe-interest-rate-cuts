Bank of England Chief Economist
 Spencer Dale  said U.K. savers have benefited from the reduction
in the benchmark interest rate to a record low and the central
bank’s bond-buying program because those measures prevented a
deeper economic collapse.  The stimulus also stopped asset prices from falling as much
as they otherwise would have during the recession, protecting
the value of savings and wealth invested in financial assets,
Dale said in an article in The Sunday Telegraph, published in
London today.  Describing some commentary on the impact of quantitative
easing on pensions as “misleading,” he said gains in the value
of assets held in pension funds have offset lower annuity rates.  Dale’s article comes days after the  Bank of England 
published a paper defending QE against criticism that it hurt
savers, saying these costs must be weighed against the economic
benefits. The report was a response to a government request that
the central bank explain the impact of its  bond purchases .  “Our economy today would be in a far worse state without
QE and a  bank rate  at 0.5 percent,” Dale said. “The recession
would have been even deeper, the rise in unemployment even
greater.”  The U.K. is “still laboring under the effects of the
financial crisis,” he said. The task of monetary policy is to
stimulate the economy to return it to a state of stable growth,
low inflation and a “more normal level of  interest rates .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
