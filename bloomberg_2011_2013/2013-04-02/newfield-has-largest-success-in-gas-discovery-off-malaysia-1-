Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX) , the U.S.
oil producer exploring the sale of offshore assets, had what it
called the “largest conventional exploratory success” in its
history with a natural gas discovery off the coast of  Malaysia .  The B-14 well encountered 1,585 feet (483 meters) of net
natural gas in about 250 feet of water 50 miles (80 kilometers)
offshore, The Woodlands, Texas-based company said in a statement
today after the close of regular trading. Newfield operates
Block SK 310 and has a 30 percent interest.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) 
owns 30 percent and Petronas Carigali holds 40 percent, Newfield
said.  Newfield climbed 7.2 percent to $23.70 at 5:58 p.m. in  New
York .  Newfield estimates there are 1.5 trillion to 3 trillion
cubic feet of gas initially in place after its discovery. The
B-14 find is less than three miles from the company’s B-15
discovery, where recoverable reserves are an estimated 265
billion cubic feet and will be developed along with B-14.
Newfield plans further drilling in the region, including at
another prospect in the third quarter.  On Feb. 13, the company said it was exploring strategic
alternatives for international assets, which include offshore
holdings in Malaysia and China. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
leading the process, according to the statement. The company
plans to focus on production onshore in  North America  in such
areas as the Uinta, Cana Woodford, Williston and Eagle Ford
formations.  A data room for international assets is expected to open in
the second quarter, Newfield said today. The company’s full-year
2013 international cash income taxes are expected to be $55
million to $65 million at current  oil prices , Newfield said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
