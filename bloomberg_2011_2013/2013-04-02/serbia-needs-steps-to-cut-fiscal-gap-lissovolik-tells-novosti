Serbia  needs to take additional
steps to narrow its 2013 fiscal deficit to meet the target of
3.6 percent of economic output, Novosti newspaper reported,
citing the International Monetary Fundâ€™s resident representative
Bogdan Lissovolik.  If the Washington-based lender decides to discuss a new
loan with Serbia, talks will focus on a credible, multiyear
fiscal adjustment and steps to overhaul the pension system,
labor market, public companies and improve the business
environment, Novosti quoted Lissovolik as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
