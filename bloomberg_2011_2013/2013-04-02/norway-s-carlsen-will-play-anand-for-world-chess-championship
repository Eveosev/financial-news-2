Magnus Carlsen will challenge
defending champion Vishwanathan Anand of  India  for the World
Chess Federation championship after winning the Candidates’
Tournament in a tiebreaker.  Norway’s Carlsen, ranked the world’s No. 1 chess player by
the federation, won the eight-man tournament in  London  yesterday
because he had more victories than Russia’s Vladimir Kramnik,
who also finished with  8 1/2 points  from 14 rounds. Carlsen and
Kramnik lost their final-round games.  Carlsen, 22, will face Anand in the Nov. 6-26 world
championship at a location that’s yet to be decided. Anand, 43,
has held the title since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
