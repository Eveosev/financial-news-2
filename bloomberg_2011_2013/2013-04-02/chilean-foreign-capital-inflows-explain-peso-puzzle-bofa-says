Chile ’s peso has outperformed
copper, a “puzzle” explained by the nation’s record foreign
capital inflows, according to Bank of America Corp.  The peso has depreciated 0.2 percent since the end of
January while copper, which makes up more than half of Chile’s
exports, has retreated 9.9 percent.  The difference between Chile’s 5 percent target lending
 rate  and borrowing costs in other countries will keep attracting
investors while investment in mining remains strong, Marcos Buscaglia, the chief Latin American economist at Bank of
America, wrote today in a note to clients.  “The main explanation for peso strength in the face of
lower copper prices is that capital inflows have remained at
record levels in recent months,” he wrote.  Bank of America recommends that investors sell Chilean
pesos and buy Mexican pesos because of the risk that the Chilean
central bank may intervene to weaken its currency.  Chile’s central bank board indicated that the benchmark
interest rate will remain unchanged for at least six months as
policy makers reduced their inflation forecasts and raised
economic growth estimates.  The board lowered its 2013 inflation forecast to 2.8
percent from 2.9 percent while boosting its economic growth
estimate to a range of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent from 4.25
percent to 5.25 percent, according to the quarterly monetary
policy report published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
