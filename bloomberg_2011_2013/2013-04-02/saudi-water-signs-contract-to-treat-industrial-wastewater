Saudi Arabia’s National Water Co.
agreed with Jeddah-based  Middle East Paper Co.  to a $27 million
deal to treat 5,000 cubic meters of industrial wastewater a day
for 20 years, according to a  statement  citing the state-owned
company’s chief executive officer, Loay al-Musallam.  Saline Water Conversion Corp. Governor Abdulrahman Al-
Ibrahim meanwhile visited the solar unit project due to start
operating at the end of April that’s to curb energy used in
desalination plants, cutting the costs of producing water
purified from the sea, the state Saudi Press Agency said.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer with the Arab
world’s largest economy, plans to build the biggest desalination
plant in Rabigh on the kingdom’s Red Sea coast. National Water
Co. is planning to spend $66 billion on water projects over the
next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
