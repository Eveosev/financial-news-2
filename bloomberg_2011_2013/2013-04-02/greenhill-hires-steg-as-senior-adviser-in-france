Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the advisory firm
planning to add five to 10 managing directors this year, hired
Jean-Michel Steg as a senior adviser to help the company develop
business with French corporations.  Steg, 59, was previously a senior managing director at
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and opened that firm’s advisory business in
France, New York-based Greenhill said today in a statement. He
earlier was head of French and Belgian banking at  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and ran investment-banking units for both Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in France.  Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 53, said in January that
Greenhill’s and other advisory firms’ results could be
“materially better” if European markets recover the way those
in the U.S. have. In anticipation of a global pickup in deal
activity, Greenhill has been adding managing directors,
including at least seven last year. The firm said last month it
hired Carl-Georg Bauer-Schlichtegroll in London to focus on
European financial companies.  “The euro zone is going through a difficult period and we
could not think of a more qualified person to help us bring our
global capabilities and reach to the attention of French
companies who value independent advice,” David Wyles and Luca Ferrari, co-heads of European corporate advisory, said in
today’s statement.  About $194.6 billion of deals have been announced this year
in Europe, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with $212.7 billion announced during the same period
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
