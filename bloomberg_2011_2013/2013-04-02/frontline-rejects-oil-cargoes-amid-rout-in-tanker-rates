Frontline Ltd., the oil-tanker
operator led by shipping billionaire John Fredriksen, said it’s
rejecting some cargoes after a rout in rates for the vessels.  Frontline is offering tankers for charters “selectively”
and the market is in a “state of panic” as excess ship supply
drives down charter costs, Jens Martin Jensen, chief executive
officer of the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company’s management
unit, said by phone today. Frontline 2012 Ltd., a newer
Fredriksen company, is adopting the same approach, he said.  Earnings for very large crude carriers, the industry’s
biggest ships, plunged 75 percent from a year earlier to $11,624
a day, according to figures from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s
largest shipbroker. A surplus of the supertankers seeking
charters in the Persian Gulf averaged 21 percent during the
first quarter, the largest glut since 2009, according to market
surveys by Bloomberg.  “Crude rates remain in the doldrums,” RS Platou Markets
AS, an Oslo-based investment bank, said by e-mail today. VLCCs
earned $17,000 a day on average in the first quarter, down 32
percent from a year earlier, it said.  Lowest Since 1999  Fredriksen split Frontline Ltd. in two in December 2011,
forming Frontline 2012 to withstand a slump in returns that put
the original company at risk of running out of cash. Frontline
Ltd.’s shares fell to the lowest since May 1999 last month and
slumped 95 percent since the end of 2007. The stock slid 1.5
percent to 12.75 kroner by the close in Oslo trading today.  VLCCs are losing $3,012 daily on the benchmark Saudi
Arabia-to-Japan voyage, figures from the Baltic Exchange in
London showed. That compared with a $29-a-day loss as of March
28, the last time before today rates were updated because of
national holidays. Frontline said in February the ships in its
fleet need a daily return of $24,200 to break even.  The exchange’s earnings assessments don’t account for speed
reductions aimed at reducing fuel consumption, the industry’s
largest expense. Last year’s average price was more than double
the 2008 level, figures compiled by Bloomberg from 25 global
ports show. Today costs increased 1 percent, the most since Feb.
7, to $633.15 a metric ton.  Charter  costs  for VLCCs on the benchmark journey fell 4.3
percent, the most since Jan. 24, to 32.56 industry-standard
Worldscale points, according to the exchange. That means the
ships are earning 32.56 percent of a dollars-a-ton flat rate,
set once a year by the Worldscale Association.  The number of VLCCs seeking Persian Gulf cargoes exceeds
likely shipments over the next 30 days by 22  percent , according
to a Bloomberg survey of five shipbrokers and owners today. That
was the same as last week.  Jensen declined to say how long Frontline has been adopting
the strategy of rejecting some cargoes or in which regions it’s
doing so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
