Gasoline fell a third consecutive
day as refinery maintenance lessened. Crack spreads and calendar
spreads weakened.  May gasoline’s premium to June narrowed 0.66 cent to 1.28
cents a gallon amid speculation that supplies will rise as
spring maintenance ends. The May gasoline crack spread versus
West Texas Intermediate  slipped  $1.39 to $31.80 a barrel and the
premium to Brent  dropped  $1.69 to $17.49. Philadelphia Energy
Solutions restarted units late last week at the largest refinery
along the U.S. East Coast.  “We have more refineries coming out of maintenance and
gasoline is not being helped by technical factors,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a
research company in  London .  Gasoline for May delivery fell 4.75 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $3.0542 a gallon at 10:05 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume on the Nymex was 109 percent above the
100-day average.  Gasoline traded below the 20-day, 30-day and 40-day moving
averages. Prices have fallen 6.5 percent from the 2013 intraday
high of $3.2672 reached on March 11.  “We’re getting more in line with reality,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“You have weaker crude prices, weaker demand and you’re going
to see a lot of production coming online shortly.”  Ultra-low-sulfur-diesel for May delivery rose 1.68 cents to
$3.0855 a gallon on volume that was 36 percent above the 100-day
average 10:09 a.m. ULSD traded at a 3.13-cent premium to
gasoline.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.637 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are 28.8
cents below a year earlier after falling in March for the first
time in 10 years, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
