New Zealand  cricketer Jesse Ryder
has no recollection of the incident that led to his
hospitalization and two men being charged with assault, New
Zealand Police said.  Ryder, 28, was interviewed by police today in the
Christchurch hospital where he’s recovering from the March 28
assault outside a bar in the city. He was yesterday moved out of
the intensive care unit.  “Unfortunately Mr. Ryder has no recollection of what took
place or the events leading up to the incident,” Detective
Senior Sergeant Brian Archer said in an e-mailed statement.
“This is not uncommon when a victim has received a head injury
of this nature.”  Ryder had gone out with Wellington teammates following a
March 27 one-day game in Christchurch and was involved in two
separate altercations outside a bar in the suburb of Merivale,
 New Zealand Police  said last week. Two men, aged 20 and 37, were
charged over the assault and will appear in Christchurch
District Court on April 4.  Ryder came out of an induced coma three days ago and is
talking and breathing without the assistance of a ventilator. He
said in a March 31 statement that he was feeling “heaps
better.”  Ryder, who’s contracted to play for the Delhi Daredevils in
the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition beginning
tomorrow, last played for New Zealand in February 2012 before
being dropped for a breach of team protocol involving an
incident at a bar when he responded to taunts from a patron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
