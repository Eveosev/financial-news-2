The eastern U.S. and southern
Ontario and Quebec may get a burst of warm air by mid-April,  MDA
Weather Services  said.  Average temperatures in the region are expected to climb 5
to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 4 Celsius) above normal from April
12 to 16, according to Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA. In the
Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to North Carolina,
temperatures may rise 8 to 14 degrees above normal.  At the same time, western Canada and the upper Great Plains
may see readings 3 to 4 degrees below normal.  “Models are largely in agreement on the warm pattern,”
MDA said in a note to clients. “Confidence is moderate to high
in the large-scale pattern but still a bit lower in the finer
details.”  The U.S. heating season, when natural gas demand is
heaviest, ended last month. April is the start of a transition
to warmer weather, when more energy is used to cool, rather than
heat, homes.  Until heat builds in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, the
impact of the weather on energy prices is less noticeable. About
50 percent of U.S. households use gas for warmth.  The normal average temperature on April 11 in  New York  City
is 51 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), according to MDA. In
Boston, it’s 47; in Chicago, 47; in Houston, 69; in St. Louis,
56; and in Burbank, California, it’s 62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
