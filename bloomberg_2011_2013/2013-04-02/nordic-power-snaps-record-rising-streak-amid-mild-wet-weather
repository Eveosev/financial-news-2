Nordic electricity fell for the
first time in 13 days, breaking the longest period of gains for
the month-ahead contract since at least 2003, as  weather
forecasts  signaled warmer temperatures.  Power for July through September fell as much as 4.5
percent to 38.65 ($49.70) euros on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s
energy exchange in Oslo, the lowest since March 22. The contract
traded at 38.70 euros at 9:50 a.m. May power lost 3.9 percent to
39 euros a megawatt-hour.  Forecasts today are for wetter weather than was predicted
before a five-day holiday period that started March 28, Danish
energy trading company Scanenergi A/S said today on its website.
The Nordic region gets more than half of its power from
hydroelectric plants.  The amount of water and snow available to generate
electricity in the region may be 23.6 terawatt-hours below
normal for the time of year in two weeks, down from minus 22.6
terawatt-hours today, Markedskraft data on Bloomberg showed.  Temperatures in  Norway  through April 12 will be minus 0.3
degrees Celsius (31.6 degrees Fahrenheit) on average, which is
1.25 degrees warmer than the previous forecast, MetraWeather
data on Bloomberg using the ECMWF model showed. Higher
temperatures limit the demand for electric heating.  Nordic power for delivery around the clock today  costs 
56.38 euros a megawatt-hour on average, following yesterday’s
auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. That’s the
highest since Dec. 12.  Last month’s average price for day-ahead delivery was 45.06
euros a megawatt-hour, up 13 percent from 39.74 euros a
megawatt-hour in February, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
