The U.K. unit of  Cyprus Popular Bank
Pcl (CPB) , known as Laiki Bank, agreed to transfer all its deposits to
 Bank of Cyprus  U.K. after the Mediterranean nation decided to
shut the lender as part of an international bailout.  Laiki Bank U.K. customers will be able to access their
funds “as normal and do not need to do anything,” the  Bank of
England ’s Prudential Regulation Authority said in a statement in
London today. Bank of Cyprus U.K. deposits are insured for as
much as 85,000 pounds ($129,000) per depositor by the British
government, according to the statement.  The government in Cyprus agreed to close Cyprus Popular
Bank, the nation’s second-biggest lender, as part of a 10
billion euro ($13 billion) bailout. Cyprus Popular Bank deposits
of less than 100,000 euros will be absorbed by Bank of Cyprus
and those above that level will be placed in a so-called bad
bank, the Nicosia-based central bank said on March 30.  Laiki Bank mortgages and loans won’t be transferred to Bank
of Cyprus U.K., according to the PRA. Customers should continue
to make repayments on mortgages “as normal,” the authority
said.  Bank of Cyprus  said  in a statement today that 15,000
accounts had been moved, with a combined balance of 270 million
pounds.  “To ensure continuity of service during transition,
holders of transferred deposits can continue to use the branch
services of the Laiki U.K. branch,” Bank of Cyprus said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
