President  Barack Obama  announced a
campaign designed to develop treatments for some of the least
understood brain disorders, a push that could benefit
Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG and Eli Lilly & Co.  The effort, called the BRAIN Initiative, will spend $100
million beginning in 2014 to map the complex interactions
between brain cells and neurological circuits. The goal is to
find treatments for some of the most common brain disorders,
including Alzheimer’s, epilepsy and brain injuries, according to
an administration statement today.  “Ideas are what power our economy,” Obama said today in
the East Room of the White House. “We do innovation better than
anybody else, and that makes our economy stronger.”  The first $100 million will be part of the fiscal
2014 budget coming out April 10, the president said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
