Novartis AG feels stung by the
Indian Supreme Court’s decision this week to  deny patent
protection  to the company’s  Gleevec cancer treatment . Its
spokesmen have gone so far as to threaten to withhold
investments and  even products  from the country.  This reaction may be understandable, given how essential
patents are to the pharmaceutical industry. It’s not realistic
though.  India ’s high court made a decision that makes sense for
India today -- no matter how unfair it might seem to Novartis.
The benefits the country realizes from allowing its generic
drugmakers to market their own versions of Gleevec are far
greater than the penalties Novartis threatens to impose.  The ruling doesn’t mean, however, that world-class drug
companies like Novartis can’t make healthy profits in India. To
do so, they will have to be as innovative with their business
model as they are with their products.  Novartis filed its case in 2006 after Indian authorities
denied its patent application for Gleevec on the grounds that
existing drugs could be patented only if the updated
formulations significantly improved efficacy. According to
Novartis, new Gleevec was safer than original Gleevec. As
Novartis points out, 40 countries have given patent protection
for new Gleevec. But those countries aren’t India.  The vast majority of India’s 1.2 billion people can’t
afford patented drug prices -- for instance, $2,200 for a
month’s supply of Gleevec is 2.3 times the average month’s
income. And India’s generic drug companies are happy to pump out
discounted pills, such as generic Gleevec for $175. This robust,
$26 billion industry also produces generics for the rest of the
developing world, which is a big reason global health advocates
were  thrilled  by the Indian court’s decision.  At this point, rather than try to punish India, Novartis
should accept the reality of the pharmaceutical market there. A
high-price/high-profit model complemented by drug giveaways for
the very poor just won’t work in India, or any other emerging
economy.  What will work? India’s thriving generics market may
suggest an answer. It shows that Indians will pay for drugs,
though not as much as what people pay in Zurich.  Just as pharmaceutical companies worked with global health
advocates to develop tiered pricing for HIV drugs based on
national income, they will need to establish different prices
for income groups within a single, large country, such as India.  This won’t be easy. The companies will need to work closely
with governments to ensure that the elite who can pay patented
prices do so, that the middle class pay less but something, and
that the very poor get a free or almost-free ride.  Pharmaceutical companies complain that this approach is
impossible, that a gray market would drive out anything but the
cheapest price. However, Novartis’s experience with Coartem, its
drug treatment for malaria, suggests otherwise. Novartis sells
the drug two ways to the developing world: to the private market
in nice packaging, for dispensing in drugstores to wealthy
clientele; and to the public sector in blister packets, at a
fraction of the cost, for distribution to the poor.  The growing health insurance system in India will make
tiered pricing easier. About  one in four  people have insurance,
much of it government sponsored, which means Indians in the
middle class can afford patented pharmaceuticals -- as insured
people do the world over, by paying largely indirectly, through
their premiums.  As this insurance system grows, along with India’s entire
economy, the country will become a bigger market for
prescription drugs. By 2020, the pharmaceutical industry  expects 
 emerging markets  to make up 38 percent of revenue.  It’s increasingly clear that, in the short term, patents
won’t guarantee drugmakers’ profits. Before the Novartis
decision, India had begun compelling pharmaceutical companies to
issue licenses to domestic generic companies to make their
patented drugs.  China  amended its law last year to allow Chinese
companies to make low-cost versions of medicines under patent
protection.  In years to come, though, these countries will want to
provide strong patent protection: Their own inventors will need
it, and the cost of lost investment will begin to outweigh the
public health advantages of weak patents. Rather than expect
these countries to play entirely by industry rules now,
companies like Novartis should stick around for that day and
find ways to make a profit in the meantime.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
