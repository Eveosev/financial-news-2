The crime editor at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Sun
tabloid has been cleared of bribery allegations uncovered as
part of a wider police probe into wrongdoing at the company’s
U.K. newspapers.  Mike Sullivan, who was arrested in January 2012, will have
no further action taken against him by police, News Corp.’s U.K.
unit said in a statement. The probe, called Operation Elveden,
has led to more than 60 arrests of journalists at News Corp.’s
U.K. publishing unit, police officers, prison guards and other
public officials.  “After more than a year of uncertainty we are pleased that
Mike can now carry on with his work without this distraction,”
a News International spokesman said in an e-mailed statement.  News Corp.’s publications in the U.K. have been
investigated for phone hacking and bribery since revelations in
2011 that the company’s News of the World tabloid illegally
accessed messages on the mobile phone of a murdered school girl
during the police investigation. News Corp. Chairman  Rupert
Murdoch  closed the News of the World in response to the scandal.  Four former law enforcement officers have been sentenced
for as much as two years for giving information to News Corp.
U.K. journalists in exchange for bribes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
