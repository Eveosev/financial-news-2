Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has
agreed to forfeit part of his salary to show solidarity with
civilian workers who will be forced to take unpaid leave,
Pentagon spokesman  George Little  said today.  The Defense Department plans to put most of its 800,000
civilian workers on unpaid leave for as long as 14 days this
fiscal year because of the automatic budget cuts known as
sequestration. Hagel will give up as much as 14 days of his pay
as a show of support even though he isnâ€™t subject to the
furloughs, Little told reporters at the Pentagon.  Hagel makes about $199,700 a year as a cabinet secretary,
according to a Congressional Research Service report.  The furloughs are likely to begin in mid-June, Little said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
