The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Japan against non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 2.5 basis points to
116.5 as of 9:32 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The gauge, which has ranged from 101 to 148.1 this year,
is on course for its highest close since March 5, CMA data show.
The 50-member index rolled to a new series on March 21, with
contracts on Ricoh Co. and Sumitomo Chemical Co. replacing Sharp
Corp. and Mitsui & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
120 as of 10:53 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The measure dropped last quarter for the third consecutive
period, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 122 basis points
as of 8:57 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark has ranged from 100.5 to 122.3 basis
points since Dec. 31, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
