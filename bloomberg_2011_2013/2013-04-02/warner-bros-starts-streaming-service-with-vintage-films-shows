Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros.
started a subscription streaming  service  featuring vintage TV
shows and films, creating a new player in the online viewing
field led by  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)   The “Adventures of Superman” TV series and the Spencer Tracy picture “Bad Day at Black Rock,” are among the rotating
fare offered by Warner Archive Instant, according to terms
posted on the service’s  website . The Burbank, California-based
studio is offering a two-week free trial and unlimited access
for $9.99 a month.  The titles reach back to films from the 1920s, tapping
content not available through agreements with Netflix, Redbox
Instant by Verizon and Amazon.com Inc. Netflix carries some
newer Warner TV shows. Redbox Instant offers new Warner films
for purchase and on-demand rental.  “These are exceptional, high-quality, deep library titles
that are often not available,” Thomas Gewecke, president of
Warner Bros. Digital Distribution, said in an e-mailed
statement. “It’s a great opportunity to serve customers who are
fans of classic movies and TV shows.”  Consumers can browse Warner Archive Instant titles,
including Lillian Gish’s 1926 silent classic “The Scarlet
Letter,” by decade or genre. Some are available in high-
definition using Roku Inc. set-top boxes, according to the
studio.  Time Warner, also the owner of CNN and HBO, was little
changed at $57.58 at the close in New York. The shares have
gained 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
