Japanese  stocks  fell for a second
day, with the Topix Index closing below 1,000 for the first time
in a month, after data on U.S. manufacturing missed estimates
and the yen rose to a four-week high, damping the earnings
prospects for exporters.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction equipment that gets
about 80 percent of sales overseas, slipped 3.9 percent. Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, dropped 3.1 percent
after  Japan ’s car sales fell by the most in six quarters as
government subsidies ended.  Nikon (7731)  Corp. sank 3.2 percent after
the Nikkei newspaper reported the camera maker’s full-year
operating profit fell 44 percent.  The Topix lost 0.9 percent to close at 991.34, the lowest
since March 5. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1.1 percent to
12,003.43, paring a 2.7 percent decline. Volume was 28 percent
above the 30-day average. The benchmark rallied 39 percent since
Nov. 14 amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe government and
the Bank of Japan will take more steps to beat deflation.  “Market participants are taking a breather following the
recent rally amid extreme expectations the government will boost
efforts to stimulate the Japanese economy,” said  Ayako Sera , a
market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which
manages about $163 billion. “The yen’s depreciation was too
fast so we’re seeing a bit of correction now.”  Shares on the Nikkei 225 traded at 18.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 14.1 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  BOJ Meeting  Futures on the S&P 500 was little changed today. The index
fell 0.5 percent in New York yesterday, retreating from a record
high, as the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
fell to 51.3 in March from 54.2 February, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 54. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between growth and contraction.  Exporters declined as the yen climbed to 92.57 against the
U.S. dollar, the strongest since Feb. 28. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated today that the central bank will do whatever
it can to beat deflation and that it will conduct bold monetary
easing. He spoke in parliament ahead of a two-day policy meeting
that starts tomorrow, his first as governor since taking over
from Masaaki Shirakawa last month.  Komatsu sank 3.9 percent to 2,123 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker
of industrial robots that makes about 76 percent of sales
overseas, slipped 2.3 percent to 14,130 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, dropped 3.4 percent to 3,245 yen.  Carmakers Drop  Carmakers fell after the number of vehicles sold in Japan,
Asia’s second-largest auto market, fell 9.4 percent to 1.53
million last quarter, according to data from the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association.  Toyota, whose domestic sales dropped 15 percent during the
quarter, decreased 3.1 percent to 4,615 yen. Nissan Motor Co.,
Japan’s third-biggest carmaker, slipped 3.5 percent to 856 yen.
Honda Motor Co. fell 2.6 percent to 3,370 yen.  Nikon sank 3.2 percent to 2,152 yen. Operating profit
tumbled 44 percent to about 45 billion yen ($485 million) on
weak camera sales in the U.S. and Europe, the Nikkei newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. That
compares with the 48 billion yen average estimate of 19 analysts
tracked by Bloomberg. The company is scheduled to report annual
results on May 9.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 2.4 percent
to 27.71 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
