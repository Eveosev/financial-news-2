(Corrects time frame of  Japan ’s incentive program in last
paragraph in story originally published April 2.)  A remote island off Sasebo city in
southern Japan has won permission to construct one of Japan’s
biggest solar power plants, the Nagasaki newspaper said.  Construction of a 400-megawatt solar power facility is
aimed at creating new income sources and securing employment of
150 jobs in the island as the population ages and declines, the
newspaper said, citing city council member Hirofumi Oiwa.
Photovolt Development Partners GmbH and other partners will set
up a venture in May to proceed with the project, the paper said.  The island will borrow idled land and construct and operate
the facilities for 20 years with the project costing a total of
100 billion yen ($1.1 billion), the paper said. Electricity will
be supplied to  Kyushu Electric Power Co. (9508)  on Sasebo city’s
mainland by building undersea transmission lines, the paper
said.  Japan last year introduced a feed-in-tariff program paying
renewable energy generators above-market rates for their output.
The country last week gave final approval to a recommendation to
cut the tariff for solar power by 10 percent for the year
started April 1 to 37.8 yen (40 cents) per kilowatt hour for 20
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
