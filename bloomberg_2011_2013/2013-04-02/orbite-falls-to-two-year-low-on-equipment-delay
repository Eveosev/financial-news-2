Orbite Aluminae Inc. (ORT) , the Montreal-
based company seeking to extract alumina and rare-earth metals
without toxic residue, fell to the lowest in more than two years
as equipment delays threaten production goals.  Orbite  dropped  22 percent to C$1.07 at 10:56 a.m. in
Toronto, the lowest intraday price since Jan. 18, 2011. Trading,
which was halted because of the decline, is expected to resume
today, said Jason Morley, an Orbite spokesman who works for
Stanton Public Relations & Marketing.  A delay in receiving equipment to process minerals into
aluminum means the company will not meet production goals and
may not generate revenue until next year, said Luisa Moreno, a
Toronto-based analyst at Euro Pacific Canada Inc. The company,
which has declined 56 percent this year, reported no revenue for
2010 and 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “They’re probably only going to be able to reach
commercial production by the end of this year or beginning of
2014,” Moreno said by phone today. “I assumed now there’s not
going to be any revenues for this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
