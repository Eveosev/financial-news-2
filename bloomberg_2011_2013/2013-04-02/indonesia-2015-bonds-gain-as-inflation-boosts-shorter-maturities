The yield on  Indonesia ’s two-year
bonds fell by the most this year on speculation investors are
favoring shorter-dated notes after inflation accelerated to a
22-month high. The rupiah was little changed.  Consumer prices  rose 5.9 percent in March from a year
earlier, official data showed yesterday. That compared with 5.31
percent in March and the 5.56 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The central bank has a 3.5 percent to 5.5
percent target range. The finance ministry plans to offer  1.5
trillion rupiah  ($154 million) of Islamic debt at an auction
today, with tenors of between six months and 24 years. Longer-
dated bonds are more sensitive to consumer-price gains.  “Inflation exceeded  Bank Indonesia ’s annual target last
month,” said Handy Yunianto, head of fixed-income research at
PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta. “We expect to see quite a bit
of demand for the six-month bills at the auction as investors
prefer shorter-term notes for safety” due to the accelerating
inflation, he said.  The yield on the benchmark two-year bonds fell eight basis
points to 4.35 percent as of 9:40 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show. That was the biggest
drop since Dec. 20.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. said in research notes yesterday that they
expect Bank Indonesia to raise its deposit facility rate, or
Fasbi, in the coming months to restrain inflation. Bank
Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution’s term ends on May 23.  Fasbi Rate  “With the change in governors, there may be a delay in
making significant policy changes, but a hike in the Fasbi rate
is possible in the first half,” Mandiri’s Yunianto said.  The rupiah traded at 9,738 per dollar, compared with 9,740
yesterday, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show.
It was at a 0.5 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable
forwards, which advanced 0.1 percent to 9,785, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,738 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,719 on March 28. Today’s rate will be published
at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.92 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
