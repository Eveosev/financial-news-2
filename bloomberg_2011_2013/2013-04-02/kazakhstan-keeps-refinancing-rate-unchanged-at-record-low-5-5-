Kazakhstan ’s central bank held its
refinancing rate at a record low after inflation unexpectedly
decelerated last month.  The National Bank of Kazakhstan kept the benchmark  rate  at
5.5 percent, the regulator in Almaty said in a  statement 
published on its website and dated yesterday. The biggest energy
producer in central Asia last decreased borrowing costs by a
half point on Aug. 6.  The decision was made “on account of a continuation in the
moderate pace of inflation and current conditions in the
functioning of the financial market,” the central bank said in
the statement.  Kazakhstan, which reduced its main rate four times last
year, is targeting economic growth of 6 percent this year after
 gross domestic product  expanded 5 percent in 2012. Policy makers
want to restrain inflation within the range of 6 percent to 8
percent, with the authorities moving to curb price growth by
capping fuel costs and banning exports of gasoline and diesel.  Inflation in March decelerated to 6.8 percent from a year
earlier, with consumer prices rising 0.2 percent in the month.
The central bank shaved 2 percentage points off its key  interest
rate  last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
