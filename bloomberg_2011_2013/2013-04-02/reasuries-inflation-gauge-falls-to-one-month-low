Treasuries fell, with 10-year yields
rising from the lowest level in two months, as orders placed
with U.S. factories increased in February, damping demand for
haven assets.  Benchmark  10-year yields  climbed before a government report
this week that economists said will show the U.S. is adding jobs
without driving wages higher. The yields earlier slipped below
their 100-day moving average. Morgan Stanley is forecasting less
implied volatility in Treasuries based on market perception of
Federal Reserve policy. Two Fed regional presidents voiced
support for continued stimulus spending by the central bank.  “It’s the anticipation that the number on Friday will be a
bit stronger than the estimates,” said Thomas di Galoma, a
managing director at Navigate Advisors, a brokerage for
institutional investors in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’re in a
fairly tight range of 1.80 to 2 percent.”  The 10-year  yield  rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It earlier dropped to
1.82 percent, the lowest since Jan. 24, below the 100-day moving
average at 1.83 percent. The 2 percent note due in February 2023
fell 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 1/4.  The 10-year yields will climb to 2.31 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Fed Presidents  Atlanta Fed Bank President  Dennis Lockhart  said the central
bank will probably need its  asset-purchase  program, now at $85
billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month, into next year to
boost jobs.  “The decision to curtail asset purchases ought to be
forward-looking, and in my judgment, that point could come later
this year or early next year without harm to the momentum of the
economy,” Lockhart said today in a speech in Birmingham,
 Alabama .  Fed Bank of Minneapolis President  Narayana Kocherlakota 
said U.S. policy makers can spur economic growth by clarifying
the conditions that would prompt a slowing or halt to the Fed’s
asset purchases.  “ Monetary policy  should be more accommodative,” he said
in a talk in Grand Forks,  North Dakota  today.  The Fed  purchased  $1.575 billion today in notes maturing
between February 2036 and February 2043.  Less Volatility  Morgan Stanley is forecasting less implied volatility in
Treasuries based on the market’s evolving understanding of when
the Fed is likely to reduce the amount of accommodation it’s
providing to financial markets, firm strategists Matthew Hornbach and Ankur Shah said in a note to clients published
today.  Investors should look at longer-term changes in labor
market data rather than at each specific report on nonfarm
payrolls or initial jobless claims in assessing when the Fed is
likely to reduce the aid it is providing, the New York-based
strategists wrote.  The decline in volatility as investors pay less attention
to each piece of data should push the gap between yields on
Treasury maturing in seven and 30 years wider, as well as
widening the gap between 10-year and 30-year government debt
yields, Hornbach and Shah wrote.  Yield Premium  Investors demanded the highest  yield premium  to own 30-year
bonds instead of 10-year notes in 18 months. The spread widened
to as much as 1.26 percentage points yesterday, the widest since
September 2011. It was 1.24 percentage points today.  The gap contracted 10 percent on Sept. 21, 2011, when the
Fed announced Operation Twist to buy longer-term Treasuries and
sell shorter-term debt from its holdings to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs.  Treasuries due in a decade or more have been trading at
almost the cheapest level in 19 months relative to global peers
with comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch bond indexes. Yields on the Treasuries reached 57 basis
points higher than those in an index of other sovereign debt on
March 25, the most since August 2011, the data showed. The
spread was 51 basis points yesterday.  Trading  volume  rose to $183.5 billion as of 4:01 p.m. in
New York after falling yesterday to $165.3 billion, the lowest
level since Dec. 31, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . It touched a 2013 high of
$491 billion on Feb. 1. Average daily volume this year is $282.6
billion.  ‘Chop Around’  “Everyone is waiting for the payroll number to give us
some direction,”  Sean Murphy , a trader at primary dealer
Societe Generale SA in New York, said before the manufacturing
report. “Until then we will continue to chop around in this
range -- the range as I see it is 1.85 to 2.09.”  Factory orders  rose 3 percent in February, the biggest gain
in five months, following a revised 1 percent decline in the
prior month, a Commerce Department report showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 64 economists in a Bloomberg
survey called for a 2.9 percent rise.  U.S. employers hired 199,000 workers in March, after adding
236,000 in February, according to another Bloomberg survey
before the Labor Department report on April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
