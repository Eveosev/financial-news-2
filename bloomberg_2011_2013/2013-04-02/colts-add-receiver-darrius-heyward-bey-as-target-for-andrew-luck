The Indianapolis Colts agreed on a
contract with free-agent wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, a
first-round draft pick who led the Oakland Raiders in catches
and receiving yards over the last four seasons.  Heyward-Bey, 26, had a career-high five touchdown
receptions last season while catching 41 passes for 606 yards.
He also had 64 receptions for 975 yards and four scores with the
Raiders during the 2011 season.  The seventh pick in the 2009 draft, Heyward-Bey provides
another target for quarterback Andrew Luck, who led the Colts to
an 11-5 record as a rookie last season. Heyward-Bey replaces
Donnie Avery, who joined the Kansas City Chiefs as a free agent
after finishing second on the Colts to Reggie Wayne last season
with 60 receptions.  “He’s big, strong and shows toughness in traffic and after
the catch,” Colts General Manager Ryan Grigson  said  of the 6-
foot-2, 216-pound Heyward-Bey. “He’s got elite finishing speed
that’s as good as there is in the NFL. With this staff, this
team and overall culture we’re building here in Indy, we felt
strongly that he was the right player and person at the wide-
receiver position for us moving forward.”  The Colts didn’t disclose terms of Heyward-Bey’s contract.
 USA Today said  it’s a one-year deal worth a maximum of $3
million, with $1.5 million guaranteed, citing an unidentified
person who had reviewed the contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
