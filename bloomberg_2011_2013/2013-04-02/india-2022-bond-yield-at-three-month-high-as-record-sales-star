The yield on  India ’s 2022 bonds rose
to a three-month high on speculation there is a lack of demand
for the debt, as the government prepares to start a record
borrowing program.  The  finance ministry  will offer 150 billion rupees ($2.8
billion) of notes due 2020, 2026, 2032 and 2042 on April 5,
according to a central bank statement yesterday. The auction
will be part of a 6.29 trillion rupee borrowing program for this
fiscal year that began April 1. The government last sold debt on
Feb. 15.  “The supply pressure is huge,” said Debendra Kumar Dash,
a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai.
“So there’s little demand for bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.99 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That
matches the level touched on March 26, the highest since Jan. 2.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.46 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
