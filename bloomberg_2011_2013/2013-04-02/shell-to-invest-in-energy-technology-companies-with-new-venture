Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest energy producer, set up a venture to invest in
technology companies and venture-capital funds as oil and gas
extraction becomes more costly and complex.  “Shell is ready to invest several hundred million dollars
in emerging technology companies,” the company said today in a
 statement  on its website. “Shell Technology Ventures will make
investments over the next six to eight years.”  The oil company, which spent more than $1.3 billion on
research and development last year, has helped fund production
of transport fuels from sugar cane and tight-oil extraction in
Siberia. Shell and its peers are investing in technology as a
four-year surge in crude prices pushes global energy explorers
to more remote, harder-to-tap deposits.  Shell Technology Ventures’ focus will include enhanced oil
recovery; natural-gas production and marketing; geophysical
surveys; chemical manufacturing; and water treatment. It’s a
successor to Shell Technology Ventures Fund 1 BV, which was set
up in 1998 and managed by Kenda Capital BV.  The new venture is fully owned and managed by The Hague-
based Shell, it said. Fund 1 will focus on its current portfolio
of projects and won’t make further investments, according to the
Anglo-Dutch company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
