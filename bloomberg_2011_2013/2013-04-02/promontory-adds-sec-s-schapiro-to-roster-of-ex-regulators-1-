Mary Schapiro, chairman of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission until December, joined
Promontory Financial Group LLC as a managing director and
chairman of the firm’s governance and markets practice.  Schapiro, 57, will advise clients on risk management and
corporate governance, Washington-based Promontory said today in
a statement.  Appointed by President  Barack Obama , Schapiro took over at
the SEC in 2009, after the financial crisis and the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns & Co. on the
agency’s watch. She won praise from a predecessor, Harvey Pitt,
for helping to restore the agency’s credibility, while other
regulators said she failed to hold banks accountable and manage
policy divides among commissioners.  “At Promontory I join a team of highly experienced
professionals who work with clients to meet regulatory and
investor expectations while advancing the evolving norms for
corporate governance and regulatory compliance,” Schapiro said
in the statement. “This is important not only to companies, but
also to our markets and to global prosperity.”  Schapiro adds to the ranks of former top regulators at
Promontory, which was founded by Eugene Ludwig, former head of
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The firm, which
hired OCC chief counsel Julie Williams this year, drew criticism
from lawmakers after it helped banks settle allegations of
faulty foreclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
