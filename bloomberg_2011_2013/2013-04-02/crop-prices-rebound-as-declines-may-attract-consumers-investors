Corn rallied after plunging the most
in 24 years yesterday, while wheat and soybeans advanced on
speculation the slump in the past two days may attract
investors, feed millers and biofuel producers.  Corn for May delivery climbed as much as 1.1 percent to
$6.49 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and was at $6.455
at 3:22 p.m. in  Singapore  on volume that was 94 percent above
the 100-day average. Futures tumbled into a bear market
yesterday, dropping 23 percent from the record close in August.  “There’s some buying from consumers and end-users at these
levels,” Michael Pitts, a commodity sales director at National
Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from Sydney today. “It will
definitely attract import demand across all grains,” he said,
referring to the plunge in the past two days.  Wheat for May delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.68 a bushel
in Chicago, while soybeans for delivery in the same month gained
0.4 percent to $13.9625 a bushel. Corn,  inspected  before export
at U.S. ports, gained for a third week, rising 11 percent to
19.1 million bushels in the five days ended March 28, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Wheat export
 inspections  climbed 24 percent, USDA data show.  The recent decline in corn prices has improved margins,
allowing producers to sell ethanol at lower prices and boosting
export demand and making the biofuel more attractive to be mixed
with gasoline, Jason Ward, an analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investments LLC in  Minneapolis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
