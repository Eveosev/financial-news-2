Libya  pledged to review a  management
contract  with an Emirati partner at the Ras Lanuf refining
complex following a workers’ protest, according to the state-run
National Oil Corp.  Demonstrators outside the Tripoli offices of the NOC called
yesterday for the government to reject a 20-month extension to
the existing agreement with Libyan Emirati Refining Co. and to
hand management back to the Libyans, the company said on its
 website . The workers also demanded that proposed upgrades at the
refinery be speeded up, the NOC said.  Libya “will do its utmost to meet their demands and review
all previous agreements in a way that suits the interests of
Libya and its people,” the NOC quoted Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi as saying.  Libyan Emirati Refining Co., or Lerco, is a joint venture
between Trasta Energy of the  United Arab Emirates  and Libya’s
NOC. Each holds a 50 percent stake. Ras Lanuf can process
220,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
