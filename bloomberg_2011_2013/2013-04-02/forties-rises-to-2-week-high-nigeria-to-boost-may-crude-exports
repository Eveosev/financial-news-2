North Sea Forties crude rose to the
highest in almost two weeks as Total SA bought. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and Talmay Trading both offered Russian Urals grade
without finding buyers.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, will boost crude
exports to 76 cargoes in May, according to a final loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Vitol Group sold Forties to Total for loading from April 20
to April 22 at 35 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with trades
on March 28 at discounts of 70 cents and 90 cents to the
benchmark and is the highest since March 21, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 10 cents to a discount of 73 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $110.56 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  at the close of the
window, compared with $109 at 12:30 p.m. on March 28, the
previous Platts session before the Easter holidays. The June
contract was at $110.36, a discount of 20 cents to May.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell and Talmay both failed to sell Urals at $2.15 a
barrel less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam
without finding buyers, the Platts survey showed. That compares
with a Feb. 25 deal at minus $2.75, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Socar Trading SA failed to find a buyer for 600,000 barrels
of Azeri Light at a $3.05 a barrel premium to Dated Brent,
according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 2 cents to $1.12 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In northwest  Europe , the  discount  was at $2.18 a barrel,
compared with minus $2.15 in the previous session. That’s the
widest since March 12.  Iraq will ship 48 cargoes of Basrah Light crude from the
Persian Gulf in April, 13 more than last month, a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  About 68.6 million barrels of the blend will be exported
from the Basrah Oil Terminal, according to the plan. That
equates to 2.29 million barrels a day this month and compares
with average daily shipments in March of 1.93 million barrels.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $3.25 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show  The Nigeria loading program for May compares with 66
shipments due to be exported this month, according to a revised
plan for April. The plan includes all of the main 18 grades.
Three Bonny Light cargoes, two lots of Brass River and one Okono
consignment have been deferred to May from April.  Vitol sold 2 million barrels of Qua Iboe for loading in May
to Hindustan Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s third-largest state
refiner, said two people with knowledge of the deal who asked
not to be identified because the information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
