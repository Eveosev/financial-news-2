Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) ,  Brazil ’s
worst-performing homebuilder this year, rose the most in a month
after saying it is shifting its focus to building more expensive
projects and away from subsidized low-income housing.  Shares gained 3.9 percent to 3.17 reais at 11:51 a.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier advancing as much as 5.6 percent in the
biggest intraday increase since March 6. It was the best
performance on the benchmark Bovespa index, which fell 0.3
percent.  The homebuilder plans to reduce its participation in
Brazil’s “My House, My Life” low-income housing program
beginning this year, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday describing its investment plan for the three years
through 2015. The Sao Paulo-based company said it will focus on
projects for higher-income buyers and concentrate construction
in seven metropolitan areas instead of the 120 cities in which
it currently builds.  Itau BBA raised its recommendation on the stock to the
equivalent of hold from sell after the announcement.  Rossi declined 33 percent this year through yesterday,
while the benchmark index lost 8.3 percent during that same
period. The BM&FBovespa Real Estate index slid 8.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
