Euro-area manufacturing output
contracted less than initially estimated in March as the
currency bloc struggled to emerge from a recession.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
declined to 46.8 last month from 47.9 in February, London-based
Markit Economics said today. That is above an initial estimate
of 46.6 on March 21. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
