LeBron James and Dwyane Wade of the
Miami Heat will sit out tonight’s home game against the  New York 
Knicks because of leg injuries, and Las Vegas oddsmakers have
adjusted the betting line by five points.  The Heat are now listed as 2 1/2-point favorites without
their top two scorers for the matchup of National Basketball
Association division leaders. Miami had been favored by 7 1/2
points, according to the Las Vegas Hotel’s Super Book.  James, who has a strained right hamstring, and Wade, who
has a sprained right ankle, were ruled out after missing this
morning’s shoot-around. Mario Chalmers also won’t play tonight
due to a right ankle sprain, the Heat said in a  Twitter  post.  The Knicks (46-26) take an eight-game winning streak into
tonight’s game in Miami against the Heat, who lead the NBA with
a 58-15 record and have won 29 of their past 30 games. Miami has
opened an 11-game lead over the Indiana Pacers for the No. 1
seed in the Eastern Conference, with the Knicks another half-
game back in the third spot.  James, Wade and Chalmers also missed Miami’s March 31 game
against the San Antonio Spurs. With the Heat on the road for
that matchup, the betting line adjustment was more significant,
as the Spurs became 9 1/2-point favorites after the spread
opened eight points less, at 1 1/2. Miami won 88-86 as Chris Bosh hit a winning 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds remaining.  “Returning home off the win lessened the effect a few
points,” LVH Super Book assistant manager Jeff Sherman said in
an e-mail. The Heat have a 32-3 home record this season.  James is averaging a team-leading 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds
and 7.3 assists this season, while Wade is second with 21.3
points a game. Chalmers is averaging 8.5 points and 3.4 assists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
