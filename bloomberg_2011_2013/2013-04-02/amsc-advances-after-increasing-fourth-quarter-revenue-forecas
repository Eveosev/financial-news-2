American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
U.S. supplier of wind-turbine components, rose the most in three
weeks after raising its sales forecast.  AMSC advanced 4.5 percent to $2.69 at the close in New
York, the most since March 12.  The company, based in Devens, Massachusetts, expects
revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31 will be
$19 million to $20 million, according to a statement released
after the close of regular trading yesterday. That’s higher than
AMSC’s February forecast of $18 million. It expects to have a
positive  cash flow  within a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
