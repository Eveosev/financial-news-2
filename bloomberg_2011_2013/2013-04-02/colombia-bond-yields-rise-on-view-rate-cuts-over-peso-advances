Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose for
a third day on speculation the central bank’s rate-cutting cycle
that began in July reached an end after an unexpected half-
percentage-point cut last month.  Yields on peso bonds due 2024 climbed four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 5.04 percent at 9:54 a.m. in Bogota,
according to the central bank. The price fell 0.438 centavo to
141.925 centavos per peso.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas , who is also president
of the central bank’s board, told reporters yesterday that the
reduction in the overnight lending rate “should be sufficient”
to speed economic growth toward 4.8 percent, the limit at which
expansion wouldn’t spur excessive inflation.  “Cardenas’s tone has changed and that’s an indication for
some there won’t be any more cuts,” said William Florez, a
strategist at Helm Bank SA’s brokerage in Bogota.  Banco de la Republica lowered the target lending rate by 50
basis points to 3.25 percent on March 22, surprising all 32
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. They have reduced the key rate 2
percentage points since the beginning of cuts in July.  Yields on the benchmark bonds have fallen 62 basis points
this year, helped in part by the rate cuts. Florez predicts
yields on medium- and long-term bonds will continue to fall amid
liquidity in international markets and low inflation.  “The rally isn’t over,” said Florez, who forecasts the
yield on the bond due in 2024 will fall to 4.7 percent this
quarter.  The peso appreciated for a third consecutive session,
advancing 0.1 percent to 1,820.44 per  U.S. dollar . It has
slumped 2.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
