Alsea SAB (ALSEA*)  surged to a record after
purchasing the rest of Cafe Sirena S de RL, which operates
Starbucks stores in Mexico.  Alsea, which also operates Burger King restaurants in the
country, jumped 3.4 percent to 36.61 pesos at the close of
trading in Mexico City. The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican
companies rose 0.4 percent.  Alsea bought the 18 percent of Starbucks operator Cafe
Sirena it didn’t already own, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday that didn’t disclose the financial terms of the
transaction. Alsea also agreed to open 50 cafes a year for the
next five years, according to the statement.  The transaction eliminates the risk Starbucks would
exercise an option to buy a 32 percent stake in the company,
according to Corporativo GBM SAB. That’s one of the “main
positive” takeaways from the deal, GBM analysts led by Luis
Willard wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Alsea has  advanced  42 percent this year, the most on the
IPC index, which has climbed 0.9 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
