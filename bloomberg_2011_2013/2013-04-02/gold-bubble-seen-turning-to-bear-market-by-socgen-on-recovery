Gold is in a “bubble” after the
best annual run in at least nine decades and will head into a
so-called bear market as a stronger  U.S. economy  helps increase
 interest rates  and cut bullion demand,  Societe Generale  SA said.  Investors are unlikely to raise gold holdings because
inflation has remained low, signs that the economy is improving
may spur the  Federal Reserve  to curb stimulus and the dollar has
strengthened, the bank said today in a report. Bullion is down
4.6 percent this year after 12 straight annual gains and would
need to drop another 4.8 percent to mark the common definition
of a bear market.  Prices fell this year as Fed policy makers debated the pace
of asset purchases. Billionaire investor  George Soros , who
called bullion the “ultimate asset bubble” in 2010, cut his
stake in the biggest gold exchange-traded product by 55 percent
in the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in February
that bullion’s cycle has probably turned as the U.S. economy
recovers and Credit Suisse Group AG has said the metal is
unlikely to return to the 2011 record of $1,921.15 an ounce.  “The gold price is, in our view, in bubble territory,”
Societe Generale analysts including London-based Robin Bhar
wrote in the report. “Rising interest rates, driven in part by
a positive view of the U.S. economy with an associated
improvement in the dollar, could be the perfect storm to start a
longer-term  bear market .”  Gold Price  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,597.48 by 11:14
a.m. in  London . While gold’s 1.2 percent advance in March was
the first monthly gain since September, it posted the first
back-to-back quarterly losses since the start of 2001. A close
at $1,520.18 would be a 20 percent drop from Sept. 5, 2011,
signaling prices entered a bear market.  Prices will slide to $1,375 by December and average $1,500
this year and $1,400 in 2014, Societe Generale estimates. The
metal as much as doubled after central banks, led by the Fed,
increased stimulus since 2008 to bolster economic growth.  “Investors have pushed the gold price sharply higher over
the past 10 years with the past five-year rally driven by fears
that aggressive central bank quantitative easing would lead to
very high inflation,” Societe Generale said. “Professional
sentiment, as evidenced by heavy redemptions in ETFs and the
increasing willingness of managed money investors to trade from
the short side, confirms our view that gold may have had its
‘last hurrah.’”  Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by the 82-year-old,
owned about $97 million of metal through the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)  as
of Dec. 31, a regulatory filing showed in February. Investors
hold about 2,450 metric tons through ETPs, about 6.9 percent
below the record set Dec. 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Money Managers  Money managers cut bets on higher prices by 70 percent
since October, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  data 
show. Speculators held a net-long position of 60,126 futures and
options as of March 26. They held 39,631 contracts in the week
to March 5, the least since July 2007, the data show.  Gold, which generally earns returns only through price
gains, averaged a record $1,669 last year as nations pledged
more stimulus. The Fed is currently purchasing $85 billion of
Treasury and mortgage debt a month.  U.S. growth will slow to 1.75 percent this quarter,
compared with 2.05 percent in the first quarter, according to
the median estimate of as many as 74 economists compiled by
Bloomberg. Expansion will then accelerate each quarter through
mid-2014. The U.S.  Dollar Index , a measure against six
currencies, climbed to an almost eight-month high on March 27
and is up 3.6 percent this year.  Mining Companies  Mining companies have so far held off locking in prices by
selling future production, and companies are still reluctant to
hedge, Societe Generale said. Barclays Plc expects net hedging
of 20 tons this year and 35 tons in 2014. Annual production is
about 2,700 tons.  “A sustained fall below $1,400 an ounce could unleash
fresh waves of producer hedging not associated with project-
related hedging by miners looking to finance development
projects,” Societe Generale said. “A downward price spiral
could see gold locked into a vicious downward cycle as increased
producer hedging prompts ever lower  gold prices  and, in turn,
more producer hedging.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
