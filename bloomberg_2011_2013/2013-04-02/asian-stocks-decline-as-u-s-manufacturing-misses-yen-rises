Most Asian  stocks  fell, led by
Japanese shares after data on U.S. manufacturing missed
estimates and the yen strengthened, damping the earnings outlook
for exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s No. 1 camera maker, lost 3.4
percent in  Tokyo .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest
carmaker, slid 3.1 percent as Japanese vehicle sales fell by the
most in six quarters as the government ended subsidies.  Angang
Steel  Co. jumped 12 percent after the Chinese steel maker
predicted it will post a first-quarter profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.2 percent to 133.95
as of 7:46 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five companies retreating
for every four that gained. The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding
Japan Index added 0.3 percent to 473.01. The Asia-Pacific index
capped a five-month rally last week as Japanese shares gained on
speculation the nation will deploy more stimulus and amid signs
the  U.S. economy  is recovering.  “The bar has been set quite high now after such a long
stretch of economic data outperforming expectations, and we are
likely to go through a period when economic data will miss
expectations,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic
 asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
$126 billion. “Markets are quite vulnerable to a corrective
stage.”  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13.3 times
estimated earnings, compared with 14.1 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BOJ Meeting  Japan’s Topix Index dropped 0.9 percent before the  Bank of
Japan  convenes April 3-4 in its first policy meeting after new
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda took the post. Kuroda has pledged to do
whatever it takes to beat deflation.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index dropped 0.5 percent.
International investors sold the most South Korean equities in
10 months in March amid concern the nation’s exporters will lose
market share to Japanese rivals and as tension with North Korea
built.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index and the Shanghai Composite
Index both fell 0.3 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.4 percent as the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged today. Billabong International Ltd., Australia’s
largest surf-wear company, halted trade in its shares as it
negotiates rival private equity bids.  Markets Reopen  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.3 percent.  Taiwan’s
Taiex Index (TWSE)  added 0.2 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times
Index gained 0.2 percent. Markets in Australia, New Zealand and
Hong Kong reopened today after a four-day weekend.  “We’ve had two days off and missed a lot of big news over
that period, and I think chances are markets are likely to tread
water a bit now as we move into the beginning of the first-
quarter earnings season,” saidGarry Evans, head of global
equity strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. “We’ve had a
big run in Japan and people are starting to look at the Bank of
Japan meeting on Thursday and thinking it’s unlikely to beat
very high expectations.”  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SXXP)  rose 0.5 percent today. The index
fell 0.5 percent in New York yesterday, retreating from a record
high, as the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
fell to 51.3 in March from 54.2 February, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 54. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between growth and contraction.  Yen Rises  The yen rose against 14 of its 16 major counterparts. A
stronger yen cuts the value of overseas earnings at Japanese
exporters when repatriated.  Japanese exporters fell with Canon sliding 3.4 percent to
3,245 yen. Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction equipment that
gets about 80 percent of sales overseas, slipped 3.9 percent to
2,123 yen.  Carmakers fell after the number of vehicles sold in Japan,
 Asia ’s second-largest auto market, fell 9.4 percent to 1.53
million in the three months through March, with Toyota recording
a 15 percent drop, according to data released yesterday. In
South Korea, the region’s fourth-largest vehicle market,
deliveries slid 2.5 percent as Hyundai Motor Co. suffered a 0.7
percent contraction, based on company statements.  Toyota dropped 3.1 percent to 4,615 yen. Nissan Motor Co.,
Japan’s third-biggest carmaker, slipped 3.5 percent to 856 yen.
Hyundai Motor, the biggest South Korean carmaker, lost 1.1
percent to 219,500 won.  STX Fund-Raising  STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. plunged 15 percent to 5,160
won in Seoul as it seeks help from creditor banks. STX Group has
been selling assets, including its entire stakes in STX OSV
Holdings Ltd. and STX Energy Co., as it seeks to raise 2.5
trillion won ($2.2 billion) to  pay debt .  Shui On Land Ltd. (272) , the Chinese developer controlled by Hong
Kong billionaire Vincent Lo, slumped 13 percent to HK$2.91 after
underlying profit dropped 87 percent to 201 million  yuan  ($32
million) in 2012 and the company it will sell as many as 2.25
billion shares at HK$1.84 each to existing shareholders.  Among stocks that rose,  Angang Steel (347)  climbed 12 percent to
HK$4.78 after the company said it will report a first-quarter
profit of 550 million yuan ($89 million), compared with a year
earlier net loss of 1.9 billion yuan.  Qantas Airways Ltd. advanced 2.5 percent to A$1.83 after
Australia’s biggest carrier said Europe bookings rose six-fold
as an alliance with Emirates reduces flight times between the
continents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
