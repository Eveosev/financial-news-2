Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. auto-rental chain, rose to its
highest level in more than five years after projecting profit
for 2015 that was higher than analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  jumped 6.9 percent to $23.41 at the close in  New
York , the highest price since October 2007. Hertz has advanced
44 percent this year compared with an 10 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Hertz is benefiting from its $2.6 billion acquisition last
year of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc., which solidified
its position as the second-largest U.S. rental-car chain, behind
closely held Enterprise Holdings Inc. Adjusted earnings per
share for 2015 will be $3.10 to $3.30, the  Park Ridge ,  New
Jersey  based company said today in an investor presentation
posted on its website. Analysts projected $2.39 a share, the
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The 2015 plan is clearly better than most expected,”
Fred Lowrance, a Nashville, Tennessee-based analyst at Avondale
Partners LLC, said in an e-mail. “The Dollar Thrifty
acquisition should prove to be an even bigger game-changer than
expected, and the legacy rental car and equipment-rental
businesses are likely to continue the positive momentum that
they displayed over the last couple of years.”  Lowrance has a market outperform rating on the stock.  Revenue will increase at a compounded annual rate of 12.5
percent to 13.5 percent through 2015, compared with a September
2011 forecast of as much as 8 percent, the company said today.
Hertz said it plans to use its cash to repay debt and expand the
business as well as return it to shareholders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
