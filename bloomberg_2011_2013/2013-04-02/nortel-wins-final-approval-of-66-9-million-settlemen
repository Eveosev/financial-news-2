Nortel Networks Inc. (NRTLQ) , the defunct
telecommunications company, won final court approval of a
$66.9 million settlement over retiree benefits.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross approved the accord at a
hearing today in Wilmington,  Delaware . The agreement, negotiated
with a committee representing retirees, applies to Nortel’s U.S.
employees.  Nortel, based in Mississauga, Ontario, filed for bankruptcy
in Canada, the U.S., the U.K. and France in 2009. The company is
still in a dispute with U.K. administrators who are demanding
$2.67 billion from Nortel’s main U.S. unit to pay retiree
benefits.  Nortel’s U.K. retirees lost a bid last month to force the
company into private arbitration over how to split $7 billion
raised in liquidation sales of Nortel’s most valuable assets.  The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-10138,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington)  To contact the reporter on this story:
