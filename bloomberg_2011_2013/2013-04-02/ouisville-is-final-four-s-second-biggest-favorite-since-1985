The University of Louisville is the
second-biggest Final Four favorite of oddsmakers since the
national men’s college basketball tournament expanded to 64
teams in 1985.  Louisville, the lone No. 1 regional seed to reach the
national semifinals in Atlanta, is favored by 10 1/2 points in
its April 6 game against Wichita State, according to Las Vegas
sports books. The Cardinals are riding a 14-game winning streak,
while the Shockers, out of the Missouri Valley Conference, are
the first No. 9 regional seed to make the Final Four since the
University of Pennsylvania in 1979.  The only team in the past 28 years that’s been a bigger
Final Four favorite was the 1999 Duke Blue Devils, who were
picked to beat  Michigan  State by 11 points and won 68-62,
according to Las Vegas-based handicapping information website
 Pregame.com .  “We’re excited to be there and we know there are four
teams in that Final Four all capable of winning a national
championship,” Louisville coach  Rick Pitino  said on a media
conference call. “They’re all playing great.”  The  University of Michigan  is a 2 1/2-point favorite over
 Syracuse University  in the other national semifinal on April 6,
according to the Las Vegas Hotel’s Super Book. The championship
game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
will be played two days later at the Georgia Dome.  A year ago, Louisville was a 9 1/2-point underdog at the
Final Four against  Kentucky  and lost 69-61 to its instate rival,
which went on to win the championship.  Heavy Favorite  This season, Louisville is a 10-13 favorite to win its
third NCAA title, meaning a bettor would have to wager $130 to
win $100. Wichita State (30-8), which had upset wins over
Gonzaga, Pittsburgh and Ohio State in its run to the Final Four,
is a 12-1 longshot to win the championship. Michigan is listed
at 3-1 and Syracuse has 4-1 championship odds.  Of the 116 Final Four teams since 1985, Wichita State is
the fourth to be seeded worse than eighth in its region. The
Shockers join Virginia Commonwealth (2011),  George Mason  (2006)
and Louisiana State (1986), all of which were No. 11 seeds.  “This team has done better when nothing has been expected,
when they’re the underdogs, which we’ll clearly be on
Saturday,” Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall said on a
conference call. “I just think that’s when we’re at our best.”  Louisville has gone almost two months since its last loss,
a 104-101, five-overtime defeat at  Notre Dame  on Feb. 9. The
Cardinals (33-5) recovered to win the Big East tournament title
after dropping three games in a row in late January.  “We knew all along that we were good,” Louisville junior
guard Russ Smith said. “Once we put it together, everybody got
their confidence back and locked in to say, ‘Hey, let’s set our
goals, let’s win seven straight, let’s win the Big East
tournament. Let’s get the No. 1 of the No. 1 seeds.’ And now
we’re here. We’ve had confidence in ourselves all along.”  Tournament Wins  Louisville has won its four NCAA tournament games by an
average of 21.8 points, including 85-63 over Duke in the Midwest
region final. That win sent Pitino to the Final Four for the
seventh time, tied with  Roy Williams  for the fourth-most in NCAA
tournament history behind  John Wooden  (12),  Mike Krzyzewski  (11)
and Dean Smith (11).  “We know we’re playing a great basketball team in Wichita
State, so we’ll just have to see how deep they are in the back-
court,” Pitino said. “We have a lot of front-court depth, but
we don’t have a lot of back-court depth. If they’re deep, we’ll
have to make some adjustments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
