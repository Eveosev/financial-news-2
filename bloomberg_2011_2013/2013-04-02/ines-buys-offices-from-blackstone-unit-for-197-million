Hines Global REIT Inc. acquired
three office buildings in a  Boston  suburb from  Blackstone Group
LP’s (BX)  Equity Office unit for $197 million as property investors
seek higher yields outside major cities.  Riverside Center in Newton, Massachusetts, has three
buildings with about 510,000 square feet (47,000 square meters),
Houston-based Hines said today in a statement. Tenants include
online publisher  TechTarget Inc. (TTGT) , which has its headquarters in
the 97 percent-leased complex, and  McKesson Corp. (MCK) , the biggest
drug distributor in the U.S. The acquisition is the third in the
area for the real estate investment trust.  “Boston is a market that Hines Global REIT has targeted
for investment because of its diverse economy and highly
educated workforce,” Chief Executive Officer Sherri Schugart
said in the statement. “Riverside Center is a well-located,
quality asset with strong tenancy that will fit well within our
portfolio.”  Investors are buying commercial real estate outside large
cities as they search for lower prices and better rates of
return. Hines Global REIT purchased Riverside Center with a
bridge loan from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  with a maximum borrowing
amount of $150 million, the buyer said today in a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The loan has a 60-day term and an interest rate of the
London interbank offered rate plus 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent,
with an option to extend the maturity date by 30 days, according
to the filing.  Newton is about 11 miles (18 kilometers) west of Boston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
