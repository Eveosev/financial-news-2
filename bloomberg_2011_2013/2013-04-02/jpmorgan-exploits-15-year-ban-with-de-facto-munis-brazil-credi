JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  are finding ways to profit from  Brazil ’s 15-year
ban on municipal bond sales, issuing notes tied to state loans
guaranteed by the government.  The banks last month sold notes backed by a $1.27 billion
loan to the state of  Minas Gerais  yielding 4.216 percent. While
the securities were sold at a lower rate than the 5.33 percent
that Credit Suisse charged Minas Gerais in November and let the
state pay back a portion of the principal along with interest
payments, they yield 1.3 times more than similar-maturity
 government bonds  and carry the same guarantee.  Wall Street’s biggest banks are capitalizing on Brazil’s
decision in August to ease some restrictions on state  borrowing 
put in place after a $44 billion federal bailout in 1997 by
securitizing the loans they extend as local governments seek to
refinance bailout debt and fund investments. With virtually no
outstanding muni bonds in Brazil, the Minas Gerais notes have
risen 0.32 cent since they were issued at a premium of 109.18
cents on the dollar, according to  Cantor Fitzgerald .  “It’s clear that the market likes it,” Ulisses de Oliveira, a  money manager  at Galloway Capital Management in Sao
Paulo who helps oversee $400 million of emerging-market debt,
said in a telephone interview.  Brazil Spread  The percentage point in extra yield investors get to hold
the notes instead of federal government bonds compares with an
average spread of 0.13 point between  U.S. municipal debt  and
similar-maturity Treasuries.  The U.S. municipal bond market is
$3.7 trillion.  Mexico  has 60 billion pesos ($4.85 billion) in
municipal debt outstanding, according to Finance Ministry data
compiled through March 2012.  The Minas Gerais loan was assigned to a special purpose
entity, which in turn issues pass-through notes to investors. It
was the first state borrowing to be repackaged for the  bond
market  since Brazil authorized 21 states in August to borrow 60
billion reais ($30 billion) through 2014 with government
guarantees to compensate for lower tax transfers and help
finance investments.  The securities received a preliminary BBB rating from
 Standard & Poor’s , the second-lowest level of investment grade
and in line with Brazil’s sovereign rating.  States’ Plans  States are in talks to borrow at least $6.5 billion from
private lenders this year, more than double last year’s total
following federal authorization last August, with each loan
subject to approval by the federal government. No other banks
have filed to package such loans to investors, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Mato Grosso, an agricultural state in western Brazil, is
waiting for approval for a $1 billion, 15-year loan from Credit
Suisse with a 4.5 percent interest rate, Deputy Finance
Secretary Vivaldo Lopes said March 4.  Parana state, in the south of Brazil, is seeking approval
for a 1.1 billion-real loan from Credit Suisse to repay debt
owed to the state-owned electric utility, according to state
Finance Secretary Luiz Carlos Hauly.  Press officials in Sao Paulo for Zurich-based Credit Suisse
and New York-based JPMorgan declined to comment on the debt
sale. The  Finance Ministry  declined to comment.  States ran into financial difficulties in the early 1990s
after years of mismanagement and hyperinflation.  Spending Limits  After the rescue, Congress approved a fiscal-responsibility
law that limits spending in election years and prohibits local
governments from selling bonds until they finish paying off
about $200 billion of debt stemming from the bailout that’s owed
to the federal government.  It makes sense for the federal government to ease
restrictions as rising tax revenue creates room for some states
to take on more debt, according to Raul Velloso, a former
economic secretary at the federal Planning Ministry who is now
director of ARD Consultores Associados in Brasilia.  “The credibility of the states is rooted in this
mechanism,” he said in a telephone interview. “The states are
still held in a very tight straitjacket, so these deals don’t
inspire a lot of worry.”  States’ revenue probably exceeded net debt last year,
according to a Feb. 22 report by  Fitch Ratings . States had a
total of 408 billion reais of debt in 2011, 88 percent of which
was owed to the federal government, according to the report.  TCW View  Even with a sovereign guarantee, not all Brazilian states’
debt would be attractive to foreign investors, said Marcela Meirelles, a Latin America strategist at TCW Group Inc. in  Los
Angeles , which oversees $128 billion of assets.  Rio de Janeiro , whose finances are being squeezed as
federal lawmakers seek to funnel some of the royalties from
crude produced within the state to other local governments,
would face more scrutiny from investors, she said.  The federal guarantee creates “some sense of comfort with
the credit, but it’s not the only requirement,” Meirelles said
in a telephone interview. “They’re still case by case.”  The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian
government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 187 basis points at
12:11 p.m. in  New York , according to JPMorgan indexes.  Default Swaps  The cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for
five years was little changed at 139 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements.  The real was little changed at 2.0201 per dollar. Swap
rates on the contract due in January 2014 fell four basis points
to 7.74 percent.  Future sales of such debt could cause yields on quasi-
sovereign and high-grade bank debt to rise as investors sell the
bonds in favor of higher-yielding notes with similar credit
risk, according to Galloway’s Oliveira.  The 4.2 percent yield on the Minas pass-through notes is
greater than for similar-maturity debt sold by state-owned
lender Caixa Economica Federal, which yields 4.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is a market for this, they’re coming with a
premium, and they have an outright sovereign guarantee,” he
said. “Not every state is created equal, but it’s clear that
some states will be able to capture this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
