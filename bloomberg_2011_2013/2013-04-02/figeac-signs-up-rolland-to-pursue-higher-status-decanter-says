Chateau Figeac, a Saint-Emilion wine
producer which missed out on promotion in the region’s 2012
classification, has signed a contract with consultant Michel
Rolland in a bid to achieve the coveted “A” status for its
wines, Decanter.com said.  Two producers, Chateau Angelus and Chateau Pavie, did win
promotion to “A” from “B” ranking among the premier grands
crus classes wines of the Bordeaux appellation last year
alongside Chateau Ausone and Chateau Cheval Blanc, while Figeac
remained classified as a “B,” according to Decanter.com’s
website. Rolland was approached by Figeac’s owner Marie-France
Manoncourt, widow of former proprietor Thierry Manoncourt, to
consult on its wines, Decanter.com said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
