Chi-X  Australia  Pty appointed John Fildes as chief executive officer to lead the company, which is
the only rival venue to  ASX Ltd. (ASX)  for equities trading in the
nation.  Fildes, who previously ran strategic development for Getco
LLC in  Singapore , will join Chi-X this month and will replace
current CEO  Peter Fowler , who will step down May 1, according to
an emailed statement. Fildes oversaw the entry of Getco and
Instinet Inc. into the Australian market in former roles.  “John Fildes has worked in or with the Australian market
for two decades and is a well-regarded member of the Australian
trading community,” Tal Cohen, chief executive officer of Chi-X
Global, said in the statement. “He has held senior positions
with various market participants and made significant
contributions to industry bodies through his interaction with
regulators and government.”  Chi-X Australia and ASX compete as the only two public
venues of stock trading in the nation. Chi-X, backed by Nomura
Holdings Inc., has gained more than 10 percent of market share
since starting operations in November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
