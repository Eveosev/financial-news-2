Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  and Hyundai
Engineering & Construction Co. were awarded a $2.4 billion
contract by Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Co. as the emirate seeks
to expand crude oil production.  The contract is for the 100,000 barrel-a-day Satah Al-
Razboot field development, the Abu Dhabi-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The project is part of a plan to
increase crude output by 300,000 barrels daily from new offshore
fields, it said.  South Korea’s Hyundai will undertake onshore works
including processing, storage and building export terminals for
$1.89 billion, according to the statement. U.K.-based Petrofac
will carry out construction of subsea cables, pipelines, a
mooring facility and platforms, it said.  Petrofac said today in a separate statement that the
contract would start “shortly” and be delivered by April 2016.
Its main clients are in  Abu Dhabi , Algeria,  Saudi Arabia  and
Turkmenistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
