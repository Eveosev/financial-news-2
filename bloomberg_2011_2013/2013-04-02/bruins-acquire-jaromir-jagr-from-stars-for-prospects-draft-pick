The Boston Bruins acquired 41-year-
old Jaromir Jagr, the eighth-leading scorer in National Hockey
League history, from the Dallas Stars for a conditional second-
round pick in the 2013 draft and two prospects.  Jagr had 14 goals and 12 assists in 34 games for the Stars
this season. A two-time Stanley Cup champion, he’s the active
NHL leader with 679 goals and 1,000 assists over 19 seasons,
with 116 game-winning goals -- second all-time to Phil Esposito.  The Bruins have the third-best record in the Eastern
Conference at 22-8-4. The Stars, who have a 16-16-3 record,
receive forwards Lane MacDermid, 23, and Cody Payne, 19, from
the Bruins.  “Jaromir Jagr produced as a consistent scorer for our team
all year and we would like to thank him for his contributions to
our hockey club,” Dallas Stars General Manager Joe Nieuwendyk
said in a statement. “With our eye to the future, we have
acquired some valuable assets that we believe strengthen our
organization.”  The move comes a day before the NHL’s trade deadline and
less than a week after the Bruins fell short in their pursuit of
All-Star right wing Jarome Iginla, who was traded to the
Pittsburgh Penguins after 16 seasons with the Calgary Flames.  MacDermid, a fourth-round draft pick in 2009, made his NHL
debut last season and has played in eight league games. He has
four goals and two assists in 37 games this season for the
Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League. Payne had 24
goals and 21 assists over 66 games for the Plymouth Whalers of
the Ontario Hockey League this season.  The conditional second-round pick the Stars receive would
become a first-round selection if the Bruins advance to the
Eastern Conference finals in this season’s playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
