Ukraine spring sowing may be delayed
after “extremely strong” snowstorms in the northwest and the
center of the country, while cold conditions the U.S. Midwest
may slow planting there, Oil World wrote.  Soybean crop prospects in Argentina have deteriorated after
late planting, while drought has hurt crops in  South Africa ,
according to the Hamburg-based researcher.  Corn prices in  Chicago  have dropped 24 percent from an
August peak on expectations of increased planting, while
soybeans have slipped 21 percent from a September high and wheat
29 percent from a July peak.  In Ukraine, delayed planting “is likely to become a
particular concern for the early-sown crops like spring wheat
and barley,” Oil World wrote in an e-mailed report today.
“Some farmers might also be prompted to postpone field work to
the benefit of crops that can be planted later, like corn,
soybeans and sunflower seed.”  In the U.S., cold weather in the southeast and southern
Midwest could result in planting delays, according to Oil World.
Several growing regions still need “considerable” rain to
replenish soil moisture, while any delays caused by rains would
mean corn sowing can’t be completed on time, it said.  About 30 percent of  Argentina ’s soybeans were planted later
than usual and will reach maturity 10 to 20 days behind
schedule, according to the researcher. In South Africa, dry
conditions in the Free State and North West provinces resulted
in lower forecasts for corn and sunflower seed, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
