Chile ’s central bank board indicated
the benchmark interest rate will remain unchanged for at least
six months as policy makers reduced their inflation forecasts
and raised economic growth estimates.  The bank’s board lowered its 2013 inflation forecast to 2.8
percent from 2.9 percent, while boosting its economic growth
estimate to a range of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent from 4.25
percent to 5.25 percent, according to the quarterly monetary
policy report published today.  The board, led by bank President Rodrigo Vergara, changed
its 2013 estimates after the inflation rate fell more than
forecast last year, dropping to the lowest level in Latin
America, while the economy expanded more than estimated by
policy makers. The conflicting pressures of slow inflation and
surging internal demand leave it little space to change
borrowing costs.  “The opposing forces that monetary policy has faced remain
present,” Vergara said in prepared remarks to the Senate today.
“The base scenario is based on a working supposition that the
monetary policy rate will continue a path that is similar to the
one indicated in current surveys.”  Traders and investors polled by the central bank on March
26 forecast the benchmark interest rate will remain unchanged at
5 percent through at least October before rising to 5.25 percent
by April 2014. Borrowing costs have stayed at 5 percent for 14
straight monthly meetings.  Beat Forecasts  Since quarterly estimates were last published Dec. 18,
economic growth has exceeded estimates made by analysts for
three straight months, while consumer prices have risen less
than forecast twice.  The economy expanded 5.6 percent last year, exceeding the
central bank’s December forecast of 5.5 percent, while
unemployment fell to 6.2 percent in the three months through
February from 6.4 percent in the year-ago period.  Internal demand and investment will drive growth this year,
expanding 6.1 percent and 7.2 percent respectively, according to
the report. The price of copper, which accounts for more than
half of exports, will ease to $3.50 a pound this year from $3.61
a pound in 2012, it said.  Inflation eased to 1.3 percent in February, the slowest
pace since June 2010. Policy makers forecast inflation will
accelerate to 3 percent in 2014. The board targets 3 percent
inflation plus or minus 1 percentage point over two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
