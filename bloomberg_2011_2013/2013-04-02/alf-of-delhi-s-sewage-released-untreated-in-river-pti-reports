Fifty-four percent of the sewage in
 India ’s capital of New Delhi is treated by Delhi Jal Board with
the remainder released raw into the Yamuna River, Press Trust of
India said, citing a comptroller and auditor general report for
the fiscal year ending March 2012.  The report tabled in the Delhi Assembly today found that
management of industrial sewage flowing untreated through
stormwater drains into the Yamuna to be “deficient,” PTI said.
The Yamuna is the largest tributary of the Ganges River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
