Philippine bonds climbed, pushing
the 25-year yield to a record low, on speculation the country
will win further credit-rating upgrades. The peso was steady,
after gaining 4.6 percent in the past year.  Demand for bonds is strengthening after the central bank
reduced the rate it pays on special-deposit accounts to 2.5
percent from 3 percent on March 14, the second decrease this
year. The Southeast Asian nation won its first investment-grade
rating on March 27 from  Fitch Ratings  and Vishnu Varathan, an
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., says  Standard & Poor’s 
and Moody’s Investors Service may follow suit as the peso
appreciates and the economic outlook improves.  “Philippine bonds are in a very good place,” said
Varathan, who is based in Singapore. “Global investors will
find the Philippines alluring, given the rating story, while
idle funds from a cut in special-deposit accounts will continue
to go into bonds.”  The yield on the government’s 6.125 percent notes due 2037
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.70
percent as of 12:13 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition
Financial Services. That is the lowest level for a benchmark 25-
year security in Bloomberg data going back to 2000. U.S.
Treasuries due May 2037 yield 2.86 percent.  The Philippine economy expanded 6.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, official data show. President  Benigno Aquino  is seeking
more than $17 billion of infrastructure investments to spur
growth to as much as 7 percent this year. The government, which
reported a  budget deficit  of 19.5 billion pesos ($478 million)
for January, will tomorrow release details of its income and
spending in February.  The peso traded at 40.820 per dollar, compared with 40.838
yesterday, Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used
to price options, fell two basis points to 3.89 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
