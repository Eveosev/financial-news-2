The leu retreated after  Romania ’s
central bank provided funding in line with commercial banks’
requests for a fifth week at its repurchase auction yesterday.  The currency trimmed its gain this year as the Banca
Nationala a Romaniei lent 2.2 billion lei ($639 million),
matching banks’ requirements, after scrapping a repo limit on
March 4.  “The central bank allotted 100 percent of bids from seven
participants at its weekly repo, signaling that liquidity
conditions are steadily improving,” analysts at BRD-Groupe
Societe Generale SA, including Bucharest-based Roxana Hulea,
wrote in a note today.  The currency depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 4.4200 by
2:21 p.m. in Bucharest, after strengthening 0.7 percent in the
first three months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
