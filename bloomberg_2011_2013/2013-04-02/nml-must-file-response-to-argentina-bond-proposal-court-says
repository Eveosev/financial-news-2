Holders of defaulted Argentina debt,
led by billionaire  Paul Singer ’s Elliott Management Corp., were
directed by a court to respond to the South American nation’s
proposal to force them to take a sharp discount on their bonds.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  New York  yesterday ordered
Elliot unit NML Capital Ltd. to respond to Argentina’s payment
proposal by April 22. The creditors, who hold bonds that
Argentina repudiated in its record $95 billion default in 2001,
are seeking $1.4 billion. The order means the court is unlikely
to rule before then.  Argentina is appealing a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Thomas Griesa in  Manhattan  that it must pay the full amount owed
to the holders of its defaulted bonds whenever it services the
restructured debt. On March 29, responding to an order by the
court,  Argentina  filed a proposal similar to ones the
bondholders had rejected in earlier debt restructurings.  Argentina proposed forcing NML and the other creditors to
take new bonds worth about one-sixth what Griesa said they’re
owed. The country’s restructured debt fell yesterday on concern
Argentina will default on bonds issued in its 2005 and 2010
restructurings rather than paying NML and other holdout
creditors if the court orders it do so.  Argentina claimed a decision forcing it to pay the
defaulted bondholders immediately would expose it to $43 billion
in additional claims it can’t pay and trigger a new default.  The nation’s officials have said they may ignore the U.S.
court altogether.  The lower court case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of
Argentina, 08-cv-06978, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). The appeal is NML Capital Ltd. v.
Republic of Argentina, 12-00105,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
Second Circuit (New York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
