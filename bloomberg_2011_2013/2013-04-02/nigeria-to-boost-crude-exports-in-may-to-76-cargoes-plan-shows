Nigeria, Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, will boost crude exports to 76 cargoes in May,
according to a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  That compares with 66 shipments due to be exported this
month, according to a revised plan for April. Three Bonny Light
cargoes, two lots of Brass River and one Okono consignment have
been deferred to May from April.  Nigeria plans to ship 11 consignments of Qua Iboe, nine of
Forcados, eight each of Bonny Light and Agbami, five each of
Akpo, Bonga and Brass River, four of Erha, three each of Amenam,
Escravos, Usan and Yoho, two lots of Abo, Antan and Okwori, and
one each of EA Blend, Okono and Pennington in April, the
schedules show.  The May program totals 65 million barrels, or 2.1 million
barrels a day, versus 60.2 million, or 2 million a day,
scheduled for April.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  lifted a two-week force majeure on
Bonny Light exports on March 19. The country has been hit by
rising oil theft and the Nembe Creek Trunkline will close in
April to clear points along the link that are vulnerable to
thieves, according to Shell.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
