The price of German  milk-production
rights  fell to a record low as farmers anticipate the end of the
European Union’s quota system in 2015, agricultural lobby
Deutscher Bauernverband reported.  The right to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cow’s milk
in Germany sold for an average 1 euro cent ($0.013) at auction
today, falling 4 cents from November, the Berlin-based DBV wrote
in a  report  on its website.  Farmers in Germany, the EU’s biggest milk producer, trade
milk-production rights three times a year. Prices have dropped
from 23 cents a kilogram paid in April 2009.  The price drop “shows that the German dairy farmers are
integrating the impending expiration of the milk quotas in their
operational planning,” the DBV wrote.  The price to produce milk fell 4 cents to 1 cent a kilogram
in western  Germany  and declined 2 cents to 1 cent in the eastern
part of the country, according to the DBV.  Farmers traded rights to produce 124,907 metric tons of
milk, according to the auction report, with an offer for 317,742
tons of quota exceeding demand of 172,865 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
