Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African lender controlled by  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , increased the 2012
pay of Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  by 10 percent to 28.7
million rand ($3.1 million) after profit rose.  Brown, 46, received a guaranteed package of 6.2 million
rand, short-term incentives of 11.5 million rand and long-term
share-based awards of about 11 million rand, according to the
Johannesburg-based lender’s  annual report  published today. Brown
was paid 26.1 million rand in 2011.  Nedbank said on Feb. 25 full-year profit climbed 20 percent
to 7.8 billion rand after the lender lured more than half a
million new clients. While larger rivals  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  and
 Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)  cut staff numbers, Nedbank created 450
jobs and expanded outside South Africa’s biggest cities to
increase its share of the low-income market.  Absa, which reported a 13 percent decline in profit in
2012, paid CEO Maria Ramos 16.7 million rand for the period,
according to the Barclays Plc-controlled bank’s annual report.
Separately, Ramos was awarded 5.5 million rand last month from a
management retention program set up in 2010.  Nedbank,  South Africa ’s fourth-largest bank, has  gained  1.4
percent this year compared with the 1.5 percent increase in the
six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
