China’s  yuan  jumped the most since
December and strengthened beyond 6.20 per dollar for the first
time in 19 years after the central bank set a record reference
rate for the currency.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  fixing  by 0.14
percent, the most since Feb. 8, to 6.2586 per dollar today. The
yuan is allowed to trade 1 percent on either side of the rate.
An official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.9 in March, the
highest since April 2012 and above the 50 level that represents
the dividing line between growth and contraction, data showed
yesterday.  “China’s economic growth is gaining momentum, which is
positive for the yuan,” said Kenix Lai, a foreign-exchange
analyst at  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23)  in Hong Kong. “An improved
economy also provides the condition for accelerating reforms on
the  exchange-rate  mechanism.”  The yuan rose 0.15 percent to close at 6.1986 per dollar in
Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. That’s the biggest gain since Dec. 13 and the strongest
level since the government unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993. The currency ended the session at a
0.97 percent premium to the fixing.  China may face “relatively large” capital inflows because
of loose monetary policy in the U.S., China Securities Journal
reported today, citing former central bank adviser Yu Yongding.  Fed Easing  The  Federal Reserve  is using a near-zero benchmark interest
rate and $85 billion a month of open-ended bond purchases to
help revive the  U.S. economy , policies that boost the supply of
dollars and spur demand for higher-yielding assets elsewhere.
China’s 10-year sovereign bonds yield  3.53 percent , compared
with 1.83 percent for similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency
climbed 0.11 percent to 6.1960 per dollar, the strongest level
since Jan. 23, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.15 percent to 6.2880, a 1.4
percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, added six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.22 percent. That’s the
largest increase since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
