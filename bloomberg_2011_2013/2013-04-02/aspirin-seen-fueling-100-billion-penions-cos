Aspirin’s use fighting cancer has the potential to increase pension liabilities by as much as $100 billion by extending  lifespans , a risk modeler said in a  report .  The pension costs for men in the U.K. could rise by 0.7 percent within 20 years if more people begin taking aspirin daily, according to a  statement  by Risk Management Solutions Inc. today. An increase of that magnitude across the more than $13 trillion in pension liabilities in  North America  and  Europe  would be about the same as everyone giving up smoking within a generation, the modeling firm said.  Employers and governments are grappling with obligations to retirees as  low bond yields  make it harder to generate returns on funds set aside for the benefits. Actuaries’ assumptions about costs have been challenged as medical advances and changes in behavior help people live longer.  “Aspirin was not known to be a protection against cancer,” said Andrew Coburn, a senior vice president of RMS’s LifeRisks platform and one of the report’s authors. “It’s another one that people just didn’t expect” when they forecast liabilities.  Daily doses of aspirin reduce the chances of developing or dying from cancer earlier than previously thought and also prevent tumors from spreading, studies published in the Lancet medical journal last year showed.  The findings could increase the use of a drug that’s cheaper and more readily available than other cancer-fighting treatments, RMS said in its report. The modeling firm ran different scenarios about how widely aspirin would be used to predict additional pension costs.  Heart Disease  Some studies show up to 25 percent of people aged 50 and older in the U.S. are already taking aspirin each day, mainly to prevent  heart disease , said Dr. Charlie Fuchs, director of the gastrointestinal cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in  Boston .  “Whatever is driving people to do it, it potentially has an impact on mortality through cancer risk reduction,” he said in a telephone interview today.  Potential side effects, including dangerous bleeding, may discourage doctors from advising patients to take aspirin daily, he said.  “There aren’t recommendations for an average-risk person to take aspirin to prevent cancer,” he said. “In terms of the state of the science, there is even yet more literature to support the benefits of aspirin, but the risks, albeit small, haven’t gone away.”  Bayer, Prudential  Bayer AG, based in Leverkusen,  Germany , invented aspirin and has sold it since 1899. A bottle of 500 generic 325- milligram aspirin tablets marketed by Walgreen Co. costs $8 on drugstore.com, or 1.6 cents a pill. The drug is based on salicin, a chemical found in the bark of the willow tree that was first mentioned about 2,400 years ago by Hippocrates, an ancient Greek considered the father of Western medicine.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  struck deals last year with  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the second- largest U.S. life insurer, to hand over pension obligations after bond yields fell. Prudential Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld said in a  letter  last month that the transfers are the “beginning of a trend.”  Prudential has said longevity risks on pensions can be balanced by the life-insurance policies the  Newark , New Jersey- based company also sells. The longer that life-insurance clients survive, the more time the company has to invest premiums.  To contact the reporter on this story: Noah Buhayar in  New York  at  nbuhayar@bloomberg.net .
