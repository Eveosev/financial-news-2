Fluor Corp. (FLR) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. engineering and construction company, agreed to pay
$1.1 million to settle a U.S. lawsuit alleging it improperly
billed the U.S. Energy Department for marketing costs.  The company denied wrongdoing and settled the case to avoid
the expense and distraction of litigation, Flour said in a
statement today. The lawsuit alleged that funds from an Energy
Department contract were used to pay for lobbying activities
that sought more federal money.  The U.S. joined a false claims lawsuit in federal court in
Spokane,  Washington , accusing Fluor and Fluor Hanford Inc. of
paying two lobbying companies more than $650,000 with money
meant to train emergency personal at the Energy Departmentâ€™s
Hanford nuclear site.  No false claims were made and no lobbying or other laws
were broken, Fluor said. The government contract obligated the
company to encourage other agencies to use the training facility
and the use of consultants to contact other agencies to market
the site was overseen by ranking Energy Department officials,
the company said.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Rambo v. Fluor Hanford LLC, 11-
cv-05037, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Washington
(Spokane).  To contact the reporter on this story:
