Hungary ’s forint climbed to the
strongest level in two weeks and government bond yields dropped
as data showed the country’s manufacturing expansion accelerated
in March.  The currency appreciated for a third day after a purchasing
managers’ index rose to 55.7 from 54.1 in February, according to
an e-mailed statement from MLBKT, the company that compiles the
data. Hungary has struggled to exit a second recession in four
years, caused by the slowdown in the euro area, its main trading
partner, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s measures to cut the
biggest debt burden in the east of the European Union.  “The PMI data may provide some optimism for the forint,”
Imre Kerekgyarto and Karoly Bamli, Budapest-based traders at
Commerzbank AG, wrote by e-mail today.  The forint gained 0.4 percent to 302.52 per euro by 10:54
a.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year
bonds fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.304
percent, the lowest since March 1.  The forint has gained 1.2 percent since Hungary’s central
bank urged caution in monetary easing after cutting the
benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a record low 5 percent on
March 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
