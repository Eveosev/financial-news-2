Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  fell the most in
more than four months after Bill Shope, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., downgraded the shares amid a continuing slump
in personal-computer sales.  The  shares  dropped 5.2 percent to $22.10 at 10:11 a.m. in
New York, and earlier touched $21.90 for the biggest intraday
decline since Nov. 20. Shope downgraded the stock to sell from
neutral and has a $16 target price.  Before today, Hewlett-Packard had surged 64 percent this
year on optimism that  Meg Whitman , the fourth CEO in three
years, could engineer a turnaround. She showed early signs of
progress in February, forecasting fiscal second-quarter profit
that beat estimates as cost cutting and rebounding demand for
enterprise services helped offset waning demand for PCs.  “Sentiment has moved ahead of reality,” Shope wrote in a
research report today. He predicted that the shares could fall
31 percent from yesterday’s closing price.  “The current restructuring actions will be largely
countered by incremental weakness in PCs, enterprise hardware,
services and printing in fiscal 2013,” Shope said.  Global PC shipments may fall 1.3 percent to 345.8 million
units this year, from 350.4 million in 2012, researcher IDC said
last month. Last year, shipments declined 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
