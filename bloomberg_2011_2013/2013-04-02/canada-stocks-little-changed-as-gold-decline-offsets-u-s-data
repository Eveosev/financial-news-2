Canadian stocks  were little changed
as a drop in gold producers offset better-than-estimated data on
U.S. factory orders.  Secure Energy Services Inc. climbed 3.5 percent as Raymond
James Financial Inc. boosted the stock’s rating. Barrick Gold
Corp. and Goldcorp Inc. declined at least 1.5 percent as the
metal was headed for the biggest drop in a month. Silvercorp
Metals Inc. slumped 6.6 percent amid a report that the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission is probing the company over
its battle with short sellers.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 2.24 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,692.90 at 10:19 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge for Canadian equities dropped yesterday as
reports showed U.S. manufacturing slowed and  China ’s factory
output trailed forecasts. The index is up 2.1 percent this year.  Orders placed with U.S. factories increased 3 percent in
February, boosted by a pickup in demand for motor vehicles and
commercial aircraft, a Commerce Department report showed today.
The gain in bookings was the biggest in five months and exceeded
the median forecast for a 2.9 percent rise in a Bloomberg survey
of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
