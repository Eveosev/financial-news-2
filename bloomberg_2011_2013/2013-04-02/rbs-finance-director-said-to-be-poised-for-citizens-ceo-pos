Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
Finance Director Bruce Van Saun may give up his post to run the
lender’s Citizens Financial Group Inc. unit before its initial
public offering, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Van Saun, 55, would replace Ellen Alemany as chief
executive officer of the Rhode Island-based consumer lender,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. The lender is yet to make a final decision on
the move, the person added. Nathan Bostock, RBS’s head of
restructuring and risk, may succeed Van Saun as finance
director, the Financial Times reported today, without saying
where it got the information.  RBS said last month it plans to sell a 25 percent stake in
Citizens after coming under pressure from regulators to boost
capital. Van Saun, who joined RBS in October 2009, has overseen
the shrinking of the Edinburgh-based lender after it received
45.5 billion pounds ($68.8 billion) in the biggest banking
bailout in the world in 2008 and 2009.  Bostock, 52, joined RBS in June 2009 from Santander’s Abbey
National Plc unit. Bostock was named head of wholesale banking
at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in July 2011. Four months later, he
decided to remain at RBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
