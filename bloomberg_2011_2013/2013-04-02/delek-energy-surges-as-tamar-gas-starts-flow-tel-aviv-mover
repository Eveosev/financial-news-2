Delek Energy Systems Ltd. (DLEN) , which has
a stake in the Tamar offshore natural gas field via two units,
surged the most in four months as production started at Israel’s
second-largest gas field.  The  shares  of the company with holdings in Tamar field
partners  Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL)  and  Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  gained
5.2 percent, the most since Dec. 3, to 1,793 shekels, in twice
the three-month average daily volume at 12:43 p.m. in Tel Aviv.
Delek Group Ltd., which holds an 86.7 percent stake in Delek
Energy, advanced 1.3 percent to 1,034 shekels. The benchmark
TA-25 Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,239.77.  The partners in the field, which also include  Noble Energy
Inc. (NBL) ,  Isramco Negev 2 LP (ISRAL)  and  Dor Alon Energy (DRAL)  in Israel (1988)
Ltd., said gas started flowing on March 30. The field, in the
eastern Mediterranean Sea, is estimated to hold 9 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas and along with the Dalit field could supply
Israel with gas for two decades.  “Because of the gas flow at Tamar, investors are lowering
the risk of the project and that raises its valuation,” Guil Bashan, an analyst at IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in
Tel Aviv, said today by phone. “This is good news for the
gas explorers.”  Delek Energy shares have advanced 11 percent this year
compared with a 0.5 percent rise in the Bloomberg World Oil &
Gas Index. Delek Group shares have advanced 19 percent. The flow
from Tamar is expected to contribute about 1 percent to  Israel ’s
gross domestic product, the Bank of Israel said in a March 24
report, forecasting that the economy will grow 3.8 percent in
2013, including the contribution from gas.  UBS AG (UBSN)  today raised the price estimate for Delek Group and
Delek Drilling by 2.2 percent to 1,170 shekels and 18.9 shekels,
respectively. The bank also increased Avner’s price projection
to 3.39 shekels from 3.29 shekels and that of Isramco to 0.72
shekel from 0.66 shekel.  Delek Drilling dropped 1.2 percent to 15.49 shekels. Avner
fell 1.1 percent to 2.67 shekels. Isramco slid 0.5 percent to
0.664 shekel. Dor Alon gained 1 percent to 34.74 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
