European Union carbon permits for
December rose for the fourth time in five days as traders
focused on lawmakers’ proposals to boost prices after data
showed emissions declined 1.4 percent in 2012.  The benchmark future closed 2.7 percent higher at 4.94
euros ($6.34) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, after having fallen as much as 6 percent in earlier
trading.  Carbon emissions fell to 1.787 billion tons last year from
2011, according to incomplete European Commission  data  from 89
percent of factories and power stations. Discharges from the 68
percent of airlines that submitted reports by the April 30
deadline totaled 55 million tons, the data showed.  “The published data will not have a substantial impact on
prices, since there haven’t been substantial changes to market
fundamentals,” according to Guido Busato, chief executive
officer of Eco-Way, an Italian emissions-trading company based
in Milan. “Instead, we think that price movements will be based
on the political decision that will take place on April 16,”
when the European Parliament votes on a measure to enable
temporary cuts in the supply of permits, he said.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
rose 3 percent to 34 euro cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
