U.S. bank-card delinquencies have
dropped to their lowest levels in more than 18 years as
borrowers maintain a conservative approach to personal finances,
according to an American Bankers Association report.  The rate of bank card accounts 30 days or more overdue fell
to 2.47 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to the
quarterly report from the Washington-based industry group.
That’s the lowest ABA-recorded rate since NBC’s ‘Friends’ first
aired and  Tiger Woods  became the youngest golfer to win the U.S.
Amateur Championship in 1994.  The delinquency rate is down from 2.75 percent in the third
quarter of 2012 and is well below the 15-year average of 3.87
percent, the ABA said in a statement. ABA Chief Economist  James Chessen  credited the decrease to consumers wanting to protect
themselves against continuing economic uncertainty.  “Consumers continue to carefully manage their finances in
an effort to get debt levels under control and build up a secure
financial base,” Chessen said in a statement. “The sharp
decline in delinquencies reinforces the notion that the economic
recovery has become more self-sustaining and is on a path to
increased growth.”  Chessen said that three home-related loan categories
tracked by the report also showed delinquency declines -- the
first time in a year they were all down at the same time. The
home-related delinquencies still “remain at elevated levels,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
