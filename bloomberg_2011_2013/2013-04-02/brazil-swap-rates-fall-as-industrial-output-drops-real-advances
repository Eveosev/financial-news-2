Brazil ’s swap rates declined to a
four-week low after a report showed industrial output fell the
most since 2008, fueling speculation that the central bank will
refrain from raising borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.43 percent at 9:46
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the lowest level on a closing basis since
March 6. The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.0156 per dollar.  Industrial production contracted 3.2 percent in February
from a year earlier and fell 2.5 percent from the prior month,
the biggest drop since December 2008, the national statistics
agency reported today.  “This shows that the economy is still stalled,” Luis Otavio de Souza Leal, the chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA
in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview. “This data will
create more uncertainty about first-quarter growth and an
increase in the Selic rate.”  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting indicated
that an increase in the target lending  rate  known as the Selic
from a record low 7.25 percent wasn’t imminent as policy makers
said “a cautious management of monetary policy” was needed.
Central bank President Alexandre Tombini is due to speak before
the Senate at 10 a.m. today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
