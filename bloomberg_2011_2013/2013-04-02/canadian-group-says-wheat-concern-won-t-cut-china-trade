The Canadian International Grains
Institute said wheat-quality concerns on shipments to  China 
won’t disrupt trade.  COFCO Corp., China’s largest grain trader, said some
supplies of spring wheat from Canada lacked sufficient proteins,
Earl Geddes, the institute’s chief executive officer, said today
in a telephone interview from Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada.
Officials from the grain group visited the Asian nation in
response to the complaints.  Quality concerns are “rare,” and “the grain industry, if
it wants to retain the ‘best wheat in the world’ brand, needs to
respond to those customers in an appropriate way,” Geddes said.  The U.S. is the world’s top wheat exporter, followed by
Canada. State-owned COFCO, based in Beijing, probably won’t
change to U.S. supplies because of protein concerns, Geddes
said.  “If  Canada  didn’t go to meet with them, address the issue
with them and show them how to utilize Canadian wheat more
effectively, they might,” he said. “But this incident doesn’t
say that COFCO is going to shift its buying patterns at all.
This isn’t a story that should be blown out of proportion. This
is regular trade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
