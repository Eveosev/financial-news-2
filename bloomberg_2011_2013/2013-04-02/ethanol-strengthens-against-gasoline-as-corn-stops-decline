Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline as corn halted its slide, signaling higher production
costs for the biofuel.  The spread, based on the May gasoline and ethanol
contracts, contracted 7.36 cents to 70.19 cents a gallon at
11:14 a.m.  New York  time. Corn, which dropped 13 percent in the
past two sessions, was little changed today on speculation the
lower prices will attract demand from investors and end-users.  “Ethanol doesn’t seem to want to stray too far away from
it,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management
LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “Corn is the biggest moving part, and
you have no incentive to stick your neck out and take on a bunch
of excess risk.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  climbed 1.9 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.345 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The April contract, which expires tomorrow, added 2.4 cents to
$2.385 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for May delivery declined 5.46 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $3.0469 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
The grain surged to a record in August after drought devastated
yields, forcing as many as 20 ethanol plants to idle output,
according to the  Renewable Fuels Association  in  Washington .  Prices for the grain tumbled a March 28 Agriculture
Department report showed domestic inventories of corn on March 1
totaled 5.399 billion bushels, compared to analysts’ estimates
for 4.995 billion.  Corn for May delivery was unchanged at $6.4225 a bushel in
Chicago. Trading was 79 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 1 cent
a gallon, up from minus 1 cent yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
