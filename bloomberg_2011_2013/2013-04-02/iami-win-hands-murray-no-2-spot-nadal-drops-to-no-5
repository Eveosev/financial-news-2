U.S. Open champion Andy Murray
leapfrogged Roger Federer to regain the No. 2 ranking on the
men’s tennis tour after winning the Miami Masters.  Murray saved a match point against David Ferrer to win the
Miami final 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) two days ago.  The 25-year-old Briton moved up one spot behind top-ranked
Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  in the ATP World Tour rankings. Murray
was last ranked second on Aug. 17, 2009, when he held the spot
for four weeks. Men’s Grand Slam record holder Federer of
Switzerland dropped to No. 3.  Ferrer moved back to No. 4, pushing French Open champion
and fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal down to fifth place. Nadal and
Federer didn’t play in Miami.  The men’s clay-court season, which ends with the French
Open in May, starts next week.  There were no changes at the top of the rankings of the
women’s WTA tour. Serena Williams of the U.S. remains No. 1
after she beat French Open champion Maria Sharapova of  Russia ,
ranked second, in the Miami final. Victoria Azarenka of Belarus,
who didn’t play in Miami because of injury, is third while
Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska is fourth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
