Hog futures extended a rally to the
highest price since July on speculation that consumers will
boost purchases of cheaper U.S. pork as an alternative to more-
expensive meats. Cattle were little changed.  Wholesale  pork  has slumped 3.3 percent to 77.36 cents a
pound in the 12 months through yesterday, while  beef  rose 3.9
percent to $1.9053 a pound, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Chicken  breasts  at Georgia docks are up 8 percent in the
past year at $1.75 a pound yesterday, government data show.  “Poultry prices are way high, and beef prices, too,
compared to pork,”  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at
Northstar Commodity Investments Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a
telephone interview.  Pork is “still really cheap,” he said.
“That does help from a demand standpoint.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.7 percent to 92.225
cents a pound at 9:38 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching 92.45 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 9. Prices are up 4.5 percent since March 19.  Retail pork and beef may climb as much as 4 percent this
year, the USDA forecast in a March 25  report . Last year, beef
prices increased 6.4 percent while pork advanced 0.3 percent.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell less than 0.1 percent
to $1.2405 a pound in  Chicago , after fluctuating between gains
and losses. The commodity lost 6.2 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement declined 0.2
percent to $1.474 a pound. Prices were down 4.3 percent this
year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
