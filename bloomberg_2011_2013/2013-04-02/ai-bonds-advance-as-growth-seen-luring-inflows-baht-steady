Thailand ’s government bonds advanced
on speculation the nation’s improving economy will lure inflows
from overseas investors. The baht was little changed.  The  finance ministry  said March 29 that it raised its 2013
growth forecast to 5.3 percent from 5 percent because of
increased private consumption. Foreign funds pumped a net $4
billion into local debt and stocks in the first quarter, Bank of
Thailand Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said the
same day, driving a 4.3 percent gain in the baht against the
dollar this year, the best performance in Asia.  “Bond yields will remain under downward pressure and the
baht will stay on a gradual appreciation path as fund inflows
will probably continue,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader
on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd. in  Tokyo .  The yield on the 3.625 percent debt due June 2023 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.54 percent as of
8:47 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate reached 3.46 percent on March 28, the lowest level
since Nov. 6.  The central bank will leave its benchmark interest rate
unchanged tomorrow at 2.75 percent, according to 17 of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with one predicting a cut of
25 basis points. The monetary authority has held the rate since
October, when it reduced it from 3 percent.  The baht traded at 29.32 per dollar, compared with 29.33
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, dropped four basis points to 5.16
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
