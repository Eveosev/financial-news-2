President Narayana Kocherlakota said U.S. central bankers can
spur economic growth by clarifying the conditions that would
prompt a slowing or halt to the Fed’s  asset purchases .  “Monetary policy should be more accommodative,”
Kocherlakota said in the text of prepared remarks given in Grand
Forks, North Dakota today. “The FOMC could reduce the public’s
level of policy uncertainty by clarifying the nature of the
economic conditions that would lead the Committee to reduce or
stop its current asset purchases.”  The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has
debated when to start reducing the pace of monthly bond buying
as the economic expansion gathers steam and some officials voice
concerns about the risks from continuing the program. Fed
officials last month affirmed a plan to keep buying $85 billion
a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.  Kocherlakota, who does not vote on policy this year, said
last month he favors lowering the  unemployment rate  the Fed has
said may prompt a policy tightening. His remarks are similar to
a speech he gave on March 27 in Edina,  Minnesota .  The U.S. central bank says it will keep its  benchmark
interest rate  near zero as long as the jobless rate is above 6.5
percent and projected inflation is no more than 2.5 percent. The
FOMC has provided less specific guidance on how long it expects
to continue quantitative easing, noting that officials are
looking for substantial improvement in the labor market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
