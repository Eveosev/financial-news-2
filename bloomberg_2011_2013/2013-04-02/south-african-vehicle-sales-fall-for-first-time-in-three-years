South African new vehicle  sales  fell
2.1 percent in March from a year earlier, its first decline
since December 2009.  Purchases declined to 54,946 last month from 56,152 a year
earlier, the Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed  statement 
today.  A weaker rand and “rising inflationary pressures facing
consumers would damp growth in consumers’ real disposable
income,” Naamsa said.  The Reserve Bank kept the benchmark  repurchase rate  at the
lowest level in more than 30 years last month as inflation near
the top end of its target limited the room it had to stimulate
an economy that grew 2.5 percent last year, the slowest pace
since a 2009 recession.  The inflation rate will breach the top of the bank’s target
of 3 percent to 6 percent in the third quarter,  Reserve Bank 
Governor Gill Marcus said on March 20. The rand has dropped 8
percent against the dollar in 2013, the worst performer among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Passenger-car sales fell 3.6 percent to 37,596 in March,
while vehicle exports rose 18 percent to 28,338.  To contact the reporter on this story:
