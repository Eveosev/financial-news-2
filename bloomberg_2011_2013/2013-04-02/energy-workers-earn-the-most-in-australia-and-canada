Australia, Norway and  Canada  lead
the world with the highest salaries in the oil and natural gas
industry, according to a survey by a job-recruitment firm.  Average annual salaries for locally employed professionals
in the oil and gas industry are the highest in Australia, at the
equivalent of $163,600, while Norwegians earned $152,600,
according to a  study  by  Hays Plc, (HAS)  a London-based recruitment
firm, and Oil and Gas Job Search, an employment website. Average
salaries in the U.S. were $121,400, ranking below Canada,  New
Zealand  and the Netherlands, the report said.  Rising demand for fossil fuels and a “relatively stable”
price for oil has helped to boost salaries for the five million
people employed by the industry globally, the report said.  Brent
crude , the global benchmark, has average $110.22 during the past
12 months and traded at $110.50 at 11:05 a.m. in New York today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite the concerns in Europe and a slowdown in China’s
growth, the sentiment in the oil and gas industry remains
positive,” said Duncan Freer, managing director of Oil and Gas
Job Search, in an e-mailed statement today.  The global average annual salary was $87,300, an 8.5
percent increase from the previous year, according to the
report. Salaries are expected to increase 4 percent to 6 percent
this year, according to the report. Local workers in  Sudan 
earned the least in the survey at $31,100.  The salary survey received data from about 25,000 people in
53 countries, covering 24 different job categories, including
Business Development, Drilling and Petroleum Engineering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
