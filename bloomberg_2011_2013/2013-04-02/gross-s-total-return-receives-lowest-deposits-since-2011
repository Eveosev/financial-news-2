Bill Gross ’s  Pimco Total Return
Fund (PTTRX) , the world’s largest mutual fund, attracted $32 million in
investor deposits in March, the lowest amount since December
2011.  The Total Return Fund drew $2.2 billion in the first
quarter of 2013, according to data from Chicago-based research
firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  Investors last year poured $18 billion
into the fund, which has assets of about $289 billion.  Investors anticipating an end to the 30-year bond rally are
turning to stocks as the U.S. economy shows signs of
strengthening and equities have rallied to record levels,
erasing losses from the 2008 financial crisis. Mutual funds that
buy U.S. stocks have drawn an estimated $18.5 billion this year
through March 20, compared with withdrawals of $16.4 billion in
the first three months of 2012, according to the Washington-
based Investment Company Institute. The renewed demand hasn’t
come at the expense of bond funds, which gathered $57.6 billion
this year through March 20, ICI’s data show.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s flagship fund had $1.35
billion in withdrawals in the final month of 2011 and its first
ever annual redemptions that year of about $5 billion as Gross
trailed some rivals, according to data from Morningstar. Last
year, the Total Return Fund rebounded as it advanced 10.4
percent, beating 95 percent of peers, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. This year, the fund returned 0.7 percent, ahead of
89 percent of similarly managed funds.  Gross decreased his holdings of Treasuries in February to
28 percent from 30 percent in January, according to the
company’s website. He cut mortgage holdings to 36 percent, the
lowest level since August 2011, from 37 percent in January.  Pimco, based in Newport Beach,  California , is a unit of
Munich-based insurer  Allianz SE (ALV)  and manages $2 trillion in
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
