March was the “most devastating”
month of the two-year Syrian uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, with 6,005 documented deaths, according to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights.  The dead include 2,080 civilians, 1,400 rebels and 1,464
soldiers, the U.K.-based activist group said on its Facebook
page. The group said it has documented the deaths of 62,554
people from March 18, 2011, when the first casualty in the
unrest was reported, to March 31 this year.  The civil war began with peaceful protests that turned
bloody after the government began attacking demonstrators.  Violent clashes between Assad’s troops and rebel forces
were reported on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, today
killing 19 people, the activist Local Coordination Committees
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
