Chong Hing Bank Ltd. (1111) , the Hong Kong
lender partly owned by the Liu family, rose to a two-year high
in local trading after a report that shareholders will send a
signal they’re ready to sell.  Shares of Chong Hing rose as much as 12 percent to the
highest level since February 2011, and traded at HK$20.80, up
9.2 percent, at 10:49 a.m. That brings their gain this year to
28 percent, outperforming a 1.1 percent decline since December
in the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  The Liu family may
confirm its intention to sell Chong Hing,  Apple Daily  reported
today, citing unidentified people.  Takeover speculation has mounted since November, when Lau Wai-man was named chief executive officer at Chong Hing to
replace Liu Lit-chi, a member of the founding family who spent
more than 50 years at the bank. Lau last month said Chong Hing
is open to proposals from prospective buyers for all or part of
the bank.  “We don’t have any information that needs to be disclosed
for now,” Chong Hing said in an e-mailed reply to questions
from  Bloomberg News . “We are not aware of any specific reasons
contributing to the share price movement today.”  The number of publicly traded family-run banks in Hong Kong
has fallen to four from six more than a decade ago after the
industry drew buyers including  China Merchants Bank Co. (3968) , which
paid $4.7 billion in 2009 for the Wu family’s Wing Lung Bank
Ltd.  Bank of East Asia Ltd. ,  Dah Sing Banking Group Ltd. (2356)  and
 Wing Hang Bank Ltd. (302)  are also owned by families.  To contact the reporter on this story:
