Jerome Cahuzac, who resigned as
French budget minister on March 19 over holding offshore
accounts, said his initial denials were not true. He apologized.  “I was caught in a spiral of lies,” Cahuzac  said on his
blog today . “To the president, to the prime minister, to my
former colleagues of the government, I ask for mercy for the
damage I caused,” he said. Cahuzac, 60, asked to be heard by
two Paris judges today to confess his misconduct.  Cahuzac said he held 600,000 euros ($770,000) in an
offshore account and promised to repatriate the money to  France .
He did not say where the bank account was located.  Judges today charged Cahuzac with tax fraud, Agence France-
Presse reported, citing his lawyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
