The Bovespa index rebounded from a
one-week low as Brazilian homebuilders rallied amid speculation
that policy makers will maintain record-low borrowing costs.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  rose the most on the benchmark after
saying it will turn away from government-sponsored projects
aimed at low-income families in favor of higher-end projects in
its 2013-2015 business plan. Competitors  Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  and  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  also
advanced.  The Bovespa climbed 0.5 percent to 56,152.14 at 10:26 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Forty-seven  stocks  gained on the gauge while 19
declined. Brazil’s swap rates on contracts due in January 2015
fell 0.04 percentage point to 8.45 percent after a report showed
industrial production contracted more than forecast in February.
The real appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.0170 per dollar.  “The industrial production figures came in significantly
lower than expected, which makes investors price in a low
probability of  interest rates  going up in the next policy
meeting,” Gustavo Mendonca, an economist at Oren Investimentos,
said by phone from Rio de Janeiro.  Industrial production  contracted 3.2 percent in February
from a year earlier, after growing a revised 5.5 percent in the
prior month, Brazil’s statistics agency reported today. The
median forecast of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
output to shrink 2.4 percent.  Rossi added 4.3 percent to 3.18 reais. MRV climbed 1.4
percent to 8.51 reais. Brookfield rose 0.8 percent to 2.46
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
