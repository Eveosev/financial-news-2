Spain had its wettest March on
record, with more than triple the usual amount of rainfall, the
government’s weather office reported.  The country got an average 157 millimeters (6.18 inches) of
rain last month, the most in records going back to 1947,
compared with normal values of 46 millimeters, the Agencia
Estatal de Meteorologia wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Spain’s water reserves, used to irrigate the country’s
crops including corn during the dry summer months, are at 82
percent of capacity, the Agriculture Ministry reported today.
That compares with 62 percent at the same time a year ago.  “March was extremely rainy in almost all of Spain,” Aemet
wrote. “The large accumulated quantities are more due to the
persistence of the precipitation than the intensity.”  Temperatures averaged 10.6 degrees Celsius (51.1 degrees
Fahrenheit) in March, 0.1 degree below normal values for the
month, the weather office wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
