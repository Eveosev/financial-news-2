Carbon permit prices fell before
European Commission data today that will probably show factories
and power stations emitted less  greenhouse gases  last year than
in 2011.  European Union carbon allowances for December fell 4.8
percent to 4.58 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London at 9:53 a.m. The contract jumped 16 percent
last week.  Carbon emissions  in the world’s biggest greenhouse gas
market by traded volume may have dropped 0.8 percent to 1.88
billion metric tons in 2012, according to a Bloomberg New Energy
Finance estimate on March 25. Analysts at Thomson Reuters Point
Carbon predict a decline of 1.4 percent, half the pace of 2011,
while Jefferies Group Inc. and Virtuse Energy sro in  Prague  both
estimate a drop of 0.6 percent.  Today’s data will include emissions from airlines for the
first time. The information may not be complete for the 31
countries in the EU’s emissions trading system.  Certified Emission Reduction credits for December dropped 4
cents, or 12 percent, to 29 euro cents a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
