Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela  remained in an undisclosed hospital for a sixth
day as he recovered from pneumonia.  The government didn’t give an update on his condition
today. Mandela’s family visited him after his condition improved
over the weekend,  Mac Maharaj , a spokesman for President  Jacob Zuma , said yesterday.  Mandela, 94, was admitted to the hospital before midnight
on March 27 to treat pneumonia, and doctors performed a
procedure to drain his lungs of liquid during the weekend. The
nation’s first black president has been hospitalized three times
since December, including a scheduled check-up last month.  South Africans shouldn’t have a “lot of anxiety”
regarding Mandela’s health, Zuma said in a pre-recorded
interview broadcast on CNBC Africa today. The country must
“take it easy” and the former president will eventually return
to his home, he said.  Mandela served as president for five years after the
 African National Congress  in 1994 won the first elections since
the end of all-white, minority rule. He spent 27 years in
prison, most of it on Robben Island where he contracted
tuberculosis, for his opposition to apartheid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
