Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan ,
 Canada ’s third-biggest retirement-fund manager, posted a 13
percent return on investments in 2012, led by real estate,
private equity and stocks.  Net investment income rose to C$14.7 billion ($14.5
billion) from C$11.7 billion in 2011, the Toronto-based pension-
fund manager said today in a statement. The fund managed C$129.5
billion in assets as of Dec. 31, up from C$117.1 billion a year
earlier.  “The investment team successfully navigated significant
risks and turmoil in the global economy again in 2012 to earn an
excellent rate of return,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Leech,
65, said in the statement. “This was an oustanding achievement
during a challenging year.”  Ontario Teachers’ beat the 9.4 percent median return of
Canadian pension funds in 2012, based on a Jan. 29 report by
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Investor Services unit. In
comparison, Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec , Canada’s
largest pension- fund manager , returned 9.6 percent, Ontario
Municipal Employees Retirement System gained 10 percent, and
Healthcare of Ontario  Pension Plan  rose 17 percent.  Teachers’ is responsible for investing and managing
pensions for about 303,000 active and retired teachers in
Canada’s most populous province.  Teachers’ said public and private equity investments
returned 14 percent in 2012, while fixed income holdings
returned 5.1 percent. Commodities lost 1.9 percent last year.  Investments held by Teachers’ private-equity unit returned
19 percent in 2012, the pension fund said. Teachers’ Private
Capital managed C$12 billion of assets at the end of the year,
compared with C$12.2 billion a year earlier.  Real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and
timberland returned about 15 percent. The fund’s real-estate
portfolio, which had C$16.9 billion of assets, returned 19
percent for the year.  Teachers’ estimated funding shortfall was C$5.1 billion,
down from C$9.6 billion a year earlier, after changes to
inflation-protection guarantees for plan members were announced
in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
