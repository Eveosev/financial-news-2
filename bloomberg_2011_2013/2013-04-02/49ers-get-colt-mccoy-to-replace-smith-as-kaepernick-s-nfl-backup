The San Francisco 49ers acquired
quarterback Colt McCoy from the Cleveland Browns to replace Alex Smith as a backup to starter Colin Kaepernick.  The 49ers sent fifth- and seventh-round picks in this
year’s National Football League draft to the Browns for McCoy
and a sixth-round selection, according to the Cleveland Plain
Dealer. The 49ers and Browns confirmed the trade in statements
that didn’t specify the rounds of the draft picks involved.  McCoy, 25, was a third-round draft choice of the Browns in
2010 and had a 6-15 record as a starter in Cleveland. McCoy was
a backup last season to Brandon Weeden, a first-round pick in
2012, and became expendable when new Browns coach Rob Chudzinski
last month signed free-agent quarterback Jason Campbell to
compete with Weeden.  The 49ers in March traded Smith, who had a 38-36-1 record
in seven seasons as a starter, to the Kansas City Chiefs. The No.
1 overall pick in the 2005 draft, Smith had been the 49ers’
starter through the first nine games last season before
suffering a concussion and being replaced by Kaepernick, who
helped the team reach the Super Bowl.  McCoy passed for 4,388 yards, 21 touchdowns and 20
interceptions with the Browns.  The 49ers also have Scott Tolzien at quarterback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
