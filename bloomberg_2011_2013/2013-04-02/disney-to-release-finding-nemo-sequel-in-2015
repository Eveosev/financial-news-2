Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s Pixar announced
plans to release “Finding Dory,” a sequel to its 2003 animated
blockbuster “Finding Nemo,” with Ellen DeGeneres returning as
the voice of the forgetful blue tang fish.  The film is scheduled to reach theaters on Nov. 25, 2015,
Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement.
Director Andrew Stanton, who won a best animated picture Oscar
for the original film, will return to helm the sequel.  The sequel, set partly on the California coast, will
include returning characters, such as Nemo and his father
Marlin, as well as new ones, Disney said.  “I have waited for this day for a long, long, long, long,
long, long time,” DeGeneres, a talk show host, said in the
statement. “I’m not mad it took this long. I know the people at
Pixar were busy creating ‘Toy Story 16.’ But the time they took
was worth it. The script is fantastic.”  “Finding Nemo” took in $921.7 million worldwide in ticket
sales on a budget of $94 million, according to researcher
 BoxOfficeMojo.com .  To contact the reporter on this story:
