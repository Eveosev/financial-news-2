Afrisam Ltd., a South African cement
manufacturer partly owned by the Public Investment Corp., said
it completed a debt-reduction program and Pembani Group is
gaining operational control of the company.  Afrisam’s “balance sheet has been significantly
strengthened by an overall debt reduction” in excess of 15
billion rand ($1.6 billion), the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. “A consortium of local financial institutions
has recently provided the company with a sustainable long-term
debt solution.”  The PIC, a state-owned company which manages assets of
about 1.2 trillion rand, including government employee pension
funds, and Pembani, an  investment company  with stakes in the
 energy industry , have injected “significant equity” in
Afrisam, according to the statement.  Pembani is led by  Phuthuma Nhleko, a former CEO of phone
company  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
