Romania’s credit rating should be
improved because the country has narrowed its  budget deficit  and
is economically stable, Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian said.  With the central bank likely to leave borrowing costs
unchanged, an upgrade would give lenders in the eastern European
nation better access to funding, Vosganian told a conference
today in Bucharest.  “The rating agencies should upgrade Romania’s sovereign
rating,” Vosganian said. “This move would help improve the
funding of the banking system during these times of crisis.”  Romania embarked on one of the European Union’s toughest
austerity plans in 2010 by cutting state wages and increasing
the value-added tax. The government, which received a bailout
from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union,
trimmed the budget deficit to 2.5 percent of economic output
last year from 7.2 percent in 2009.  Romania is rated at the lowest investment grade at  Fitch
Ratings  and Moody’s Investors Service. It’s been at one level
below investment grade at  Standard & Poor’s  since 2008.  Credit-default swaps, which measure the cost of insuring
Romanian debt against non-payment for five years, traded at 241
points today after reaching 190 points on Jan. 28, which was the
lowest in about five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
