Spain ’s government is waiting for
the result of negotiations with the European Union on its  budget
deficit  goals before deciding on its  tax policy  for 2014.  “Tax decisions for 2014 haven’t been taken yet and will
obviously depend on negotiations with the European Commission
and other EU partners,” Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said
during a conference in Madrid yesterday. “It will all depend on
the deficit targets that are established and on their underlying
economic assumptions.”  The government is requesting an increase of its deficit
target in 2013 to about 6 percent of gross domestic product from
4.5 percent as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy heads for
a second year of  recession .  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  fell two basis
points to 4.92 percent at 9:15 a.m. in Madrid, leaving the
spread with similar German maturities at 3.61 percentage points.  The commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive, yesterday
said it will arrive at a decision on Spain’s budget performance
after the European statistics agency Eurostat releases budget
data for 2012 on April 22.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December 2011,
has said he cut the deficit to 7 percent of GDP last year from 9
percent in 2011. Including aid to the banking sector, the figure
was 10.2 percent of GDP, up from 9.4 percent.  ‘Crucial’ Talks  Montoro described the current weeks of talks as “crucial”
and said he was pleased that a “change of philosophy” has led
the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Commission to
water down their austerity prescriptions.  “Thankfully what is changing is the concept of focusing
solely on deficit targets without taking into account the impact
on the economy,” he said. “The EU has no interest in Spain’s
extending its economic recession.”  Montoro also said the government will implement a new plan
to pay public suppliers so a maximum delay of 30 days is
respected. The law will need to be changed, Montoro said,
without providing further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
