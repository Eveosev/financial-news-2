Italy’s joblessness fell in February
from the highest level since at least 1992 as recession-scarred
businesses await tax cuts that could stimulate growth.  The  unemployment rate  declined to 11.6 percent from 11.7
percent in January, the Rome-based national statistics office
Istat said in a preliminary report today. That’s less than the
11.8 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Unemployment
remained above 10 percent for an 11th month.  Italian businesses are bracing for a fiscal stimulus after
voters in February repudiated Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
program of tax increases and budget cuts. While rivalries in the
deadlocked parliament have so far prevented the formation of a
government, each of the four biggest political parties has said
they are in favor of easing the tax burden.  The economy shrank 1 percent in the three months ended Dec.
31, the sixth consecutive quarterly decline.  Editors: Jerrold Colten, Dan Liefgreen  To contact the reporter on this story:
