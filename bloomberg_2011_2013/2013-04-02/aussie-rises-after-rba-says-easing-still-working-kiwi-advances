Australia ’s dollar advanced against
most of its major peers after the Reserve Bank kept interest
rates unchanged and said existing monetary stimulus is working.  “There are a number of indications that the substantial
easing of monetary policy during late 2011 and 2012 is having an
expansionary effect on the economy,” Reserve Bank of Australia
Governor Glenn Stevens said in a statement today.  Interest-rate
swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see an 15 percent
chance the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate on May 7.
New Zealand’s dollar climbed after data showed the nation’s
commodity export prices gained.  The RBA is “sounding more confident that monetary policy
is still powerful -- it’s not pushing on a string, even at these
low rates,” said  Sean Callow , a Sydney-based senior currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  “Speculators have ramped up
their Aussie dollar positions very substantially.”  Australia’s currency added 0.4 percent to $1.0465 as of
3:15 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday. It slid 0.1 percent to 97.04
yen. The Aussie rose 0.2 percent against the greenback last
quarter and 8.9 percent versus the yen.  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar was up 0.4 percent to 84.03 U.S.
cents. It slid 0.1 percent to 77.96 yen after a 9.7 percent
quarterly gain.  Yields on Australian 10-year bonds touched 3.386 percent,
the lowest level since March 6, before trading unchanged at 3.41
percent. The three-year rate added two basis points to 2.90
percent.  RBA Policy  “Looking ahead, the peak in resource investment is drawing
close,” the RBA said after leaving overnight cash-rate
unchanged at 3 percent, which was predicted by all 28 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. “There will, therefore, be more scope
for some other areas of demand to strengthen.”  In New Zealand,  commodity export prices  gained 7.4 percent
in March in local currency terms from the previous month, when
they rose a revised 1.1 percent, ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. said
in a report today.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate was at 2.87 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
