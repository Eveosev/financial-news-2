Peru’s sol rose to a one-week high
as companies sold dollars to pay taxes and after the central
bank eased the pace of increases in dollar reserve requirements.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5860 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Datatec.  Peruvian companies have until today to meet their
obligations for the 2012 tax year. The central bank on March 27
increased lenders’ dollar reserve requirements 25 basis points
this month after raising them 225 basis points in the first
quarter. The increase was smaller than analysts expected and
hasn’t created the dollar scarcity that followed previous
increments, said  Roberto Flores , the head of research at
Inteligo SAB, a Lima based brokerage.  “Liquidity in dollars hasn’t been reduced as much this
time,” Flores said by phone from Lima. “This, together with
the tax payments, is allowing the sol to gain ground against the
dollar.”  The central bank bought $20 million in the foreign-exchange
market today to stem gains in the sol and said on its website it
paid an average 2.5870 per dollar.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond
due August 2020 was little changed at 3.77 percent in Lima,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
