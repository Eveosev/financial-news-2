  Hong Kong  stocks rebounded as the
market reopened from the Easter holiday after the city’s
benchmark index posted its first quarterly decline since June.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. led Chinese developers
higher, gaining 4.8 percent after the Hang Seng Property Index
fell 12 percent from this year’s high through yesterday.
PetroChina Co., Asia’s biggest company by market value, gained
2.6 percent as China’s oil consumption increased in February.
 Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , which gets 72 percent of its revenue
from North America, slid 1.9 percent after after data on U.S.
manufacturing missed estimates.  “It seems to me there is a technical rebound,” Linus Yip,
a Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd.,
said by telephone. “For Hong Kong, it already dropped a lot in
the past two months, but the U.S. market is still at a historic
high.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  advanced 0.3 percent to 22,374.56 as of
10:35 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index fell 6.4 percent through
yesterday from this year’s high on Jan. 30.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.3 percent to
10,929.80 after rising as much as 0.9 percent and falling as
much as 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
