The euro is poised to drop to the
lowest since November against the dollar, IG Markets Securities
Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  “Attention is on the March 27 low of $1.2750,” Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst at IG Markets in  Tokyo , wrote in a research
note today. “If that support is broken, there are no noteworthy
technical points until the $1.26 level.”  At $1.268, Ishikawa points to the 62 percent retracement on
the Fibonacci chart from the Feb. 1 high of $1.3711 to the July
24 low of $1.2043. Fibonacci analysis theorizes that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a new high or low.  The next level the euro could target is the Nov. 13 low of
$1.2662, Ishikawa wrote.  The euro was little changed at $1.2848 as of 8:48 a.m. in
 London  from yesterday. The 17-nation currency has fallen 2.6
percent this year.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an area on a
