Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades
today officially established a commission to investigate the
reasons that led to Cyprus’s economic crisis, especially in its
banking industry, and identify those responsible.  “A series of acts or omissions by individuals authorized
to manage the economy and its banking system led the country to
the brink of bankruptcy and to the dissolution of one of its
largest banks” and the loss of billions of euros from deposit
losses at another, Anastasiades said today at a ceremony to
swear in the commission’s members, according to a statement from
the government’s press office.  Cyprus agreed last month to impose losses on uninsured
depositors at the country’s two biggest banks,  Bank of Cyprus
Plc  and  Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl (BOCY) , in return for 10 billion euros
($12.8 billion) in international aid from the  International
Monetary Fund , the  European Central Bank  and the European Union.
Cyprus Popular was closed down as part of the deal.  The president and the government would be equally
responsible if they didn’t respond to demands from ordinary
citizens for justice and for those responsible to be punished,
Anastasiades said, according to the statement.  The president called on commission members, comprised of
three former supreme court judges, to prioritize investigation
of any accusations relating to him, his family members as well
as at the law office where he was previously a partner.  To contact the reporters on this story:
