The  Cyprus General Market Index (CYSMMAPA) 
declined the most in three weeks as the stock market reopened
following a two-week closure imposed as policy makers wrangled
over the terms of a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout.  The benchmark measure retreated 2.6 percent to 99.46 at the
close in Nicosia as Hellenic Bank Pcl sank 20 percent, cruise
operator Louis Plc tumbled 18 percent and  Logicom Ltd. (LOG)  fell 10
percent. There was no volume in the index’s other 15 stocks.
Traders  completed  38 transactions today for a total of 19,209
euros, according to the Cyprus Stock Exchange website.  Cypriot shares last traded on March 15 as euro-area leaders
tried to force losses on all bank depositors to cut the cost of
financial aid for the Mediterranean nation. While parliament
rejected that plan, a subsequent agreement imposed larger fees
on deposits greater than 100,000 euros and shut  Cyprus Popular
Bank Pcl. (CPB)  Amid the crisis, Cyprus set a 300-euro daily limit on
bank withdrawals and restrictions on transfers to accounts
outside the country.  “The whole issue is to what extent capital controls and
limits to movements within accounts can affect the ability of
local players to trade on the stock exchange,” Ilias Lekkos,
chief economist at  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  in  Athens , said in a phone
interview today. “If there is very little volume on the
exchange, then the price-discovery mechanism and the ability of
prices to reflect the current macro situation will be severely
impaired.”  2007 High  The Cyprus General Market Index has declined 13 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  gauge 
has slumped 98 percent from its October 2007 high, compared with
a 24 percent drop in the Stoxx Europe 60 Index.  Hellenic Bank (HB) , the island nation’s third-largest lender,
slid 20 percent to 13.4 euro cents. The company sold its Greek
units to Piraeus Bank last month.  Bank of Cyprus Plc  and Cyprus Popular Bank, the nation’s
biggest banks, account for 60 percent of the benchmark index’s
weighting, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Both companies will
remain suspended from trading until April 15, according to
statement on the Cyprus Stock Exchange’s website today.  Louis plunged 18 percent to 1.4 euro cents. Shares in the
tourism company peaked at 6.15 euros in November 1999, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Logicom, a wholesaler of computer parts, fell 10 percent to
25.2 euro cents.  The country’s central bank today eased the limit of
financial transactions to be carried out without regulatory
approval to 25,000 euros from 5,000 euros previously, according
to an official who asked not to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
