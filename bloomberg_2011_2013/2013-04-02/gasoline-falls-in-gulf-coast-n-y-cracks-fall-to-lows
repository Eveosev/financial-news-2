Spot gasoline in  New York  Harbor and
the U.S.  Gulf Coast  weakened against futures while crack spreads
in both regions fell to the lowest levels in more than a month.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , slid $1.67 to $24.59 a barrel, the least since Jan.
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Margins for New
York area refiners, based on Brent oil in  Europe , retreated 91
cents to $11.89 a barrel, a five-week low.  The discount for  conventional , 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast slipped 3 cents to 26 cents a gallon below New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:48 p.m. Reformulated gasoline
weakened 5 cents to a discount of  12.5 cents  a gallon.  The same fuel in the New York Harbor dropped  0.13 cent  to a
discount of 24.88 cents below futures.  Gasoline supplies in the U.S. probably declined 1 million
barrels in the week ended March 29, according to the median
forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the release
of government data tomorrow.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Gulf region rose to 73.4
million barrels in the prior week, while  East Coast inventories 
dropped to 58.9 million barrels, said the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
