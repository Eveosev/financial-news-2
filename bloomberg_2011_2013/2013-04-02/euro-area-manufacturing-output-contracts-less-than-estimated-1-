Euro-area manufacturing output
contracted less than initially estimated in March as the
currency bloc struggled to emerge from a recession.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
declined to 46.8 last month from 47.9 in February, London-based
Markit Economics said today. That is above an initial estimate
of 46.6 on March 21. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
The euro-area index has remained below that level for 20 months.  The euro-zone economy has  contracted  for five consecutive
quarters. That trend is forecast to continue in the first three
months of this year before a return to growth in the second
quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
 European Central Bank  cut its economic forecasts last month and
now sees the economy shrinking 0.5 percent in 2013.  The economic risks are still “on the downside,” ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said on March 7. Draghi foresees a
gradual recovery later this year.  The euro was lower against the dollar ahead of euro-area
unemployment data due at 11 a.m. Brussels time. The  jobless rate 
may have climbed to a record 12 percent in February, according
to the median of 31 economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
The common currency was down 0.1 percent to $1.2837 at 10:21
