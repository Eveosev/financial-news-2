About 1.08 million U.S. pay-TV
customers canceled  service  in favor of  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and other
online options last year, according to a report.  The estimate from Toronto-based Convergence Consulting
Group Ltd. brings the total number of cord-cutters to 3.74
million since 2008. The total will reach 4.7 million this year,
the group  forecast . The number of people canceling service last
year was equal to 1.1 percent of pay-TV accounts.  The pace of defections, along with younger viewers who
never sign up, is slowing growth in pay television
subscriptions, according to Brahm Eiley, president of
Convergence Consulting. Cable, satellite and telephone-based
video services added an estimated 31,000 U.S. accounts last year
and are forecast to gain 98,000 this year.  “Even with the ‘cord-nevers’ it’s still going to be a pay-
TV dominated universe for a long time,” Eiley said in an
interview.  Program owners are putting more shows and movies behind a
paywall, according to the report, titled “The Battle for the
North American Couch Potato: Online and Traditional TV, and
Movie Distribution.”  About 18 percent of the TV audience watched free, online
full-episode TV on network websites and destinations such as
Hulu, according to the Convergence report. That’s down from 19
percent in 2011.  Convergence forecasts a further decline to 17 percent this
year and next, as content providers offer less for free. The
firm bases its estimates on expected pay-TV subscriber growth
and economic factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
