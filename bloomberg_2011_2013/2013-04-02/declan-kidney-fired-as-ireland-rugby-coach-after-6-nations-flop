Declan Kidney was fired as Ireland
rugby coach today after his team flopped in the Six Nations
tournament.  Kidney, 53, who twice coached Munster to win  Europe ’s
Heineken Cup, had been in the Ireland post since May 2008,
succeeding Eddie O’Sullivan. He led Ireland to a Six Nations
“Grand Slam” in 2009, winning all five games.  Ireland reached the quarterfinals of the last  Rugby World
Cup  in 2011, losing to Wales. This year it finished above only
France, on points difference, in the Six Nations standings.  The Irish Rugby Football Union said  on its website  it won’t
be offering a new contract to Kidney after his current agreement
ends on June 30 and his role as Ireland’s senior men’s coach
ceased today.  Les Kiss will act as interim head coach for Ireland’s
offseason tour of  North America .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
