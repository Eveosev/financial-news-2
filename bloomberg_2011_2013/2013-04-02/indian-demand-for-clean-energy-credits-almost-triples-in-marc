Indian demand for renewable-energy
credits, used by power distributors and industrial electricity
consumers to meet annual government goals for clean generation,
almost tripled last month in the run-up to the fiscal year-end.  Bids for credits rose to 435,481 in March from 159,729 the
month before, according to REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt., a
trader that records all of the transactions on the Indian
Electricity Exchange and the Power Exchange of  India .  “This was also the highest volume cleared in the financial
year,” REConnect Director Vibhav Nuwal said by e-mail. “March
was the last trading session for the compliance period.”  Demand for credits wasn’t sufficient to raise their price
above the floor set by the regulator of 1,500 rupees ($28) each,
according to  REConnect , based in Indore. Each credit represents
1 megawatt-hour of electricity fed into the power grid.  India requires companies such as state power distributors,
 Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and  Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  to
get as much as 10 percent of their electricity from renewables.
Those unable to get enough clean power locally may meet the goal
by buying credits from the two power exchanges. The credits are
sold by wind, solar, hydropower and biomass facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
