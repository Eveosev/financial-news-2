Rice surged the maximum allowed by
the Chicago Board of Trade on signs that planting will drop to a
26-year low in the U.S., the world’s fifth-largest exporter.  Growers will sow  2.611 million acres  with rice this year,
down from 2.699 million in 2012 and the fewest since 1987, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said on March 28. Planting will
drop 5 percent in Arkansas, the biggest producer, to 1.226
million acres. Domestic stockpiles will shrink 29 percent in
2013, the second straight annual decline, USDA data show.  “The USDA is saying people are planting less, and last
year they didn’t plant a sufficient amount,” Shawn Hackett, the
president at Hackett Financial Advisors Inc., in Boynton Beach,
Florida, said in a telephone interview. “We have to get prices
high enough to start getting some production growth.”  Rice futures for May delivery jumped by the CBOT’s 50-cent
limit, or 3.3 percent, to settle at $15.765 per 100 pounds at 2
p.m. in Chicago. The price has gained in seven of the past eight
sessions and 8.4 percent since March 18.  India is expected to be the biggest exporter this year,
followed by Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan, according to the
USDA.  While global rice production is forecast to rise 0.4
percent this year, demand is accelerating faster at 2.4 percent,
the USDA said in a March 8 report. Global stockpiles next year
will drop 2 percent, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
