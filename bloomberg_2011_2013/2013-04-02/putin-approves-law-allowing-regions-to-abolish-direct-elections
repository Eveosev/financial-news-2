Russian President Vladimir Putin
signed into law a measure that allows governors to be appointed
in the country’s 83 regions, reversing last year’s move to
restore direct elections.  The bill approved by Putin was passed last month by the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, and the Federation
Council, the upper house, the  Kremlin said  on its website today.
Under the measure, the president will have the right to submit
three candidates for approval by the legislature of any
province.  Putin abolished direct elections for governors in 2004 as
president. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as head of state from
2008 to 2012 after Putin completed the maximum two consecutive
terms allowed by the constitution, restored the gubernatorial
vote after mass protests over alleged election fraud. Putin, 60,
returned to the Kremlin last May after edging aside Medvedev,
47, who now serves as prime minister.  A top official from the ruling United Russia party, Adalbi
Shkhagoshev, said this year that the law would allow the mainly
Muslim North Caucasus to opt out from direct votes, according to
comments published on the party’s  website . The impoverished
region is plagued by violence blamed on Islamic extremists.  Critics of the law say it will be used to end elections of
all governors. Russia’s first gubernatorial elections in eight
years were held in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
