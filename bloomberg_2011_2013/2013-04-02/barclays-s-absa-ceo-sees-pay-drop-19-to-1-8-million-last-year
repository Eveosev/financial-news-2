Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
lender controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , paid Chief Executive Officer
Maria Ramos 16.7 million rand ($1.8 million) in 2012, 19 percent
less than the previous year.  The basic  salary  of Ramos, 54, was little changed at 6.1
million rand, while she also received a long-term incentive
award valued at 10 million rand, according to the Johannesburg-
based lender’s  annual report  published today. Separately, Ramos
was awarded 5.5 million rand last month from a management
retention program set up in 2010 plus incentives of 8 million
rand in June.  Ramos, who gave up a cash bonus for 2012, described Absa’s
earnings as “disappointing” on Feb. 12 after the bank missed
its own targets as home loans soured and full-year profit
declined 13 percent to 8.39 billion rand. Absa last year agreed
to buy most of Barclays’s African assets for 18.3 billion rand
in shares, boosting the U.K. lender’s stake in the South African
bank to 62.3 percent.  Absa deputy CEO Louis von Zeuner, who resigned at the end
of last year, received 23.9 million rand in 2012, including a
special retention payment of 12.4 million rand, the bank said.  Absa has dropped 4.8 percent in Johannesburg trading this
year, making the stock the worst performer on the six-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index (JBNKS) , which gained 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
