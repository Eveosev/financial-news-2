Australia’s dollar held a three-day
gain against the U.S. currency before data forecast to show the
nation’s trade deficit narrowed.  The so-called Aussie remained higher against the yen amid
speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will expand monetary easing at a
two-day policy meeting that starts today. The  Reserve Bank  of
Australia refrained from cutting rates yesterday and indicated
existing stimulus is working. New Zealand’s dollar traded 0.3
percent from a six-week high after  Fonterra Cooperative Group
Ltd. (FCG) , the world’s largest dairy exporter, said whole milk powder
prices climbed to a record.  “Our  interest rates  are on hold and the rest of the world
continues to print money,” Hans Kunnen, Sydney-based chief
economist at St. George Bank Ltd., said on a conference call
with clients today. “That makes a case for saying the Aussie
can get to $1.06 in the months ahead.”  Australia’s currency traded at $1.0452 at 10:26 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0450 in New York, after having risen 0.4 percent
in the past three sessions. The Aussie was little changed at
97.59 yen from 97.64 yesterday, when it gained 0.5 percent.  New Zealand ’s kiwi dollar fetched 84.12 U.S. cents from
84.14 yesterday, when it touched 84.46, the highest since Feb.
20. It bought 78.55 yen from 78.63.  Yields on Australian 10-year bonds rose five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.45 percent. The three-year rate
added five basis points to 2.94 percent.  Trade Data  Australia’s imports probably  outpaced  exports by A$1
billion ($1.05 billion)in February, compared with a A$1.06
billion shortfall in January, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the Bureau of
Statistics releases data today.  “There are a number of indications that the substantial
easing of monetary policy during late 2011 and 2012 is having an
expansionary effect on the economy,” RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens 
said in a statement yesterday after leaving the overnight cash-
rate target at 3 percent. Benchmark interest rates are as low as
zero in the U.S. and Japan.  The BOJ will decide at this week’s meeting to boost monthly
bond purchases by about 50 percent to 5.2 trillion yen ($55.7
billion), according to the average forecast in Bloomberg poll.
The  European Central Bank  also sets policy tomorrow.  In New Zealand, milk powder for June delivery gained 12.8
percent to $5,998 a metric ton, according to a trade-weighted
index on the Auckland-based Fonterra’s GlobalDairyTrade website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
