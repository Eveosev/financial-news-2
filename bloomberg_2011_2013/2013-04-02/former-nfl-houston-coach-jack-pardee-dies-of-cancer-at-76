Former National Football League
coach Jack Pardee, who also orchestrated the so-called Run and 
Shoot offense at the  University of Houston  that helped 
Andre Ware win the Heisman Trophy, has  died  of gall bladder 
cancer. He was 76.  Pardee was an All-American linebacker at  Texas A&M
University  and a member of the so-called Junction Boys, one of
35 players to return to the football program after the 10-day
training camp run by coach Paul “Bear” Bryant.  Pardee became an NFL head coach at age 39, guiding the
 Chicago Bears  from 1975-77 and the  Washington Redskins  from
1978-80. As a collegiate coach at Houston from 1987-89, Pardee
was known for his high-scoring offenses.  The Cougars averaged 624.9 yards of offense in 1989 as
Ware, the team’s quarterback, became the only player in school
history to win the Heisman Trophy. In a 95-21 rout of  Southern
Methodist University  on Oct. 21, 1989, Houston became the first
team in National Collegiate Athletic Association history to
total more than 1,000 yards of offense in a game.  “When you talk about the great offenses in the history of
college football, Coach Pardee’s Run-and-Shoot teams from the
late 1980s must be considered near the top of that list,”
Houston football coach Tony Levine said in a statement. “We
continue to feel the impact from his innovative ideas and
leadership of those teams in college football today.”  Pardee, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame,
coached the NFL’s Houston Oilers from 1990-94 and led the
franchise to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons. 
He had an overall 87-77 record as an NFL coach.  Funeral arrangements are pending. Pardee’s family has
established a scholarship fund at the University of Houston in
his memory that will be presented annually to a walk-on from 
the school’s football program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
