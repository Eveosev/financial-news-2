Pannergy (PANNERGY)  Nyrt., a Hungarian
renewable energy company, gained the most in more than a month
after winning a subsidy for a geothermal greenhouse project.  The shares climbed 7.2 percent, the biggest rally since
Feb. 27, to 400 forint by the close in Budapest. The benchmark
BUX stock  index  added 1.4 percent.  The 2.8 billion-forint ($12 million) subsidy, which
Pannergy announced in an e-mailed statement today, may increase
the value of each share by as much as 150 forint, Erste Group
Bank AG said in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
