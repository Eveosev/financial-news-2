Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB)  dropped the most in six
months as Colombian lenders sank amid speculation that the
central bank’s decision last month to reduce borrowing costs
will erode profit margins.  Helm’s preferred shares retreated 2.2 percent to 501 pesos
at the close of trading in Bogota, the steepest one-day decline
since Oct. 8.  Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores  fell 1.2 percent to
1,270 pesos, and  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR) , the
biggest shareholder in  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , lost 0.8 percent to
38,460 pesos.  “Banco de La Republica’s decision to surprise the market
and cut rates by 50 basis points is spurring speculation of
lower margins for lenders,” Daniel Velandia, head of research
at brokerage Correval SA, said in a phone interview today from
Bogota.  Colombia’s central bank cut on March 22 its benchmark rate
by half a percentage point to 3.25 percent, surprising all 32
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Finance minister Mauricio Cardenas said yesterday the
government’s patience is “wearing thin” on Colombian loan
rates and is asking banks to lower them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
