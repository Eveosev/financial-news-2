Administrators of Petroplus Holding
AG’s French Petit-Couronne refinery received bids from Murzuk
Oil and Netoil Inc. and will submit them to a court in Rouen
that will decide whether to accept one or liquidate the plant.  The court will rule on the formal bids for the Normandy
site in coming days, administrators said today in a statement.
Offers from  Libya ’s Murzuk and Netoil were rejected in the past.  The fate of the 154,000-barrel-a-day refinery has hung in
the balance since Zug, Switzerland-based Petroplus filed for
insolvency in January 2012. Administrators rejected five bids in
February and began proceedings to fire workers and shut up shop.  A final decision has been repeatedly pushed back by the
court, while French unions have fought to keep the plant open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
