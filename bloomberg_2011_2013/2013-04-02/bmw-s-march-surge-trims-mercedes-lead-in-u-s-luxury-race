Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
reported a 13 percent U.S. sales increase in March, cutting into
the luxury-auto lead of  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz as both
brands set records for the month.  Sales for the BMW brand rose 27,078, helped by gains for
the X3 and X5 sport-utility vehicles, the Munich-based company
said yesterday in a statement. Mercedes posted a 6.5 percent
advance from a year earlier to 24,646.  The March results trimmed Mercedes’s 2013 lead to 4,285
cars and SUVs as the two German automakers vie for the annual
sales crown BMW has held for the past two years. BMW won last
year with a December surge, based on reported sales. Measured by
vehicle registrations, Mercedes topped BMW, according to
researcher R.L. Polk & Co.  “With housing bouncing back we are at a point where the
consumers, especially luxury consumers, are more comfortable
getting out there in the marketplace and buying big-ticket
items, especially luxury vehicles,” Alec Gutierrez, an analyst
at  Irvine , California-based researcher Kelley Blue Book, said in
a telephone interview.  Mercedes sales for the first quarter gained 12 percent to
69,187, a record for the three-month period, Stuttgart, Germany-
based Daimler said in a statement. BMW’s quarterly deliveries
advanced 5.4 percent to 64,902. The results don’t include
Daimler’s cargo vans and Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which
aren’t luxury vehicles.  Good Mood  “The mood of the luxury consumer is good,” Ludwig Willisch, BMW’s chief executive officer for North America, said
in an interview. “People are in shopping malls, they’re not too
distracted by what’s going on politically and they are willing
to spend money on cars.”  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus  reported a 15 percent increase
for March, to 23,190, as deliveries of the ES sedan more than
doubled. The Toyota City, Japan-based company’s luxury brand,
which was the annual sales leader for 11 years until natural
disasters in Asia curtailed 2011 output, said it sold 56,740
vehicles in the quarter for a 16 percent gain.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac rose 49 percent to 15,751
vehicles in March, helped by the new ATS sedan, according to a
statement from the Detroit-based company.  Luxury demand is partly fueled by a record number of leases
entered into in 2010, when those consumer vehicle contacts rose
by more than 600,000 from a year earlier, Gutierrez said.  “A lot of consumers are reaching the end of their leases
this year and that drives luxury sales, since a significant
percentage of luxury buyers lease their vehicles,” he said.  Audi Record  U.S. sales of Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi
brand rose 14 percent to 13,253, according to a statement. That
was its 27th straight month of record sales and second-best
month ever, behind December 2012. The gains included 20 percent
for the A4 sedan and 39 percent for the Q5 SUV. Sales for the
year rose 16 percent to 34,186, Audi’s best first quarter ever.  Audi continued a low level of discounting in March, Mark Del Rosso, chief operating officer of the brand’s U.S. unit,
said in an interview.  “We’re been very deliberate to maintain our profitable
growth strategy,” he said.  Honda Motor Co.’s Acura brand boosted sales 26 percent to
14,100 last month, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 11,103 vehicles, an
increase of 9 percent from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-
based automaker said in a statement.  Lincoln Decline  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 6,825 Lincolns in March, a 22 percent
drop from a year earlier, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker
reported. Ford has begun a new ad campaign to try to revive the
luxury brand, including TV spots during February’s Super Bowl.  Ford sold 2,360 MKZs last month, down 20 percent from a
year earlier, as dealers contended with a shortage of the
redesigned sedan. After an initial delay, Ford has now delivered
4,600 to dealers,  Ken Czubay , the company’s U.S. sales chief,
said on a conference call yesterday.  The MKZ’s daily sales rate doubled in last third of the
month, compared with the middle third, as inventory of the car
improved, he said.  Land Rover sales rose 2.7 percent to 4,314, while Jaguar’s
gained 6.6 percent to 1,408, according to an e-mailed statement.
The U.K. brands are owned by Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)   Porsche, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part of
Volkswagen, said it sold a March record 3,487 vehicles in the
U.S., a 42 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
