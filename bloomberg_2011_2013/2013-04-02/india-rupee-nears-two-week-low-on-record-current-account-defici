India ’s rupee approached a two-week
low after the current-account deficit widened to a record.  The  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade rose to
$32.6 billion in the three months through December from the
previous quarter’s $22.6 billion, the central bank said late on
March 28. The market was shut on March 29 for a local holiday
and there was no trade yesterday as banks closed their accounts.
India may need more than $75 billion of foreign capital in the
year through March 2014 to fund the deficit, which is a
“greater worry” than the budget gap, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram said Feb. 28.  The rupee declined 0.1 percent from March 28 to 54.3450 per
dollar as of 9:46 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 54.4650 last week, the lowest level since
March 20. The currency strengthened 1.3 percent last quarter.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 8.06 percent.  “The elevated current-account deficit will likely keep the
rupee under pressure in the 54 to 56 range” with the
possibility of further weakening,  Rohini Malkani , Mumbai-based
economist at Citigroup, wrote in a report today. “There is an
increasing reliance on market-dependent flows such as portfolio
flows, non-resident Indian deposits and loans.”  The rupee’s losses will be limited due to broad dollar
weakness, according to an Edelweiss Financial Advisors Ltd.
report today. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against six trading partners, fell 0.2 percent today after data
yesterday showed U.S. manufacturing slid in March, damping
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will rein in stimulus.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.39 per
dollar, compared with 55.33 on March 28, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.35 versus 55.53 on March 29. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
