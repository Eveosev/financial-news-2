Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, said it will spend at least 100 million  yuan  ($16
million) on a coffee center in  China  as it seeks to boost
consumption of the beverage in the world’s most populous nation.  The coffee industry has room to grow on the mainland
because consumption is lower than other parts of the region,
Heiko Schipper, managing director of Nestle’s Greater China food
and beverage division, said in an interview in  Shanghai 
yesterday.  The Vevey, Switzerland-based foodmaker, which sells
products from Nescafe coffee to Maggi food seasonings in China,
is expanding its food and beverage business as rising incomes
drive consumption in the world’s second-largest economy. The new
center in the southwestern Yunnan province will train 5,000
farmers, agronomists and coffee business professionals a year,
and will include a coffee testing laboratory as well as a
consumer education facility.  “Coffee has huge growth potential, that’s because of its
low per capita consumption,” Schipper said. “Total consumption
is very low, only four cups per capita in China, and if you look
at  Hong Kong  and  Taiwan , it’s between 100 to 150 cups per
capita.”  Since 2010, the company has formed a bottled water venture
in the country and bought controlling stakes in candy maker Hsu
Fu Chi International and Yinlu Foods Group, producer of congee
and a peanut-milk beverage. The company last year bought Pfizer
Inc.’s infant-nutrition business, an acquisition which will help
the Swiss company boost its share of the Chinese baby-food
market.  China is now Nestle’s second-largest market, with annual
sales of about 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.32 billion),  according 
to the Swiss company’s annual report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
