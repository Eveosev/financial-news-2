European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said it would be a concern if
countries were to openly pursue weaker currencies to bolster
their economies.  “It would be a matter of concern if countries were to
directly pursue overt competitive devaluations, particularly by
resorting to large purchases of foreign assets,” Coeure said in
a speech in  Washington  today. “The economic literature
highlights the dangers of individual countries pursuing beggar-
thy-neighbour or burden-shifting policies. I believe this
message is well understood by central bankers.”  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in February that
buying bonds to weaken the yen won’t be necessary as the nation
battles deflation, backing away from an initial proposal that
prompted global concerns about currency manipulation. Coeure
said such policies could “expose global markets to serious
risks of an escalation of trade and financial protectionism.”  While the exchange rate isn’t a target for the ECB, the
Frankfurt-based central bank takes it into consideration and
could take measures to offset currency moves if they impacted on
the inflation outlook, he said.  The  exchange rate  “matters for  price stability  and growth
and, as such, it is part of the overall assessment of the
appropriateness of the policy stance,” Coeure said. If it is
“contrary to the objective of medium-term price stability, it
may thus trigger offsetting policy actions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
