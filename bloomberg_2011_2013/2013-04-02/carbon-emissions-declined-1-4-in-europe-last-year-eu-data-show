Carbon emissions  fell 1.4 percent in
 Europe  last year, according to European Commission data, as
industrial output slowed and renewable energy generation jumped.  Greenhouse-gas discharges reported by 89 percent of the
installations covered by the European Union’s carbon market were
1.787 billion metric tons, excluding airlines, the  data 
published today show. Aviation emissions totaled 55 million tons
in 2012, the first year of coverage for the industry, according
to figures accounting for 68 percent of the sector.  Emissions fell as electricity output from renewable energy
installations including windfarms surged 13 percent, offsetting
the impact of a decline in nuclear power and rising coal-fired
generation, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Europe’s
sputtering economy prompted a 7.4 percent drop in emissions for
the cement industry and a 3.3 percent decline for steel
companies, it said.  The data shows the EU market may continue to be
oversupplied with carbon permits, and “reinforces the need for
reform,”  Matthew Gray , an analyst at Jefferies Group Inc. in
 London , said in a phone interview.  Emissions in 2013 may be 190 million tons below the cap set
for this year, Gray said. Companies emitted 170 million tons
less than was allocated last year based on today’s data,
according to New Energy estimates.  Emission permits for December pared early losses to trade
at 4.69 euros ($6) a ton as of 1:40 p.m. on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange, a decline of 2.5 percent.  Europe’s parliament votes April 16 on the first part of
plan by the region’s regulator to support prices by postponing
the sale of some allowances.  The EU’s cap-and-trade system, introduced in 2005 to help
meet greenhouse gas-reduction targets under the 1997  Kyoto
Protocol , imposes limits on about 12,000 power plants and
factories. The program allocates permits to polluters that must
must surrender enough allowances to cover their discharges of
carbon dioxide or pay fines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
