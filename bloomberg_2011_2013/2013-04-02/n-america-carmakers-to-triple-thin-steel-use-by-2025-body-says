North American automakers may triple
their use of stronger, thinner steel by 2025 to increase  fuel
efficiency , according to a lobby for producers of the metal.  Vehicles made in the region will contain an average of as
much as 585 pounds of so-called advanced high-strength steel in
2025, the  Steel Market Development Institute  said by e-mail.
“This estimate is likely conservative,” the Washington D.C.-
based business unit of the American Iron & Steel Institute said.  The average will probably exceed an estimate by Ducker
Worldwide Automotive of 346 pounds by 2020, the lobby also said
in the e-mailed response to questions. Ducker estimated average
thin-steel use at 194 pounds per vehicle during 2012.  Automakers are experimenting with materials such as high-
strength steel, aluminum and magnesium to cut fuel consumption,
Lawrence Kavanagh, president of the lobby, said by phone. The
use of the lighter, stronger steels will keep the total level of
steel used in cars unchanged, the institute says. Steel makes up
about 58 percent to 60 percent of a vehicle’s weight.  Steel prices fell to a two-year low in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
