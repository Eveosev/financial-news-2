Standard Life Plc (SL/)  almost doubled
Chief Executive Officer David Nish’s pay to 5 million pounds
($7.6 million) in 2012 after  Scotland ’s biggest insurer boosted
profit and shares surged.  Nish, 52, received a 775,000-pound  salary , a bonus of 1.2
million pounds and three-year long-term incentives valued at
2.76 million pounds, the Edinburgh-based insurer said today in
its  annual report . The incentives will vest in June and are
based on the firm’s performance in the three years through 2012.  Standard Life was the fifth-best performing member of the
 FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  last year as the company positioned itself to
benefit from regulatory changes in the U.K.’s savings industry.
The share price jumped 61 percent in 2012 and operating profit
climbed 65 percent to 900 million pounds as the firm reaped the
rewards for investing in  information technology  and making
acquisitions over the previous three years.  “Given this financial performance and the progress made
toward our key strategic priorities, the remuneration committee,
in evaluating performance for the year, decided it was
appropriate to award the executives close to maximum payments
under the annual bonus arrangements,” said Crawford Gillies,
chairman of the firm’s remuneration committee.  Nish will receive a 1.9 percent raise in his base salary to
790,000 pounds, “in line with the range of increases awarded to
the wider workforce in Standard Life,” Gillies said. He
received 2.6 million pounds in compensation for 2011.  Chief Financial Officer Jackie Hunt was awarded 2.54
million pounds for 2012 including the value of long-term
incentives, a 71 percent increase on 2011. Keith Skeoch, CEO of
Standard Life’s investments division was paid 4.35 million
pounds, up 65 percent from the previous year.  Retail investors own about 44 percent of Standard Life’s
stock, following the company’s switch from being owned by its
customers to a publicly traded company in 2006. Standard Life
said in its annual report it advocates “the highest standards
of corporate governance” in the U.K. stock market as one of its
biggest investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
