Crude options volatility fell for
the first time in three days as oil futures climbed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 17.34 percent at 4 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , down from 17.51 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for May delivery gained 12
cents to settle at $97.19 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices have
risen in six of the past seven days, advancing 5.1 percent.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $100 calls, which fell 7 cents to 34 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,253 contracts at 4:05 p.m. May $90 puts were the
second-most active, with 1,049 lots traded. They declined 1 cent
to 8 cents a barrel.  Volume was almost evenly divided between puts and calls.
Calls accounted for 57 percent of yesterdayâ€™s trading volume of
83,032 contracts.  May $105 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,666 contracts changing hands. They fell 3
cents to 6 cents a barrel. May $90 puts were unchanged at 9
cents a barrel on 3,679 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
35,829 contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 33,950 and
December $110 calls at 32,286.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
