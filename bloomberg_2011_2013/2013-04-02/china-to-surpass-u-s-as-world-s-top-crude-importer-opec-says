China  is on course to overtake the
U.S. as the world’s top crude importer by 2014, as the Asian
country’s growing refining capacity boosts demand and America’s
fracking boom cuts the need for foreign oil, OPEC said today.  Imports to China may surpass 6 million barrels a day by the
end of this year, according to an e-mailed report from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. U.S. oil  imports 
declined 21 percent last year, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Shipments may drop below 6 million a
day in 2014, according to OPEC.  “People have been anticipating this for the better part of
a decade,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The Chinese
top leadership, and especially the military, worries a lot about
their energy import dependence. It’s not clear how high it will
go but it will certainly keep rising for the foreseeable
future.”  China’s imports rose 1.3 percent in December to 5.57
million barrels a day, OPEC said. The country may meet 60
percent of its oil needs with foreign crude this year, according
to the report.  The U.S. produced 84 percent of its own energy last year as
advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, unlocked oil and gas trapped in deep underground rock
formations, EIA data show. Domestic crude  output  reached 7.159
million barrels a day last month, the most since July 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
