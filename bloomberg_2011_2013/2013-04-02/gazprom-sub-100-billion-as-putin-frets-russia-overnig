OAO Gazprom (OGZPY)  is valued at less than
$100 billion for the first time since 2009 as concern  Vladimir Putin ’s natural gas producer is being mismanaged fuels a rout in
its shares.  American depositary receipts  of Gazprom sank 2.9 percent to
$8.25 in New York yesterday, pushing the market value of
 Russia ’s gas export monopoly to $97.7 billion, the lowest level
since July 2009. Shares in Moscow traded at a four-year low.
Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  dropped 0.1 percent to 1,428.52 by 3:28
p.m. in the capital today.  State-run Gazprom has wiped out about a third of its market
value over the past year as rising expenditure, declining profit
and the prospect of lower-than-forecast dividends deter
investors. Gazprom trades at 2.9 times estimated earnings, the
second-cheapest stock on Russia’s 50-member Micex gauge and
about one-fifth of  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , the Colombian  oil company  whose
daily production is 13 times less than Gazprom’s, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “Gazprom’s dividends disappointed -- that was just the
latest blow to investors -- and there are risks their contracts
will be revised and prices lowered spurring further declines in
net profit,”  Alexei Kokin , a senior oil and gas analyst at
UralSib Financial Corp. who has rated Gazprom’s Moscow shares
hold since September, said by phone from Moscow yesterday.
“There is hope that the company’s management will be replaced,
this is the only thing that would be able to turn the stock
around.”  State Oversight  Putin, currently in his second stint as president after
four years in between as prime minister, urged Gazprom at its
20th anniversary gala Feb. 21 to improve its performance and
increase corporate governance. The company -- run by Chief
Executive Officer Alexey Miller -- is thwarting efforts to boost
state oversight of its  capital spending , Deputy Economy Minister
Sergei Belyakov said last month in an interview.  The financial turmoil in Cyprus has made markets uneasy,
Gazprom spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  said by phone today. There
hasn’t been any corporate news in the past week that would be
responsible for the share decline, he said.  Gazprom’s market capitalization in New York has dropped
from as high as $369 billion in May 2008. Ecopetrol, which is
also government-controlled and is based in Bogota, is valued at
$112.8 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Moscow-based company produced an estimated 487 billion
cubic meters of natural gas in 2012, according to an  investor
presentation  on its website dated February. Coupled with
production at crude unit OAO Gazprom Neft, Gazprom’s output was
about 9.59 million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year,
compared with daily oil production of 754,000 barrels for
Ecopetrol, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Least Appreciated’  Shares of Gazprom fell 1.5 percent yesterday on Russia’s
benchmark Micex gauge to 130.89 rubles, or $4.18, the lowest
level since March 31, 2009. They were little changed at 130.90
rubles today.  ADRs (EC)  of Ecopetrol climbed 0.4 percent to $54.70 in
New York.  “Corporate governance is clearly the core reason” for
Gazprom’s underperformance, Lev Snykov, a partner at Greenwich
Capital in Moscow, which holds Russian stocks including Gazprom,
said by e-mail April 1. “Gazprom clearly deserves to be among
the most expensive stocks in the world due to its asset base,
but so far it is among the least appreciated names in the energy
space.”  Net income for Gazprom, which supplies about 25 percent of
Europe’s gas, dropped 37 percent to 556 billion rubles ($17.8
billion) last year, according to a March 27 report prepared to
local accounting standards. That translates into a dividend of
5.9 rubles a share given the company’s policy of returning 25
percent of profit to shareholders. Gazprom estimated a dividend
of between 7 and 8 rubles in February.  Ecopetrol plans to spend 80 percent of its 2012 net income
on dividends, according to a Feb. 25 statement. Gazprom is now
the world’s 11th-largest oil and gas company by market
capitalization, while Ecopetrol is No. 8. Exxon Mobil Corp. is
the world’s most valuable oil and gas producer at $405.2
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
