Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, sold $2 billion of bonds in a two-
part offering to help fund share repurchases.  The company, which boosted its  dividend  and announced a $17
billion stock buyback on Feb. 26, issued $1 billion of 2.7
percent securities due 2023 that yield 85 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and an equal amount of 4.2 percent,
30-year debt with a spread of 110 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes including share repurchases, Atlanta-based
Home Depot said today in a regulatory filing.  Home Depot’s $1 billion of 5.95 percent bonds due 2041
traded March 26 at 127 cents on the dollar to yield 4.29
percent, or 112 basis points more than Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Shares of Home Depot have gained 14.7 percent this year and
cost 23 times earnings, Bloomberg data show. That compares with
a 10 percent increase in the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index, which
has a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
