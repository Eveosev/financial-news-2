Swedish manufacturing  expanded for a
second month in March as orders increased.  An index based on responses from about 200  purchasing
managers  rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.1 in March from 50.9
the previous month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles
the index, said today. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The
median  estimate  of seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a reading of 50.6.  Sweden’s economic growth is forecast to accelerate this
year amid signs exports will recover as measures by European
policy makers have eased concern that the region’s debt crisis
will deepen. Swedish  economic  growth slowed to 0.8 percent last
year from 3.7 percent in 2011 as export declined. Sales abroad
account for about half of the economic output.  Swedbank’s PMI production sub-index fell to 54.7 from 54.8,
while the order index rose to 55.3 from 51.1. The employment
index fell to 44.2 from 45.3.  Sweden’s $500 billion economy is struggling to expand as
 Europe ’s debt-crisis induced recession is sapping demand for
exporters such as Volvo AB and Electrolux AB. The country’s
krona is also the second-best performing major currency in the
world over the past year, rising 4.5 percent, according to the
10 developed-market Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
