Shui On Land Ltd. (272) , the Chinese
developer controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Vincent Lo, was
set for its biggest decline in four and a half years after
profit dropped and the company announced a rights issue.  The shares sank 13 percent to HK$2.89 as of 1:01 p.m. in
Hong Kong trading, the most since Oct. 27, 2008. Macquarie
Securities Ltd., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and DBS Vickers downgraded
the shares. The company said March 28, before the Easter holiday
break, that it will issue as many as 2.25 billion shares at
HK$1.84 each. Underlying profit fell 87 percent to 201 million
 yuan  ($32 million) in 2012 from a year earlier, prompting
Chairman Lo to apologize for the disappointing results.  “We believe there are alternatives in raising capital,”
Macquarie analysts led by Jeffrey Gao wrote in a note to clients
today, citing land sales, price cuts or the formation of joint
ventures with local partners.  Macquarie downgraded the shares to underperform from
neutral because of Shui On’s poor results, potential execution
risks and tight cash flow, Gao said.  The company warned in January that full-year profit will
decline “significantly” because it completed fewer properties
last year compared with 2011.  The developer said in January it will spin off the unit
that developed the Xintiandi restaurant and bar district to
focus on development. Shui On holds about 50 percent of China
Xintiandi, which started operation last month, and is looking
for strategic investors for the rest, Lo said.  The Hong Kong stock market was shut March 29 and April 1
for the Easter holiday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
