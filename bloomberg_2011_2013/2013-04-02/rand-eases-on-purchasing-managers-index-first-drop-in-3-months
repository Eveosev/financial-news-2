The rand weakened against the dollar
as  South Africa ’s purchasing managers’ index fell for the first
time in three months, showing factory output may have contracted
in March.  The currency dropped 0.2 percent to 9.2063 per dollar by
11:46 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand is the worst performer
among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg this year, losing
8 percent against the dollar. Yields on the benchmark 10.5
percent bonds due December 2026 dropped 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.35 percent, the lowest level on a closing
basis in more than three weeks.  Kagiso Tiso Holdings’ index declined to 49.3 from 53.6 in
February, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Manufacturing, which contributes about 15 percent to
South Africa’s gross domestic product, has been under pressure
from rising electricity tariffs, transportation disruptions due
to labor strikes and a slump in demand from the euro-area
economy, which buys a third of the country’s exported
manufactured goods.  Africa’s largest economy has a current-account deficit that
forces reliance on foreign investment in stocks and bonds to
fund the gap, the broadest measure in trade of goods and
services. The deficit narrowed to 9.5 billion rand ($1.03
billion) in February from 24.5 billion rand a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
