The won rose the most in a week
against the dollar as a manufacturing slowdown in the U.S.
damped speculation the  Federal Reserve  will rein in monetary
stimulus.  South Korea ’s government bonds advanced.  The  Dollar Index  dropped for a fourth day, the longest
losing streak in two months, after  data  yesterday showed factory
output in the world’s largest economy expanded in March at the
slowest pace this year. The won weakened 2.6 percent in March,
the biggest monthly drop since May 2012, as increased risk of
conflict with North Korea and a worsening economic outlook
prompted overseas investors to cut their holdings of Korean
stocks by $1.9 billion.  The won was 0.3 percent stronger at 1,111.01 per dollar as
of 10:42 a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility in the currency, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point, to 7.57 percent.
Against the yen, the won dropped 0.5 percent to 11.94, trimming
its gain for the past six months to 19 percent.  “The U.S. outlook looks weak, prompting investors to sell
dollars,” said Hong Seok Chan, an analyst at Daishin Economic
Research Institute in Seoul. “Investors will also watch the
won’s gains against the yen as an excessive rise could prompt
the authorities to take steps.”  South Korea will monitor the effects of foreign exchange
movements on exporters at all times, the  finance ministry  said
yesterday. The government offered 100 billion won ($90 million)
in loans to small exporters hurt by the yen.  Nuclear North  North Korea  said on March 30 that a “state of war” exists
with the South and threatened to shut a jointly run industrial
zone in its border city of Gaeseong. Kim Jong Un, the communist
state’s leader, said March 31 nuclear weapons development is a
priority as the country ratcheted up tensions by repeating
threats to attack the U.S.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due March
2018 dropped one basis point to 2.56 percent, according to
prices from Korea Exchange Inc. The five-year yield reached 2.51
percent on March 29, the lowest it has been in Bloomberg data
going back to 2000, amid a worsening economic outlook.  The government lowered its 2013 growth forecast on march 28
to 2.3 percent from a December projection of 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
