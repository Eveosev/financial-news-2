The naira climbed the most in more
than a week against the dollar on speculation that the central
bank will continue to support the currency by dipping into its
rising foreign reserves.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer advanced as
much as 0.2 percent, before trading 0.1 percent stronger at
158.4 per dollar by 11:45 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital,
the biggest gain on a closing basis since March 22, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria’s foreign-currency  reserves  have advanced 38
percent to $48.5 billion in the year through March 20. The
 Central Bank of Nigeria  has enough to defend the naira and
“keep it where we want,” Governor Lamido Sanusi said in a
March 24 interview in Lagos.  “We believe the sizable arsenal of foreign-exchange
reserves that the central bank has built up over the past 15
months as well as firm monetary policy will help keep the
 exchange rate  in the target range of 150-160 per dollar in
2013,” Yvonne Mhango, a Johannesburg-based economist at
 Renaissance Capital , wrote in a report today.  Sanusi said he wants to keep the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at a record high even as more policy makers argue for
cuts amid calls from the government and businesses to lower
borrowing costs. Three Monetary Policy Committee members voted
for a reduction on March 19, compared with two in January.  Yields on the government’s local-currency bonds due June
2019 dropped 24 basis points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 10.96
percent, according to March 28 prices compiled by the Financial
Markets Dealers Association. Nigerian markets were closed for
holidays on March 29 and April 1.  Borrowing costs on  Nigeria ’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.326 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi rose 0.6 percent to 1.9275 per dollar in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
