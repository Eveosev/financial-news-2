The Moscow Exchange posted a 22
percent profit gain last year as rising income from money-market
and currency fees outweighed a drop in revenue from securities.  Net income  climbed to 8.2 billion rubles ($263 million) in
2012, the exchange said in a statement today. Revenue advanced
27 percent to 21.55 billion rubles as total trading volume
across all markets increased 24 percent to 369.72 trillion
rubles.  Fee and commission  income  from the securities market
dropped 26 percent to 3.08 billion rubles as trading fell in the
year, according to the statement. Income from foreign exchange
and money markets gained 28 percent and 108 percent,
respectively, while fees from the derivatives market were
boosted 56 percent to 1.3 billion rubles.  “We see that our clients don’t have the risk appetite for
equities, we see that the growth in trading volumes is happening
in fixed-income instruments,” Andrey Shemetov, deputy chief
executive officer, said at a press conference yesterday.
“Investors don’t want to take risks. At the moment investors’
interest in the Russian market is very low.”  Total trading volume  in the securities market in 2012
dropped 21 percent to 24.1 trillion rubles from a year earlier,
according to the statement. Equity volumes declined 41 percent,
while bond trading rose 19 percent.  Securities market trading decreased 7.3 percent to 5.9
trillion rubles in the first quarter from the same period a year
earlier, according to the bourse’s presentation.  The exchange plans to pay no less than 30 percent of net
income under international financial reporting standards as
dividends for 2012 and no less than 40 percent for 2013, the
bourse said in a Feb. 4 statement.  Modernizing Drive  The Moscow Exchange, which is modernizing to lure more
foreign investors, debuted two-day, or T+2, settlement for
sovereign debt and 15 of the more than 1,000 equities on March
25. OFZs and fifteen stocks will use T+0 and T+2 settlement
systems simultaneously until July 1, when the 50 most-liquid
Russian stocks and OFZs will switch to T+2, Shemetov said. The
entire exchange will move to T+2 settlement by the end of 2013.  “Almost all the big market players have set up access to
T+2,” Shemetov said. “Many market participants come to us
asking to completely switch off T+0 from July 1 for all
equities.”  The exchange raised 15 billion rubles on Feb. 15 in the
biggest initial public offering on  Russia ’s bourse since 2007,
pricing at 55 rubles a share, the bottom of its target range.
 The shares  fell 2.7 percent to 48.44 rubles by the close in
Moscow today, a 12 percent drop from the IPO price.  “The management’s goal is to make sure the bourse’s stock
price rises,” Shemetov said. “We have the capacity to achieve
a 50 percent-higher stock price than the IPO price in three
years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
