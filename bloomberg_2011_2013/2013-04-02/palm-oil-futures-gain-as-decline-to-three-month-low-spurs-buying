Palm oil  advanced for the first time
in four days as the lowest price at close this year stoked
demand among importers.  The contract for delivery in June advanced as much as 1.5
percent to 2,372 ringgit ($770) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 2,358 ringgit at 11:41 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures yesterday ended at the lowest level since
Dec. 20. Prices fell 2.5 percent in the first quarter, the
fourth quarterly loss in the worst streak since 1999.  “We’re actually near the technical support level of 2,340
ringgit, and around this level we may see some bargain
hunting,” Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options at
OSK Investment Bank Bhd., said from  Kuala Lumpur . Gains may be
capped as production is expected to improve this month, he said.  Exports from Malaysia rose 2.8 percent to 1.36 million tons
in March from a month ago, surveyor Intertek said yesterday.
Shipments rose 5.5 percent to 1.37 million tons, Societe
Generale de Surveillance said.  Soybean oil  for May delivery dropped 0.2 percent to 49.95
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May gained 0.4 percent to $13.965 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.8 percent
to 6,170 yuan ($995) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.4 percent to
7,842  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
