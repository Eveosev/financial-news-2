Clavis Pharma ASA (CLAVIS) , a Norwegian
biotech, is considering closing or selling itself to another
company after its experimental leukemia treatment elacytarabine
failed in a late-stage trial.  Clavis has a short-list of Scandinavian private companies
that may be interested in taking it over and will approach them
over the next few weeks, Chief Executive Officer Olav Helleboe
said on a conference call today. All development work on
elacytarabine has been suspended, the Oslo-based company said in
a statement yesterday.  The study, which didn’t show a significant difference in
survival rates between patients who received elacytarabine and
those taking other treatments, follows similar results from a
trial on a Clavis pancreatic cancer treatment in November. Both
drugs were aimed at improving existing medicines by using
Clavis’s own Lipid Vector Technology.  “We’ve taken two drugs all the way through development
with lipid technology and both failed in the final big test,”
Helleboe said. “That means it will be very difficult to justify
putting huge investments in another product with the same
technology.”  Clavis shares  slumped to a record  low in Oslo, falling as
much as 90 percent to 0.67 krone. The stock traded 84 percent
lower as of 11:22 a.m. in the Norwegian capital.  The company had 223 million kroner ($38.3 million) in cash
at the end of last year and has a net cash position of about 130
million kroner after debt and other obligations, Helleboe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
