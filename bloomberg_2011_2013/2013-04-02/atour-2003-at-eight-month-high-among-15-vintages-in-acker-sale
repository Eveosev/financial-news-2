Chateau Latour 2003, which touched
an eight-month high in Liv-ex  London  trading in March, is among
15 vintages of the Bordeaux first-growth producer on sale in an
 Acker, Merrall & Condit   New York  wine auction this week.  Latour 2003 traded at 7,400 pounds ($11,200) a case
in London on both March 11 and March 20, up 8 percent from its
July level on the exchange, according to Liv-ex data. The
vintage fetched $8,575 a case at a Sotheby’s New York auction in
September.  The 2003, represented in tomorrow’s auction by a case
carrying a top estimate of $11,000, is one of a series of Latour
vintages stretching back to 1933 in the Acker sale. Other recent
Latour wines on offer include six bottles of the 2000 estimated
to fetch as much as $7,000 and cases of the 2001 and 2002
vintages priced to fetch as much as $6,000 each.  Latour 2003 is showing signs of rebounding after recording
a 23 percent decline in its European merchant price in the past
12 months, according to data compiled by Liv-ex. The 2004
vintage gained 9 percent over the same period.  Top California wines on offer in the Acker sale include
three bottles of Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 1997, with a
top estimate of $12,000, and a magnum of Vosne-Romanee 1988 Cros
Parantoux from Burgundy producer Henri Jayer, carrying a similar
price.  Sotheby’s (BID)  holds Hong Kong sales this week while Bonhams
has an auction in London.  To contact the reporter on the story:
