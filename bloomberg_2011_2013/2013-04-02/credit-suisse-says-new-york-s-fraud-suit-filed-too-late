Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said the  New
York  attorney general’s fraud lawsuit over mortgage-backed
securities should be dismissed because it was filed too late.  Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s lawsuit accusing
Credit Suisse of defrauding investors wasn’t filed within a
three-year statute of limitations, the Zurich-based bank said in
a filing yesterday in New York state court.  “This suit is a ‘hindsight’ pleading attempt to undo the
investment risks that investors knowingly chose to take,”
Credit Suisse said.  Schneiderman sued Credit Suisse last year, accusing the
lender of “multiple fraudulent and deceptive acts” in
promoting and selling mortgage securities. The state has also
sued New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which has also argued
the case is time-barred.  “We are confident that our office will prevail, and that
those responsible for the misconduct that led to the crash of
the housing market and the collapse of the American economy will
be held accountable,”  Damien LaVera , a spokesman for
Schneiderman, said in an e-mail.  The case is People v. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
451802-2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
