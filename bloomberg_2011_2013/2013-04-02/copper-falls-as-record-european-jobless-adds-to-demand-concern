Copper futures fell for a third
straight session in  New York  as record unemployment in  Europe 
added to concern that demand will weaken, amid signs of slowing
growth in China and rising stockpiles of the metal.  The euro-area jobless rate rose to 12 percent in early
2013, a report today showed, a day after an official gauge of
Chinese manufacturing came in lower than analysts had forecast.
Inventories rose on the London Metal Exchange, and a stronger
 dollar  reduced the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments.  “Europe remains a concern, and for as long as it does,
copper is going to be under pressure,” Matt Zeman, a strategist
at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The dollar is also a bit stronger, and there are
worries that  China  is slowing.”  Copper futures for delivery in May slid 0.3 percent to
$3.3645 a pound at 11:10 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Yesterday, prices touched the lowest since Aug. 3.  An official gauge of Chinese manufacturing was 50.9 for
March, the country’s statistics bureau and logistics federation
said yesterday, below the reading of 51.2 predicted by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Markets in China will be closed April 4 and April 5 for a
holiday, and traders will “just watch the market and wait for
the finishing of the long weekend, instead of taking any extra
positions,” said Pengjiang “Richard” Fu, director for Asian
commodities trading at Newedge Group SA in  London .  Inventories tracked by the LME rose 0.2 percent to 571,125
metric tons, exchange figures showed. Orders to remove copper
from warehouses surged 28 percent to 116,625 tons, the highest
since February 2004, on bookings in  New Orleans .  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months dropped 1.2
percent to $7,449 a ton ($3.38 a pound). The bourse was shut
yesterday and March 29 for public holidays.  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also declined in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
