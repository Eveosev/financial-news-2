Dell Inc. (DELL)  is introducing a
subscription-based customer support service for consumers who
buy desktop computers, laptops and tablets.  For fees starting at $239 a year, users will have access to
telephone or Web-based assistance 24 hours a day, the Round
Rock, Texas-based company said today in a statement. Dell will
also provide support services via Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.  Dell Chief Executive Officer  Michael Dell , who in February
agreed to take the company private in a $24.4 billion
transaction with Silver Lake Management LLC, is expanding in
mobile computing and business services amid a global slump in PC
sales.  The company is also releasing new software that can
automatically configure workstations to maximize performance,
Dell said in a separate statement today. The Dell Precision
Performance Optimizer will come installed on some desktops and
also be available for download.  To contact the reporter on this story:
