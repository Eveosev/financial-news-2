Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Nigeria ’s
largest lender by market value, said full-year profit jumped 69
percent as loans and deposits grew.  Profit, after tax and income from discontinued operations,
rose to 87.2 billion naira ($550 million) through December from
51.7 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender said
in a  statement  today on the website of the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange . Revenue advanced 22 percent to 221.9 billion naira as
loans and advances increased 11 percent to 783.9 billion naira.
Deposits grew 10 percent to 1.17 trillion naira.  Guaranty Trust planned to grow its loan book 15 percent in
2012 and achieve a return on equity of 25 percent, Chief
Executive Officer Segun Agbaje said in March last year. The
lender said at the time it would expand to as many as seven
African countries within the next five years.  The bank’s  shares  were up 5.2 percent to 27.45 naira at the
close in commercial capital, Lagos, the highest on record.
Guaranty Trust has advanced 19 percent this year compared with
the 25 percent gain of the  Bloomberg NSE Banking Index (NGSEB10) ,
including the top 10 banks by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
