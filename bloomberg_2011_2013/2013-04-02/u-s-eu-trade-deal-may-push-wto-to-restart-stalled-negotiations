A decision by the U.S. and European
Union to open negotiations on a trade deal may propel the  World
Trade Organization  to restart its own stalled talks,  New
Zealand ’s candidate for the top WTO job said.  U.S. support for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership is the latest sign  Washington  is pivoting away from
the WTO, whose efforts to revise the international trading
system broke down in 2008. The U.S. is also negotiating a trade
deal with 11 Pacific Rim countries.  The U.S.-EU talks “may well provide exactly the type of
external shock to restart the (WTO) negotiations,” said New
Zealand’s Trade Minister Tim Groser, one of nine contenders to
succeed  Pascal Lamy  as WTO chief in late August.  “The problem is the decreasing relevance year by year of
an organization that has not refreshed its rules and obligations
in any important way” for 19 years, Groser said in Ankara last
night. “What we’ve got to do is generate fresh energy in the
center of the system to reduce the need for countries to look at
alternatives.”  In December, U.S. Ambassador to the WTO Michael Punke
called the organization “an institution at a crossroads,
particularly its vital function as a forum for trade
negotiations.”  The U.S.-EU trade talks are designed to liberalize trade
and investment rules and address regulatory and other non-tariff
barriers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
