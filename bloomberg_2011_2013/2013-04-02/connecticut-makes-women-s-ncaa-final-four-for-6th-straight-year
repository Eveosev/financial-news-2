The  University of Connecticut 
cruised into the Final Four of the national women’s college
basketball tournament for a record sixth consecutive season with
an 83-53 rout of Kentucky.  Breanna Stewart scored 21 points last night in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, to lead UConn, which improved to 33-4 and will face
Notre Dame or Duke in the national semifinals on April 7 in New
Orleans. Notre Dame is a fellow No. 1 regional seed and beat the
Huskies at the Final Four the past two years.  The  University of California  also reached the Final Four
with a 65-62 overtime victory against Georgia last night in
Spokane, Washington. California was the No. 2 seed in the
Spokane regional behind Stanford, which lost to fourth-seeded
Georgia in the regional semifinals.  Notre Dame  and Duke meet tonight in the Norfolk, Virginia,
regional for a trip to the Final Four. Also tonight is the
Oklahoma City regional final between No. 2 Tennessee and No. 5
Louisville, which knocked top overall seed and defending
champion Baylor out of the tournament two days ago.  Connecticut previously reached the Final Four of the
women’s tournament five straight times from 2000-04, as did
Louisiana State (2004-08) and Stanford (2008-12).  To contact the reporter on this story:
