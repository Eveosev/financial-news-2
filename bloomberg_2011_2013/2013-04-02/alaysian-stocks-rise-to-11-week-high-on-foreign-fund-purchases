Malaysian stocks  jumped, driving the
benchmark index to an 11-week high after exchange data showed
foreign funds bought shares for a fourth consecutive month.  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI)  climbed 1 percent to
1,685 at the close in  Kuala Lumpur , the highest level since Jan.
15. The gain was the biggest among benchmark gauges in Asia. The
gauge’s trading volumes were about 13 percent above the 30-day
average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  International funds bought 4.8 billion ringgit ($1.6
billion) more Malaysian stocks than they sold in March, compared
with net sales of 2.4 billion ringgit by local funds, according
to data on Bursa Malaysia Bhd.’s website. The KLCI Index rallied
3.9 percent from a three-week low on March 18.  “Foreign funds are pushing up stocks and I think local
funds have to participate,” Lye Thim Loong, who helps manage
the equivalent of $500 million at Libra Invest Bhd., said by
phone. It looks like investors are not paying attention to
election concerns, he said.  The KLCI declined 1.3 percent this year through yesterday
on concern about political risks from impending general
elections. Prime Minister Najib Razak may dissolve parliament
tomorrow, the New Straits Times reported today, citing people it
didn’t name.  Tenaga Nasional Bhd. (TNB) , the nation’s biggest power producer,
advanced 5.1 percent to the highest close since January 2008.
 British American Tobacco Malaysia Bhd. (ROTH)  gained 4.9 percent, while
 Genting Bhd. (GENT)  climbed 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
