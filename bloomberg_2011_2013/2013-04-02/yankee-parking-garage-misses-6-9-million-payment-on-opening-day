The operator of parking garages at
 New York ’s Yankee Stadium missed a $6.9 million interest payment
to bondholders yesterday, according to a  securities filing .  It was the the first time Bronx Parking Development Corp.
has skipped a payment to investors, Steven Polivy, an attorney
at Akerman Senterfitt LLP representing the company, said in a
telephone interview from New York. The next scheduled one is for
$8.1 million on Oct. 1. Polivy wouldn’t say if the October
payment would be made.  Bronx Parking issued $237.6 million of municipal bonds in
2007 through  New York City ’s Industrial Development Agency to
build three garages and renovate two others. The structures
haven’t generated enough revenue and Bronx Parking has hired
Willkie Farr & Gallagher to serve as bankruptcy counsel.  “Due to the continued financial difficulties experienced
by the company, the interest payment scheduled on April 1, 2013
will not be made,” according to a filing on the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board’s website.  The  New York Yankees  began their 2013 season yesterday at
home, losing 8-2 against the  Boston Red Sox .  The Bond Buyer reported the missed payment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
