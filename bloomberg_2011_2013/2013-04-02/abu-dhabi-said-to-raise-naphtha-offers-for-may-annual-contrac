Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. offered
to sell a year’s supply of naphtha starting in May at higher
levels than its February contract, according to two people
involved in discussions with Asian buyers.  The company offered low-sulfur naphtha and splitter grade
at a premium of $36.50 a metric ton to Middle East prices, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential. Pentane-plus grade naphtha was offered at a
premium of $38 a ton, they said.  Officials at the marketing and research departments in Abu
Dhabi weren’t available to answer two telephone calls.  The United Arab Emirates-based producer known as Adnoc
delayed the contract, which typically starts in April, because
of limited supplies, four people with knowledge of the matter
said in March.  Adnoc set premiums at $32 to $34 a ton for the annual
contract starting in February this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
