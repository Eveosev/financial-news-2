Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  fell the most in a
month after Eric Sheridan, an analyst at UBS AG, said the daily-
deals website had an “unproven business model” and initiated
coverage with a sell rating.  The stock declined 5.7 percent to $5.62 at 10:49 a.m. in
New York, and earlier touched $5.48 for the biggest intraday
decrease since Feb. 28. Sheridan set a $4.40 target price.  After the ouster of Andrew Mason as chief executive officer
in February, Groupon is searching for a replacement who can help
restore credibility and expand beyond Web-based coupons to e-
commerce. The Chicago-based company has  lost  $723.8 million in
the past three years.  “We are unsure about the next chapter of the Groupon
story,” Sheridan wrote in a research report. “A new CEO is
expected to be named over the coming three to six months,
further clouding our view of what Groupon might look like a few
years from now.”  The company generates revenue by offering discounts --
known as Groupons -- from businesses such as restaurants and
nail salons. It then shares the revenue with the businesses.  Groupon Goods, a service started in 2011 to help retail
companies such as  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  peddle thousands of
marked-down items via two-day sales, is on track to reach about
$2 billion in annual billings, Groupon said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
