Spain  is in negotiations with the
European Commission to raise its budget deficit goal for 2013 to
about 6 percent of gross domestic product from 4.5 percent as it
prepares to update mid-term budget plans amid a  recession .  The Spanish government is aiming at a figure of about 6
percent of GDP, said a spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Economy
Ministry, who asked not to be named in line with government
policy. She declined to comment on a press report that the
government may cut its economic forecast for this year to a 1
percent contraction from 0.5 percent.  In Brussels, commission spokesman Olivier Bailly told
reporters the EU isn’t in talks with Spain and that it needs to
finalize its assessment on the  nation’s budget performance.
“We are, like with all other  member states , in contact with the
Spanish authorities to make our assessment more credible and
more solid,” he said.  Spain is due to submit to the commission this month its
mid-term budget plans or so-called “stability program.” The
country has been under EU monitoring since 2009, when public
 overspending  ballooned to 11.2 percent of GDP after the collapse
of a real estate-fueled boom triggered an economic slump that is
now entering its sixth year.  Yields Fall  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bonds  fell seven
basis points to 4.99 percent at 1:51 p.m. in  Madrid . That
compares with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July before the
 European Central Bank  pledged to support the single currency.
The spread with similar German maturities narrowed nine basis
points to 3.68 percentage points.  “When it comes to the rumors about the extension of one or
two years of the targets that the commission and the other euro-
area member states could grant Spain, I must say that we are not
in negotiations with the Spanish government,” Bailly said.  The commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive, is waiting
for Eurostat to release 2012 budget data for Spain on April 22
before taking a decision, Bailly said, referring to the EU’s
statistic office. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since
December 2011, has said he cut the deficit to 7 percent of GDP
last year from 9 percent in 2011. Including aid to the banking
sector, the figure was 10.2 percent of GDP, up from 9.4 percent.  Rajoy said on March 20 that he expects to cut his forecast
for economic growth this year. His prediction of a 0.5 percent
contraction is smaller than the International Monetary Fund’s
forecast of 1.5 percent and the EU’s 1.4 percent. The economy
 contracted  1.4 percent last year after growing 0.4 percent in
2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
