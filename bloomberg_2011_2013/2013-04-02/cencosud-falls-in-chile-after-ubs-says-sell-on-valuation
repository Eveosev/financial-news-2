Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) ,  Chile ’s largest
retailer by sales, posted its longest losing streak in four
months after UBS AG recommended selling the stock, citing high
valuation and currency risks.  Shares retreated 0.5 percent to 2,890 pesos at 10:59 a.m.
in Santiago in its sixth day of declines, the longest stretch of
losses since Nov. 30. The Ipsa benchmark index of stocks
advanced 0.1 percent.  UBS cut its recommendation for Cencosud to sell from
neutral and lowered its price target to 2,900 pesos from 3,170
pesos, according to in an e-mailed report to clients. The
retailer trades at higher valuations than regional peers with
better returns on invested capital and lower leverage, according
to UBS.  “Cencosud is highly exposed to Argentinean currency risks
and faces high execution risks in Brazil and  Colombia ,” UBS
analyst Gustavo Piras Oliveira wrote in the note.  Cencosud trades at 21 times estimated earnings for the next
12 months and has a return over invested capital of 6.9 percent,
compared with an average 11 percent for Latin America retailers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
