West Texas Intermediate crude rose
as U.S. equities surged after data showed U.S. factory orders
exceeded forecasts, signaling increasing economic growth and
fuel demand.  Futures advanced for the fifth time in six days as the
Commerce Department reported that  orders  placed with U.S.
factories gained the most in five months in February, boosted by
a pickup in demand for motor vehicles and commercial aircraft.
An Energy Information Administration report tomorrow will
probably show stockpiles climbed by  2.05 million barrels  last
week, according to the median of 12 analyst responses in a
Bloomberg survey.  “The  U.S. economy  is improving and that’s showing up in
the strong move in equities,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York-based energy hedge fund. “Oil is
also getting some support from the improving economic outlook.”  WTI crude oil for May delivery climbed 12 cents to settle
at $97.19 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract dropped as much as 1.2 percent to $95.91 today. The
volume of all futures traded was 1.9 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day at 4:33 p.m.  Oil fell from the settlement as the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. in  Washington  that U.S.
inventories increased 4.71 million barrels last week to 385.1
million. Futures were down 28 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $96.79
at 4:33 p.m. They traded at $96.82 before the report.  Brent oil for May settlement decreased 39 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $110.69 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all futures
traded was 18 percent higher than the 100-day average.  Economic Data  The 3 percent gain in bookings for U.S. manufactured goods
followed a revised 1 percent decline in January, according to
the Commerce Department. The  median  forecast of 64 economists in
a Bloomberg survey called for a 2.9 percent rise. The advance
was led by a 5.6 percent surge in demand for durable goods.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.5 percent and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 0.6 percent.  Brent traded at a $13.50 premium to WTI futures, compared
with $14.01 yesterday and $12.79 March 28. The European
benchmark’s premium widened yesterday as the shutdown of  Exxon (XOM) 
Mobil Corp.’s Pegasus pipeline system, which moves oil to  Gulf
Coast  refineries from the central U.S., threatened to exacerbate
a regional glut.  “There’s less concern about the impact of the pipeline
closure today and as a result the Brent-WTI spread is
narrowing,” Kilduff said.  Pipeline Plan  Exxon is developing a plan to repair a leak that shut the
96,000 barrel-a-day pipeline system after a spill was discovered
March 29 in  Arkansas . The line runs 940 miles (1,512 kilometers)
from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland,  Texas , and serves
refineries around  Port Arthur  and Beaumont on the Gulf Coast
near Texas’ border with Louisiana.  Tomorrow’s EIA report will probably show that U.S. gasoline
stockpiles slid  1 million barrels  last week, according to the
median estimate in the Bloomberg survey. Supplies of  distillate
fuel , a category that includes heating oil and diesel, fell 1.1
million barrels, the survey showed.  “We’re going to be marking time for the most part until
the petroleum inventory data is released,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  The industry-funded API collects stockpile information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit, for its
weekly survey.  ‘Oil Aplenty’  “There’s no doubt that there’s oil aplenty in the U.S.,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in Chicago. “The rise in U.S. oil output is changing the
world energy picture dramatically. The only problem we have is
shipping it from place to place, which is why we’re paying
attention to the pipeline closure.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was 17.3 percent, down from 17.5 percent
yesterday. The figure has slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 453,144
contracts as of 4:30 p.m. It totaled 457,858 contracts
yesterday, 19 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.73 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
