GLG Partners, a hedge-fund unit of
Man Group Plc, has hired Mohit Kumar from Deutsche Bank AG,
where he was head of European interest-rate strategy.  “I can confirm that Mohit Kumar will be joining,” Laura Humble, a spokeswoman for Man Group said today by phone.  Kumar will join GLG’s macro and fixed-income team after he
left Deutsche Bank in  London  last week, according to three
people with knowledge of the appointment, who declined to be
identified because they are not authorized to speak on the
matter.  He will report to Sudi Mariappa, a former money manager at
Pacific Investment Management Co. who joined GLG last year,
another person said. GLG’s macro and fixed-income team is run by
Mariappa and Jamil Baz in London, where Kumar will be based.  Nick Probert, a spokesman at Deutsche Bank in London,
declined to comment. Kumar could not immediately be reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
