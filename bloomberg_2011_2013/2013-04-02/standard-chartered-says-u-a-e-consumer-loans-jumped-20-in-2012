Standard Chartered  Plc said its
United Arab Emirates consumer-banking assets grew almost 20
percent last year as the British bank extended more  mortgage
loans  and credit to small and medium-sized companies.  Standard Chartered, which counts the second-largest Arab
economy as one of its top 10 global markets, played a “more-
active role” in lending to the segments, regarded by the
government as critical for development, Khalid Elgibaly, head of
consumer banking for the U.A.E. and the Middle East, told a news
conference in Dubai today.  Standard Chartered has about 4 percent market share in
U.A.E. consumer banking, Elgibaly said at an event to unveil a
new platform for electronic banking. The country’s 51 banks,
including local units of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,
posted loan growth of 2.6 percent in 2012 to 1.1 trillion
dirhams ($299 billion), according to  central bank  data.  Home prices  in Dubai, one of seven emirates that make up
the U.A.E. federation, increased last year as an economic
recovery in the city spurred demand for properties. Standard
Chartered posted 60 percent growth in new mortgage lending in
2012, Ramy Lawand, the bank’s spokesman, said at the conference.  The nation’s central bank agreed last week to raise the cap
on mortgage loans to expatriates to 75 percent of the property’s
value for their first home purchase, a person familiar with the
matter said. The regulator had earlier proposed limiting home
loans to 50 percent of the value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
