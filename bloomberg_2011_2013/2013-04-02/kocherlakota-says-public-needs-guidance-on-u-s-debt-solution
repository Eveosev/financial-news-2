President Narayana Kocherlakota said controlling the national
debt in the long term will probably involve reductions in some
benefits for older Americans as well as tax increases.  “It doesn’t have to be fixed today,” Kocherlakota said in
response to a question from the audience after giving a speech
today in Grand Forks, North Dakota. “At the same time, offering
guidance to the public of the mix of tools that are going to be
used to address this problem is going to be helpful.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
