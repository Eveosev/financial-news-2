Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Africa’s
largest lender, and  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China ,
agreed to lend as much as 20 billion rand ($2.2 billion) for
renewable-energy projects in  South Africa .  “ Standard Bank  and ICBC will jointly provide debt
financing on a project-finance basis to companies that are
awarded preferred-bidder status under the country’s renewable
energy independent power producer procurement program,” George
Kotsovos, head of power and infrastructure finance at Standard
Bank, said in a statement on the Johannesburg-based lender’s
 website  today.  ICBC, the world’s largest bank by market value, is Standard
Bank’s largest shareholder with a 20 percent stake and the pair
have provided Chinese and African financing since 2008. South
Africa is seeking 3,725 megawatts of power from  renewable
sources  and companies have to submit bids in a third round of
offers by Aug. 19.  “The objective of this partnership is to facilitate the
entry of investors into South Africa,” ICBC Chairman  Jiang Jianqing  said in the statement. “ICBC is also certainly
interested in raising awareness of the South African investment
opportunity among Chinese suppliers as potential sources of
contracting capability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
