Chinese  stocks  fell to a three-month
low as health-care companies slumped and shares of smaller
companies dropped on speculation financing costs will increase.  Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. (600518)  sank 4.8 percent, leading the
drop by health-care companies, the nation’s best-performing
stocks this year. The  ChiNext (SZ399006)  index of start-up companies in
Shenzhen tumbled 3.6 percent after the central bank sold
 repurchase agreements  to remove funds from the money market.
 China  Vanke Co. led gains among developers as reports from
Macquarie Group Ltd. and BNP Paribas SA eased concerns over
curbs on property prices.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.3 percent to
2,227.74 at the close, the lowest level since Dec. 27. The
gauge’s trading volumes were 19 percent lower than the 30-day
average today, while 10-day  volatility  sank to a two-week low of
16.4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Markets will be
closed on April 4-5 for holidays.  “It’s a sector rotation as investors sell outperformers
like pharmaceutical stocks and buy laggards,” said Wu Kan, a
Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “Trading is a bit light ahead of
holidays and also investors are waiting for the release of
first-quarter earnings.”  Publicly traded companies in China are required to release
annual and first-quarter reports by the end of April. The 525
companies in the Shanghai Composite that have released 2012
earnings reported average profit growth of 3.8 percent, down
from 14 percent a year earlier,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lower Valuations  The Shanghai index slumped 8.5 percent from a Feb. 6 high
to yesterday amid concern steps to cool property prices will
drag on economic growth and as company earnings trailed
estimates. Valuations on the gauge sank yesterday to 9.1 times
projected 12-month earnings, the lowest level since Dec. 13 and
less than the seven-year average of 15.8, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  sank 0.3 percent to 2,486.39, a fourth
day of declines. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
lost 0.8 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure
of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 1 percent
in  New York .  A measure of health-care stocks in the CSI 300 tumbled 3.9
percent, the biggest loss among 10 industry groups. The gauge is
still up 17 percent this year, making it the best-performing
sub-index. It’s  valued  at 21.9 times projections for 12-month
earnings, more than double the CSI 300’s 9.8 times.  Drug Makers  Kangmei Pharmaceutical sank 4.8 percent to 17.02 yuan.
Beijing SL Pharmaceutical Co. tumbled 9.1 percent to 56 yuan.
 Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. (600267)  lost 4.4 percent to 14.27
yuan.  Pharmaceutical stocks rose too much and valuations are high
now,  Li Ying , an analyst at Capital Securities, said in a phone
interview in Shanghai.  Among companies with smaller market capitalizations, Anhui
Shengyun Machinery Co. tumbled 10 percent to 20.06 yuan, its
biggest loss since March 12.  Siasun Robot & Automation Co. (300024) 
slumped 10 percent to 29.88 yuan. The two stocks posted the
biggest declines in the ChiNext index.  The People’s Bank of China sold 30 billion yuan ($4.8
billion) of 28-day repurchase agreements today, the central bank
said in a statement today, draining money from the financial
system.  A gauge of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite
climbed 1.2 percent, the most of five sub-indexes. The gauge has
lost 9.3 percent this year, the Shanghai measure’s worst-
performing industry. Vanke, China’s largest publicly traded
developer, added 1.8 percent to 11.20  yuan , while  Poly Real
Estate Group Co. (600048)  gained 1.4 percent to 11.99 yuan.  Policy Overhang  The Shanghai property index rose 0.9 percent yesterday
after China’s largest cities unveiled rules on home purchases
that Credit Suisse Group AG said were milder than expected. The
measures announced were “far more benign” than anticipated,
Wee Liat Lee and Ronney Cheung, analysts at BNP Paribas, wrote
in a report dated today.  No new measures are expected over the next six months,
removing a policy overhang on the property industry, Macquarie
Group Ltd. analysts wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Anhui Conch Cement Co., China’s biggest cement maker,
jumped 3.8 percent to 17.96 yuan.  Huaxin Cement Co. (600801) , the Chinese
affiliate of Holcim Ltd., surged 7.6 percent to 14.67 yuan.  Cement prices rose 1.4 percent from a week earlier last
week and price gains have taken hold before the peak season for
investment, Wang Liyan, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities
Co., wrote in a report dated March 31.  GD Midea Holding Co. (000527) , China’s second-biggest publicly
traded appliance maker climbed by the 10 percent daily limit to
11.11 yuan. The stock matched yesterday’s 10 percent surge after
the household appliance maker’s parent announced plans to buy
out the listed company.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 1.2 percent to $36.48
yesterday, after losing 8.7 percent in the first quarter.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Weiyi Lim in Singapore.
