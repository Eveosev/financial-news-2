Japan ’s steel output will probably
fall 4.1 percent this quarter, the biggest decline in five
quarters, as domestic mills await the results of efforts to
stimulate the economy.  Crude steel output in Japan will probably fall to 26.38
million metric tons in the quarter that started April 1 from
27.5 million tons in the same period a year earlier, the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said today in a
statement. Production is set to fall 0.9 percent from the
estimate for the previous quarter, the ministry said.  Japan’s rebuilding of areas wrecked by the earthquake and
tsunami in March 2011 and higher exports spurred by the
weakening of the yen are failing to overcome a drop in domestic
demand from shipbuilders, carmakers and other manufacturers. The
country’s crude steel output was little changed at about 107.3
million metric tons in the fiscal year ended March 31, the
statement said.  Domestic consumption of ordinary steel from shipbuilding
customers is set to fall 24.2 percent this quarter due to global
overcapacity, the biggest drop among manufacturers. Carmakers
are forecast to cut their use of steel by 9.5 percent from a
year earlier. Consumption of ordinary steel used in construction
is likely to increase 5.8 percent to 4.92 million tons in the
current quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
