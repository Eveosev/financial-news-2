Chinese industrial companies’
profits rose 17.3 percent in December from a year earlier to 895
billion  yuan , the National Bureau of Statistics said on its
website today.   Profits for the January-to-December period increased 5.3
percent to 5.56 trillion yuan, the bureau said. That compared
with a gain of 3 percent in the first 11 months of 2012.   The world’s second-biggest economy had the first pickup in
growth in eight quarters in the last three months of 2012 after
the government accelerated investment-project approvals, boosted
spending on infrastructure and cut taxes. Gross domestic product
expanded 7.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 7.4
percent pace in the previous period.   Industrial profits may rise by an average 30 percent this
year as the economy continues to recover, businesses start
restocking and export demand improves, Standard Chartered Plc
forecasts. Expansion in GDP may accelerate to 8.1 percent this
year from 7.8 percent in 2012, according to the median of 44
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey this month.   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
