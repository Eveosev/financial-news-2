Dubai’s stocks rose to a three-year
high as  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  said apartments offered at a new
development sold out in a day, fueling investor optimism for
further recovery in the emirate’s property industry.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest tower, surged to
the highest level since October 2009.  Deyaar Development (DEYAAR)  PJSC
advanced 1.4 percent. The benchmark DFM General Index jumped 1.5
percent to 1,819.01, the strongest level since April 2010, at
the close in the emirate. About 343  million shares  changed hands
in Dubai today, almost double the 12-month daily average.  Emaar said The Address Residence Fountain Views, which will
comprise 280 apartments, sold all units available at a first
offering. The luxury hotel project, to be located in central
Dubai, was announced last week amid increasing demand for high-
end properties as the local  property market  recovers after a
2008 crash sent  home prices  tumbling more than 65 percent. The
emirate’s economy may have expanded 5 percent in 2012, the
fastest pace since 2007, according to government forecasts.  “The sale proved that sentiment in Dubai is very positive,
as reflected in the real estate sector,” said Nabil Rantisi,
managing director of brokerage at Abu Dhabi-based Menacorp.
“The sale will also reflect on the bottom line of Emaar.”  Profit Increase  Emaar, whose shares surged 3.6 percent to 4.64 dirhams
today, may post a 16 percent advance in 2012 profit, according
to the average estimate of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
The stock surged 46 percent last year, outpacing the Dubai
gauge’s 20 percent gain.  Dubai-based Deyaar’s shares advanced to 37.5 fils, the
highest close since Jan. 17. The company will probably post a 43
percent advance in 2012 profit, according to a Securities &
Investment Co. estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI) ’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose
to 80 today. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that
a security or index is poised to decline. The measure was the
Gulf Cooperation Council’s best performer last year.  In North Africa, 21 stocks on Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  decreased, while eight rose and one was unchanged. The
gauge was little changed following a drop of as much as 1.9
percent after dozens died in protests marking the second
anniversary of the uprising that toppled  Hosni Mubarak .  Loan Uncertainty  Egypt, which reached an initial agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund  for a $4.8 billion loan in November,
has seen political unrest since then delay final approval by the
lender’s board. An IMF team is to return to Cairo within two
weeks, Prime Minister Hisham Qandil said Jan. 24.  “We should be heading north again as soon as an IMF deal
is finalized and as we move closer to a resolution to the
political conflict,” Tamer Nigm, head of sales trading at
Cairo-based Watheeqa Securities, said by phone.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East ,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
gained 0.6 percent, Kuwait’s  gauge  advanced 0.1 percent and
Bahrain’s  measure  increased 0.3 percent. Oman’s MSM30 Index,
Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  and the  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index (BGCC200)  of the biggest companies in the Gulf were little changed.
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  decreased 0.6 percent.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  dropped 0.3 percent at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv. The yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25
percent bonds maturing March 2023 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.99 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
