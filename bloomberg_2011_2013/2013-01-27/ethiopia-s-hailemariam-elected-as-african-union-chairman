Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was elected by African heads of state as chairman of
the  African Union  today, replacing Benin’s President Yayi Boni.  The 47-year-old Hailemariam, who became leader of Ethiopia
after the death from illness of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in
August, will serve a one-year term as head of the African Union,
or AU.  The 54-member continental bloc’s assembly is meeting in
Ethiopia’s capital,  Addis Ababa . The AU faces several security
challenges on the continent, including rebellions in Mali,
eastern  Democratic Republic  of Congo and the Central African
Republic, and continuing tension between South Sudan and Sudan
which have failed to implement agreements on borders.  “We should do everything possible to help restore
constitutional order in Mali and safeguard the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country,” Hailemariam said.  The Addis Ababa-based AU Commission is headed by South
Africa’s Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who was elected for a four-year
term in July and is the first woman to head the organization’s
secretariat.  Hailemariam, a former foreign minister and deputy prime
minister, is from the minority Wolayta ethnicity that has
historically been excluded from power in Ethiopia by more
populous groups. He is also a Protestant in a nation dominated
by Orthodox Christians and Muslims.  To contact the reporter on this story:  William Davison  in Addis
