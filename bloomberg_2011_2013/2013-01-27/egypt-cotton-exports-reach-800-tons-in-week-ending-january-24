Egypt  agreed to export 800 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending Jan. 24, according to the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association.  The country has shipped 33,915 tons of the fiber, valued at
$97.6 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in its
weekly bulletin. Exports in the past week included 400 tons of
the Giza 88 variety and 400 tons of Giza 86, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton. The
cotton is used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh
and  India  are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
