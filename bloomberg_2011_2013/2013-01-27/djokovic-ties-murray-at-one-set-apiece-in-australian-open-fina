Two-time defending champion Novak Djokovic won the second set 7-6 (7-3) in the Australian Open
final against Andy Murray, tying the match at one set apiece.  The turning point in the second-set tiebreaker came when
Murray double faulted on the fifth point, right after he had to
halt play for a few seconds as a feather floated down from the
roof.  Murray won the first set 7-6 (7-2). There have been no
service breaks in the first two sets, each of which has lasted
more than an hour.  Murray, 25, the third seed from Britain, is seeking his
first title at the season-opening Grand Slam in  Melbourne .  The top-seeded Djokovic, 25, of  Serbia , is seeking to
become the first man to win three straight Australian Open
tennis titles since the sportâ€™s professional era began in 1968.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
