Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in a coma since suffering a brain hemorrhage in 2006,
may be unconsciously aware of his surroundings, according to a
group of U.S. and Israeli doctors.  During a two-hour test, a team of brain scientists,
including Alon Friedman of Ben-Gurion University and Martin
Monti of the  University of California  at  Los Angeles , exposed
Sharon to stimulation such as pictures of his family and
recordings of his son’s voice in an attempt to discern whether
his brain could process stimuli. While activity was observed,
indicating Sharon was processing the information, there was no
evidence he was consciously engaged, they said.  “Information from the external world is being transferred
to the appropriate parts of Mr. Sharon’s brain,” Monti said in
an e-mailed statement from  Israel ’s Ben-Gurion University.
“However, the evidence does not as clearly indicate whether Mr.
Sharon is consciously perceiving this information.”  Sharon, 85, had served four years as prime minister when he
suffered a debilitating stroke in 2006 that left him in a coma.
Earlier, he was one of Israel’s most controversial generals and
was forced to resign as defense minister after a government
commission assigned him indirect blame for the massacre of
Palestinian refugees by Israeli-allied Lebanese Christians in
1982. Sharon was later hailed internationally as a peacemaker
when he evacuated thousands of Jewish settlers from the  Gaza
Strip  in 2005 and handed the territory to the Palestinians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
