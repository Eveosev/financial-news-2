Fog delayed third-round action at
the U.S. PGA Tour’s Farmers Insurance Open, where  Tiger Woods 
holds the lead after 36 holes.  Six players were able to tee off and only three completed a
hole as the fog lifted for five minutes before conditions again
made it impossible to play at  Torrey Pines  in  La Jolla ,
California.  Woods stands at 11-under 133 after two rounds to top the
leaderboard. Billy Horschel is second at 9-under 135, one stroke
ahead of Erik Compton, Brad Fritsch, Casey Wittenberg, Jimmy
Walker, Josh Teater and Steve Marino.  Third round play is expected to resume today at 10 a.m. and
continue until dark, according to the PGA Tour.  Mark Russell, the vice president of rules, competition and
administration for the  PGA Tour , said he expects to have to
complete between nine to 12 holes tomorrow.  A total of 87 players made the cut so normally there would
be a secondary cut after the third round, the PGA said. Because
of the weather delay, there won’t be an additional, cut nor will
the players be re-paired for the final round.  Woods has won this title six times although he has only
held the 36-hole lead twice at the tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
