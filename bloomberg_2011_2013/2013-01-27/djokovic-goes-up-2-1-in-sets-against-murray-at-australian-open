Two-time defending champion  Novak
Djokovic  has taken a two-sets-to-one lead against  Andy Murray  in
the Australian Open final.  Djokovic won the third set 6-3, getting the first service
break of the match in the eighth game, after the players split
tiebreakers in the first two sets.  Murray won the first set 7-6 (7-2). The turning point in
the second-set tiebreaker, won 7-3 by Djokovic, came when
Murray double faulted on the fifth point -- right after he had
to halt play for a few seconds as a feather floated down from
the roof.  The top-seeded Djokovic, 25, of Serbia, is seeking to
become the first man to win three straight Australian Open
tennis titles since the sportâ€™s professional era began in 1968.  Murray, 25, the third seed from Britain, is seeking his
first title at the season-opening Grand Slam in  Melbourne .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
