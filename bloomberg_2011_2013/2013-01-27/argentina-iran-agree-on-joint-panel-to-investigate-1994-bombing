Argentina  and Iran agreed to set up
an international commission to investigate the 1994 bombing of a
Jewish center in  Buenos Aires , according to a joint declaration
by their foreign ministries today.  The commission will have five members, two of them
designated by each country, while the president will be agreed
upon jointly.  The blast in July 1994, which left 85 people dead, was the
second terror attack in the city in a two-year span, following a
1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy. Argentina has accused
current and former Iranian officials, including Defense Minister
Ahmad Vahidi, of involvement. Iran has rejected the accusations.  “It’s an important step that’s been taken by the two
countries because this case has been around for 18 years,”
Iran’s Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  told reporters today in
Addis Ababa, where he’s attending an African Union summit.
“It’s about time for it to be resolved.”  The commission will review documents supplied by both
countries and be able to interrogate suspects in Iran, according
to the statement.  Israel has warned the Argentine government “not to let
itself be manipulated” in discussions to set up the panel,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said in a telephone
interview from  Jerusalem  today.  “Obviously, anyone who has tried to cooperate on anything
with Iran has found themselves tricked and ridiculed,” Palmor
said. “We are a party in all this and expect to be kept up to
date on the findings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
