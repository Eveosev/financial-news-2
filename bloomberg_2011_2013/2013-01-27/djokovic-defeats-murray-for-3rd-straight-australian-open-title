Novak Djokovic defeated  Andy Murray 
to become the first man to win three straight Australian Open
tennis titles since the sportâ€™s professional era began in 1968.  The top-seeded Djokovic, 25, from Serbia, did not lose his
serve in the match and won 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-2
against the third-seeded Briton for his fourth Australian Open
title and his sixth Grand Slam championship.  Murray, 25, won the first set and was even in the second-
set tiebreaker before he double faulted on the fifth point,
right after he had to halt play for a few seconds as a feather
floated down from the roof of Rod Laver Arena in  Melbourne .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
