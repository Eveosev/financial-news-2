(Corrects market-value ranking in first paragraph.)  Masraf Al Rayan (MARK)  reported a 7.9
percent increase in profit last year, helping Qatar’s second-
biggest lender by market value finance a plan to buy shares in
banks in Libya and the U.K.  Net income for 2012 rose to 1.52 billion riyals ($420
million), the lender said today in an e-mailed release. Qatar
National Bank Financial Services forecast a profit of 1.45
billion riyals. The lender’s board recommended a cash dividend
of 1 riyal a share.  “We are expecting a decent performance on the stock,”
Ahmed Shehada, head of trading at Qatar National Bank Financial
Services in Doha, said in a phone interview from Qatar. “The
result is not just above our projection but above what was
expected generally. Paying a 1 riyal dividend demonstrates the
bank’s commitment to its shareholders.”  Masraf is in the process of acquiring shares in a Libyan
bank through a capital increase, the lender said, without naming
the bank. It’s also in the process of buying a stake in  Islamic
Bank of Britain  Plc. Qatari banks are expanding abroad amid
limited growth opportunities in their home market of 1.8 million
people.  Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC (CBQK) , the country’s second-biggest
lender by assets, plans to complete talks next month to buy a 75
percent in  Turkey ’s Alternatifbank.  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the
country’s biggest lender, agreed to buy a majority stake in
 Egypt ’s National Societe General Bank SAE last month.  Masraf’s financing activities rose to 42.8 billion riyals
last year from 34.8 billion in 2011, the lender said. Deposits
rose to 45 billion riyals from 33.1 billion riyals and assets
increased 12 percent to 61.6 billion riyals.  The share price  fell 1.6 percent today to 25.3 riyals on
the Qatar Exchange before the results were announced. The shares
rose 3.7 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.4 percent
return for the  QE Index (DSM)  of Qatari companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
