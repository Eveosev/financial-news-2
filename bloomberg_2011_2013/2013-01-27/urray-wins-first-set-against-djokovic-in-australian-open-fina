Andy Murray won the first set 7-6
(7-2) against two-time defending champion Novak Djokovic in the
Australian Open final.  There were no service breaks in the set, which lasted more
than an hour.  The top-seeded Djokovic, 25, of  Serbia , is seeking to
become the first man to win three straight Australian Open
tennis titles since the sportâ€™s professional era began in 1968.  Murray, 25, the third seed from Britain, is seeking his
first title at the season-opening Grand Slam in Melbourne.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
