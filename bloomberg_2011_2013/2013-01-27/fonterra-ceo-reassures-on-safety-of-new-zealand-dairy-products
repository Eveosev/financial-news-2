Theo Spierings, chief executive
officer of  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG) , the world’s largest
dairy exporter, said today that New Zealand’s dairy products are
safe to consume after a scare over milk contamination.  The comments came after tests found low levels of the
fertilizer aid dicyandiamide, or DCD, in dairy products last
week. “We have strong science and we are providing assurances
about the safety of our product,” Spierings said according to
an e-mailed statement. “Our testing has found only minute
traces of DCD in samples of some of our products. Our products
are safe. Customers can rest assured.”  DCD is used to improve water quality on farms by reducing
nitrate levels, as well as cut greenhouse gas emissions,
according to the New Zealand government.  Auckland-based Fonterra, which exports to more than 100
countries, relies on  China  and  emerging markets  to drive growth.
In 2008, a melamine-milk contamination in China killed at least
six infants, causing the collapse of its local partner Sanlu
Group. The company forecasts the international dairy trade will
increase at least 100 billion liters by 2020, led by China and
India.  “Since November, we have been closely involved in a
working group with the government, the fertilizer companies,
scientists and other dairy industry representatives gathering
scientific opinion, and undertaking tests,” Spierings said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
