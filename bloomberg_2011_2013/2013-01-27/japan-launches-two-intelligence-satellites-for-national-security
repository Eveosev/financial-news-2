Japan launched two intelligence
satellites into orbit today in an effort to bolster national
security.  An H-2A radar satellite for data collection and an optical
rocket took off from the Tanegashima space center in Kagoshima
prefecture, southern Japan, around 1:40 p.m. local time, the
 Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency , known as JAXA, and
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) , said in a statement.  The launches come less than a week after  North Korea 
threatened to test a nuclear weapon to derail U.S. policies it
described as “hostile.” The Obama administration pushed
through United Nations sanctions against the totalitarian state
for firing a rocket last month.  “Japan will strengthen its national security and risk
management by making use of these satellites,” Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
