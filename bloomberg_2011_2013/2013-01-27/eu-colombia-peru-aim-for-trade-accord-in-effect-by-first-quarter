The European Union, Colombia and
 Peru  are working to implement their free trade agreement on a
provisional basis by the end of March, European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso said.  Full implementation will follow once the accord has been
approved by Colombia’s Senate, Barroso told reporters in
Santiago, Chile. The European Parliament and Peru’s Congress
approved the deal last month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
