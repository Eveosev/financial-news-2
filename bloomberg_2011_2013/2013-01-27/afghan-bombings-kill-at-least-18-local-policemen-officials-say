At least 18 policemen were killed in
two separate bomb attacks in  Afghanistan  last night, according
to provincial government officials.  Eight officers and two detainees died and seven others were
wounded after their vehicle hit a bomb in the southern city of
Kandahar, Jawid Faisal, a spokesman for the Kandahar province,
said in a telephone interview. Ten policemen, including the
local heads of counter-terrorism and traffic police departments,
were killed by a suicide bomber in the northern Kunduz region,
said Enayatullah Khaliq, a spokesman for the province.  “Our police forces had been tasked to patrolling
suspicious areas in the east part of Kandahar,” said Faisal.
“They defused a first bomb and detained three people on
suspicion. While heading back to their base, another planted
bomb exploded, hitting vehicles.”  Zabihullah Mujahed, a spokesman for the Taliban, claimed
responsibility for the Kunduz suicide bombing, which also
injured 19 people including five officers, in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
