Championship club Leeds beat eight-
time champion Tottenham 2-1 today to provide another upset in
this year’s fourth round of English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  Luke Varney and Ross McCormack scored at Elland Road as
Leeds took a two-goal lead, before Clint Dempsey replied for
Tottenham.  Earlier today, defending champion Chelsea was held to a 2-2
tie at third-tier Brentford after twice rallying from a goal
behind. Liverpool is at Oldham in the day’s other match.  There have been several upsets in the fourth round,
including fifth-tier Luton Town’s 1-0 win at Premier League
Norwich yesterday. MK Dons won 4-2 at Queens Park Rangers and
Millwall defeated Aston Villa 2-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
