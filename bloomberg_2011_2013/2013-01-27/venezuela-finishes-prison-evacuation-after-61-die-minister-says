A battle between national guard
forces and prisoners at  Venezuela ’s Uribana prison in western
Lara state has left 58 dead, prisons Minister Iris Varela said
today.  Forty-six people remain hospitalized and 49 have been
released from hospital care and remain under medical
supervision, Varela said on state television. Venezuelan
authorities completed the evacuation of Uribana today after the
riot on Jan. 25, Varela wrote earlier today in a message on her
Twitter account.  “We have a regrettable balance of 57 people who died here
at the prison as well as later as a product of injuries incurred
here, plus the body of the person we found who was burned on
these premises,” Varela said.  Fighting broke out Jan. 25 between guards and inmates prior
to a planned search of the prison, Vice President  Nicolas Maduro 
said yesterday.  “There was a situation of tragic confusion that we greatly
regret,” Maduro said on state television. “The plan to reform
our prisons will continue to ensure they aren’t ruled by
violence, Mafia, drugs and death, as they have been for a long
time.”  Varela said yesterday that local media alerted inmates to
the imminent search for weapons by prison guards.  “If we have a state that cannot offer security in a
prison, what can happen with the people in the streets,”
opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski said in an e-mailed
statement today. “If this had happened in another country, they
would have at least changed the person responsible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
