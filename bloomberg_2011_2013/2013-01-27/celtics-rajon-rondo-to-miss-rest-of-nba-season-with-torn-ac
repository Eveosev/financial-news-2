The Boston Celtics lost All-Star
point guard  Rajon Rondo  for the rest of the season because of a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.  Rondo, who led the National Basketball Association with an
average of 11.1 assists a game, was injured during the Celtics’
Jan. 25 loss to the Atlanta Hawks.  After going through warmups prior to yesterday’s double-
overtime win against the  Miami Heat , Rondo was ruled out and
taken for a scan, which revealed the extent of the injury. A
date for surgery hasn’t been determined, the Celtics said in a
news release on their website.  “I knew before the game, I didn’t tell anyone,” Celtics
coach Doc Rivers said at a news conference after Boston halted a
six-game losing streak with yesterday’s 100-98 victory. “It was
pretty emotional.”  A four-time All-Star, Rondo also averaged 13.7 points and
5.6 rebounds a game this season for the Celtics, who are in
eighth place in the Eastern Conference with a 21-23 record.  “We’ve got to rally around each other,” Celtics forward
 Paul Pierce  told reporters. “I feel for him. He was having such
a good season. It’s disappointing news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
