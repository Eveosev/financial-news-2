General Motors Co. (GM)  said it will
begin a third shift at the Gravatai Industrial Complex in Brazil
and add 2,630 factory and supplier jobs.  The Chevrolet Celta and Onix are made at the complex,
according to a statement on GM’s website. The Detroit-based
automaker will start production of another small sedan in
February, prompting the third shift, Jaime Ardila, president of
GM South America, said in the statement. GM didn’t provide
additional details.  “We launched nine all-new Chevrolet models in the last 15
months in the Brazilian market and are poised for growth,”
Ardila said in the statement. GM will add 1,450 jobs at a
vehicle-assembly plant and 180 at a powertrain factory, while
suppliers will add 1,000 jobs, according to the statement.  GM is looking to improve financial results in South America
as the company’s growth in China slows and losses in  Europe 
persist.  Brazil  accounted for 60 percent of the South American
unit’s vehicle sales during the first nine months of 2012,
according to a U.S. regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
