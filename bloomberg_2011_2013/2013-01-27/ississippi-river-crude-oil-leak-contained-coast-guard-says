An  oil spill  in the Mississippi
River near Vicksburg, Mississippi, has been contained after two
barges struck a railroad bridge, the Coast Guard said in a
statement.  One of the barges released oil into the river and tank
levels are being monitored for further leakage, the Coast Guard
said. The amount of the leak hasn’t been determined, according
to the statement. The tank held about 80,000 gallons of light
crude oil.  The lower Mississippi River has been closed to traffic from
mile marker 425 to mile marker 441 near Vicksburg. No injuries
were reported.  The vessel towing the barges was owned by Nature’s Way
Marine LLC, the Coast Guard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
