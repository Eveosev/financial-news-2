James Bell scored eight of Villanova
University’s 14 overtime points to help upset third-ranked
Syracuse University 75-71 in college basketball.  It was the second time in a week that the Wildcats defeated
a top-five team. Villanova beat No. 5 Louisville 73-64 on Jan.
22.  “What a week for us,” coach Jay Wright told reporters.  Louisville fell for the third straight time yesterday,
losing 53-51 to Georgetown. In other games involving top-five
teams, it was No. 1 Duke 84, Maryland 64 and No. 3 Kansas 67,
Oklahoma 54.  Ryan Arcidiacono hit a 3-pointer with three seconds left in
regulation play to tie the game at 61-61 and force overtime on
his home court at The Pavilion in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . He
ended the game with 10 points.  “I just put it up and luckily it went in,” Arcidiacono
said. “I think we’re having fun.”  Bell, who scored 13 points, hit back-to-back 3-pointers in
overtime to help the Wildcats (13-7, 4-3 Big East) outscore the
Orange 14-10 and hand Syracuse (18-2, 6-1 Big East) its first
Big East Conference loss.  Darrun Hilliard had 25 points for the Wildcats and
Mouphtaou Yarou added 14 points.  Brandon Triche led Syracuse with 23 points and Michael
Carter-Williams contributed 17.  At the Verizon Center in Washington, Aaron Bowen scored his
only points of the game when he made the deciding tip shot with
three minutes, 36 seconds left to give Georgetown a 52-50 lead.
Otto Porter Jr. added a free throw with two seconds left in the
Hoyas’ Big East win.  Porter had 17 points and 12 rebounds and Markel Starks
added 17 for the Hoyas, who had a 33-29 halftime lead.
Georgetown improved to 14-4 overall and 4-3 in the conference.  Luke Hancock, Gorgui Dieng and Russ Smith each scored 12
points for the Cardinals, who fell to 16-4 overall and 4-3 in
the Big East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
