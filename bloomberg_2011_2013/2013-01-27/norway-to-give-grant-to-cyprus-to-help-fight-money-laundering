Norway will make a grant to Cyprus
of 935,750 euros ($1.3 million) to help the island country boost
its technological abilities to fight  money laundering , the
Cypriot government said.  The grant will finance 85 percent of a 1.1 million- euro
project to upgrade the technological infrastructure and software
systems of Cyprus’s anti-money laundering unit, known as Mokas,
according to a  statement  posted today on the website of the
Cyprus government’s press office.  The upgrade will boost Mokas’s ability to better use
available information for automatically recognizing
relationships between data and suspects in order to prevent and
combat transnational organized crime, especially money
laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, according
to the statement.  Financial intelligence units in other European Union
members as well as other Cypriot law enforcement agencies will
also benefit from the upgrade, the government said. Norway will
grant the money via the Norwegian Financial Mechanism that funds
projects in 15 EU members in southern and central  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
