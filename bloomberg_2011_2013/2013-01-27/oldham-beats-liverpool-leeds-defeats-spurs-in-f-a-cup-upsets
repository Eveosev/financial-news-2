Oldham upset Liverpool 3-2 in the
fourth round of English soccerâ€™s F.A. Cup today, while Leeds
beat Tottenham 2-1 to also eliminate Premier League opposition.
Chelsea needs a replay after a 2-2 tie at Brentford.  Matt Smith  got goals near the beginning and end of the
first half for third-tier Oldham, with Reece Wabara also scoring
at Boundary Park.  Luis Suarez  and  Joe Allen  replied for
Liverpool.   Norwich, Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers have also been
knocked out by lower-league opposition at this stage in a series
of upsets. Fifth-tier Luton Town provided the biggest shock,
winning 1-0 at Norwich.  Today, Luke Varney and Ross McCormack scored at Elland Road
as Championship team Leeds took a two-goal lead, before Clint
Dempsey headed a goal for Tottenham, which is fourth in the
elite Premier League.  Chelsea, winner of the competition four times in the past
six seasons, twice rallied from a goal behind. Marcello Trotta
and Harry Forrester, with a penalty, got goals at Griffin Park
in west London for Brentford, which plays in the third-tier
League One. Oscar and  Fernando Torres  replied for the defending
champion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
