Bets on  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ’s decline are rising to the highest in a year on
concern the Israeli drugmaker won’t succeed in blocking
competition for its best-selling Copaxone treatment.  Puts with an exercise price 10 percent below Teva shares
cost 1.48 times more than calls betting on a 10 percent increase
on Jan. 25, according to one-month data compiled by Bloomberg.
The gauge known as skew was at the highest since Feb. 6. The
 Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest  New-York  traded
Israeli companies fell 0.4 last week.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) 
traded at the biggest premium to the Tel Aviv stock since April.  Teva, whose Copaxone injection holds about 40 percent of
the market for treating multiple sclerosis, requested last year
that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration further scrutinize
rival  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) ’s oral MS drug before clearing it. The
FDA is expected to make a ruling by end of March that may see
the BG-12 treatment approved, Biogen spokeswoman Kate Niazi-Sai
said by phone from Weston, Massachusetts on Jan. 25. Teva has
lost 9.5 percent since Dec. 11, when the company unveiled a
growth strategy aimed at substituting revenue for Copaxone.  “Sentiment on the shares hasn’t been that great since the
investor day,” Gary Nachman, an analyst at Susquehanna
Financial Group LP who rates Teva neutral, said by phone on Jan.
25. “The bigger issue for Teva investors in the near term is
BG-12, and it certainly seems like it has a very good profile,
and that could do a lot of damage in the market.”  Teva’s American depositary receipts were little changed at
$37.73 last week after the shares traded in Tel Aviv added 0.3
percent to 141.3 shekels, or the equivalent of $38. The shares
in Israel fell 1.3 percent to 139.5 shekels, or $37.48, at the
4:30 p.m. close today. Israel’s  benchmark TA-25 Index  lost 0.3
percent.  Slower Growth  A delay in the approval of the BG-12 pill would be a boon
for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, which depends on Copaxone
for about 20 percent of its sales. Teva also faces competition
from  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Gilenya as Copaxone loses its last patent
protection in 2015.  “We are confident that the review for BG-12 is on track,”
Biogen’s Niazi-Sai said.  Teva’s ADRs posted a third consecutive annual retreat in
2012, the longest stretch of declines on record. The company
will probably say on Feb. 7 that  sales  rose 11.2 percent last
year, the slowest pace since 2005, according to the mean
estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Levin failed to alleviate
investors’ concerns about the company’s outlook as he unveiled
last month a plan to replace revenue from branded drugs set to
lose patent protection in the next three years, Nachman said.
Levin lowered sales and profit projections for 2013 in November.  More ‘Downside’  “There’s still a lot of pressure in a lot of areas of
their business,” Nachman said. “Even though they took down
guidance, there’s still more chance of downside than upside.”  Mellanox, the maker of software used to transfer and store
data, dropped for a ninth week, losing 0.1 percent to $50.13.
The Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company forecast on Jan. 23
first-quarter sales that  missed  analysts’ projections by as much
as 48 percent.  Mellanox’s New York shares  traded  at a $8.48 premium to the
Tel Aviv shares on Jan. 25, the biggest gap since April 19.
Shares in Tel Aviv narrowed the difference today, surging 17
percent to 181.8 shekels, or $48.85.  The “stock has potential,” Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at
FBN Securities Inc. who has the equivalent of a neutral rating
on the shares, wrote in an e-mailed report Jan. 24. “Mellanox
offers the potential to show strong spurts in revenue growth.”  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  fell 4.2 percent to $32.74 last
week after Chardan Capital Markets LLC reiterated its sell
rating on Jan. 25 on the shares of the technology company. The
stock in Tel Aviv today lost 0.9 percent to 121. shekels, or the
equivalent of $32.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
