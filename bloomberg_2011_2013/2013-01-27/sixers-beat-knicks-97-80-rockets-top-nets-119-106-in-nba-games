The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the
New York Knicks 97-80, while the  Houston Rockets  topped the
Brooklyn Nets 119-106 in National Basketball Association
contests.  The Knicks (26-15) top the Eastern Conference’s five-team
Atlantic Division, 1 ½ games over the Nets (26-18) and nine
games ahead of the fourth-place 76ers (18-25). The Rockets (24-
22) are third in the Western Conference’s five-team Southwest
Division, 11 ½ games behind the San Antonio Spurs.  Jrue Holiday scored a career-high 35 points and  Evan Turner 
and Nick Young each added 20 points to lead the 76ers past the
Knicks on their home court at Wells Fargo Center.  “We played well against a good team,” Holiday told
reporters last night. “We came off really aggressive
offensively and played well defensively.”  The 76ers outscored the Knicks 24-19 in the first quarter
and 29-22 in the second to take a 53-41 halftime lead.  Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks with 25 points for his 28th
straight 20-point game, which ties him with  Patrick Ewing  for
second-longest streak in franchise history. Richie Guerin holds
the record with 29 games set in 1961-62.  “We just didn’t have it,” Anthony said. “They played
extremely well. We didn’t make shots. We didn’t defend. We
didn’t move the ball.”  Amar’e Stoudemire came off the bench to contribute 20
points.  At Toyota Center in Houston,  James Harden  had 29 points to
lead the Rockets to their win over the Nets. Omer Asik had 20
points and 16 rebounds, Chandler Parsons contributed 16 and
Jeremy Lin tallied 14.  Deron Williams  scored 27 points before he was ejected with
one minute, seven seconds remaining for arguing with a referee
over a call. Brook Lopez added 21 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
