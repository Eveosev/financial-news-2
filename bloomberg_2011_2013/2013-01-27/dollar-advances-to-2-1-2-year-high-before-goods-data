The yen gained versus the majority
of its 16 most-traded peers as investors reduced bets it would
keep falling after declining for the past 11 weeks in the
longest losing streak on record.  Japan ’s currency advanced from its weakest level versus the
dollar since 2010 as technical indicators signaled it may have
slid too much. The pound fell to its weakest in more than 13
months versus the euro, while  Brazil ’s real climbed versus the
greenback. The dollar gained versus most major counterparts
before Federal Reserve policy makers open a two-day meeting
tomorrow and the U.S. issues an employment report Feb. 1.  “What we’re seeing is a little bit of consolidation and
anticipation of activities coming during the week,”  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington  at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage, said in a telephone
interview. “The dollar-yen won’t stray too far from current
levels ahead of the Fed and payrolls on Friday.”  The yen appreciated 0.1 percent to 90.79 per dollar at 1:36
p.m.  New York  time, after declining earlier to 91.26, the
weakest level since June 2010. It strengthened 0.2 percent to
122.10 per euro. The 17-nation currency fell 0.1 percent to
$1.3450.  The Japanese currency fell 5.7 percent in the past month in
the worst performance among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 2.3 percent, and the dollar increased 0.3 percent.  Yen Bets  The difference in the number of bets by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen versus those on
a rise, so-called  net shorts , was 64,068 in the week ended Jan.
22, according to figures from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. That’s the least bearish reading since November.  Traders expect the euro to extend its rally against the
dollar, according to Lloyds Banking Group Plc, citing
derivatives measuring the difference between implied volatility
on calls and puts. The 17-nation common currency has
strengthened 2 percent this month, poised for a sixth-straight
gain, the longest stretch since 2003.  One-month 25-delta risk reversals, a gauge demand for call
relative to puts, reached 0.1, the highest since 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Calls grant the right, but not
the obligation, to buy the underlying futures. Puts grant the
right to sell them.  Real, Krona  The Brazilian real and  Sweden ’s krona were the two biggest
winners among the dollar’s most-traded peers.  The real rose to a six-month high after the central bank
auctioned foreign-exchange swap contracts to shore up the
currency and contain inflation. The currency appreciated 1.4
percent to 2.0010 per dollar and touched 2.0005, its highest
level since July 3.  Sweden’s krona gained against all of its major counterparts
except the real as retail sales in the country increased 1.2
percent last month, easing pressure on the central bank to cut
 interest rates . The krona rose 0.6 percent to 6.4188 per dollar
after touching 6.4110, its strongest since October 2011. The
currency climbed 0.7 percent to 8.6312 per euro.  South Africa ’s rand was the biggest loser as foreigners
reduced holdings of the country’s assets on concern labor unrest
and mining output cuts will weigh on the nation’s current-
account deficit. The currency weakened 1.9 percent to 9.1182 per
dollar and touched 9.1604, its lowest level since April 2009.  Relative Strength  The yen’s 14-day relative strength index against the dollar
was at 30.5, near the 30 level that some traders see as a signal
an asset has fallen too far, too fast and may be due to reverse
course. Against the euro, it was 29.8.  Once the yen’s exchange rate against the dollar gets
“north of 90 to 91, the impetus, or the ability to break
higher, will prove to be a little more compromised,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “The combination of data
points should be reasonably dollar-supportive.”  Orders for durable-goods in the U.S. rose 4.6 percent in
December after a 0.7 percent gain the prior month, a Commerce
Department report showed today in Washington. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 2 percent gain.  Pending U.S. home sales declined in December for the first
time since August, showing uneven progress in the housing
market. They slid 4.3 percent.  The pound depreciated 0.6 percent to 85.73 pence per euro
and reached 85.87 pence, the weakest level since December 2011.
Sterling dropped 0.7 percent to $1.5686 and touched $1.5675, the
least since August.  Home prices  in England and  Wales  were unchanged from
December, after declining for the previous six months, Hometrack
Ltd. said in a statement today. Data released on Jan. 25 showed
the U.K. economy shrank more than forecast in the final quarter
of 2012, tipping it back toward recession.  Fed Meeting  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee opens a two-day
meeting tomorrow as investors speculate when policy makers will
begin to slow stimulus.  Employers in the U.S. added 161,000 workers in January,
after a 155,000 increase in December, a Bloomberg survey of
economists showed before the Labor Department reports the data
on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
