Defending champion Chelsea was held
to a 2-2 tie at Brentford in the fourth round of English

goals at Griffin Park in west London for Brentford, which plays
in the third-tier League One. Oscar and  Fernando Torres  replied
for the Blues.  The teams will now face a replay at Chelsea’s  Stamford 
Bridge to advance in the competition.  In today’s other games, Tottenham is at Championship team
