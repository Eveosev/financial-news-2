Chinese tennis player  Li Na , who
lost the women’s Australian Open final to defending champion
Victoria Azarenka yesterday, was hailed by  China ’s media today
for her perseverance in the match.  Li lost the game and “won the world,” the Shanghai-based
Oriental Morning Post said. What will be remembered “is Li’s
perseverance” in the 4-6, 6-4, 3-6 loss after she played
through most of the match with an injured ankle, the official
People’s Daily wrote on its front page.  Li Na has become the new representative for Chinese
sportsmanship, “replacing Liu Xiang,” said a commentary on Web
portal site Neteast, referring to the hurdler who won a gold
medal in 2004  Olympic Games .  Li, 30, became the first Chinese player to win a Grand Slam
singles title at the 2011 French Open. She would have become the
oldest woman to win the Australian Open in the professional era,
had she defeated Azarenka, the 23-year-old top seed from Belarus.  “No pity and only pride,” hurdling hero Liu said of Li on
his micro-blog, which has 28 million followers. “You’ve 
outperformed yourself,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
