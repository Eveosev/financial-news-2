Jockey Ramon Dominguez, recovering
from a skull fracture suffered when he was thrown from his mount,
was transferred out of the neurological intensive care unit at
New York-Presbyterian Hospital.  Dominguez, 36, was unseated when Convocation appeared to
clip heels with Sovereign Default in the seventh race at
Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens,  New York , on Jan. 18. Convocation
stumbled and fell, throwing the jockey.  Dominguez was transferred to a medical step-down unit, said
his wife Sharon in a statement.  “Ramon’s doctors say he is recovering well, and we’re
beginning to discuss his rehab options,” said his wife.  There is no timetable for the jockey’s release from the
hospital, where doctors have prohibited visitation.  A native of  Venezuela , Dominguez led all riders on the New
York Racing Association circuit in 2012 with 322 victories and
led the nation in earnings with $25.6 million.  Fellow New York jockeys  John Velazquez  and Javier Castellano accepted on behalf of Dominguez the jockey’s third
career Eclipse Award at the ceremony on Jan. 19 in Hallandale
Beach,  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
