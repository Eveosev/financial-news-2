China successfully tested a locally-
built freight plane, two months after the debut of its fighter
jet, boosting the nation’s efforts to use homegrown technology
to expand defense capacity.  The Yun-20, which had its maiden flight yesterday, can take
a maximum load of 66 tons and is suited for long-distance
transportation, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The
plane will aid the armed forces and will help deliver  disaster
relief  and humanitarian aid, according to the report.  China achieved a military milestone when its fighter jet
landed on its new  aircraft carrier  in November, extending a
modernization bid that’s recorded advances in submarines, cyber
warfare and in outer space.  The J-15 jet was developed and built by AVIC Shenyang
Aircraft Corp., a unit of China’s largest aerospace company,
Aviation Industry Corp of China. It can carry multi-type anti-
ship, air-to-air, air-to-ground missiles and precision-guided
bombs.  The aircraft tests underscore China’s progress in military
modernization, which has been accompanied by a doubling of the
 defense budget  in six years. China, the biggest spender on
defense after the U.S., has become increasingly assertive in the
region as President  Barack Obama  executes a strategic shift
toward Asia and tensions rise with Japan and other nations over
territorial disputes.  China’s defense spending, estimated at 670 billion  yuan 
($108 billion) in 2012, has more than doubled since 2006,
tracking a rise in nominal gross domestic product to 47.2
trillion yuan from 21.6 trillion yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
