Barclays Plc (BARC) , which plans to leave a
12-bank group in the  United Arab Emirates  whose quotes determine
the interbank lending rate, will stay on the panel for the next
three months, two people familiar with the matter said.  Barclays was asked by the U.A.E. central bank to remain on
the panel to give it time to find a replacement, the people
said, asking not to be identified because the information is
private. Yesterday’s meeting didn’t address possible
replacements for Barclays on the panel, according to the people.  The bank, Britain’s second-biggest bank by assets, paid a
290 million-pound ($449 million) fine to U.S. and U.K.
regulators last month for manipulating the benchmark Libor rate.
Barclays’ U.A.E. unit submitted a request to the central bank
this month to exit the rate-setting panel in the second-biggest
Arab economy, a person familiar with the matter said July 15.  A spokesman for Barclays in Dubai declined to comment. A
central bank spokesman also declined to comment.  The central bank uses lending rates from 12 banks operating
in the U.A.E. to compute the Emirates Interbank Offered Rate, or
Eibor. The interbank rate, used as a benchmark by banks to price
loans to customers, is an average after excluding the two lowest
and the highest lending rates from the 12 banks.  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Standard Chartered
Plc. are the other foreign banks on the panel, which also
includes eight local lenders including  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  and
National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, according to the central bank
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
