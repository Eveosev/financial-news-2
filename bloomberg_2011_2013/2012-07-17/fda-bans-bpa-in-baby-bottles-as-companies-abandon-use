Baby bottles and other cups intended
for children can no longer contain the chemical bisphenol A, or
BPA, under new rules by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The change was made primarily because the use by companies
of polycarbonate containing BPA has already been “completely
and permanently abandoned” in baby drinking products, the FDA
said in the Federal Register today. The  American Chemistry
Council , a Washington-based trade group, had petitioned the
agency for the change in October.  “FDA action on this request now provides certainty that
BPA is not used to make the baby bottles and sippy cups on store
shelves, either today or in the future,” Steven Hentges, a
spokesman for the council said in a statement.  BPA is used to harden plastic and make canned food
watertight and for decades was included in the manufacture of
plastic food containers and baby bottles. Companies stopped
using it in baby bottles and sippy cups several years ago,
according to the chemistry council statement.  BPA has been linked to male infertility, diabetes and
cancer. A study in October said exposure in the womb may cause
behavior and emotional problems in young girls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
