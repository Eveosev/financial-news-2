U.S. Ambassador to  India  Nancy Powell called the country’s foreign secretary, Ranjan Mathai, to
offer her regret for the loss of life after an American navy
ship opened fire on a fishing boat off the coast of Dubai.  Powell vowed a full investigation, according to a  statement 
from India’s foreign ministry. The shooting killed one Indian
fisherman and wounded three others, the ministry said in the
statement, citing U.A.E. officials it didn’t name.  “An embarked security team aboard a U.S. Navy vessel fired
upon a small motor vessel after it disregarded warnings and
rapidly approached the U.S. ship,” Lt. Greg Raelson, a media
officer for the U.S. Navy, said in an e-mail. The incident
occurred at 2:50 p.m. local time yesterday, 10 miles off the
port of Jebel Ali in the  United Arab Emirates , he said.  The incident happened near the  Strait of Hormuz , where
tensions have risen this year as Iranian officials threatened to
shut down the waterway in response to increased U.S. and
European pressure. Western sanctions on oil and other products
aim to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons technology
that Iran maintains it isn’t seeking.  The USNS Rappahannock issued warnings to the smaller vessel
by voice, radio and light signals before firing, a U.S. official
said. The vessel, a 41,000-ton fleet replenishment oiler
operated by the U.S. Navy’s Sealift Command and staffed mostly
by civilians, also carried a security team, the Navy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
