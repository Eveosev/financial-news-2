Russia’s  Agriculture Ministry  cut
its grain-crop forecast by as much as 5.9 percent because of a
drought.  The national crop will come to 80 million to 85 million
metric tons, the ministry said in a  statement  on its website
today. Estimates are under constant revision, it said.
Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov yesterday reiterated a
forecast for an 85 million-ton crop. Farmers have harvested more
than 15.7 million tons of grain, including 13 million tons of
wheat, the ministry said.  Russia will have an exportable surplus of at least 16
million tons of grain in the year ending in June, with domestic
consumption forecast at 71.5 million tons, according to the
statement. Exports may come to 16 million to 20 million tons,
the minister said yesterday.  The country has “enough grain resources” to prevent
domestic prices from surging given government stockpiles, the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
