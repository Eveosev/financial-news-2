Meditrade, an Egyptian private

33,500 tons of sunflower oil at a tender today, two traders
involved said.  Meditrade bought 18,500 tons of sunflower oil at $1,189.98
a ton from Nidera and 15,000 tons at the same price from Louis
Dreyfus, the traders said. They spoke on condition of anonymity
because they arenâ€™t authorized to comment to the media. The
company purchased 6,000 tons of soybean oil at 7,310 Egyptian
pounds ($1,205) a ton from Alex Seeds and an equal amount at the
same price from Wataneya, they said.  The vegetable oil is for arrival in August and September,
they added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
