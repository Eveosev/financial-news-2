New York  Life Insurance Co., the
largest U.S. life insurer owned by policyholders, named Steven Benevento to oversee its private-equity unit’s $8.8 billion
portfolio.  Benevento, 47, takes the newly created position of chief
investment officer at New York Life Capital Partners, the firm
said today in a statement. The CIO title is “a formalization of
a role that he’s been engaged in for quite some time,” John
Brine, a New York Life spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The unit invests in private-equity firms and manages
alternative assets for New York Life Insurance, its affiliates
and other institutional investors. Benevento has been involved
in all the firm’s investment activities, Brine said.  “It is critical that we have someone with Steve’s
expertise dedicated to the role of maintaining the integrity of
our investment process,” Thomas Haubenstricker, chief executive
officer of New York Life Capital Partners, said in the
statement.  Benevento joined New York Life in 1995 after working at
TIAA-CREF, according to today’s statement. He earned a
bachelor’s degree in finance from  State University of New York 
at  Albany  in 1987 and received his MBA from New York
University’s Stern School of Business in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
