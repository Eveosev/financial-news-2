Subway Restaurants, the U.S. fast
food sandwich retailer, is in talks to open a franchise at a
U.K. school for the first time, the  Daily Telegraph  reported,
citing education officials.  The fast food chain is discussing opening an outlet with
Parrs Wood High School in the northern English town of Didsbury
at its sixth form college, the newspaper said.  The U.K. is the largest market for Subway outside the U.S.
The Connecticut-based company declined to comment, the Telegraph
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
