An exhibition center in the east
London district of Wapping will be used to house most of the
3,500 troops being deployed on Olympics security operations, the
U.K. Ministry of Defence said in an e-mailed statement today.  About 2,500 personnel will be located in the center, called
Tobacco Dock, a converted 19th-century tobacco warehouse, while
the remaining 1,000 will be accommodated in military bases,
Territorial Army centers and temporary accommodations procured
in Hainault,  England , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
