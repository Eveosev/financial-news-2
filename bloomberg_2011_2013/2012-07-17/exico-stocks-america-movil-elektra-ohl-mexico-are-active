The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IPC index  rose 0.9 percent to a record 41,273.02.  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  , the wireless carrier
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , gained 2.3 percent to
18.13 pesos. Vector Casa de Bolsa SA analyst Jorge Herrera said
the company is a “speculative buy” after it broke 18 pesos,
according to an e-mailed research note today.  Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA*)  , the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire Ricardo Salinas, jumped 6.8
percent to 636.27 pesos. Elektra has surged 56 percent since
saying June 19 that it unwound some stock derivatives contracts,
spurring optimism it will meet conditions to remain on the
nation’s benchmark index.  OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*)  , the local unit of Spanish
construction company Obrascon Huarte SA, climbed 1.7 percent to
19.27 pesos. OHL’s announcement that it would extend a road for
the Mexican government is “positive news” because it is
“indicative of the company’s good relations with the Mexico
City government,” Banco Santander SA said in an e-mailed
research note dated today. Santander has a buy recommendation on
the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
