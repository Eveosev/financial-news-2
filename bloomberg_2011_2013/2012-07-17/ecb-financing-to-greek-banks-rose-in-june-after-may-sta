Greek banks’ use of the  European
Central Bank ’s refinancing operations dropped to almost nothing
in May as they were frozen out of ECB liquidity operations,
before increasing again in June after they got a capital boost.  Greek bank reliance on ECB liquidity fell to 3.4 billion
euros ($4.1 billion) in May from 62 billion euros in April,
according to an Athens bourse filing from the  Bank of Greece 
today. Reliance on Emergency Liquidity Assistance, or ELA, which
is extended by the central bank, climbed to 124 billion euros in
May from 59.2 billion euros the month before, it said in the
statement.  The ECB suspended Greek banks from its funding operations
on May 16 until they received a capital boost from funds that
were earmarked for the purpose from  Greece ’s 130 billion-euro
March loan package from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . The freeze was lifted after the country’s bank
recapitalization fund disbursed 18 billion euros on May 28.  Lenders’ reliance on ECB liquidity increased to 73.7
billion euros in June while their ELA funding dropped to 61.9
billion euros, the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
