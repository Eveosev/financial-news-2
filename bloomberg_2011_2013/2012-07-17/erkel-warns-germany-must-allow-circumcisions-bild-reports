Chancellor Angela Merkel  warned that
 Germany  would risk being a “nation of buffoons” if it became
the only country to prohibit male circumcision even on religious
grounds following a court ruling,  Bild  reported.  “I don’t want Germany to be the only nation in the world
in which Jews are unable to practice their rituals,” Bild today
cited Merkel as telling her Christian Democratic Union
leadership. “Otherwise we’d be a nation of buffoons.”  A German court last month ruled that circumcising children
for religious reasons amounts to bodily harm even if parents
agree to it, sparking protests from Jewish, Muslim and Christian
groups.  Merkel’s government will work with parliament on a “quick
solution” on the issue to resolve legal uncertainty arising
from the May 7 district court decision in Cologne, government
spokesman Steffen Seibert said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
