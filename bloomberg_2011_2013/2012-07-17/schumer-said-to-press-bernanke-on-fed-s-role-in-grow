New York  Senator  Charles Schumer 
plans to press Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on
“potential monetary options, including a new round of full-
scale bond buying,” that could help promote economic growth and
reduce unemployment in the face of congressional gridlock, said
a Schumer aide.  The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of
Benanke’s testimony today before the Senate Banking, Housing and
Urban Affairs Committee, said Schumer “plans to note that
election-year politics have prevented Congress from enacting the
kind of fiscal relief that the Fed chairman has subtly suggested
is necessary.”  Schumer, the Senate’s third-ranking Democrat, has blamed
Republicans for blocking proposals that Democrats contend will
bolster small businesses and create jobs, most recently on July
12 when a Democratic plan to offer tax breaks for hiring and
capital investment failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance.
That same day, the chamber rejected a Republican proposal to
give businesses a 20 percent tax cut.  “Given the Fed’s own reduced expectations for growth in
2012, Schumer will seek the chairman’s thoughts on potential
monetary policy options, such as a new round of full-scale bond
buying,” the aide said, adding that “Schumer will express his
hopes that with inflation below the Fed’s 2 percent target and
declining, the Fed sees fit to err on the side of fulfilling the
second part of its mandate -- unemployment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
