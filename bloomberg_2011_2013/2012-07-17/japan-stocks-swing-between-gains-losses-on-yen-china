Most Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Topix Index capping its longest losing streak in two years, as
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly slid and the yen rose to a month
high against the dollar. Losses were limited after the
 International Monetary Fund  raised  Japan ’s growth forecast.  Sony Corp., the nation’s leading exporter of consumer
electronics, dropped 3.4 percent.  Hokuriku Electric (9505)  Power Co.
paced declines among utilities amid renewed concern about
nuclear plants. Real estate shares gained after the IMF cited
stronger-than-expected domestic demand in Japan.  The Topix lost 0.4 percent to 743.38 at the 3 p.m. trading
close in  Tokyo , falling for an eighth day, the longest string of
losses since July 2010. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.4
percent to 8,755.00 following a three-day weekend.  “Japanese stocks, especially exporters, are taking direct
hits from the yen’s move,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity
strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees
about 5 trillion yen ($63 billion). “Utilities will face
tougher conditions ahead for sure. A little restart of nuclear
plants can’t make up for all the nuclear fleet, and public
options are making it hard for them to raise power rates.”  The  Topix (TPX)  rebounded about 7 percent since June 4, when it
closed at its lowest since 1983, as concern eased about  Europe ’s
debt crisis after bailout terms were loosened for lenders and on
optimism central banks around the world will ease policy.  Shares on the index are  valued  at 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.4 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  U.S. Retail  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.5 percent today. The gauge
lost 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday after U.S. retail sales
unexpectedly dropped in June amid limited employment gains.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may hint at further
stimulus today when he delivers his semiannual report on the
economy and monetary policy before Congress.  Exporters to the U.S. dropped after the yen reached 78.69
against the dollar yesterday, the strongest since June 18. A
stronger Japanese currency reduces the value of overseas
earnings for exporters when repatriated. Sony dropped 3.4
percent to 964 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28
percent of its sales in  North America , dropped 3.2 percent to 92
yen.  “Earnings season will start in earnest in Japan next week,
and investors don’t want to make a big move for now,” said
Takashi Ito, a strategist equity market at Nomura Securities Co.,
Japan’s biggest brokerage.  Of the 1,671 companies on the Topix Index, 209 companies
are scheduled to report earnings next week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  Utilities Slide  Utility shares had the second-biggest decline among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups after a government advisory body on
July 13 recommended breaking up power generators’ regional
distribution monopolies.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the utility
at the center of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, slumped 11.5
percent to a record-low 123 yen.  Tens of thousands of people packed Tokyo’s Yoyogi Park
yesterday for the nation’s biggest anti-nuclear rally since last
year’s meltdowns in Fukushima.  Hokuriku Electric slid 8.3 percent to 1,115 yen. The shares
fell after government research suggests a strong possibility a
fault may be active beneath the utility’s Shika nuclear power
station about 300 kilometers (190 miles) northwest of Tokyo,
 Kyodo News  reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Kansai Electric Power Co., the country’s second-largest
utility, fell 7.2 percent to 809 yen. Alarms went off at a
reactor in Ohi scheduled for restart tomorrow.  Among other stocks that fell, JX Holdings Inc. slipped 7.8
percent to 356 yen. The oil refiner said it will shut processing
at one its plants after finding falsified safety reports.  IMF Forecast  Losses were limited after the International Monetary Fund
raised Japan’s growth forecast for 2012. The economy will expand
2.4 percent this year, up from a 0.4 percent estimate for
expansion in April, while the IMF trimmed its global economic
forecast.  Leopalace21 Corp. led real estate companies higher, gaining
7.2 percent to 267 yen. Tokyu Livable Inc. added 4.1 percent to
921 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  declined 1.2 percent to
18.75, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.4 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei was 4 percent below the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
