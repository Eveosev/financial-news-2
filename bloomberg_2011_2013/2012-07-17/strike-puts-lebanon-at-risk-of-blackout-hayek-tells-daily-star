Lebanon could be plunged into
darkness if part-time workers staging a sit-in at Electricite du
Liban’s headquarters don’t evacuate the building, the  Daily Star 
reported today, citing Kamal Hayek, the electricity company’s
director-general.  Collection of electricity bills stopped after the employees
began the strike more than two months ago to demand the
government give them full-time work, Hayek said. He said some
striking bill collectors are holding more than $650,000 of
electricity bills they collected from subscribers. Most areas
across Lebanon are experiencing severe power rationing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
