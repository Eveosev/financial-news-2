Egypt ’s central bank will offer the
fewest seven-day  repurchase agreements  in two months as funding
pressure ease following a cut in a key reserve ratio for banks
and the sale of longer-term repos. Dollar bonds advanced.  The Arab country will make available 18 billion Egyptian
pounds ($3 billion) of the contracts, the least since May 8,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The repos allow
holders of  government securities  to sell them back to the
central bank to access funds at 9.75 percent.  Yields on treasury debt have stabilized after reaching
near-record levels last month after central bank’s lowered the
local-currency reserve requirement ratio for banks. The rate was
cut on June 26 for the second time this year to 10 percent. The
regulator also introduced 28-day repos last week, giving banks
access to longer-term cash. The average yield on  one-year bills 
has declined at the last three auctions to 15.83 percent, the
lowest level in more than two months.  The central bank started offering seven-day repos in March
2011 to address funding concerns for lenders as foreign
investors dumped the country’s debt amid unrest that followed
the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak . It sold 321.1 billion pounds of the
contracts last quarter, more than three times the amount from a
year earlier.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due 2020 fell
for the second time in three days, declining three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.24 percent at 12:15 p.m. in
Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The pound,
subject to a managed float, was unchanged at 6.0646 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
