Treasury five-year futures are
poised to extend gains to a new record after breaking through a
level of so-called resistance, Credit Suisse Group AG said,
citing trading patterns.  The advance of the securities past their June 1 high of 124
5/8 yesterday “signals bullish continuation,” according to
analysts including  David Sneddon , head of technical-analysis
research in  London . The contract is set to advance toward
another resistance level at 125 1/8 before climbing to 125
23/32, the analysts said, citing Fibonacci theory.  “The five-year note has started the week on the front
foot,” the analysts wrote today in a note to clients.  The five-year contract for September delivery was little
changed at 124 21/32 at 6:43 a.m. in  New York . The security
climbed to a record 124 3/4 yesterday.  Investors should buy the five-year contract at 124 1/2 and
sell once it has risen to 125 3/32, the analysts wrote. They
should exit the trade should the contract decline to 124 10/32,
they said.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may be grouped.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
