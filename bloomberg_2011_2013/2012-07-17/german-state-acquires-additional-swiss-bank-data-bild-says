German tax investigators in the
western state of North Rhine-Westphalia bought an additional CD
with illicit Swiss tax data, Bild newspaper reported, without
saying where it received the information.   The latest CD contains data on German withdrawals from
Swiss bank accounts, the newspaper reported.  The state’s  Finance Ministry  declined to confirm or deny
the report, Bild said. Officials at the ministry weren’t
immediately available to reply to an inquiry by Bloomberg News
after working hours.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
