Books-A-Million Inc. (BAMM)  Chairman Clyde Anderson withdrew his $48.8 million offer to buy the bookstore
chain.  Anderson and his family decided not to pursue the buyout
after discussing the matter with a special committee of the
board, the company said today in a Business Wire statement.  Anderson made the $3.05-a-share offer in April to take the
company private. He and his family already owned about 53
percent of the shares. The $48.8 million bid prompted two
shareholder lawsuits saying the board wrongfully approved the
deal.  Books-A-Million, based in Birmingham,  Alabama , operates 257
stores in 31 states, including locations under the names Books &
Co., Bookland and Joe Muggs Newsstands. Last year it started an
expansion plan by taking over 14 stores formerly operated by the
bankrupt Borders Group Inc. in the Northeast and Midwest.  The company’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $3.17 today in  New
York  before trading was halted for pending news. They’ve gained
30 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
