Gold fell for a second day as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refrained from
discussing steps to boost the U.S. recovery, while insisting the
central bank will act if labor markets don’t improve.  Bernanke, responding to questions from lawmakers today in
Washington, said Fed tools include further purchases of assets,
such as mortgage-backed securities, reducing the interest rate
it pays on reserves banks keep with the Fed, and altering its
communications on the outlook for  interest rates . Gold surged 70
percent from the end of December 2008 to June 2011 as the
central bank kept borrowing costs at a record low and bought
$2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called quantitative
easing. This year, the price is up 1.4 percent.  “The market wants to know specifics even as it’s clearer
that some form of easing will be announced soon,”  William O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle River ,  New
Jersey , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for August delivery slid 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,589.50 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
after earlier slipping as much as 1.3 percent. The price is down
0.9 percent in July, after dropping in four of the previous five
months.  Bullion pared losses today after Bernanke’s answers to
questions from the Senate Banking Committee signaled he doesn’t
view inflation as a hindrance to providing more stimulus to spur
the economy.  Silver futures for September delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to close at $27.316 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,420.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 1 percent to
$583.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
