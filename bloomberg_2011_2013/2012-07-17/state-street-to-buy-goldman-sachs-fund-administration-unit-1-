State Street Corp. (STT) , the third
largest custody bank, has purchased  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) â€™s
hedge fund administration unit for $550 million in cash.  The deal makes State Street the largest servicer of hedge
funds in the world with $877 billion under administration as of
June 30, the Boston-based company said today in a statement.  The business of hedge-fund administration has been
consolidating since the conviction of fraudster  Bernard Madoff 
in 2008 spurred new regulation for hedge funds and companies
that keep records for them. State Street added $170 billion of
hedge-fund and private-equity assets when it bought Mourant
International Finance Administration, based in Jersey in the
Channel Islands, in December 2009.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities for institutional investors, including mutual funds,
pension funds and hedge funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
