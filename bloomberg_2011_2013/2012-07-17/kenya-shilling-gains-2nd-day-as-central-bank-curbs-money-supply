Kenya’s shilling gained for a second
day, rallying the most in more than a week, as the central bank
stepped up restrictions on  money supply .  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 83.75 per dollar and was trading 0.1
percent stronger at 84.03 by 5:10 p.m., in the capital Nairobi.
A close at this level will be the biggest one-day advance since
July 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling rally is due to the central bank’s continued
mop-up drive, with the market demand and supply of dollars
matching well,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 800 million shillings
($9 million) of seven-day repurcahse agreements at a weighted
average rate of 14.456 percent, a  central bank  official, who
declined to be identified in line with policy, said by phone
from Nairobi. The bank also accepted 600 million shillings of
21-day term-auction deposits at 14.76 percent, and 600 million
shillings of 28-day deposits at 14.5 percent, the official said.  The bank cut its  benchmark lending rate  for the first time
in 18 months on July 5, reducing the key rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 16.5 percent. The bank raised borrowing costs by a
record 12.25 percentage points in 2011 to help bolster the
shilling and curb price pressures following drought.  Inflation declined for the seventh straight month to 10.1
percent from 12.2 percent in May, the  Kenya  National Bureau of
Statistics said June 29.  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.4 percent to 2,470 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling weakened less than 0.1 percent to
1,586 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
