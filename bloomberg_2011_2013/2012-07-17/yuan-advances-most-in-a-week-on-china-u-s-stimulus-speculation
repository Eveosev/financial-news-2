China’s yuan advanced the most in a
week on speculation the world’s two biggest economies will be
more aggressive in stimulating growth after the  International
Monetary Fund  trimmed its global forecast.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell 0.3 percent yesterday as investors
bet that Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will hint at
further monetary easing at a testimony before Congress today.
U.S. retail sales fell for a third month in June, declining 0.5
percent, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday. China’s
State Council may this week detail easing measures to support
growth, Nomura Holdings Inc. said yesterday. The China
Securities Journal reported a meeting as early as July 18 may be
followed by policy measures, citing unidentifed analysts.  “The weak U.S. retail sales have spurred hopes of
quantitative easing,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based
currency analyst at  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23)  “Investors are also
betting China will announce more stimulus measures and economic
growth could regain momentum in the second half, boosting demand
for the  yuan .”  The currency rose 0.07 percent to 6.3744 per dollar as of
10:11 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was steady at 1.45
percent.  The People’s Bank of China raised the yuan’s  reference rate 
0.06 percent to 6.3167 per dollar. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  The IMF cut its 2013 global growth forecast to 3.9 percent
yesterday from an April estimate of 4.1 percent, as Europe’s
debt crisis slows expansion in  emerging markets  from China to
India. Foreign direct investment in China dropped 3 percent in
the first six months from a year earlier, the Ministry of
Commerce said today.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan appreciated 0.06
percent to 6.3745 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards advanced 0.07 percent to 6.4160, a 0.65 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
