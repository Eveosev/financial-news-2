Bank of America Corp.  won
preliminary court approval of a $20 million settlement of a
consumer lawsuit over its marketing of credit protection.  Credit card customers alleged that they were charged a
monthly fee for “Credit Protection Plus” and got nothing
meaningful in return, according to documents filed in federal
court in San Francisco. Bank of America charged customers for
the service without authorization, enrolled them through
deceptive marketing and improperly denied benefits, their
lawyers alleged.  Bank of America created a $20 million fund to pay card
holders who enrolled in the program starting in 2006. Some may
be eligible for $50 and $100 awards. The bank also agreed to
change some of its practices related to the program. U.S.
District Judge Thelton Henderson in  San Francisco  gave
preliminary approval to the settlement today.  The bank denied wrongdoing, according to the settlement.
Betty Reiss, a spokeswoman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
Bank of America, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message
seeking comment about the accord.  The case is In Re: Bank of America Credit Protection
Marketing and Sales Practice Litigation, 11-2269, U.S. District
Court (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
