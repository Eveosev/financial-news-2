OAO MRSK Holding jumped the most in
almost three weeks after  Russia ’s largest electricity
distribution company proposed a five-year investment program
which is smaller than investors expected.  MRSK Holding surged 5.7 percent to 1.768 rubles by the
close in Moscow, the biggest advance since June 27. The stock
led gains on the benchmark Micex Index, which rose 0.6 percent
to 1,430.17.  MRSK is planning an 825 billion rubles ($25.5 billion)
investment program for the period between 2012 and 2017, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The company
initially estimated its program for the period between 2011 and
2015 at 1.8 trillion rubles, Interfax reported on Feb. 8, citing
an internal MRSK report.  “A reduced investment program is positive for the investor
sentiment as it means more money will go to the shareholders,”
Ivan Rubinov, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by phone from
Moscow.  The company cut its plan because of slower-than-expected
tariff growth, Dmitry Doronin, an analyst at Rye, MAN & Gor,
said in an e-mailed note.  “We welcome the company’s decision to cut its investment
program although mention it was partly forced by new tariff
realities,” Doronin said in the note.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
