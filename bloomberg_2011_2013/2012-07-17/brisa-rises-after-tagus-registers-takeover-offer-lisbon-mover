Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA 
advanced to the highest level in almost four months after Tagus
Holdings Sarl registered its bid for Portugal’s biggest toll-
road operator.  The stock  climbed  as much as 2.9 percent to 2.728 euros,
the highest intraday price since March 30. The shares were up 2
percent at 2.703 euros as of 11:44 a.m. in the Portuguese
capital. Tagus is offering 2.76 euros a share for Brisa.  “As we rule out any competitive bid, we would sell shares
in Brisa as soon as the share price gets close to the offer
period,” Joaquin Ferrer, a London-based analyst at Grupo
Santander, said in a research report today.  Portuguese securities regulator CMVM yesterday said it
registered the bid by Tagus for shares in Brisa. The offer
period starts today and ends on Aug. 8.  Jose de Mello SGPS SA, a holding company for one of
 Portugal ’s richest families, and Aeif Apollo Sarl last week
raised their bid for Brisa to 2.76 euros a share. The bidders,
through their Tagus venture, on March 29 had bid 2.66 euros a
share. Aeif Apollo and Jose de Mello already own a combined
 stake  of 50 percent in Brisa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
