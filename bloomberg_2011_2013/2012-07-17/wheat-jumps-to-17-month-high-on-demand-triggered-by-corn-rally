Wheat futures rose to a 17-month
high on speculation that demand for the grain in livestock feed
will climb as hot, dry weather scorches the U.S. corn crop.  Corn futures have jumped 52 percent since mid-June, and
wheat has surged 41 percent. About 55 percent of the contiguous
U.S. states were in moderate to extreme drought at the end of
June, the highest percentage since December 1956, according to
the National Climatic Data Center.  “Maybe we’re using wheat more as feed than we used to
because of these  price levels ,”  Larry Glenn , an analyst at
Frontier Ag in Quinter,  Kansas , said in a telephone interview.
“Usually when we have problems, it’s in one area. This is
larger than normal, and it’s lasting a while.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.5 cent to
settle at $8.85 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price climbed for the fifth straight session, the
longest rally in almost two months. Earlier, the commodity
reached $8.985, the highest for a most-active contract since
Feb. 15, 2011.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
