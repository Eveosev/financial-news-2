Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s
biggest maker of health-care products, lowered its 2012 profit
forecast on unfavorable foreign-exchange rates.  Second-quarter  net income  fell 49 percent to $1.4 billion,
or 50 cents a share, on acquisition costs, the  New Brunswick ,
New Jersey-based company said today in a statement. The
drugmaker cut its  forecast  to $5 to $5.07 a share, excluding
one-time items, from $5.07 to $5.17.  Revenue fell 0.7 percent in the quarter to $16.5 billion,
reflecting a negative impact from currency of 4.2 percent, J&J
said. Other U.S. companies, including Procter & Gamble Co. and
Philip Morris International Inc. last month cut their 2012
forecasts because currency effects were hurting sales in
international markets.  “It’s all because of currency,” said  Tony Butler , an
analyst with Barclays Capital Inc. “I don’t care about
currency. I’m looking at what they do as a business. They can’t
pick up a facility and move it to a different jurisdiction or
sell in a different jurisdiction.”  J&J gained less than 1 percent to $69 at the close in New
York. The shares had gained 2.3 percent in the past 12 months.  Profit excluding some items beat by 1 cent the $1.29 a
share  average  of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
While U.S. sales declined 1.2 percent in the quarter, J&J gets
about 26 percent of its revenue from  Europe .  Looking at the business outside the effect of foreign
exchange rates, “J&J is on the mend,” Butler said.  Generic Competition  Chief Executive Officer  Alex Gorsky , who took over in
April, has been working to boost revenue hurt by recalls of at
least 50 products over two years. Generic competition to some of
its top-selling drugs has also cut into sales. Analysts said
they had been looking for Gorsky to move the company past those
issues and start growing sales in the second half of the year.  Second-quarter sales of J&J’s attention deficit disorder
drug Concerta fell 23 percent to $268 million from a year
earlier. Revenue from the antibiotic Levaquin fell 90 percent to
$16 million from $159 million. Both drugs lost patent protection
in the U.S. last year.  Helping ease those losses was revenue from J&J’s top
seller, the rheumatoid arthritis treatment Remicade, which rose
13 percent to $1.5 billion.  J&J said its acquisition of Synthes Inc., which won U.S.
regulatory approval in June, added 1.2 percent to operational
sales. Synthes makes tools and implants to treat damaged bones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
