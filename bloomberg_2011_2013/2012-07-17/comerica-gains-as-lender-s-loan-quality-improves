Comerica Inc. (CMA)  advanced as much as
3.5 percent, the most since April, after the lender posted a
second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as fewer
borrowers defaulted.  Net income climbed 50 percent to $144 million, or 73 cents
a share, from $96 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, the
Dallas-based lender said today in a statement. That beat the
average  estimate  of 60 cents by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Write-offs for soured loans in the three months ended June
30 plunged 50 percent to $45 million from a year earlier and
nonperforming loans declined 23 percent to $747 million, the
company said. Provision for loan losses, funds set aside to
cover future defaults, dropped 83 percent from a year earlier to
$8 million, according to the statement.  “Credit quality continued to be strong,” Chief Executive
Officer Ralph W. Babb Jr., 63, said in the statement. “We will
continue to see the provision and net charge-offs at or near
these levels for the remainder of the year.”  Comerica spent $88 million to repurchase 2.9 million shares
in the second quarter. The company said it would buy back as
much as $375 million of stock through the first quarter of next
year after announcing in March that the  Federal Reserve  had
approved the company’s capital plan. In April, the firm raised
the quarterly  payout  by 50 percent to 15 cents a share.  “With very strong fundamentals, an active share buyback
and an increased dividend, Comerica is the best-positioned
regional bank in the U.S.,” Kevin Reynolds, an analyst at
 Memphis , Tennessee-based Wunderlich Securities Inc., said today
in a note to clients.  Comerica, the  best performer  today in the 24-company  KBW
Bank Index (BKX) , climbed 95 cents to $31.76 at 1:54 p.m. in New York
and earlier touched $31.89, the biggest advance  since  April 17.
The shares had gained 19 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
