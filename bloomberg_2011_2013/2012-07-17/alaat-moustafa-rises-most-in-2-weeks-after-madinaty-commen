Talaat Moustafa Group Holding (TMGH) ,
 Egypt ’s largest publicly traded real estate developer, gained
the most in more than two weeks after telling investors its
legal position is “strong” in a land dispute.  Shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 3.1 percent, the
most since July 2, to 4.01 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 1.6 percent.  The company in a filing to the Egyptian bourse today
reassured investors over land it purchased from the government
on the outskirts of Cairo for the  Madinaty  housing and business
community.  “It’s highly unlikely Talaat Moustafa would be stripped of
the land especially considering the significant infrastructure
that has been built,” said Rehab Taha, Cairo-based equities
analyst at Prime Securities SAE, who has a buy recommendation on
the shares. “Talaat Moustafa is a cyclical stock historically
that reacts aggressively to news reports.”  The worst projected outcome of a court battle over the land
would be renegotiating with authorities to correct a procedural
mistake deemed by a panel of judges to have been made by the
government, the company said. The next court hearing in the case
is set for Nov. 7, according to the filing.  The panel recommended on July 7 the annulment of a revised
contract that allowed the government to sell the land plot to
Talaat Moustafa, an opinion the company said wasn’t binding. The
shares declined 15 percent since the judges’ recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
