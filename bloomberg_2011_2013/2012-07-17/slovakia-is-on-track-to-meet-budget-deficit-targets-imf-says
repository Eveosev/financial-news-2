Slovakia is set to meet the goal of
reducing its  budget deficit  below the European Union’s limit
next year amid one of the strongest economic recoveries in the
region, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The euro-region member is on track to trim the shortfall to
4.6 percent of gross domestic product this year and 2.9 percent
in 2013, the Washington-based lender said today in a report
following regular Article IV consultations. The government will
need to enact more measures to ensure the stabilization of debt
levels and reduce vulnerability to market shocks, the IMF said
in the document.  Austerity measures planned by the government shouldn’t
constrain growth, the fund said, projecting an economic
expansion of 2.6 percent in 2012 and 3.3 percent next year. An
intensifying of the euro-area’s debt crisis and an eventual loss
of investors’ confidence in fiscal consolidation represent key
risks for the economy’s outlook, the IMF said.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is growing at one
of the fastest paces in the euro area, driven by exports from
units of foreign manufacturers such as  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)  The growth
has enabled Premier  Robert Fico , who came to power three months
ago on pledges to insulate poorer Slovaks from the impact of the
crisis, to cut the budget deficit mainly through measures to
increase revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
