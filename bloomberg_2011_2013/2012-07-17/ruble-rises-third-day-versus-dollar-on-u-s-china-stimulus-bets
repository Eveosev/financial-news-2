The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for a third day and yields on  Russia ’s international debt
declined after a gain in oil, the country’s main export.  The Russian currency added 0.2 percent to 32.54 per dollar
by the close in Moscow. The ruble strengthened 0.5 percent to
39.7075 per euro and 0.4 percent to 35.7654 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Brent crude  traded little changed at $103.89 per barrel,
1.6 percent higher than at yesterday’s close in Russia. Oil and
gas contribute about 50 percent of the country’s state revenue,
according to the government’s estimates.  Russia’s $3 billion of Eurobonds due 2042 climbed for a
third day, cutting the yield by seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.561 percent.  Russia’s markets pared earlier gains after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said progress in reducing unemployment
is likely to be “frustratingly slow” and refrained from
discussing specific monetary actions to spur the economy. The
ruble had earlier strengthened as much as 0.8 percent against
the dollar.  Investors pared bets on the currency weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.0428 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 33.0740 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
