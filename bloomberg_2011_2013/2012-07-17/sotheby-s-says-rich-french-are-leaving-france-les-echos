Rich French families are leaving the
country because of fiscal measures being put in place by
Francois Hollande’s government,  Les Echos  reported, citing
Sotheby’s International Realty France.  That trend explains the good business in properties worth
more than 5 million euros ($6.1 million), which are being bought
by foreign purchasers looking for stable real-estate investments
in France, the newspaper said, citing the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
