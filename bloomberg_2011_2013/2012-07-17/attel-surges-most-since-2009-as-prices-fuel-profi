Mattel Inc. (MAT) , the world’s largest
toymaker, surged the most in more than three years as price
increases helped second-quarter profit and revenue top analysts’
estimates.  Mattel gained 9.7 percent to $34.05 at the close in New
York for the largest gain since April 17, 2009. The shares of
the El Segundo, California-based company have gained 23 percent
this year.  The maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels brands has been raising
prices to combat higher costs for raw materials and labor in
 Asia , where it manufacturers its toys. That’s now improving
gross margin, which widened from a year earlier.  “Price increases seem to have stuck, so the gross margin
outlook is encouraging,”  Sean McGowan , an analyst for Needham &
Co. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “Adding it up,
whatever expectations were for the quarter, they blew it away.”  McGowan, who recommends buying Mattel shares, had projected
a 0.3 percentage point gain in gross margin.  Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after the
cost of goods sold, expanded 3.4 percentage points to 51.3
percent from a year ago.  Net income advanced 20 percent to $96.2 million, or 28
cents a share, from $80.5 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier,
Mattel said in a statement. Analysts on average had  estimated  21
cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total revenue was little changed from a year earlier at
$1.16 billion, the company said. Analysts had estimated $1.13
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
