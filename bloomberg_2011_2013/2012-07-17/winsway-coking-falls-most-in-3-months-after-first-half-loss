Winsway Coking Coal Holdings Ltd. (1733) ,
which processes and moves coal to China from Mongolia, fell the
most in more than three months in  Hong Kong  after saying it
posted a first-half loss because of lower prices and demand.  The stock fell as much as 10.9 percent to HK$1.23, the most
since March 28, in intraday trading and was at HK$1.29 as of
10:56 a.m. local time. The benchmark  Hang Seng  index gained 1.5
percent.  The company didn’t specify the loss for the six months
ended June 30. Finance costs increased following the sale of
$500 million, five-year bonds in April last year, Winsway said
today, citing unaudited financial results.  The price of coking coal, the raw material used to make
steel, fell as Chinese mills and coke plants cut back demand,
the company said today in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Winsway has dropped 34 percent since April 23, when
China’s biggest aluminum producer  Aluminum Corp. (2600)  of China Ltd.
agreed to purchase a majority stake.  Finance costs also rose after buying Calgary-based Grand
Cache Coal Corp., Winsway said today. Winsway acquired Grand
Cache with Japanese trading house  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  for about C$1
billion ($986.9 million) in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
