Hyundai Heavy  Industries Co., the
world’s largest shipbuilder, sold a 705 billion won ($617
million) stake in  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  after one of its units
shelved a share-sale plan.  Hyundai Heavy  sold  3.2 million shares of  South Korea ’s
biggest carmaker at 220,000 won apiece, or 3.7 percent lower
than yesterday’s closing price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The stake sale reduced Hyundai Heavy’s  holding  in
Hyundai Motor to 2 percent, the shipbuilder said in a regulatory
filing yesterday.  The disposal comes a month after Hyundai Oilbank Co., 91
percent owned by Hyundai Heavy, shelved its initial public
offering plan, citing worsening economic conditions. Today’s
sale brings Hyundai Heavy’s fundraising announced in the past
week to more than 1.4 trillion won, and is its biggest
divestment of an asset since the company went public in 1999,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The failed attempt to list its subsidiary would have
complicated Hyundai Heavy’s financial plans,” said Lee Jin Woo,
a senior  fund manager  at Seoul-based KTB Asset Management Co.,
which oversees $7 billion in assets including Hyundai Motor
stock. “I don’t think there is any reason to be concerned about
Hyundai Motor’s shares, as the sale was purely for Hyundai
Heavy’s operational purposes.”  The share sale is to improve its finances, Hyundai Heavy
said in its statement yesterday, without elaboration. The
company said earlier this month it won an order to build 10
mega-container vessels for $1.2 billion, the biggest new
contract for such ships industrywide in a year.  Capital Gain  Hyundai Heavy’s last purchase of Hyundai Motor shares was
on Oct. 25, 2007, according to a regulatory filing. The company
bought 3.3 million shares for 64,000 won apiece, which is 3.4
times cheaper than yesterday’s offering price.  Hyundai Motor  fell  2.4 percent to 223,000 won at close of
trading in  Seoul , while the benchmark Kospi stock index rose 0.2
percent. Hyundai Heavy shares gained 0.9 percent to 238,500 won.  The shipbuilder’s operating profit, or sales minus the cost
of goods sold and administrative expenses, is expected to drop
25 percent to 3.42 trillion won this year, according to 25
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Hyundai Heavy’s former chairman and biggest single
shareholder Chung Mong Joon is the younger brother of  Chung Mong Koo , Hyundai Motor’s chairman. The two companies broke off from
 Hyundai Group  when the aging father and founder named his fifth
son, Chung Mong Hun, as his successor in 2000. Hyundai Motor
separated that year, while Hyundai Heavy split off in 2002.  Citigroup Inc. managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
