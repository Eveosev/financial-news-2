The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Japan and  Australia  from non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 2 basis points to
178.5 basis points as of 10:52 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp.’s prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close
since July 10, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index added 1.5 basis points from
its close last week to 178 as of 9:39 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup
Inc. prices show. The index is headed for its highest level
since July 9, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. The country’s markets were closed yesterday
for a national holiday.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 166 basis points
as of 8:49 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge has ranged between 161.5 basis points and
173.5 basis points this month.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
