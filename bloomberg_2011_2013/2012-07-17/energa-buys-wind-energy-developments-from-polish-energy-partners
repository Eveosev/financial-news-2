Energa SA,  Poland ’s fourth-largest
utility, signed a preliminary agreement to buy rights in a wind
farm site from  Polish Energy Partners SA (PEP) , a project developer.  The final contract will be signed by the end of 2013, said
Magdalena Zdziech-Sobotkowska, a spokeswoman for PEP said by e-
mail today.  The 38.7 million Polish zloty ($11 million) Miloradz wind-
farm site in northern Poland will be sold through a special
purpose vehicle, Pepino Ltd., with most of the price paid when
the sale is finalized and the rest due when the site receives a
government license to produce energy, wire service SeeNews
reported.  Poland’s supply of  wind energy  could exceed demand at slack
times by 2014, according to national grid operator PSE-Operator
SA. Total capacity is currently 2,300 megawatts and is expected
to exceed 5,500 megawatts in the next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
