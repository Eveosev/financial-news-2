Mohamed  Bin Hammam  provisionally was
suspended from any soccer activity by the Asian Football
Confederation after an audit of the governing body’s accounts.  Former AFC President Bin Hammam, who is fighting a life ban
from the sport, was suspended for 30 days following the forensic
audit, which centered on contract negotiations and payments to
and from AFC bank accounts during his tenure, the AFC  said in a
statement  late yesterday.  Bin Hammam, 63, is banned “from taking part in any kind of
football activity in the area of jurisdiction of the AFC until
the AFC Disciplinary Committee reaches a decision on the merits
in the present matter,” the AFC said.  The Qatari, who challenged Sepp Blatter for the FIFA
presidency, already has been banned for life by soccer’s world
governing body after being found guilty of buying votes for last
year’s leadership contest against Blatter. He denied offering
any money and said the charges were politically motivated.  He is awaiting a final verdict on his appeal to the Court
of Arbitration for Sport, his final chance to overturn FIFA’s
ban. He said on June 29 that the Lausanne, Switzerland-based
court will deliver its verdict July 27.  Bin Hammam was banned in July 2011 for offering Caribbean
soccer officials $40,000 each per month before he was due to
challenge Blatter. He pulled out of the presidential race when
originally suspended, so Blatter retained the post unopposed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
