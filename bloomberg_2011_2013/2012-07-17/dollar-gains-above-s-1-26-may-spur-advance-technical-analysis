The  U.S. dollar  may be set for a
further advance against its  Singapore  counterpart should it
sustain gains above its lowest level this month, Forecast Pte.
said, citing technical patterns.  The greenback dropped to as low as S$1.2608 on July 5, the
weakest since May 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The level is the base of the currency’s trading range in the
past 2 1/2 weeks, according to Winston Tang, a Singapore-based
technical analyst.  “The anticipation is that we’ll see more of an upside
break as long as it sustains above” the July 5 low, Tang said.
The first target may be the S$1.2749 high reached on July 6 and
a breach of this level “will trigger more upside momentum,” he
said.  The dollar was at S$1.2644 as of 7:54 a.m. in Singapore.
S$1.2749 is the U.S. currency’s strongest level this month,
Bloomberg data show. It climbed to as high as S$1.3006 on Jan. 9
this year and has dropped 2.5 percent against its Singapore
counterpart since Dec. 31.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
