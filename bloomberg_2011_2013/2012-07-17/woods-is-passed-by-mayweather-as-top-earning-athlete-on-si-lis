Tiger Woods isn’t the top-earning
U.S. athlete for the first time since Sports Illustrated started
its annual ranking in 2004, having been passed by boxer Floyd Mayweather and fellow golfer  Phil Mickelson .  Mayweather, who is serving a three-month jail sentence in
Las Vegas after pleading guilty to domestic battery charges
against a former girlfriend, made $85 million in the past year
from world title fights against Victor Ortiz and Miguel Cotto.
He ranks No. 1 on SI.com’s “ Fortunate 50 ” list, even with no
earnings from endorsements.  Mayweather, 35, is followed by Mickelson, who earned almost
$60.8 million, with $57 million of that coming from  endorsement
and sponsorship deals. Mickelson, 42, also was second in last
year’s SI ranking of top-earning athletes.  Woods, 36, slipped to third after his total earnings for
2011 fell to $56.4 million, the lowest it’s been since SI.com
started the “Fortunate 50” eight years ago. Woods, who didn’t
capture an official U.S. PGA Tour title in 2011, had $1.9
million in winnings and received another $54.5 million in
endorsement income, down $5 million from the previous year.  SI.com’s rankings used the 2011 calendar year for winnings-
based sports such as golf, auto racing and tennis, while boxing
purses are from June 2011 through May 2012. For sports such as
football, basketball, baseball and hockey, salary figures from
the current or most recently completed season are used. As a
result, a player such as  Drew Brees  -- who signed a $100 million
contract with the New Orleans Saints earlier this week -- isn’t
included on the list.  Kobe Bryant  of the National Basketball Association’s Los
Angeles Lakers ranks fourth among the top-earning U.S. athletes
with $48.3 million in earnings, followed by  LeBron James  of the
Miami Heat at $45.9 million.  Two Yankees  Two players from Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees
rank in the top 10:  Alex Rodriguez  at No. 6 with $33.5 million
and  Derek Jeter  at No. 9 with $27.7 million.  Quarterback Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos is the
highest-earning National Football League player, ranking seventh
on the SI.com list at $31 million. He’s followed by Nascar
driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. with $28.2 million in salary and
endorsements. Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald
rounds out the top 10 at $26.8 million.  The Fortunate 50 list features 19 baseball players, 13
basketball players, 11 football players, four Nascar drivers,
two golfers and Mayweather as the lone boxer. No female athlete
is on the list for the fourth year in a row.  Tennis player  Roger Federer  tops SI.com’s list of the 20
highest-earning international athletes after making more than
$51.4 million.  Soccer players  David Beckham ,  Lionel Messi  and Cristiano Ronaldo occupy the next three spots, with total earnings of $46
million, $41.2 million and $40.2 million, respectively. Tennis
player  Maria Sharapova  ranks 10th with $26.5 million in winnings
and endorsements, the only woman to make either list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
