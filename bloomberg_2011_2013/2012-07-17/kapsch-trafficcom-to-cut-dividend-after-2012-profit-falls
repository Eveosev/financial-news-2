Kapsch TrafficCom AG (KTCG) , the Austrian
maker of toll-road systems, will cut its full-year dividend
after project delays in  Poland  and  South Africa  caused profit to
fall even as sales reached a record.  Net income slid 3 percent to 27.5 million euros ($33.8
million) even after sales jumped 42 percent to 550 million
euros. The company plans to pay a dividend of 90 cent a share
compared with a euro the year before, Chief Executive Officer
Georg Kapsch said today at a press conference in Vienna.  “While the delays affected our profit margin, they won’t
be a lasting problem,” Kapsch said in the Austrian capital,
where the company is based. “We’ve made massive investments in
the future.”  Kapsch has expanded into 30 countries including the U.S.,
where it supplies technology to 22 million drivers using E-ZPass
Group passes on toll roads. Kapsch TrafficCom is a listed unit
of  Austria ’s 120-year-old Kapsch Group, which supplies system
technologies and location-based services to companies including
 Apple Inc ., Google Inc. and 3M Co.  “E-ZPass gives us a firm basis for solid growth in  North
America ,” Kapsch said, adding that he’s positioning his
family’s business to be a “dividend oriented” company.  Kapsch shares rose as much as 1.02 euros a share, or 1.7
percent, and traded at 60.50 euros at 11:18 a.m. in Vienna. The
stock is up 3 percent this year, giving Kapsch a 787 million
euro market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
