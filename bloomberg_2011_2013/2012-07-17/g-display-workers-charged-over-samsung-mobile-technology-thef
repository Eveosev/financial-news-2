Six employees of  LG Display Co. (034220) , the
world’s second-largest flat-panel maker, have been charged over
theft of technology from Samsung Mobile Display Co.  The six leaked or stole Samsung Mobile’s organic light-
emitting diode technology and business secrets, according to an
indictment filed with Suwon District Court in  South Korea . The
accused include two former Samsung Mobile employees.  Samsung Mobile requested LG Display formally apologize and
take steps needed to prevent reoccurrence, the company, merged
with Samsung Display Co. this month, said in an e-mail today in
response to questions. LG Display systematically took Samsung’s
OLED technology and core staff to overcome its own shortcomings,
according to the e-mail.  The information obtained is widely known in the industry
and isn’t considered a trade secret, LG Display said in a
separate e-mail. Seoul-based LG Display said it plans to take
legal action against Samsung Display, a unit of  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) , for defamation.  LG Display rose 1.8 percent to 23,100 won as of 11:46 a.m.
in Seoul trading, while Samsung Electronics advanced 1.1 percent
to 1,165,000 won. Samsung Display isn’t publicly traded.  OLED televisions are as thin as 4 millimeters (0.2 inch)
and produce sharper images than liquid-crystal-display models.
Shipments of OLED TVs may  surge 62-fold  to 2.1 million sets in
2015 from 34,000 in 2012, according to an estimate by Englewood,
Colorado-based IHS Inc.’s iSuppli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
