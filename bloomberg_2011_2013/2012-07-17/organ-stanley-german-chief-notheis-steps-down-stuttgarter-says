Morgan Stanley’s German chief Dirk Notheis left the bank’s local executive board and won’t return
to his post,  Stuttgarter Zeitung  reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter.  Notheis stepped down because of criticism over his
involvement in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg’s purchase of a
stake in  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) , the newspaper said.  A spokeswoman for the lender declined to comment
immediately on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
