Orascom Telecom Media & Technology
Holding SAE (OTMT) , an Egyptian telecommunications company, rose the
most in more than two weeks as the stock attracted retail
investors after adjusting for the dividend.  Shares of the Cairo-based company surged by the daily limit
10 percent before closing 2.5 percent higher at 41 piasters in
Cairo. That’s the biggest increase since July 2.  The company
will distribute  a dividend  of 1.05 pounds a share July 19 after
the sale of most of its stake in  Egyptian Co. for Mobile
Services  to  France Telecom SA (FTE)  earlier this year. The benchmark
 EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  increased 1.6 percent.  “A lot of the buying we’re seeing today is by retail
investors that are finding the stock cheap,” said Hassan
Kenawi, equities trader at Cairo-based HC Brokerage. “This
should only last for a day or two as the future of the company
is still unclear.”  The stock was initiated with a hold recommendation this
week by Pharos Holding for Financial Investments. The bank cited
a lack of information about Orascom Telecom Media’s strategy and
the concentration of its “remaining value in a high-risk
asset” in  North Korea ’s Koryolink. The company owns about 75
percent of the Korean mobile network operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
