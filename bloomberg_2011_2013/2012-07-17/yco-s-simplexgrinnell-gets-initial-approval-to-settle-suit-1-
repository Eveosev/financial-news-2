Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) ’s
SimplexGrinnell unit received initial court approval for a $5.5
million settlement in a lawsuit over workers’ wages.  The case was filed in 2007 on behalf of more than 600
current and former SimplexGrinnell employees who handled  New
York  state and municipal fire alarm and sprinkler projects.
Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold in Brooklyn, New York, granted
the preliminary approval in an order filed today.  The  Boca Raton , Florida-based  safety system company  was
accused of failing to pay appropriate wages and benefits to
workers and laborers on projects for the New York State Office
of Mental Health.  Under the settlement, SimplexGrinnell will pay $5.5 million
to plaintiffs in addition to funds that would cover an
employer’s share of payroll taxes, according to a memorandum
filed on behalf of the plaintiffs.  The case was “on the eve of trial when the settlement was
reached,” Gold said in the order. “By that time, the parties
had engaged in extensive discovery that was more than sufficient
to allow counsel to make a well-informed decision about the
fairness of the settlement.”  Chris Woodcock, a SimplexGrinnell spokesman, and David
Copus, a lawyer for the company, didn’t immediately respond to
requests for comment on the settlement.  The case is Ramos v. SimplexGrinnell, 1:07-cv-00981, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York ( Brooklyn ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
