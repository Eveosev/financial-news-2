What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower as
demand ebbs following a 52 percent rally since mid-June, Dewey Strickler, the president of Ag Watch Market Advisors in
Franklin,  Kentucky , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower as
consumption declines following a 21 percent rally since mid-
June, Strickler said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open steady to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher
after Russia cut its forecast for grain production because of
drought, Strickler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
