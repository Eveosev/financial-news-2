Corn slipped from a 13-month high on
speculation that a drought-fueled rally this month will curb
demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest grower
and exporter. Soybeans closed unchanged after reaching a four-
year high.  Ethanol  output  in the U.S. fell 4.2 percent in the week
ended July 6 to the lowest in almost two years, government data
show. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on July 11 cut its 2012
forecast for meat and poultry output by 0.7 percent. Corn
futures are up 52 percent since mid-June as Midwest crops
withered under the worst U.S. drought since 1956.  “We have reached levels that have historically slowed
demand,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Anyone making ethanol or raising livestock is
losing money at current prices. That’s called demand
destruction.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
close at $7.7125 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching $7.89, the highest for a most-active
contract since June 9, 2011. Prices are up 22 percent this
month, more than any of the 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Soybean futures for November delivery closed unchanged at
$15.905 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $16.07, the highest
since July 2008. Prices are up 21 percent since mid-June.  About 55 percent of the contiguous U.S. states were in
moderate to extreme drought at the end of June, the highest
percentage since December 1956, according to the National
Climatic Data Center. Last month was the 14th-warmest ever and
the 10th-driest June based on records going back to 1895.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
