About 55 percent of the contiguous
U.S. states were in moderate to extreme drought at the end of
June, the highest percentage since December 1956, according to
the National Climatic Data Center.  Last month was the 14th-warmest ever and the 10th-driest
June based on records going back to 1895, the center said in a
 note  on its website. Crop-growing regions in the Midwest and
central and northern Great Plains were among the core drought
areas identified by the Palmer Index, a drought measure going
back 112 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
