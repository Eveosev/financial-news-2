FedEx Corp. (FDX)  will have to fend off
competition from  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  to keep a contract
valued at more than $1 billion with its largest customer, the
money-losing U.S.  Postal Service .  The agreement generates more than  3 percent  of FedEx’s
sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and covers
shipping of first class, priority and express mail. UPS
“definitely wants to bid” for that work when the Postal
Service seeks proposals after the contract’s expiration in
September 2013, said  Norman Black , a company spokesman.  UPS, which already has a $100 million contract with the
Postal Service, is the “most logical competitor,” said Ben Hartford, a Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst in  Milwaukee . The
agency is seeking new bids as it closes mail-processing plants
and cuts its work force to save cash after a $3.2 billion loss
in the quarter through March 31.  Just being the incumbent, FedEx is “the most likely to get
the business going forward, but it would likely be under
different terms,” Hartford said in a telephone interview.  During an 11-year relationship, FedEx has “raised the
service levels and reliability of the Postal Service product,”
 Jess Bunn , a FedEx spokesman, said in a telephone interview.
“That record of success will be an important consideration.”  FedEx warned in a regulatory filing this week that it
may lose the contract or be able to negotiate less favorable
terms for renewing it. Postal Service work generated about
$1.4 billion for the Memphis, Tennessee-based company in its
fiscal year through May 2012,  Helane Becker , a Dahlman Rose &
Co. analyst in New York, said in a note to clients.  Road Bump  The loss would “negatively impact FedEx and would cause a
bump in the road as the company restructures its Express
business,” she said.  FedEx fell 0.7 percent to $91.25 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 9.3 percent this year. UPS today rose
0.2 percent to $79.33.  FedEx last month  predicted profit  of $6.90 to $7.40 a share
in the fiscal year through May, compared an average estimate of
$7.33 from analysts and $6.41 last year.  The FedEx Express unit also has around 5,000 drop boxes at
Postal Service locations that will be removed under an agreement
that expired in June, the company said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
