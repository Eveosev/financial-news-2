Neeraj Seth, the Singapore-based
head of Asian credit at BlackRock, which oversees $3.68 trillion
worldwide, discusses the Indian rupee at a media briefing today:  “Given the changes that have happened in the last few
weeks, including the change in the finance minister, with the
prime minster taking on that responsibility there’s some
increased awareness about the need for fiscal consolidation and
the need for reforms.  “We have been a little bit more positive on the rupee in
the short term. In order for the rupee to strengthen over time
we still need some of the basic reforms to pave the path for
future growth. That still has to happen.” Seth defines short
term as the next few months.  On the impact of fiscal and monetary policies:  “On the fiscal side, there’s limited room given the high
level of the exiting deficit. And on the monetary side,
inflation is still running high.  “To make things more complicated, there’s a logjam on the
political front which is not helping. Overall, there’s some room
in the case of  India  on the monetary side but there’s limited
room on the fiscal side that you can imagine to get the economy
back on the growth track.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
