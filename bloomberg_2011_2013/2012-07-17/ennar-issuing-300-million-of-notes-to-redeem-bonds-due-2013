Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, sold $350 million of notes to make a
tender offer for debt coming due next year.  The company, which builds residences in 18 states, sold
4.75 percent bonds due December 2017 that yield 414 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The offering was originally sized at $300
million, according to a release today from the Miami, Florida-
based company.  Proceeds will be used to redeem $267.7 million of 5.95
percent debentures due March 2013 at a price of 103 cents on the
dollar and for general corporate purposes, the release said. The
bonds increased to 103.1 cents on the dollar at 1:57 p.m. in  New
York  today, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Lennar last issued bonds in November 2011, issuing $400
million of 3.25 percent convertible securities maturing in 2021
with a conversion price of $23.5 per share, according to
Bloomberg data.  The new bonds were rated B2, the fifth-highest level of
speculative grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the ratings
company said in a release today.  “While the transaction may result in a slight increase in
Lennar’s debt levels, it extends the company’s debt maturity
profile,” Moody’s said in the release. “We recognize the
positive momentum the company has been demonstrating in terms of
its operating performance and credit metrics.”  Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG managed
the sale, according to Bloomberg data.  Editors:  John Parry , Richard Bravo  To contact the reporter on this story:
