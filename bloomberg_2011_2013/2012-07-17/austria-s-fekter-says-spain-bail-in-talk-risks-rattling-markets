Austria ’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said she was reluctant to discuss imposing losses on
senior bondholders for Spanish banks because it risked rattling
financial markets.  “Regarding a private-sector involvement, I am basically
very hesitant as we could massively irritate the market with
this,” Fekter told reporters in Vienna today, saying it was too
early to comment on conditionality for Spain’s bailout.  The cost of insuring against default on senior bank bonds
rose yesterday after the  European Central Bank  was said to drop
its opposition to holders of the securities taking losses in
bailouts. The ECB backed imposing losses on senior bondholders
of the most troubled Spanish banks at a July 9 meeting, a
position rejected by euro-area finance ministers, according to
two officials with knowledge of the ECB’s thinking who spoke on
condition of anonymity as the talks were confidential.  Euro-area finance ministers plan to put the finishing
touches on  Spain ’s bailout package on July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
