Tobacco farmers in  Zimbabwe  have
delivered 134 million kilograms (295 million pounds) of tobacco
for sale this year, beating a revised estimate of 133 million
kilograms,  Newsday  reported, citing statistics from the state’s
Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board.  Sales of the leaves will end July 27, Harare-based Newsday

crop, at an average price of $3.70 a kilogram, Newsday said.
Earnings from tobacco rose 45 percent on the same period last
