Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  fell the most in more
than four months as the drugmaker awaits a decision from U.S.
regulators on whether to approve its obesity drug Qnexa.  Vivus declined 7.8 percent to $26.46 at the close in  New
York , the biggest single-day decline since Feb. 28. The  Food and
Drug Administration  is scheduled to decide today on whether the
treatment can be sold in the U.S.  It’s not unusual for shares to be volatile on days when an
FDA decision is due, Jason Butler, an analyst at JMP Securities
in New York, said in an interview. The decision “could have a
pretty significant impact on the stock,” said Butler, who
expects Qnexa to be approved.  Vivus is seeking a boost in sales from Qnexa, which may
contribute $1.25 billion to revenue in 2016, according to the
average of five analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Mountain View , California-based company is competing against
 Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  and  Eisai Co. (4523) , which had their
weight-loss treatment Belviq approved by the FDA on June 27.  Arena’s Belviq was the first weight-loss pill approved by
the FDA since Roche Holding AG’s Xenical in 1999.  Orexigen
Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  is also developing a weight-loss pill called
Contrave with Osaka, Japan-based  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)   The FDA in 2010 had rejected weight loss pills from Arena
and Vivus on safety concerns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
