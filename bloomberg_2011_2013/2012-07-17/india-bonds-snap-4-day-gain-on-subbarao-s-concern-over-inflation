India ’s 10-year bonds declined for
the first time in five days after central bank Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao said that inflation was “way above” the threshold.  Yields rebounded from a one-month low after commerce
ministry data published yesterday showed inflation exceeded 7
percent for the fifth straight month. The benchmark wholesale-
price  index  rose 7.25 percent from a year earlier, after
climbing 7.55 percent in May, the ministry said. The monetary
authority’s threshold level “may be around 5 percent,”
Subbarao said yesterday.  “Investor’s sentiment has been damped after the governor’s
comments” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank  in Mumbai. “This means the central
bank may not cut rates this month.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.09 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
touched 8.05 percent yesterday, the lowest for a benchmark 10-
year bond since June 15.  The RBI reduced its  repurchase rate  by 50 basis points to 8
percent in April, after raising it by a record 375 basis points
through 2010 and 2011. Subbarao held the repo  rate  at 8 percent
at a meeting on June 18. The next policy review is scheduled on
July 31.  “I’m not implying anything by way of what decision we
might take at the policy review at the end of July” Subbarao
said, speaking at a book release function yesterday. “I’m only
saying that inflation is above the threshold.”  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose six basis
points to 7.59 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
