Italy ’s spending on grain imports
fell 14 percent in the first four months of 2012 as the world’s
third-biggest wheat buyer purchased less.  Grain imports fell to 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) from
January through to April from 1.17 billion euros a year earlier,
the Rome-based Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti, known as
Anacer, wrote in an e-mailed statement statement today.  Italy shipped in 7.3 million tons of wheat last year,
making the country the third-biggest importer of the grain after
 Egypt  and  Algeria , according to figures from the Geneva-based
International Trade Centre.  Soft-wheat imports in January through to April fell to 1.54
million tons from 1.61 million tons a year earlier, while the
cost of shipments fell to 348.2 million euros from 414.5 million
euros, the report showed.  Imports of durum wheat, the hard variety used to make
pasta, fell to 378,881 tons from 558,928 tons, while costs
declined to 118.7 million euros from 144.2 million euros.  Italians on average eat more wheat than people in other
countries of  Europe  or  North America ,  data  from the
International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center shows.  Corn imports declined to 792,823 tons from 1.04 million
tons, and the cost fell to 189.3 million euros from 240.8
million euros, according to Anacer. Barley shipments fell to
222,407 tons from 334,192 tons, with a value of 47.7 million
euros from 75.9 million euros in January through April 2011.  Including oilseed and protein-crop products, the value of
imports fell to 1.44 billion euros from 1.65 billion euros.  Italian cereal-industry exports were worth 1.21 billion
euros, compared with 1.46 billion euros, Anacer reported. That
shrunk Italy’s grain-trade deficit to 514 million euros from the
year-earlier current-account shortfall of 691.7 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
