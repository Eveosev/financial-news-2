Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  will pay
$26.6 million to settle a lawsuit brought by investors in a
$698 million mortgage-backed securities offering, according to
papers filed in Manhattan federal court.  The Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi
today asked U.S. District Judge Harold Baer to approve the
settlement. The pension fund told Baer earlier this month that
both sides had accepted a settlement proposed by a mediator. The
amount of the settlement was disclosed in today’s filing.  The Mississippi retirement fund sued in 2009, claiming New
 Century Financial Corp. (CYFL) , which originated the mortgages
underlying the securities, failed to adhere to its underwriting
standards and overstated the value of the collateral backing the
loans. The fund claimed New York-based Goldman Sachs didn’t
conduct proper due diligence when it bought the loans in 2005.  Baer in February granted a request by the  Mississippi  fund
to represent a class of more than 150 investors in the offering.  The case is Public Employees Retirement System of
Mississippi v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 09-cv-01110, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
