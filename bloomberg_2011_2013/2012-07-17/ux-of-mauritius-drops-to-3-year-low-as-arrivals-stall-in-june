Lux Island Resorts Ltd. (NRL) , Mauritiusâ€™s
third-biggest leisure operator by market value, fell to the
lowest in more than three years after tourism arrivals to the
Indian Ocean island nation missed estimates.  The  stock  retreated for a second day, falling 0.5 percent
to 18.90 rupees a share by 12:39 p.m., in Port Louis, the
capital, the lowest since March 2009.  The number of visitors to the Indian Ocean island nation
rose 0.1 percent to 54,625 last month, Statistics Mauritius said
in a  statement  on its website today. Arrivals for the first six
months in 2012 grew 0.5 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent
forecast by the data agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
