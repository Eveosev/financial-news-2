Nordex AG, a German windmill maker,
rose in  Frankfurt  trading after securing a five-turbine order
for a wind park in the German Oberpfalz area.  The stock climbed as much as 5.5 percent to 3.14 euros, the
biggest increase since July 3, and was up 3.5 percent at 5:07
p.m. in Frankfurt. The Hamburg-based company was the biggest
climber on the German HDAX Index today.  “Nordex’s situation is inspiring investor confidence,”
Holger Fechner, a Hamburg-based analyst at Norddeutsche
Landesbank Giroz, said in a phone interview. The company has “a
strong order intake” and recently confirmed it will reach
profit goals, Fechner said. Investors also favor the company’s
efforts to find a partner in  China , he said.  Nordex plans to connect the five N117/2400 onshore turbines
ordered by Neumarkt-based Jura Energie GmbH to the  power grid 
next year, the company said today in a statement. In April, the
manufacturer won a contract from VenSol Neue Energien GmbH and
Honold GmbH Windkraftanlagen for the delivery of 10 turbines to
Bavaria´s largest wind farm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
