 Bernie Ecclestone  says having a race in London would be “great
for the city” after officials confirmed an auto track is among
four bidders for the city’s Olympic Stadium.  The London Legacy Development Corp. today said it had
received a bid from a company called Intelligent Transport
Services in association with Formula One for the stadium that
will host the  Summer Olympics . It named soccer teams West Ham
United and Leyton Orient and the UCFB College of Football
Business as the other bidders.  “A race in London would be great for the city,”
Ecclestone said in a telephone interview, adding there was no
agreement in place with Intelligence Transport Services.  The company was registered in the U.K. in May 2011,
according to records at  Companies House .  “We’ve told them it’s a good idea and we would be
interested,” Ecclestone said.  The British Grand Prix is currently held at Silverstone,
where  Mark Webber  of  Red Bull  was the winner on July 8.
Ecclestone said there would be “no problem” for that track,
which is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of London, if a
grand prix circuit was built in London.  The Olympic arena is the U.K.’s third-largest, behind
Wembley Stadium and Twickenham Stadium. The games start July 27.  The U.K. government started seeking an operator for the 537
million pound ($838 million) stadium, the centerpiece of
London’s 2012 games, in October after an agreement to sell the
facility to West Ham failed because of legal challenges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
