Nick Buckles, the chief executive
officer of  G4S Plc (GFS) , said he’s confident that, working with the
police and military, the company can deliver a secure London
Olympic Games.  “We’re still confident that, together with the military
and the police, we can deliver a safe and secure Olympics,”
Buckles told lawmakers on the House of Commons Home Affairs
Committee in London today.  Competitor companies are providing 500 staff to assist G4S,
Buckles said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
