Japanâ€™s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average
swung between gains and losses at the open of trading following
a three-day weekend as the yen rose to a one-month high against
the dollar, offsetting investor optimism that China may take
further steps to boost its economy amid a global slowdown.  The Nikkei 225 slipped 0.1 percent to 8,718.87 as of 9:02
a.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index fell 0.2 percent to
744.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
