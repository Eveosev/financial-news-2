Spanish Economy Minister Luis de
Guindos said banks that plan to issue preference shares in the
future will have to sell 50 percent of the total to
institutional investors,  La Vanguardia  reported.  “Individual investors will have to be informed of the risk
they are taking on,” de Guindos told La Vanguardia during an
interview yesterday in Barcelona.  De Guindos also said that nationalized banks including
Catalunya Caixa and  Bankia SA (BKIA)  will receive fresh capital and be
privatized once bad assets are transferred to a bad bank that
will be operational before the end of the year  To contact the reporter on this story:
