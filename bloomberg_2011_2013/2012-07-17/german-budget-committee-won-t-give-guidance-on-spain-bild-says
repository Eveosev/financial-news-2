The budget committee in  Germany ’s
lower house of parliament won’t make a recommendation after a
meeting tomorrow on how lawmakers should vote in a July 19
plenary session on the recapitalization of Spanish banks,  Bild-
Zeitung  reported.  The panel has no intention of making a decision that goes
beyond “taking note” of the matter, the newspaper cited an
unpublished letter by committee chairwoman Petra Merkel as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
