Canadian oils surged as refiners in
 Alberta  and  Illinois  returned plants to service and as rail
shipments of petroleum increased.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. is starting units after planned
work at its Robinson refinery in Illinois, Jamal Kheiry, a
Findlay, Ohio-based spokesman, said in a telephone interview
yesterday.  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ’s Strathcona refinery in Alberta
completed maintenance and has returned to normal operations,  Jon
Harding , a company spokesman, said yesterday.  Canadian rail freight car loads of petroleum products rose
45 percent from a year ago to 5,934 in the week ended July 7,
Association of American Railroads data shows.  Syncrude strengthened $3.65 to a $2.50 premium to West
Texas Intermediate at 2:39 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level the grade has
traded at this year. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from
tarlike bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $3 to $13.75 a
barrel below WTI, the smallest gap since May 1.  Bakken oil was steady at $3.25 below the U.S. benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI decreased 45 cents
to $17.70 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 60 cents to

Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased 85 cents to
a $16 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
