Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said today he
hasn’t been approached for the job of  Egypt ’s new prime minister
under President Mohamed Mursi, and would decline the offer if
extended.  “There are many more qualified candidates than me,” El-
Erian said in an e-mailed response to questions. “At this
critical time in Egypt’s history, it is important that
candidates include those who have been living in Egypt and who
have participated in person in Egypt’s revolutionary process.”  The independent Egyptian daily, Al-Watan, reported today
that El-Erian was a likelier choice to head up the new
government than former central bank Governor Mahmoud Abul-Eyoun.
Other candidates whose names have been floated by the Egyptian
media have been former finance ministers and the current central
bank head.  Mursi said today that the discussions are ongoing in a bid
to ensure that the selection process yields the best choices for
the country at a time when it is struggling economically.  To contact the reporter on this story:
