China’s stocks  rose, helping the
benchmark index rebound from a three-year low, after the
government said it will boost railway infrastructure investment
and forecast economic growth will pick up in the second half.  CSR Corp. (601766)  the nation’s biggest train maker, advanced the
most in a week after the railway ministry increased its planned
spending for this year by 9 percent.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly
Real Estate Group Co., the largest developers, gained after a
Shenzhen government agency said the city may allow individuals
to borrow against their provident funds to buy first homes.
Citic Securities Co. led a rally for brokerages after the
Ministry of Commerce said China’s economy will gain momentum.  “Though the downtrend on the economy is continuing, we
shouldn’t be totally bearish now as the government may announce
additional stimulus plans at any time,” said  Wang Zheng ,
Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment
Management Co., which manages about $120 million. “If you sell
now, you’ll probably miss the boat.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.6 percent to 2,161.19

according to the statement dated July 6. That indicates about

expected,” said Zhang Zhiwei, a Hong Kong-based economist for
Nomura Holdings Inc. who formerly worked for the  International
