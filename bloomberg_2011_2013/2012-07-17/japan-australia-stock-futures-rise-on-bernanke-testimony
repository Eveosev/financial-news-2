Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  rose after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
U.S. policy makers are prepared to act to boost growth if the
labor market doesn’t improve, buoying the earnings outlook for
Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s
third-largest carmaker by market value, rose 0.8 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Australia’s third-biggest lender,
gained 0.7 percent. Chip-related shares such as Tokyo Electron
Ltd. may be active after bellwether  Intel Corp . reported a
third-quarter sales forecast that missed some estimates.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,780 in Chicago yesterday compared with
8,750 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  8,780
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
advanced 0.1 percent in Wellington.  Bernanke “continued to indicate that the Fed would ease
policy further if they thought that was necessary,” said
 Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment market
research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which
oversees about $150 billion. There were “certainly no hints on
when that action might be or what it might entail.”  Easing Tools  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell less than
0.1 percent today. The index climbed 0.7 percent in New York
yesterday after a report showed the cost of living in the U.S.
was little changed in June. Bernanke told the Senate Banking
Committee in Washington yesterday that easing tools include
further purchases of assets, cutting the interest rate that the
Fed pays on reserves banks keep with the Fed, and altering its
communications on the outlook for interest rates.  The Bank of Japan is scheduled to release minutes of its
June policy meeting at 8:50 a.m. today in Tokyo. The central
bank maintained the size of its asset-purchase fund at the June
meeting.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.4 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 4.7 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, said
yesterday its revenue in the current period will be $14.3
billion, plus or minus $500 million. The average of estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected sales of $14.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
