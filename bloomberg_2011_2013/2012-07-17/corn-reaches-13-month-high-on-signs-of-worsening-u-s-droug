Corn touched a 13-month high in
 Chicago  as damage from the worst U.S. drought in a generation
stoked concern yields will drop. Soybeans declined.  The Department of Agriculture cut its ratings for U.S. corn
conditions for a sixth week yesterday, while  heat  indexes in
Illinois,  Indiana  and Wisconsin may top 100 degrees Fahrenheit
(38 degrees Celsius) today, National Weather Service data show.
Grain and oilseeds are the best performing commodities this year
among 80 raw materials tracked by Bloomberg. The rally may drive
world food costs to a record this year, Danske Bank A/S said.  “Until the weather changes significantly, we’re going to
continue to see the uptick in corn,”  William Adams , a  fund
manager  at Resilience AG, said by telephone from Zurich today.
Extended dryness may spur the USDA to cut its crop forecast next
month, and “if numbers come through dramatically worse, we will
push prices to $8 and potentially have another 50 cents to a
dollar higher in the move,” he said.  Corn for December delivery was little changed at $7.7225 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:06 p.m. in  London 
after touching $7.89, the highest since June 9, 2011. Futures
also fell as much as 1.3 percent today on concern a price surge
since mid-June would cut demand from ethanol producers and
livestock feeders. The most-active contract hit an all-time high
of $7.9925 during the food crisis in June 2008.  Soybeans, Wheat  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.7 percent to $15.7975
a bushel after reaching $16.07, the costliest for the most-
active contract since July 2008. Wheat for September delivery
fell 0.4 percent to $8.8125 a bushel.  U.S. corn production may total 12.97 billion bushels this
year, or 12 percent less than the record 14.79 billion projected
in June, the USDA said July 11. Output is still expected to be
larger than the 12.36 billion bushels produced last year, when
hot weather also damaged crops.  Mostly above-normal temperatures and below-normal rain are
expected to persist across the Midwest for at least the next 10
days, forecaster Telvent DTN said in a report yesterday. Thirty-
one percent of U.S. corn was in good or excellent  condition  as
of July 15, the worst rating for this time of year since a
drought in 1988, the USDA said. Forty percent of crops had the
top ratings a week earlier.  30% Drop?  “If the weather pans out in the next few weeks the way
it’s forecast, we could see U.S. corn production down 25 to 30
percent year-on-year,”  Paul Deane , an analyst at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said from  Melbourne .  An estimated 34 percent of  soybeans  got the top ratings as
of July 13, also the worst reading at this time of year since
1988, the USDA said. About 63 percent of the Midwest had
moderate to extreme  drought  as of July 10, according to the U.S.
Drought Monitor in Lincoln,  Nebraska .  In  China , the world’s largest soybean buyer, the January-
delivery contract dropped 1.3 percent to 4,757 yuan ($746) a
metric ton after rising to the highest price for the most-active
contract in Dalian since July 2008. Soybean meal for May
delivery slumped 2.3 percent to 3,412  yuan  a ton.  “Local soybean meal has surged so much that a ton of
soybean meal is now worth more than a ton of steel rebar used in
the construction field,” Lin Ruhan, general manager of Shanghai
Futures Investment Co., said by phone today. “It’s time for
investors to pause and take a look at the fundamentals.”  In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat fell 0.2 percent
to 264.25 euros ($324.49) a ton on NYSE Liffe after touching 269
euros, the highest ever for the contract. Prices have rallied 30
percent since mid-June on weather concerns in the U.S., European
Union and former  Soviet Union . Rapeseed for November delivery
declined 0.4 percent to 518.75 euros a ton after touching a
record 524.75 euros yesterday.  Wet weather has delayed barley harvesting in  Germany  and
poses a “great risk” to wheat, which may suffer damage from
mold, agriculture lobby Bundesverband der Agrargewerblichen
Wirtschaft e.V. reported yesterday. In  Russia , drought has
damaged 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of grain, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
