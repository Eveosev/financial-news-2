Dubai’s benchmark stock index gained
to the highest level in more than two months as a rally in
property developer  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  this week prompted
investors to buy construction and real-estate companies.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the biggest publicly traded
construction company in the  United Arab Emirates , rose to the
highest since May 9.  Drake & Scull International PJSC (DSI)  advanced
for a second day, while Emaar increased as much as 1.9 percent.
The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 0.9 percent to 1,529.42, the
highest since May 8, at the close in the emirate. The Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index lost 0.2 percent.  Emaar’s performance “is giving a good momentum,” said
Tariq Qaqish, Dubai-based deputy head of asset management at Al
Mal Capital. “Short-term investors are rotating to other stocks
such as Arabtec.”  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper in
Dubai and the company with the heaviest weighting on the index,
has risen 5.5 percent this week amid speculation second-quarter
earnings may beat estimates.  Net income  will more than double to
551 million dirhams ($150 million), according to the mean
estimate of four analysts on Bloomberg. The shares have gained
27 percent this year, more than double the benchmark index.  Arabtec’s second-quarter profit may also more than double
to 73 million dirhams, according to the  mean estimate of six
analysts on Bloomberg . Arabtec rose 1 percent to 2.97 dirhams.
Drake & Scull advanced 3 percent to 82.5 fils, the highest since
May 13. There are 100 fils to the dirham. Emaar advanced 1.2
percent to 3.27 dirhams, the highest since April 30.  The three companies were the most traded stocks on Dubai’s
gauge, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . About 144
million shares were traded in Dubai today, compared with a 12-
month daily average of about 138 million shares, t he data show.   Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index and Qatar’s QE Index climbed
