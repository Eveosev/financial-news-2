An Israeli college in the  West Bank 
settlement of Ariel was recognized today as a university by the
Judea and Samaria Council for Higher Education, Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office said in a text message.  “This is a day of celebration in Ariel, and a day of
celebration for higher education in Israel,” Netanyahu said in
the message.  Judea and Samaria are biblical names for the West Bank.  The United Nations and other international bodies have said
Israeli settlements in the West Bank violate international law
against construction on occupied territory. The U.S. has asked
Israel to freeze such construction and the Palestinian Authority
has said it will not negotiate directly with Netanyahu’s
government unless it does so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
