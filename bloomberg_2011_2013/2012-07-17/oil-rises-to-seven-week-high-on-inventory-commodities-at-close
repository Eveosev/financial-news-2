in New York, led by energy.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26  prices  declined 0.1
percent to 1,546.23.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose to a seven-week high on speculation that
petroleum inventories fell. A report showed U.S. industrial
production increased in June, signaling higher energy demand.  Supplies probably dropped 1.3 million barrels last week, a
Bloomberg survey of analysts showed. Industrial output rose 0.4
percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for August

$104 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Statoil ASA failed to sell North Sea Forties for a second
day after it lowered its offer. Gunvor Group Ltd. failed to find
buyers for Russian Urals in the Mediterranean.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will cut
crude exports for September to 49 cargoes, a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg showed.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil advanced to an eight-week high as rising U.S.
factory output and increased homebuilder confidence indicated
greater demand for transportation fuel.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for August delivery rose
0.5 percent to $2.8422 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for August delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$2.845 a gallon.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures rose to a 17-month high on speculation that
demand for the grain in livestock feed will climb as hot, dry
weather scorches the U.S. corn crop.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for September
delivery rose 0.5 cent to $8.85 a bushel. Earlier, the commodity
reached $8.985, the highest for a most-active contract since
Feb. 15, 2011.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$7.7125 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $7.89, the highest

$15.905 a bushel. The price reached $16.07, the highest since
July 2008.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas dropped for a second day as forecasts for
moderating late-July heat will limit demand for the power-plant
fuel.  On the Nymex, gas futures for August delivery fell 0.2
percent to $2.796 per million British thermal units.  U.K. within-day gas was stable as imports from  Norway 
rebounded, while exports to  Belgium  jumped to an eight-month
high.  Gas traded up 0.15 pence, or 0.3 percent, at 54.70 pence a
therm at 4:12 p.m.  London  time. August gas fell 1.2 percent to
54.15 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $8.44 percent million
Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the second straight day after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  refrained from disclosing steps
that the central bank may take to bolster the  U.S. economy ,
eroding prospects for metal demand.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for September
delivery slid 0.8 percent to $3.4555 a pound.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 1.2 percent to $7,595 a metric ton ($3.45 a
pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also declined in London.
Tin advanced.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for a second day as Bernanke did not discuss
measures to boost the recovery, while insisting the central bank
will act if labor markets don’t improve.  On the Comex, gold futures for August delivery slid 0.1
percent to $1,589.50 an ounce.  Silver futures for September delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $27.316 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery rose
0.2 percent to $1,420.70 an ounce. Palladium futures for
