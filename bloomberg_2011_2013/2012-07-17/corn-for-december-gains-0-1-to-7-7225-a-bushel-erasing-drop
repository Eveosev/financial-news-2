Corn for December delivery gained
0.1 percent to $7.7225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at
7:39 a.m. in  Singapore , erasing an earlier loss of as much as 1
percent. Prices reached $7.89 a bushel yesterday, the highest
level for a most-active contract since June 2011 as drought
baked crops across the U.S. Midwest, hurting yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
