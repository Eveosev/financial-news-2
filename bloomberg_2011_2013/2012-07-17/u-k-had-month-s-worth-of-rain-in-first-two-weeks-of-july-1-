The U.K. received more rain in the
first two weeks of this month than it normally gets in all of
July, the  Met Office  said.  The U.K. had 71.8 millimeters (2.8 inches) of rain in the
first half of this month, or 103 percent of the average total
for the whole of July from 1971 to 2000, the country’s weather
forecaster said today in a statement on its website. England has
already had 150 percent of the normal amount of rain it usually
receives in July, while precipitation has been closer to normal
in parts of  Northern Ireland  and  Scotland , the agency said.  Soggy conditions in July followed  record  rainfall in June
and April, which has slowed wheat crop  development  and left
plants at risk of disease, the Agriculture and Horticulture
Development Board’s grains unit has said.  “After an exceptionally wet and gloomy June, the first
half of July has continued the disappointing theme,” the Met
Office said.  It’s too early to know whether rainfall in the full month
of July will set another record, according to the report. Parts
of the U.K. may receive more rain today, while England and  Wales 
may see drier conditions this weekend.  Temperatures averaged 13.7 degrees Celsius (57 degrees
Fahrenheit) in the first half of July, or about 1.1 degrees
Celsius below normal, the Met Office said. The U.K. has had
about 45.5 hours of sunshine in July, about half of the normal
amount for this time of year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
