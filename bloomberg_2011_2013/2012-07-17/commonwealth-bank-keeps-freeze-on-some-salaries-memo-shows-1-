Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the
nation’s biggest lender by market value, will freeze base
salaries for people making A$150,000 ($155,000) or more in its
institutional banking and markets division, according to an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Pay will be curtailed for a second year as the bank seeks
to “closely manage” costs, Ian Saines, head of the division,
said in the message to employees on July 3. Tracy Hicks, a
Sydney-based spokeswoman for Commonwealth Bank, confirmed the
content of the memo.  Profitability (AS51)  at  Australia ’s biggest banks, called the four
pillars, has been under pressure by rising wholesale funding and
deposit costs. The industry is “suffering from severe revenue
headwinds,” Saines said. Chief Executive Officer Ian Narev is
among employees who won’t receive an increase for the financial
year that started July 1, Hicks said.  “We are determined to avoid making short-term decisions,
including setting targets for a reduction in staff numbers or
sending Australian jobs offshore,” said Hicks. The bank will
report earnings for fiscal 2012 on Aug. 15.  Shares of Commonwealth Bank gained 1.6 percent to A$54.92
as of 3:58 p.m. in Sydney, extending this year’s advance to
almost 12 percent. The equity benchmark Australian S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.8 percent. The gauge has risen 2 percent in 2012.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , the third-
largest bank in Australia, said Feb. 13 it will eliminate about
1,000 jobs and extend a pay freeze for most senior executives as
it combats a slump in lending growth. The cuts are due to be
made by Sept. 30 and will involve middle-management, back-office
and support staff, the bank said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
