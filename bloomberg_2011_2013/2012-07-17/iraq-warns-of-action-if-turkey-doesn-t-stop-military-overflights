Iraq  called on Turkey to stop
violations of its airspace by military planes and warned that it
reserves the right to take action to halt the flights.  Iraq’s Foreign Ministry plans to submit a complaint to the
United Nations Security Council, according to an e-mailed
statement from government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. The
statement didn’t give details on the flights.  The Turkish  air force  killed 25 members of the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party, or PKK, in June 24 air strikes against northern
Iraq, the Turkish army said in a statement on its  website .  The PKK, which is classified as a terrorist organization by
Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union, has its main bases in
northern Iraq. The group has been fighting for autonomy in
largely Kurdish southeast  Turkey  for almost three decades in a
conflict that has left some 40,000 people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
