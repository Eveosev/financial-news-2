A judge leading a tax-fraud
investigation concerning  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s French unit has charged a
second person with aiding in illicit marketing and money
laundering.  Judge Guillaume Daieff charged the person, a former UBS
employee in Lille,  France , on July 12, Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre,
a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors’ office, said today.  UBS is “fully cooperating with the French authorities,”
according to an e-mailed statement by the Zurich-based bank.  French tax investigators have searched UBS offices in
Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Lyon as part of the inquiry, seizing
hard drives, documents and questioning employees. The bank
hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in the matter, Thibault-
Lecuivre said.  The case began in April after a preliminary inquiry into a
complaint by France’s national bank regulator over marketing
practices.  UBS avoided prosecution in the U.S. in 2009 by paying $780
million, admitting it helped thousands of Americans evade taxes
and turning over the names of 250 American clients to
authorities. UBS later revealed another 4,450 accounts held by
clients in the country.  Agence France-Presse  reported the charge against the former
employee earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
