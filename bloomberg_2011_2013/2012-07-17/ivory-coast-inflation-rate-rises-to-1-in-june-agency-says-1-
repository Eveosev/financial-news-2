Consumer prices in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s biggest cocoa producer, rose 1 percent in June from a
year earlier as communication and housing costs increased, the
statistics office said.  The inflation rate gained after falling 1.2 percent in May,
the  National Institute of Statistics , based in Abidjan, said in
an e-mailed statement today. Prices rose 0.6 percent in the
month.  Ivory Coast, the biggest economy in the eight-member West
African monetary union, is recovering from a post-election
crisis in 2011 that largely halted exports, shut banks and shops
and forced the stock exchange to relocate to  Mali .  The return to growth, forecast at 8.2 percent from a 4.7
percent contraction in 2011, is expected by the region’s central
bank to lead output in the economic grouping that shares the
euro-pegged CFA franc. The currency weakened 0.3 percent to
538.7 a dollar by 2:24 p.m. in Abidjan.  Food prices were little changed in June, rising 0.1 percent
from a year earlier, while communication costs rose an annual
4.1 percent, the highest among the non-food groups, according to
the agency. Prices for housing and utilities increased 3 percent
from a year earlier while transportation costs fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
