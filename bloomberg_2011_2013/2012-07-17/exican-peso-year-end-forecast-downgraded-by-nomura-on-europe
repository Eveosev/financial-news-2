Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its year-
end forecast for the Mexican peso to 13.85 per  U.S. dollar  from
12.80 as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis drags on.  The peso “is particularly sensitive to global risk-on and
risk-off periods,”  Benito Berber , a New York-based strategist
for the bank, wrote in an e-mailed report. “The eurozone crisis
has yet to reach its climax.”  The peso may also fall as the U.S. approaches the so-called
fiscal cliff, when more than $600 billion in higher taxes and
reductions in defense and other government programs will be
implemented if Congress doesn’t take action, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
