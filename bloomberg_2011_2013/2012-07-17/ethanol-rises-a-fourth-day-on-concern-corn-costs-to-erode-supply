Ethanol futures rose a fourth day in
 Chicago , reaching an eight-month high, on concern costlier corn
prices caused by a drought in the U.S. will curtail supply.  Prices gained a day after the Agriculture Department said
about 31 percent of the U.S. corn crop was in good or excellent
condition as of July 15, compared with 66 percent a year
earlier. Ethanol producers have responded to a surge in
feedstock costs by shuttering output, sending output to the
lowest level in two years.  “The market’s fearing more production declines,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.689 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since Nov. 16. Prices have gained 22
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 3 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.66 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 3 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.72, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  rose 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.775
a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel surged 9.5 cents, or
3.4 percent, to $2.905.  Corn for December delivery fell 1.25 cents to $7.7125 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Distillers are losing 19 cents on each gallon of ethanol
made based on the September contracts for the fuel and corn,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. is required to use 13.6 billion gallons of
renewable fuels such as ethanol this year under a government
mandate, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard.  Gasoline for August delivery fell 0.97 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.845 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have gained 5.9 percent this year.  The fuel’s premium to ethanol fell to 15.6 cents, the
lowest level since Dec. 5, as corn costs boosted the biofuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
