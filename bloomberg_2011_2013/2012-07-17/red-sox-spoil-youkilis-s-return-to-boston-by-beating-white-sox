Adrian Gonzalez  hit a three-run
eighth-inning home run to lift the Red Sox to a 5-1 win against
the Chicago White Sox, spoiling Kevin Youkilis’s Boston return.  Youkilis, who spent 8 1/2 seasons with the Red Sox before
being traded to the White Sox on June 24, was greeted with a
standing ovation from the Fenway Park crowd during his first at-
bat last night. Youkilis went 3-for-4 and scored Chicago’s lone
run on a first-inning throwing error by Gonzalez.  The score was tied 1-1 in the eighth when Gonzalez followed
walks to Carl Crawford and  David Ortiz  with a 393-foot homer to
left-center field.  Mike Aviles  added a run-scoring single to cap
Boston’s four-run inning.  The  Red Sox  improved to 46-44 while the American League
Central Division-leading White Sox fell to 49-40.  The New York Yankees improved their Major League Baseball-
best record to 55-34 with a 6-3 win against the visiting Toronto
Blue Jays last night in the opener of a three-game series. Raul Ibanez hit an eighth-inning grand slam to snap a 2-2 tie for the
Yankees, who have won seven of their past nine games.  The host Detroit Tigers also used a late-inning home run to
snap a tie, with Brennan Boesch delivering a two-run seventh-
inning blast in an 8-6 win against the Los Angeles Angels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
