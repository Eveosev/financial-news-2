Cincinnati Reds All-Star first
baseman  Joey Votto  probably will miss three to four weeks
following surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.  Votto, 28, will undergo an arthroscopic procedure today and
be placed on the 15-day disabled list, the team said.  Votto, the National League’s 2010 Most Valuable Player, is
hitting .342 with 14 home runs and 49 runs batted in. He leads
 Major League Baseball  with 36 doubles and his 66 walks are the
most in the NL.  Todd Frazier replaced Votto at first base in last night’s
5-3 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks that snapped the Reds’ six-
game winning streak. Cincinnati, with a 50-39 record, leads the
NL Central division by one game over the Pittsburgh Pirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
