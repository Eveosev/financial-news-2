Kardan NV (KARD)  fell to the lowest close
on record after the investor in real estate and financial
services had its ratings cut by Standard & Poor’s Maalot.  The Amsterdam-based company’s  stock  dropped 5.2 percent to
2.089 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest
since July 2003 when the shares were listed in Israel.  Kardan was lowered to ilCC from ilBBB at S&P’s Maalot
yesterday, which said the liquidity profile of the company will
deteriorate as a result of a debentures buy-back plan announced
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
