Spain  may liquidate lenders that
aren’t viable as part of its European-financed overhaul of the
industry, Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde said.  “If an institution doesn’t have the strength to ensure its
future, it will have to undergo a process of orderly resolution
or liquidation,” Linde told  lawmakers  today in Madrid in his
first testimony to Parliament.  Spain is negotiating the terms of a 100 billion-euro ($123
billion) European bailout for its banks, which are still reeling
from the collapse of the debt-fueled real estate boom in 2008.
The government hasn’t liquidated any lenders, instead
restructuring and selling on the banks it has seized since 2009.
Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said on June 13
that closing down banks wouldn’t be the most efficient solution.  The draft memorandum of understanding, the agreement on the
bailout that Spain is due to sign with other euro-region nations
on July 20, says weak banks may face “restructuring and/or
resolution,” leaving open the possibility of liquidation, even
without specifically mentioning such a move.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters in  Madrid 
today he had no plans to close down any banks.  The government’s bank-bailout fund, known as FROB, has four
banks under its control. The biggest is Bankia group, which
helped prompt the European bailout request by seeking 19 billion
euros of public funds after it was nationalized in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
