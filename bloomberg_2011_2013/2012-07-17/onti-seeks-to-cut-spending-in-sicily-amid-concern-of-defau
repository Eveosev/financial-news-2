Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ,
pressing for the resignation of Sicilian Governor Raffaele Lombardo, will push for spending cuts in the region to improve
the local government’s finances.  “We’re in spending review mode,” Elisabetta Olivi, a
spokeswoman for Monti, said by telephone. “We think there are
substantial wastes and spending excesses” in Sicily’s public
accounts.  Monti’s office said earlier today in a statement that the
premier recognized “serious concerns about the possibility
Sicily could default” and wrote to Lombardo for clarification.
Sicily’s finances are “sustainable,” Lombardo said in a
subsequent statement. The Sicilian governor confirmed his
intention to resign.  To contact the reporters on this story:
