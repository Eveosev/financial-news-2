The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for May released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales declined 0.4% to $48.7 billion in May, the
fourth decrease in five months. Sales in the petroleum and coal
product industry dropped 9.6%, reflecting temporary shutdowns at
some refineries. This drop was largely offset by gains in the
aerospace product and parts industry. Excluding the petroleum
and coal product industry, total manufacturing sales rose 1.2%.  Sales fell in 13 of 21 industries, representing approximately
two-thirds of manufacturing. Sales of non-durable goods declined
3.2%, while durable goods sales rose 2.4%.  Constant dollar sales increased 0.2% in May, reflecting a rise
in the volume of durable goods sold.  Despite four monthly declines in overall manufacturing sales in
2012, manufacturing employment has continued to increase.
Employment rose 2.0% in May according to the Labour Force
Survey. Since January 2012, employment in the manufacturing
sector has risen 4.5% to 1.8 million workers.  Chart 1
Current dollar sales decrease  CSV version of the chart  Sales drop in petroleum largely offset by higher aerospace
production  Sales in the petroleum and coal product industry fell 9.6% to
$6.4 billion. The drop reflected temporary shutdowns at some
refineries and lower prices. Even with the decrease in May,
sales of petroleum and coal products were slightly higher than
they were in May 2011 ($6.3 billion).  Sales declines were also reported by manufacturers in the
machinery (-3.5%) and other transportation equipment (-26.1%)
industries.  Production in the aerospace product and parts industry rose
65.8% to $1.5 billion, following a 34.8% decrease in April.
Despite the increase in May, year-to-date production in the
industry was 6.5% lower than it was in the same period in 2011.  In the fabricated metal product industry, sales rose 2.8%. Sales
in the  motor vehicle  industry increased 1.6% to $4.6 billion,
its 10th increase in 11 months. Sales in the motor vehicle
industry were at their highest level since November 2007.  Sales decline in four provinces  Sales decreased in four provinces in May, with Ontario and
 Alberta  posting the largest declines in dollar terms.  Sales in Ontario declined 1.9% to $22.4 billion, the first
decrease following two months of increases. A 31.8% drop in
sales for petroleum and coal products was responsible for the
reduction and reflected temporary shutdowns at petroleum
refineries. However, increases in the aerospace product and
parts (+52.3%) and motor vehicle industries moderated the
decrease. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported a 1.7% rise in
sales to $4.5 billion, following a 10.0% advance in April.  In Alberta, sales fell 2.6% to $6.1 billion. The petroleum and
coal product industry was mostly responsible for the drop, with
sales down 7.7%. This was the third consecutive monthly decrease
for the industry and reflected temporary shutdowns. Sales in the
machinery industry (-4.8%) also dropped in May.  Gains in six provinces partly offset the decreases in Ontario
and Alberta. In  Quebec , sales increased 2.2%, reflecting gains
in aerospace product and parts. Production in this industry rose
85.6% in May, following a 45.6% drop in April. In  New Brunswick ,
gains in the non-durable goods industry drove the 9.0% increase
in sales.  Inventory levels rise  Inventories advanced 2.1% in May to $66.0 billion, almost
entirely as a result of a sharp increase in the petroleum and
coal product industry. With this advance, total inventories were
at their highest level since January 2009.  In the petroleum and coal product industry, total inventories
increased 29.5% (+$1.3 billion) to $5.6 billion. Over 61% of the
increase reflected higher raw materials held at a number of
refineries. Gains in goods-in-process and finished product
inventories also contributed to the advance.  Higher inventories in the motor vehicle (+6.0%) and the computer
and electronic product (+2.2%) industries also contributed to
the overall advance in May.  Chart 2
Inventory levels rise  CSV version of the chart  The inventory-to-sales ratio advanced to 1.35 in May from 1.32
in April. The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time,
in months, that would be required to exhaust inventories if
sales were to remain at their current level.  Chart 3
The inventory-to-sales ratio advances  CSV version of the chart  Unfilled orders increase  Unfilled orders rose 0.7% to $63.1 billion in May. The advance
reflected increases in the aerospace product and parts industry
and the fabricated metal products industry. A 4.7% decline in
the computer and electronic product industry offset a portion of
the gains.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, the value of
unfilled orders increased 1.8% to $31.0 billion. The increase in
May reflected a rise in the value of the US dollar relative to
the Canadian dollar, as a large portion of unfilled orders in
the industry are held in US dollars.  Unfilled orders in the fabricated metal product industry rose
2.4% to a high of $6.9 billion in May. Gains in unfilled orders
for architectural and structural metals were responsible for a
large portion of the advance in the industry.  Chart 4
Unfilled orders increase  CSV version of the chart  New orders were relatively flat in May at $49.2 billion,
following a 2.6% decrease in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
