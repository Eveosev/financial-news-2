Mali  is “thoroughly preparing”
military action to take back control of the rebel-held north,
said Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra.  The West African nation has asked “friendly countries” to
help with restructuring its armed forces including training
ground troops and replacing the chain of command, he said in a
speech on Bamako-based state television yesterday.  “We will never abandon our compatriots in the north,”
Diarra said. “What’s happening over there is a matter of
national, West African, and even global concern.”  Islamist rebels seeking to impose Sharia law are currently
in control of northern Mali after clashing with ethnic Touareg
insurgents of the National Movement for the Liberation of
Azawad. The Touaregs declared independence in April after using
a power vacuum following a March coup in Bamako to seize the
north.  Diarra said he was looking forward to proposals from the
Economic Community of West African States, which has sent a
technical team to Bamako to prepare an African-led military
intervention force. Diarra didn’t say which country should lead
the military operation.  Ecowas has urged Mali to form a national unity government
before the end of the month amid disagreement between political
and religious groups over the country’s current leadership.  A unity government will be appointed soon, Diarra said,
without giving a date. Interim President Dioncounda Traore
remains in  France  after being assaulted by protesters on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
