Uzbek authorities have suspended the
license of OAO Mobile TeleSystems’ local unit for 10 days,
starting 6 p.m. today, due to license violations, according to a
 statement  published today on the Uzbek Communications and
Information Agency website.  “MTS believes the suspension of its Uzbek company’s
license is unreasonable and violates the rights of the foreign
investor provided in domestic and international legislation,”
the Moscow-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
