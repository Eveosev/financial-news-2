Vossloh AG (VOS) ,  Germany ’s biggest
supplier of concrete railroad ties, rose to an 11-week high
after Heinz Hermann Thiele, owner of brakemaker Knorr Bremse AG,
increased his stake.  Vossloh jumped as much as 3.9 percent to 71.90 euros, the
highest intraday price since May 3, and traded up 2.1 percent at
4:25 p.m. The stock has risen for three consecutive days,
valuing the manufacturer at 942 million euros ($1.15 billion).  Thiele raised his ownership in Vossloh to 20.22 percent,
the company said in a statement yesterday. That compares with
his holding of 19.5 percent in early 2012, according to
Vossloh’s  2011 annual report .  “It is unlikely that Thiele is going to take over the
company as the Vossloh family is committed to the company as
well,” Chris Armstrong, a London-based equity sales specialist
at Berenberg Bank’s industrial unit, said today by phone. “He
needs the approval of the family.”  Thiele’s move is a “long-term strategic investment in
Vossloh,” the Werdohl, Germany-based company said in
yesterday’s statement.  Knorr Bremse is a closely held manufacturer based in
Munich. Thiele couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
