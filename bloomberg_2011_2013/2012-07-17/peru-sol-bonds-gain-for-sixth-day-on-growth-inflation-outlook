Peruvian bonds rose for a sixth day
as higher-than-forecast growth in May and speculation inflation
will slow within the central bank’s target buoyed demand for the
fixed-rate securities.  “Positive numbers have been coming out of  Peru  recently,”
said Hedmond Rios, an economist at Celfin Capital in  Lima .
Peru’s sol-denominated bonds “have proved attractive to foreign
investors amid the good local conditions, and especially given
the uncertainty in global markets.”  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.53 percent today, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. It has fallen 83 basis points since May 24. The price
rose 0.13 centimo today to 122.01 centimos per sol.  Economic activity rose 6.5 percent in May from the same
month a year earlier, after a 4.4 percent expansion in April,
the government’s statistics agency said in a July 15 report.
Economists predicted growth of 5.3 percent, according to the
median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Rios expects inflation to slow to 2.8 percent at the end of
the year, within the central bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent
target. The annual inflation rate fell to a nine-month low of 4
percent in June, according to a July 1 government report.  The sol closed little changed at 2.6195 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.6205 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit. Data from Peru’s financial regulator show that’s the
strongest level since 1997.  The central bank  bought  $113 million in the  spot market 
today to slow the sol’s advance, extending its purchases this
month to $504 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
