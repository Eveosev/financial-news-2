German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government has formally asked lawmakers to back the
recapitalization of Spanish banks through the euro region’s
financial backstops.  The  Finance Ministry  in a letter dated July 16 asked
parliament to support recapitalizations of as much as 100
billion euros ($122.8 billion) by the European Financial
Stability Facility and the transfer of the program to the future
European Stability Mechanism. The ESM won’t have preferred
creditor status for loans to  Spain ’s banks, it said.  “The financial aid is irrefutable to safeguard the
stability of the euro zone as a whole,” the ministry said in
the  letter , posted on the lower house’s Internet site. Stripping
the ESM of preferred creditor status is an “exception for this
individual case and serves to preserve Spain’s access to
markets.”  Lawmakers are due to vote on the recapitalization of
Spanish banks in the lower house of parliament in Berlin, the
Bundestag, on July 19. Merkel will get “the majority she
needs,” Steffen Seibert, her spokesman, told reporters at a
regular government press conference July 13. Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  will address lawmakers at the plenary meeting
that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
