Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
Australia’s third-biggest producer of  iron ore , said fourth-
quarter shipments rose 48 percent to a record, beating analyst
estimates, as the company expands production.  Shipments were 17.1 million metric tons in the three months
ended June 30, compared with 11.5 million tons a year earlier,
Perth-based Fortescue said today in a statement. That compares
with the 16.3 million ton median of three analysts estimates
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fortescue is planning to almost triple output capacity to
155 million tons a year by June to meet rising demand in  Asia .
The company today reported an estimated cost overrun of 7
percent for the expansion to $9 billion because of higher than
expected costs to build railroads and port facilities.  Total ore shipped rose 53 percent from a year earlier to
17.8 million tons, Fortescue said.  Fortescue rose 1.9 percent to A$4.73 at 10:15 a.m. in
Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
