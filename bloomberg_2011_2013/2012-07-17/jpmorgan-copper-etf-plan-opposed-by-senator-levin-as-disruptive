JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s plan for an
exchange-traded fund linked to copper will disrupt supplies to
the market and drive up prices to “create a bubble and burst
cycle” in the metal, Senator  Carl Levin  told regulators.  Funds backed by copper would stockpile the metal and leave
less available for industrial users, including manufacturers and
builders, Levin said in a letter dated yesterday to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Levin, a Michigan Democrat
and chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
said a proposed rule change to list and trade the firm’s JPM XF
Physical Copper Trust should be denied.  ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery.
NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext, filed
with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper Trust,
according to an April 2 document.  JPMorgan,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and ETF Securities Ltd. have said
they planned to start exchange-traded funds for industrial
metals. ETF Securities started the first exchange-traded
products backed by copper, nickel and tin in London in December
2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
