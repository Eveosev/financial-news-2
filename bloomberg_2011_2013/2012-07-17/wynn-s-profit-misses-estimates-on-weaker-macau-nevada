Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , the casino
company run by billionaire  Steve Wynn , reported second-quarter
results that missed analysts’ estimates because of lower
winnings in Macau and  Nevada .  Excluding items, profit totaled $1.38 a share, Las Vegas-
based Wynn said today in a  statement . That missed the $1.50 a
share average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 8.3 percent to $1.25 billion, shy of  estimates  of
$1.33 billion.  Wynn shares were little changed in extended trading.
Investors had been expecting worse results in Macau, according
to  Harry Curtis , an analyst at Nomura Securities International
Inc. Growth in the Chinese gambling market has slowed and
discounts offered by casino operators have increased, Wynn said
today on a conference call.  “Competition has made everyone sharpen their knives,”
said Wynn, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer.  Wynn rose 0.6 percent to $97.90 in extended trading. The
stock gained 1 percent to $97.36 at the close in  New York  and
has fallen 12 percent this year.  Net income rose 13 percent to $138.1 million, or $1.37 a
share, from $122 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. The 2011 result included a $107.5 million charge
for the company’s donation to the University of Macau
Development Foundation. That donation is part of a legal dispute
between Wynn and former Vice Chairman Kazuo Okada, who was the
largest shareholder until the company seized his stock.  Less Lucky  Wynn’s results in Macau and Nevada were affected by a lower
“hold,” the percentage of bets that casinos keep.  The company’s Macau revenue fell 7.1 percent to $907.6
million. Profit in Macau, or property earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, declined 3.9 percent to
$302.2 million.  Las Vegas  revenue tumbled 12 percent to $345.6 million,
while earnings there declined 38 percent to $81.9 million.  Industry results reported for Las Vegas and Macau had
suggested Wynn would miss Wall Street estimates, Rachael Rothman, a casino analyst with Susquehanna International Group
in New York, said in a research note today. She recommends
buying Wynn shares.  Total gambling revenue on the  Las Vegas Strip , where Wynn
operates its namesake and Encore resorts, tumbled 18 percent in
May to $475.1 million as casinos kept the lowest percentage of
blackjack bets there ever, according to the state’s Gaming
Control Board.  Casino revenue in Macau, where Wynn operates one resort and
plans another, rose 12 percent in June, according to the city’s
Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That was below the 15
percent median estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
