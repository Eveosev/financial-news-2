About 900 farmers in  Nebraska  will
have to stop irrigating crops as the state’s Department of
Natural Resources regulates the amount of water taken from
streams and rivers.  About 1,106 appropriations, or permits giving farmers
access to water from state streams and rivers, were affected
because of dry weather, Brian Dunnigan, the state agency’s
director, said today in a telephone interview. Some growers have
more than one permit, he said.  “Given the dry weather, that’s when we see water
appropriations being regulated,” Dunnigan said. “In Nebraska,
we regulate the surface water.”  Corn futures on the  Chicago  Board of Trade have soared 52
percent since the middle of June as drought curbs production in
the Midwest. Nebraska is the third-biggest U.S. producer. Five
percent of the normal amount of rain fell in parts of the state
in the past 30 days, according to the  National Weather Service .  Iowa is the top U.S. corn producer, followed by Illinois,
Department of Agriculture data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
