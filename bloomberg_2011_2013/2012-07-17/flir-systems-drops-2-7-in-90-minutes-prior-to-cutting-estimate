Flir Systems Inc. (FLIR)  declined 2.7
percent in the last 90 minutes of trading yesterday, sending the
stock to the biggest intraday retreat in almost three months
just before the company cut its earnings estimate.  The maker of night-vision cameras fell as low as $18.19 in
the last half hour from $18.70 at 2:30 p.m.  New York  time. The
loss for the day reached 3.1 percent, the biggest intraday slump
since April 27. Nine minutes after the market’s close, the
company lowered its 2012 forecasts.  “It would almost certainly seem suspicious,”  Mark Turner ,
head of U.S. sales trading at New York-based Instinet Inc.,
which accounts for almost 5 percent of daily U.S. equities
volume, said in an e-mail. “While we have no evidence or inside
knowledge, it would have appeared that the guidance news could
have been leaked.”  The  profit warning  from Flir comes at the start of the
second-quarter earnings season with more than half of Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index companies scheduled to report results in the
next two weeks. Shares of the Wilsonville, Oregon-based
manufacturer have tumbled 51 percent since reaching a three-year
high of $37.04 in May 2011.  Flir’s Chief Financial Officer Tony Trunzo declined to
comment on the stock’s trading. Wayne Lee and Robert Madden,
spokesmen at Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., didn’t respond to phone
calls and e-mails seeking comment.  Weak Demand  Flir said weak demand for products used in building
maintenance and recreational marine products such as night-
vision equipment used by operators of yachts, particularly in
 Europe , hurt second-quarter sales and profit.  The company cut its 2012 sales projection to a range of
$1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, compared with an April forecast of
at least $1.55 billion. Profit will be $1.40 to $1.50 a share,
compared with the earlier estimate of at least $1.60, Flir said.
Analysts, on average, expect full-year profit of $1.63 a share
on sales of $1.55 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg prior to the announcement.  The  stock  fell 2.3 percent, or 44 cents, to $18.33
yesterday in regular trading before being halted on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. Flir lost 1.3 percent to $18.10 at 10:26 a.m. New
York time today.  James Ricchiuti, a New York-based analyst at Needham & Co.,
said the announcement wasn’t surprising based on the prospects
for weaker earnings. He has a hold rating on Flir.  “The stock was down 44 cents,” he said in a telephone
interview. “I don’t think that was all that much. It came with
the market move.”  Global Economy  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  declined 0.2 percent yesterday after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its global economic forecast and
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell. The index retreated less
than 0.1 percent to 1,352.81 today after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said progress in reducing unemployment
is likely to be “frustratingly slow.”  Flir last year cut its annual profit forecast on July 22
before the market opened and the stock climbed 0.3 percent
during the day.  “I don’t think it was predictable that they would lower it
specifically today,” Jonathan Ho, a Chicago-based analyst at
William Blair & Co. said in an e-mail. “It was somewhat
expected as investor sentiment had been that they would revise
it lower given the headwinds they faced in both their
businesses.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
