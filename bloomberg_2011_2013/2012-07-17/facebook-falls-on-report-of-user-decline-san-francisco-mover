Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
world’s largest social-network, declined after a report from
Capstone Investments said the number of users fell over the past
six months.  The  shares  of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook
decreased 0.6 percent to $28.09 at the close in New York, adding
to a 8.1 percent slide yesterday. Shares of  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , which
gets most of its revenue from games played on Facebook, dropped
5.2 percent to $4.58.  U.S. users decreased 1.1 percent over the past six months,
Rory Maher, an analyst at Capstone, said in a report today. Of
23 countries where Facebook had at least 50 percent market
penetration, growth was little changed or down in 14 nations
over the past three months, he said.  “This could be an issue for Facebook growth since we
estimate that outside of  Southeast Asia  and some countries in
Latin America, most markets are approaching 50 percent
penetration,” Maher said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
