World soccer ruling body FIFA named
former United States attorney  Michael Garcia  as main prosecutor
in an ethics probe.  FIFA also named German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to chair a
judicial body as part of its plans to combat corruption. The
moves were announced at a FIFA news conference in Zurich.  The appointments follow the release of court papers on a
kickbacks scandal and allegations of vote-buying surrounding
the selection of World Cup hosts.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
