The U.K.  Competition Commission  said
its antitrust probe into  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ’s 30-percent stake
in competing carrier  Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  will continue during
the airline’s lawsuit in Britain to block the investigation.  Ryanair, which started a bid last month to buy the rest of
Aer Lingus for 694 million euros ($853 million), sued to block
the watchdog from investigating the minority stake it acquired
six years ago, arguing it would now overlap with a possible
merger probe by the European Union’s competition regulator.  The Competition Commission corrected today a statement it
made yesterday that the investigation would effectively be put
on hold during the lawsuit at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in
London, due to an expected lack of cooperation from Ryanair.  The probe “will continue in the meantime, although clearly
we’ll be restricted by the fact that Ryanair is unlikely to play
any part until the judgment,” Rory Taylor, a spokesman for the
regulator, said in an e-mail.  The two carriers, both based in Dublin, carry more than 80
percent of the 370,000 passengers that travel between the U.K.
and Ireland each month, regulators have said. The probe started
after another U.K. regulator, the  Office of Fair Trading ,
flagged it for review, saying the Ryanair stake could lead to
higher prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
