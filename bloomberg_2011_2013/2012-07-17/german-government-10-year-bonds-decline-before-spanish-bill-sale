Austria ’s bonds rose, with two-year
yields falling below zero for the first time, and French
borrowing costs also dropped to the least on record as investors
sought safer assets offering higher returns than German debt.  Spanish bonds fell as the nation sold 364- and 511-day
securities. German two-year  note yields  dropped to a record as a
government report showed investor confidence in Europe’s largest
economy declined to a six-month low in July.  “It’s a story of the semi-core countries such as Austria,
 France  and  Belgium ,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC
Bank NV in Brussels. “German yields below zero are a sign for
many investors to give up some safety for the higher yields they
can find in the semi core. The safety of these bonds is good
enough in comparison to  Spain  and  Italy .”  Austria’s  two-year yield  fell as much as three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to a record minus 0.018
percent before being little changed at 0.02 percent at 10:21
a.m. London time. The 4.3 percent note maturing in July 2014 was
at 108.50.  France’s two-year yield slipped three basis points to 0.051
percent after falling to an all-time low of 0.046 percent.  Austria, which was stripped of its AAA rating by Standard &
Poor’s this year, has the lowest unemployment in the European
Union and has a ratio of debt to gross domestic product of 72
percent, beaten only by the Netherlands,  Finland  and Spain among
major economies sharing the euro. The nation still holds a top
rating at  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s Investors Service.  German Confidence  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, fell to
minus 19.6, the lowest since January.  Germany ’s two-year yield was at minus 0.047 percent after
falling to minus 0.061 percent, the lowest level since Bloomberg
began tracking the securities in 1990.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bund rose two basis to
1.26 percent. It declined to a record 1.127 percent on June 1.  Germany’s  borrowing costs  have plunged over the past year
as investors sought the nation’s debt as a haven from  Europe ’s
financial turmoil. Bonds from other European countries perceived
as safer than the so-called periphery have also gained as
investors sought alternatives to negative returns.  Spain sold 3.56 billion euros ($4.38 billion) of bills,
surpassing its maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. Demand for
the 12-month securities was 2.23 times the amount sold, compared
with 2.16 times in June, while the bid-to-cover ratio for the
18-month bills was 3.66 compared with 4.42.  The Spanish two-year bond yield increased five basis points
to 4.7 percent.  Germany will auction 5 billion euros of two-year notes
tomorrow, which may be sold at a negative yield for the first
time. The  nation  auctioned two-year securities at a record-low
yield of 0.07 percent on May 23.  German debt has returned 4.2 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities have lost 5.2
percent, with Belgian bonds making 12 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
