from an April estimate of 4.1 percent. U.S. retail sales fell
for a third month, dropping 0.5 percent in June from a year
earlier. China’s State Council may this week give details of
easing measures to support growth, Nomura Holdings Inc. said
yesterday.  “The weak U.S. retail sales have spurred hopes of
quantitative easing,” said Kenix Lai, a currency analyst at
Bank of East Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “Investors are also
betting China will announce more stimulus measures and economic
growth could regain momentum in the second half.”  The ringgit rallied 0.5 percent to 3.1650 per dollar as of
4:11 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. South Korea’s won closed 0.3 percent stronger at

day, while its 60-day historical volatility was steady at 3.71
percent. The Dollar Index fell 0.1 percent on concern that more
money-printing for bond purchases would weaken the greenback.

today. That compares with an 8 percent estimate in the Reserve
Bank of India’s annual report for 2009-2010 and 8.5 percent
before the onset of the global financial crisis, he said.  “Markets are getting a bit ahead of themselves and are
pushing into a higher chance of QE3 sooner rather than later,”
said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. Investors “are looking for real returns
elsewhere” as the greenback weakened, he said.  Fed Chairman Bernanke will address the outlook for the
economy when he delivers his semi-annual monetary policy report
