U.K. dairy farmers need to be able
to negotiate shorter-term milk supply contracts with processors
in order to stave off losses, and the government should
intervene to support farmers if the two sides can’t come to an
agreement, said Mansel Raymond, chairman of the National Farmers
Union’s dairy board.  Many U.K. dairy farmers are locked into 12-month supply
contracts with processors that have announced cuts in milk
payments starting in August, Raymond told Parliament’s
environment, food and rural affairs committee today in  London .
British dairy farmers will lose about 5 pence (8 cents) on every
liter (2.1 pints) of milk they produce when the cuts go into
effect, said Raymond, who’s also a farmer from Pembrokeshire,
Wales.  Dairy Crest Group Plc (DCG)  will allow its farmers to sign three-
month contracts, Mike Sheldon, group milk procurement director
for the company, told the committee. The move may not ensure
profitability for farmers because “it wouldn’t change what’s
going on in commodity prices,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
