Berlin’s city government voted today
to acquire  RWE AG (RWE) ’s stake in BWB Wasserbetriebe for 618 million
euros ($755 million) to raise its holding in  Germany ’s largest
water company to 75.05 percent.  The transaction for the second-biggest German utility’s
24.95 percent stake in BWB is effective retroactive to Jan. 1,
subject to approval of parliament, the city-state said in a
statement. Berlin’s finance ministry said its agreements with
 Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the world’s largest water utility that
owns the balance of BWB, remain unchanged.  In 1999, France’s Veolia and RWE acquired 49.9 percent of
the Berlin water utility. City officials have sought to regain
control of the 150-year-old water supplier to curb high costs
for Berlin consumers. Veolia has been trying to cut the Paris-
based waste and water utility’s debt, selling a U.K. unit to a
Morgan Stanley-backed venture last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
