China  and the U.S. agreed that
greater climate-protection efforts are needed before a binding
global treaty comes into force in 2020, joining nations at a
meeting in Germany to acknowledge current pledges fall short.  Delegates from about 35 governments agreed that countries’
voluntary commitments to cut emissions are insufficient to limit
global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and nations
shouldn’t wait until a treaty is ready, German Environment
Minister  Peter Altmaier  told reporters in Berlin today.  “We need a higher level of ambition before 2020,”
Altmaier said after hosting the two-day meeting, which was aimed
at preparing for a United Nations summit later this year in
Qatar. “We urgently need additional climate-protection
measures.”  Envoys from more than 190 governments who met in Durban,
 South Africa , in December agreed to discuss replacing the  Kyoto
Protocol , which sets emission targets only for developed states.
The U.S. never accepted Kyoto because it excluded fast-expanding
economies such as China, the biggest polluter, and has joined
calls to devise a new treaty that will take effect by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
