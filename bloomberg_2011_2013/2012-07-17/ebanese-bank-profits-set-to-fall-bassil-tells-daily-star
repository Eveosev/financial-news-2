Lebanese bank profits will drop by 5
percent to 10 percent this year because of the turmoil in  Syria 
and local political tensions, Francois Bassil, the chairman of
Byblos Bank, told the  Daily Star .  Some leading lenders saw profits fall in the first quarter,
Bassil told the newspaper. He said most banks have increased
provisions for non-performing loans since the crisis in Syria
began in March last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
