Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  rose to an all-time
closing high after Bank of America Corp. recommended buying the
stock because fiscal 2013 profit estimates may be too low.  Disney added 3.1 percent to $49.35 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain in four months. The shares have advanced
32 percent this year, re-establishing the record high most
recently on July 2.  Bank of America’s earnings estimate of $3.62 a share for
the year that starts in October is 15 cents higher than the
average on Wall Street, analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said in a
research note. Profit may be driven higher by the company’s
theme parks, improving film studio and interactive unit, and
cable networks, she said.  In June, the company opened Cars Land at California
Adventure in Anaheim, California, after raising theme-park
ticket prices. Cars Land, along with lower launch costs at the
parks unit, may add 10 cents in fiscal 2013, Cohen said.  “Marvel’s the Avengers,” the movie based on comic-book
heroes such as The Hulk,  Iron Man  and Thor, has generated $613.7
million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales for Disney since May 4
and $1.46 billion worldwide, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. The film, third in revenue all-time to  James Cameron ’s
“Avatar” and “Titanic,” countered “ John Carter ,” which
lost $200 million for Disney this year.  “Avengers” may add 11 cents a share to Disney’s profit
this year, Cohen said. She told clients to buy the stock,
increasing her recommendation from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
