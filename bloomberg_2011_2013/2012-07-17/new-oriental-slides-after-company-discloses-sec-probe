New Oriental Education & Technology
Group Inc. (EDU) , a Chinese test prep and online-education provider,
fell the most since 2008 after it said the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission was looking into its financial statements.  New Orientalâ€™s  U.S. shares  fell as much as 33 percent in
intraday trading in  New York , and were down 29 percent to $15.90
at 10:16 a.m. Before today, the shares had dropped 7.4 percent
this year.  The investigation may concern whether the company
appropriately consolidated the earnings of Beijing New Oriental
Education & Technology, a variable interest entity, into its
statement, New Oriental said today in a quarterly earnings
statement. The Beijing-based company said it received the SEC
notice July 13 and that it intended to cooperate with the
investigation.  New Oriental is the largest provider of private education
services in  China , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
