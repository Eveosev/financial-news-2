The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development approved a 10 million-euro ($12.3 million)
 credit line  for micro, small and medium-sized businesses in
Serbia.  The loan will “assist  Erste Bank (EBS)  Serbia in meeting demand
from private sector enterprises for short-, medium- and longer-
term loans,” the London-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement.  At least 60 percent of the credit line is intended for
businesses outside the Serbian capital, Belgrade, to support the
companies that “are facing limited access to financing for
their development and growth,” the EBRD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
