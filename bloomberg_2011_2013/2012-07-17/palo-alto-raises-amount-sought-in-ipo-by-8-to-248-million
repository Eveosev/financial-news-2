Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) , the
provider of Internet firewalls to businesses, increased the
amount it’s seeking in its initial public offering this week by
8 percent, to $248 million.  The Santa Clara, California-based company and existing
owners plan to sell 6.2 million shares for $38 to $40 each after
earlier offering them for $34 to $37, according to a  filing  with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.  Palo Alto filed to raised its  price range  after people with
knowledge of the share sale said last week the company had
received more than enough orders to cover the offering. The IPO
is scheduled to price on July 19 along with sales by  Kayak
Software Corp. (KYAK) , Five Below Inc. and  Fender Musical Instruments
Corp. (FNDR) , making it the busiest day for U.S. initial offers since
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The midpoint of Palo Alto’s higher offering range would
value the company at about $2.6 billion, or 12 times sales of
$220 million in the 12 months through April 30, according to
Bloomberg data. That’s more than double the average multiple of
5.7 for similar-sized  peers  such as Juniper Networks Inc., Check
Point Software Technologies Ltd. and Sourcefire Inc., the data
show.  The company, founded in 2005, is offering 4.69 million
shares, while existing holders are offering 1.5 million,
regulatory filings show. Venture firms  Greylock Partners  and
 Sequoia Capital  aren’t selling shares and combined will own more
than 41 percent of the company after the IPO.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
are leading Palo Alto’s sale. The shares will be listed on the
 New York  Stock Exchange under the symbol PANW.  To contact the reporter on this story:
