Mexico ’s peso rallied to a two-month
high as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told U.S.
lawmakers that the central bank is prepared to act to boost
growth if labor markets don’t improve.  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 13.1579 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. It earlier touched 13.1516 in intraday
trading, the strongest level since May 7. The currency has
gained 5.9 percent this year.  Most major emerging-market currencies including the peso
rose as Bernanke signaled in congressional testimony that he is
concerned about the economic recovery and doesn’t view inflation
as a hindrance to more monetary stimulus.  The peso rose because “there’s some probability that we
could see some additional stimulus,”  Mario Copca , a currency
strategist at Metanalisis SA, said in a telephone interview in
Mexico City. Investors are “very conscious that the labor
sector is advancing at a rhythm that’s much slower” than policy
makers want, he said.  The peso declined earlier after Bernanke’s prepared remarks
disappointed investors by not including specific steps that the
central bank would take to spur growth. The U.S. is the
destination for 80 percent of Mexican exports.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 was
little changed at 5.26 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price dropped 0.01 centavo to 143.12 centavos per
peso.  Mexico sold all 6 billion pesos ($456 million) of 28-day
Cetes and 7 billion pesos of the 91-day securities offered
today, the central bank said on its website. Mexico also sold
all 9 billion pesos in 175-day bills it auctioned, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
