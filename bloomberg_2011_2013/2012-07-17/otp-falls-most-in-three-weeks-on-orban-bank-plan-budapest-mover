OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, fell the most in three weeks after Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban  said Hungarian ownership in the financial industry should
be at least 50 percent.  The shares dropped 2.3 percent to 3,452 forint by the close
in Budapest, the biggest slide since June 25. The benchmark BUX
stock index rose 0.3 percent to 17,275.91.  Hungary wants to boost local control in banks and is
proposing a non-profit model for utility companies to build a
“new economic system,” Orban told business leaders in Budapest
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
