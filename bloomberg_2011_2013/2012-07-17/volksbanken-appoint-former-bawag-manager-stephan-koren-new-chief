Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) , the
Austrian lender partially nationalized earlier this year,
appointed Stephan Koren Chief Executive Officer as of Sept. 1.  It also appointed Rainer Borns as Chief Operating Officer,
Vienna-based Volksbanken said in a statement today.  Koren, 54, was deputy CEO of Bawag PSK Bank until 2011 and
currently is the chairman of the agency that manages Austria’s
nationalized banks and state aid.  Austria owns 43 percent of Volksbanken after a bailout
agreed in February, with 62 local banks still owning a majority
stake in the lender, which once was the country’s fourth-
biggest. The bank has been led by Deputy CEO Michael Mendel
since May, when the term of then CEO Gerald Wenzel expired.  Koren comes from  Austria ’s most famous banking families,
with his father, who shares his name, heading the country’s
central bank for 10 years until his death in 1988 and and his
sister Elisabeth Bleyleben-Koren serving as deputy CEO of Erste
Group Bank AG for nine years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
