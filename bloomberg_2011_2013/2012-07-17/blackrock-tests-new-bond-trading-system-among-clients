BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
money manager, tested its bond-trading network last week among
some clients.  The test involved matching client orders on the firm’s
Aladdin network and didn’t require the participation of dealers,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
matter is private.  BlackRock, which manages $3.68 trillion in assets, said in
April it was starting a bond-trading platform that would match
clients’ orders using its own system, rather than relying on
Wall Street firms or other electronic networks to trade bonds.
The platform may shut off a source of revenue for investment
banks, which have seen fees from trading bonds for money
managers decline amid  interest rates  near record lows and
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “The system is designed to enhance liquidity for our
clients and future testing will include third-party dealer
participation, as necessary, to achieve that,” Bobbie Collins,
a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm, said. Further testing
will continue periodically until the network’s formal launch,
Collins said.  The service is open to clients who use the Aladdin
investment-management system. BlackRock Solutions, the unit that
advises financial institutions and governments on hard-to-value-
assets, was selected by the U.S. in 2008 to oversee tainted
holdings at the peak of the financial crisis.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that
BlackRock had tested its bond-trading system without telling
securities dealers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
