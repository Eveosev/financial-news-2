OCI Co. (010060)  led declines among South
Korean solar-cell companies after media reports said the Chinese
government began investigating sales of Korean-made polysilicon
in  China  on suspicions of dumping.  OCI, South Korea’s biggest maker of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make most solar panels, fell as much as 6.1
percent before closing 3.5 percent lower at 204,500 won, its
lowest since June 12, on the Korea Exchange today. South Korea’s
benchmark Kospi index rose 0.2 percent.  China’s Ministry of Commerce notified the South Korean
Embassy that it’s collecting preliminary data to check whether
Korean-made products were dumped in sufficient quantities to
hurt competition with those made in China, the Edaily reported
yesterday, citing industry officials.  The South Korean government is aware its Chinese
counterpart is conducting a preliminary probe into the sale of
Korean products, an official at the South Korean Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs  and Trade said today by phone, declining to be
identified because the matter is confidential.  China accounts for about half of OCI’s overseas sales of
polysilicon, an official at the Seoul-based company said today
by phone, adding it hasn’t been notified of any probe.  Woongjin Energy Co. (103130) , which makes silicon ingots and wafers,
ended 0.4 percent lower at 5,080, recouping some losses after
dropping as much as 2.8 percent.  KCC Corp. (002380) , which produces
polysilicon, closed 0.5 percent higher at 281,500 won after
earlier falling as much as 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
