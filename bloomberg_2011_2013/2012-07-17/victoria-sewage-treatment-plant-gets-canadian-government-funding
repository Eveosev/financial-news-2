Canada ’s federal government will
contribute about a third of the funding to help build a C$783
million ($771 million) wastewater treatment plant in British
Columbia and reduce marine pollution.  The funding of the greater Victoria area sewage facility
and a biosolids plant at the Hartland landfill that will convert
solid waste to energy means the quality of municipal wastewater
discharged into the Strait of Juan de Fuca will be “vastly
improved,” the government said in a statement.  Construction of the wastewater plant may begin by the end
of the year. The province has pledged as much as C$248 million
for the project, which will also include infrastructure
upgrades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
