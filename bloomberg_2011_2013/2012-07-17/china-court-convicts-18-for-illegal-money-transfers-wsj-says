A court in the Chinese city of
Chongqing convicted 18 people of smuggling almost $10 billion
through illegal bank transfers, the Wall Street Journal
 reported , citing a lawyer involved in the case.  The group used fake electronics companies and bank accounts
to help clients evade  capital controls , the newspaper said,
citing prosecutors it didn’t name. The ringleader, a 36-year-old
former electronics saleswoman, was sentenced to six years in
prison and fined more than 3 million yuan ($470,000), according
to an unnamed attorney cited by the Journal.  Two phone calls by Bloomberg News to the prosecutor’s
office in Chongqing’s Jiulongpo district went unanswered. A
woman who answered the phone at the research division of the
district court said she couldn’t confirm the conviction unless a
case number was supplied.  Local prosecutors charged 18 people with illegally moving
62 billion  yuan  through shell companies in 2007-2011, Xinhua
 reported  in February.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
