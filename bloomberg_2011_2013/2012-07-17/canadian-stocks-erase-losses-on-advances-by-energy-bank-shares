Canadian stocks erased losses as
gains in energy and financial companies offset declines in
mining shares.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index rose 18.94
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,540.12 at 12:09 p.m. in Toronto.
It fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
