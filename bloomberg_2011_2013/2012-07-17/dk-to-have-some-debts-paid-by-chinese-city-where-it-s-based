LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of wafers that convert sunlight to power, will
have part of its debts paid by the government of the Chinese
city in which it is based.  The city of Xinyu in eastern  China ’s Jiangxi province has
decided to include the repayment of LDK Solar’s loans from
Huarong International Trust and Investment Corp. in the
municipal government’s annual fiscal budget, according to a
 statement  on the website of the National People’s Congress, the
nation’s top legislative body. Xinyu’s local legislature has
approved the plan, according to the statement dated July 13,
which didn’t say how much the city would pay.  LDK said in a May filing that it might be unable to remain
a “going concern” if it can’t improve access to funds. The
company announced a first-quarter  net loss  of $185.2 million on
June 26.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
