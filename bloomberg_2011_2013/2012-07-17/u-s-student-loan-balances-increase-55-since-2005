The average loan balance for U.S.
college students has increased 55 percent to $24,301 since 2005,
according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  The number of student loan borrowers increased 59 percent
to 37.1 million in the first quarter from the same period seven
years ago, according to data released today and posted on the
bankâ€™s  website . While 68 percent of borrowers are 39 and
younger, the number for people ages 50 to 59 doubled to 4.6
million. Those 60 and over tripled to 2.2 million.  Outstanding U.S. educational debt reached $1 trillion
earlier this year, topping the amount Americans owe on their
credit cards, according to the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau. More students are borrowing to pay for college and are
taking out larger amounts as tuition costs have climbed faster
than the rate of inflation.  The New York Fed report is based a sample of data provided
by the  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  credit bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
