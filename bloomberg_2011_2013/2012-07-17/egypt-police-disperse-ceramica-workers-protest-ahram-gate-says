Egyptian police fired tear gas to
disperse hundreds of workers from Ceramica Cleopatra Group as
they stormed government buildings in the city of Suez, Ahram
Gate reported.  Workers broke into Suez administration buildings to protest
what they consider the government’s neglect over their battle
with the Ceramica Cleopatra Chairman Mohamed Abou El Enein, the
state-run news website reported.  Abou El Enein, a former member of ousted president  Hosni
Mubarak ’s party, has said he plans to sell all his assets in the
country after the public prosecutor banned him from travel due
to the labor dispute.  The prosecutor’s office, in a July 5 statement, said it’s
investigating allegations that Ceramica Cleopatra violated a
collective labor agreement, withheld pay and tried to stop
workers from doing their jobs.  The producer of tiles and sanitary ware employed 12,000
workers and exported to more than 100 countries as of 2008,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
