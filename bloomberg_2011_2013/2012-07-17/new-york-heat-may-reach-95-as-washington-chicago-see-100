Temperatures in  New York City  may
reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius)  and 100 in Chicago,
Philadelphia and Washington as a heat wave sets more records and
pushes up energy consumption.  New York ’s temperature may feel like 100 today and as much
as 104 tomorrow, said  Tim Morrin , a National Weather Service
meteorologist in Upton, New York.  “We have the heat advisory in effect for today through 8
p.m. on Wednesday, so it is an ongoing hazard,” Morrin said by
telephone. “It will be the fourth heat wave for the city this
summer. We don’t get that every summer.”  Temperatures in New York City have reached 90 seven times
this month and 12 times since June 1, according to  Weather
Service  records. The July average going back to 1870 is 6.1 and
the annual average is 14.9, Weather Service records show.  Temperatures in the 90s to 100s in the large cities of the
eastern U.S. and Canada create high electricity demand because
people turn to air conditioning to cool down. The result can be
increased prices on the  spot market , as well as an increase in
natural gas because 32 percent of U.S. power plants use that
fuel to generate electricity.  Electric use tends to peak late in the day as people return
from work and cool their homes, turn on appliances and cook
meals, according to  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives
in Belton,  Missouri .  Energy Demand  Salmon predicts energy use may increase by 10 to 30 percent
along the U.S. East Coast and 30 to 60 percent across the
Midwest from July 18 to July 24.  The high temperatures are also drying out crops in parts of
the Midwest.  Corn futures touched a 13-month high in Chicago yesterday
as damage from the worst U.S. drought in a generation stoked
concern that yields will drop. The Department of Agriculture cut
its ratings for U.S. corn conditions for a sixth week yesterday.  Since July 1, 2,946 daily high temperature records, or 3.2
percent of the total, were set or tied across the U.S.,
according to the  National Climatic Data Center  in Asheville,
 North Carolina .  Heat advisories and warnings cover parts of 19 states from
 Kansas  to Massachusetts.  Toronto may reach 99 today, while Montreal’s high is
expected to be 84, according to  Environment Canada.   Storms Ahead  A line of potentially severe thunderstorms may signal a
drop in temperatures to more seasonal levels starting tomorrow
in the Northeast, Morrin said.  New York,  Pennsylvania  and southern New England, including
Boston, have a 15 percent chance of severe storms with damaging
winds and hail starting later tomorrow, according to the U.S.
 Storm Prediction Center  in Norman,  Oklahoma .  Temperatures of at least 3 to 4 degrees above normal are
expected to persist across the northern U.S., Ontario and Quebec
through next week, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Iowa and neighboring states may have
temperatures 8 to 14 degrees above normal from July 22 to 26.  The Northeast may cool to seasonal levels July 27 to July
31, while the Midwest remains 5 to 7 degrees above normal,
according to MDA.  For July 24, the normal average temperature is 78 in New
York. It’s 74 in Boston; 80 in  Washington ; 85 in Houston; 74 in
Chicago; 80 in Atlanta; 67 in  Seattle  and 75 in Burbank,
California, according to MDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
