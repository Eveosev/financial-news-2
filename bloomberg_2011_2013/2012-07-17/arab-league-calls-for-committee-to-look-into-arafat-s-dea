The  Arab League  is calling for the
establishment of an independent, neutral committee to look into
the death of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Egypt’s
state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  The league, meeting in Cairo, said the committee should
include prominent figures who would work in cooperation with the
 Palestinian Authority , Arab and international institutions, the
agency reported.  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas earlier this
month given permission to exhume and examine the remains of
Arafat. The move came after Al-Jazeera television said Swiss
experts have discovered traces in Arafat’s clothes of the
radioactive isotope polonium, which could have poisoned him.  Arafat, who died in a Paris hospital in 2004, is buried in
the West Bank city of  Ramallah .  To contact the reporter on this story:
