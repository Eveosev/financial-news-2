Dutch authorities will start an
eradication campaign against the tiger mosquito after finding
the insect, a native of  Southeast Asia  that can spread tropical
diseases including dengue fever, in the southern Netherlands.  Seven tiger mosquitoes were found at a used-tire trading
company in the village of Heijningen on July 5, the Dutch food-
safety authority wrote in a  statement  on its website today. That
follows an eradication effort against an exotic mosquito species
in the same area two years ago, it said.  Tiger mosquitoes were found in  Italy  in 1990 and the insect
is now the main pest mosquito in northern parts of the country,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The  mosquito , whose Latin name is Aedes albopictus,
is an epidemic vector for dengue viruses in parts of  Asia , based
on CDC data.  “The Asian tiger mosquito is unwelcome in the Netherlands
because it can transmit infectious disease,” the authority
wrote. “The tiger mosquito mainly stings during the day, and
its bite can be painful.”  Authorities said they’ll spray  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Aqua-K-Othrine
insecticide in a 200-meter (219-yard) radius around where the
mosquitoes were found and remove suitable breeding spots or
apply larvae-killing chemicals in a 500-meter radius.  Tiger mosquitoes breed in artificial pools with standing
water, such as used tires, vases and sewer drains, the food-
safety authority said. Larger water surfaces such as canals and
lakes aren’t suitable breeding grounds, it said.  “The Asian tiger mosquito is mainly spread through
international trade in used tires,” the authority wrote. “In
this way the tiger mosquito has by now established itself in
parts of southern  Europe .”  The species was first found in the U.S. in  Texas  in 1985,
and is now believed to be established in 26 states of the
continental U.S., according to the CDC. .  The chance that the found mosquitoes are disease carriers
is “extremely small,” and eradication is taking place to avoid
permanent establishment of the insect in the Netherlands,
according to the authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
