Burundi is facing a shortfall of
nearly a fifth of its electricity demand because of a shortage
of rainwater to run hydropower dams, the East African nation’s
power and water distribution company Regideso said.  The neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo has cut
exports to Burundi by 3 megawatts, and a local water shortage
means Burundi’s own production will be diminished by 5
megawatts, Regideso spokesman Augustin Baruvuza told reporters
today in Bujumbura, the capital.  As a result, rationing will start from tomorrow with
certain areas receiving electricity from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and
others from 3 p.m. until 10 p.m. Only public facilities like
hospitals, universities and airports will have power after 10
p.m., he said.  Burundi produces 32 megawatts and imports the remaining 15
megawatts from neighboring countries, mainly Congo. The
government is in talks with  India ,  Israel ,  Norway  and  China  to
develop its power industry and triple consumption with 13 years.
Burundi’s electrification rate is 2.5 percent to 3 percent of
its population of 8 million, Baruvuza said.  Burundi, Congo and Rwanda plan to build the 145-megawatt
Ruzizi III dam along their common borders, although none has the
money to start the construction, Baruvuza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
