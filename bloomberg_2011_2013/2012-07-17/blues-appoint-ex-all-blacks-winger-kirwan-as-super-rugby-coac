Former All Blacks winger John Kirwan
was appointed as head coach of the Blues Super Rugby team on a
two-year contract, the  New Zealand  Rugby Union said.  Kirwan, 47, replaces Pat Lam as coach of the Auckland-based
franchise, which finished bottom of the New Zealand Conference
last weekend after winning four of its 16 regular-season games.  Kirwan, who played 63 Tests for New Zealand before coaching
the Italy and Japan national teams, will take over a squad that
finished 12th in the Super Rugby standings, the Blues’ worst
placing in the 17 editions of southern hemisphere rugby’s top
provincial competition.  “It’s been a tough season,” Blues Chairman Gary Whetton
said in a statement. “Our supporters expect the team to play
winning rugby, as we all do. The challenge is clearly laid down
for John and we look forward to seeing positive results.”  The Blues, whose roster includes 2011 World Cup-winning All
Blacks  Tony Woodcock ,  Piri Weepu , Ma’a Nonu and  Keven Mealamu ,
won the most recent of their three southern hemisphere
championships in 2003. They reached the semifinals last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
