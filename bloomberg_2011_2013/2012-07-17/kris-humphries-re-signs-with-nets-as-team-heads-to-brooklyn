Kris Humphries will re-sign with the
Brooklyn Nets after averaging career highs in points and
rebounds last season during the team’s final campaign in  New
Jersey .  The 27-year-old forward agreed to a new deal, the Nets said
in a statement without disclosing terms. The contract is worth
$24 million over two years, ESPN reported, citing a person
familiar with the situation.  “Kris has been a very consistent player for us over the
past two years,” Nets General Manager Billy King said in a
statement. “He has developed into one of the top rebounding
forwards in the league and we are very pleased to welcome him
back.”  Humphries, 6-foot-9, averaged 13.8 points and 11 rebounds
in 62 games last season, which was shortened to 66 games from 82
because of a work stoppage.  Having re-signed guard  Deron Williams  and center Brook Lopez, the Nets also traded for All-Star guard  Joe Johnson 
during the offseason. Humphries was to be part of an attempted
trade that would have sent All-Star  Dwight Howard  to the Nets
from the Orlando Magic, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
