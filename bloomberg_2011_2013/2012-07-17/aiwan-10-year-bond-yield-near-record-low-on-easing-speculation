Taiwan ’s government bonds were
little changed, with the 10-year yield near a record low, on
speculation the central bank will ease monetary policy. The
local dollar gained for a second day.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  completed the biggest
two-day drop in more than three years yesterday after the  Bank
of Korea  unexpectedly reduced borrowing costs on July 12.
Taiwan’s export orders dropped 2.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, the fourth monthly decline, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due
July 20. The island’s central bank kept its benchmark rate at
1.875 percent last month, and will review it again in September.  “Taiwan and  South Korea  have very similar economic
structures and the central bank might want to make sure the
island’s exporters remain competitive,” said  James Wang , a debt
trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “The central bank
might let the overnight rate fall even more, together with other
measures, to boost liquidity.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
1.152 percent, compared with 1.151 percent yesterday, as of 9:51
a.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate
reached 1.138 percent on July 13, the lowest for  benchmark  10-
year notes since Bloomberg starting tracking the data in 2002.
The island will sell NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of five-year
securities today.  The overnight rate was steady at 0.457 percent, after
dropping five basis points in the last two days, the biggest
two-day decline since May 2009.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.957
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was little changed at 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
