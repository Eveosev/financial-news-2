OAO Gazprom sent technical experts
to a Chinese shale-gas deposit owned by  China  National Petroleum
Corp., boosting cooperation even as a supply contract stalls.  The two state-controlled energy producers have agreed on a
series of visits by Gazprom personnel to CNPCâ€™s shale-gas
fields, the Russian company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Gazprom has been discussing a contract with CNPC to supply
Russian gas by pipeline to China since at least 2004. The deal
has stalled amid disagreements over prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
