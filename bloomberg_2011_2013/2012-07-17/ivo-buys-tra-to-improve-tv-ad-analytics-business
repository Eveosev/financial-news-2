Digital video-recorder maker  TiVo
Inc. (TIVO)  agreed to buy TRA Inc., a research company that links
households’ TV viewing to purchasing habits, for about $20
million to improve analytics.  TRA tracks about 1.5 million homes, linking TV exposure to
purchase transactions, according to a TiVo statement today. TRA
has more than 45 brand clients and 27 network clients, including
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) ,  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and A&E Television Networks. The
company helps advertisers know which networks or TV shows are
most effective at selling products.  “TV has long been the best medium for advertisers to
influence what consumers buy,” Tom Rogers, chief executive
officer and president of TiVo, said in the statement. “TRA has
proven its platform can determine the effectiveness of  TV
advertising  by connecting the exposure of ads to actual
purchases, helping advertisers identify the right audience and
get the most out of their ad dollars.”  TiVo, based in Alviso, California, plans to expand its
advertising research. TiVo’s customers include individual
consumers, cable, satellite and broadcasting companies. TiVo had
$238.2 million in revenue in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31.  The company’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $7.95 at the close
in New York. The shares have declined 11 percent through today.
