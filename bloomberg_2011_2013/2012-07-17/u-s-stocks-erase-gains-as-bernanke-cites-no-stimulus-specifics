U.S. stocks erased early gains as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to Congress
disappointed investors anticipating a more definitive signal the
central bank was prepared to provide more stimulus.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 1,352.92 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as
0.6 percent in the first half hour of trading.  Bernanke said progress in reducing unemployment is likely
to be “frustratingly slow” and repeated the Fed is ready to take
further action to boost the recovery, while refraining from
discussing specific steps.  The S&P 500 slipped in  seven of the last eight  sessions
before today and is down more than 4 percent from a four-year
high in April as economic data trailed estimates and investors
braced for the first decline in quarterly profits since 2009.  Bernanke’s testimony follows data yesterday showing a
contraction in June retail sales and a report today that the
cost of living in the U.S. was little changed in June, a sign
inflation may stay subdued.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which
measures how much data from the past three months is beating or
missing the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys, is at minus
64, near the almost 11-month low of minus 64.9 reached last
week. The gauge peaked at 91.9 in January.  Earnings beat estimates at 32 of the 45 companies in the
S&P 500 that have reported quarterly results so far, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. Earnings are down 3.1 percent for
the group and profits are projected to decrease 2.1 percent for
the entire S&P 500.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
