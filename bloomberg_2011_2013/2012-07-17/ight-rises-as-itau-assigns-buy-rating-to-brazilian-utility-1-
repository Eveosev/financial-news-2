Light SA (LIGT3)  rose the most in three
weeks after Banco Itau BBA raised the Brazilian power utility to
the equivalent of buy from neutral, citing its “attractive”
valuation.  “The stock seems to have reached an attractive entry
point,” Marcos Severine and Mariana Coelho, analysts at Itau in
 Sao Paulo , wrote in a note to clients dated today.  Shares advanced 5.3 percent to 24.23 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the biggest gain since June 2009. The benchmark
Bovespa index rose 1 percent. Light has fallen 15.9 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
