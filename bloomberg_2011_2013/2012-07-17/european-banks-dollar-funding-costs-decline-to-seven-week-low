The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined to the lowest in seven weeks,
according to a money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 47 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9 a.m. in  London 
from minus 48 yesterday. The cost is the lowest since May 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 53 basis
points, or 0.53 percentage point, below Euribor. Three-month
Euribor, the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in
euros, was set at a record low 0.477 percent yesterday.  An estimate of average overnight borrowing costs in euros,
the Eonia OIS swap, was 9.9 basis points from 10.5 yesterday.
The measure dropped nine basis points on July 5 after the
 European Central Bank  lowered its deposit rate to zero. The swap
dropped to a record 9.2 basis points yesterday.  The euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia, dropped to a
record 11.4 basis points yesterday from 11.7 on July 13.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, placing 404 billion euros ($496 billion) from 387
billion euros on July 13. Lenders cut the deposits to the lowest
in seven months on July 11 after the deposit rate cut took
effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
