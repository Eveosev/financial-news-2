Iran has lifted imports of vegetable
oils, soybeans and soybean meal since the start of June, a sign
that the effects of a financial embargo on the country’s trade
have subsided, industry researcher Oil World said.  Soybean imports may rise to about 180,000 metric tons in
the June-August period from nothing in the previous four months
and 151,000 tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher
wrote in an e-mailed report.  Iranian importers had been largely reliant on  India  for
soymeal imports in recent months, and shipments from  South
America  have resumed recently, according to Oil World. Soybean-
oil imports had come to a near standstill, leading to a “severe
depletion” of stocks in Iran, it said.  “Exports of some key commodities to Iran have recovered
pronouncedly in recent months, indicating that the effects of
the financial embargo on Iranian imports have subsided,” Oil
World wrote. “Iranian crushers suffered a severe blow with
soybean imports plunging to a multiyear low.”  Iran’s imports of soybeans had fallen to 184,000 tons in
the year through June, from 762,000 tons in 2010-11 and 1.02
million tons in 2009-10, according to Oil World.  Combined imports of soybean oil and sunflower-seed oil are
estimated at 330,000 to 340,000 tons in June and July, compared
with 127,000 tons in the same period a year earlier.  Argentina 
delivered about 110,000 tons of  soybean oil  in the past two
months,  Brazil  supplied 89,000 tons, and Ukraine shipped most of
the sunflower-seed oil, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
