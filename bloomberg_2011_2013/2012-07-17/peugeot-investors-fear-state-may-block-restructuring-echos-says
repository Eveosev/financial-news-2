PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  Chief Financial
Officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said among the reasons for
the drop in the company’s share price is investors’ fear that
the French government may block the carmaker’s restructuring
plan,  Les Echos  reported, citing an interview.  “We are going to respond to all their questions at the
time of the publication of our six-month results on July 25,”
de Chatillon told the newspaper, adding that details on the
restructuring plan would be announced at that time.  The CFO said the share price has also been affected by
Moody’s Investors Service decision to put the company’s credit
rating on review, and the possibility it could be downgraded,
Les Echos said an e-mailed preview of an article to be published
in tomorrow’s edition.  De Chatillon said the company requires a treasury of 2
billion euros to carry out its day-to-day operations, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
