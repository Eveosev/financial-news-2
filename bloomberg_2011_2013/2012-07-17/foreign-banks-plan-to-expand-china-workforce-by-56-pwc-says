HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
are among foreign banks in  China  that plan to boost their
combined workforce in the country about 56 percent by 2015,
according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  The banks aim to increase staff to 55,000 people in China
from more than 35,000 as revenue may grow at least 20 percent
annually, PwC said, citing a survey of chief executive officers,
senior executives and branch managers at 41 foreign lenders.
Priority positions are in corporate banking, risk management,
treasury and compliance, the survey found.  Foreign lenders are struggling to expand their 1.93 percent
share of the world’s third-largest banking market, citing
regulatory hurdles, staff attrition and restrictions on new
products as their top challenges, PwC said.  In 2011, 14 banks reported employee turnover levels of 20
percent to 40 percent, and the rate may rise further this year.
Most foreign banks plan to boost salaries in the world’s second-
largest economy by 8 percent to 10 percent this year, according
to the survey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
