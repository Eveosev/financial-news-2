     (Corrects wage growth figure in second paragraph.)  Polish jobs growth slowed in June to
0.1 percent from a year earlier, the Warsaw-based Central
Statistical Office said today. The figure compares with 0.3
percent growth the previous month and the median forecast of 0.2
percent in a Bloomberg survey of 24 economists.  Average gross wages rose 4.3 percent in June from a year
earlier, matching the rise in consumer prices and beating the
3.5 percent median forecast of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
