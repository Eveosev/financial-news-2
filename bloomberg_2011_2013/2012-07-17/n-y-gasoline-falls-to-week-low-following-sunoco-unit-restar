New York  gasoline fell to the lowest
level in a week following the restart of a vacuum tower at
 Sunoco Inc. (SUN) â€™s Philadelphia refinery.  The T-5 tower at the 137 crude unit in the Girard Point
section of the plant was started on July 11, a filing with city
regulators showed.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor dropped 1 cent to 13.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:49
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the second
consecutive decline at the hub and the lowest level since July
9. Prompt delivery fell 2.29 cents to $2.9793 a gallon.  Sunoco shut the vacuum tower June 20, according to an
earlier filing with city regulators. The premium at the East
Coast hub rose to 22 cents a gallon on June 22.  The refinery has a capacity of 355,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has a total vacuum
distillation capacity of 163,200 barrels a day, Energy
Department data show.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  held at
a discount of 5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  reported flaring from a crude unit at
the Big Spring refinery in Texas yesterday after a compressor
tripped offline, according to a filing with state regulators.  Flint Hills Resources LLC also reported a release of
benzene from its Corpus Christi West refinery in Texas after an
equipment failure, a filing with the National Response Center
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
