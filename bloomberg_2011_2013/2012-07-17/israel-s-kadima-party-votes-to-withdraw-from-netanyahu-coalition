Israel’s Kadima party, the biggest
in parliament, voted to withdraw from Prime Minister  Benjamin
Netanyahu ’s coalition after failing to agree on legislation for
drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army.  Kadima’s pull-out today comes about two months after its
leader, Shaul Mofaz, struck a surprise deal with Netanyahu to
join forces and create the biggest government alliance in 20
years with 94 seats in the 120-member Knesset. Netanyahu,
chairman of the Likud party, still commands a majority in
parliament without Kadima’s 28 seats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
