Indian stocks dropped for the fifth
day amid concern deficient seasonal rainfall will slow economic
growth and hurt company earnings.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s largest producer of
sport-utility vehicles and tractors, tumbled 1.7 percent.  Bajaj
Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , slid for the second day.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  declined the
most in a month. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell
0.1 percent to 17,086.39, according to preliminary closing
prices, the longest losing stretch since May.  India’s monsoon rains have been 21 percent below a 50-year
average since June 1, threatening to reduce harvests and stoke
food costs, data from the weather office show. Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  is relying on higher farm output, which makes up
about 15 percent of gross domestic product, to cool inflation
and boost an economy growing at the weakest pace in nine years.  “If we don’t see a pick-up in the monsoon in the next few
weeks then there is fear that the agricultural growth forecast
could be downgraded further, which will mean an even lower GDP
growth,” Toral Munshi, head of India equity research at Credit
Suisse Wealth Management, told Bloomberg UTV today.  Overseas  funds  bought local shares for a 10th straight day
on July 13, data from the market regulator showed yesterday, the
longest run of net purchases since March. They have placed a net
$9.9 billion in the nation’s stocks this year, the highest in
 Asia  and a record for the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
