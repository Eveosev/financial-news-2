New York Mets outfielder  Jason Bay 
will be in the starting lineup tonight against the  Washington
Nationals  after missing the Major League Baseball team’s last 24
games recovering from concussion symptoms.  The 33-year-old was activated today from the 15-day
disabled list, the Mets announced in an e-mailed release. Bay
suffered a concussion on June 15 by running into the wall trying
to catch a fly ball. Tonight’s game is at Nationals Park in
Washington.  A three-time All-Star, Bay was 3-for-10 with two runs
scored and four walks in a three-game rehabilitation stint with
the Mets’ Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. He was hitting
.187 with four home runs and had driven in six runs in 22 games
before getting hurt. He was also on the disabled list from April
24 to June 6 with a fractured left rib.  To contact the reporter on this story:
