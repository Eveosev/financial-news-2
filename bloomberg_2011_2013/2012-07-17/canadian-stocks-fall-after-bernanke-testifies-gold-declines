Canadian stocks gained for a third
day as rising oil prices drove energy shares higher and
expectations grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve will take
further action to boost growth.  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  and  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , two
of the nation’s largest energy providers, added at least 1.4
percent.  Heroux-Devtek Inc. (HRX)  surged 33 percent after the maker of
landing gear agreed to sell four factories to Precision
Castparts Corp. for C$300 million. Energy stocks contributed the
most among 10 industries to the advance in the  Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index. (SPTSX)   The S&P/TSX advanced 50.01 points, or 0.4 percent, to
11,571.19. It lost as much as 0.4 percent in earlier trading.
The gauge is down 3.2 percent in 2012.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told senators that the central
bank is prepared to act to boost growth if the labor market
doesn’t improve. Oil rallied 0.9 percent to a seven-week high
after his comments and as a Bloomberg survey of analysts showed
inventories of the commodity falling.  “ Ben Bernanke  understands that to make a deleveraging feel
not as bad, you can add a lot more money to the system than you
normally could,” Arthur Salzer, who manages C$200 million at
Northland Wealth Management, said in a phone interview. “He’s
doing everything in his power to keep the patient alive.”  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the nation’s largest oil producer,
climbed 0.9 percent to C$29.99. Imperial Oil rallied 1.4 percent
to C$43.13. Canadian Natural Resources gained 3.1 percent to
C$27.31.  Pinecrest Energy Inc., a Calgary-based oil and gas
explorer, advanced 12 percent to C$1.86 as CIBC analysts
upgraded its stock to outperform from perform.  Heroux-Devtek rose 33 percent, its biggest gain since at
least 1988, to C$10.42 on its sale announcement.  Gold miners declined as the metal fell for the second day
on the Comex.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer
of the metal, lost 0.9 percent to C$35.08.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
second-largest producer, slumped 0.5 percent to C$34.10.  AuRico Gold Inc. (AUQ)  slid 13 percent to C$6.66, the most in
nearly 11 months, as the company lowered its 2012 production
forecast. Separately, the operator of three mines in Mexico and
 Canada  said Chief Executive Officer Rene Marion will resign for
health reasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
