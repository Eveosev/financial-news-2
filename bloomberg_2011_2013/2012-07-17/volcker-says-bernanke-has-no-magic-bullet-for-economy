Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker  said the central bank doesn’t have a “magic bullet” to
solve economic woes caused by too much borrowing.  “I don’t believe we’re headed back into a recession, but
we’ve been for some years now stuck in a kind of slow-growth
pattern,” Volcker said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today. “We have inherited a very difficult situation, not
unique to the United States.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  doesn’t have a
“magic bullet to solve these real problems,” Volcker said.  “There’s been too much borrowing, too much indebtedness,
too much leverage in our economy and the world economy,” said
Volcker, 84. “Sometimes it takes years to work itself out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
