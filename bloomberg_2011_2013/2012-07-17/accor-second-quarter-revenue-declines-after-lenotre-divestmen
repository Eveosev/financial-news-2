Accor SA (AC) , the largest hotel company
in Europe, reported second-quarter revenue that missed analysts’
estimates after selling its Lenotre catering unit.  Sales declined to 1.48 billion euros ($1.8 billion) from
1.49 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based owner of the
Sofitel and Ibis brands said in a statement today. Analysts
expected about 1.61 billion euros, the average of three
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue excluding new openings,
acquisitions and currency fluctuations rose 3.1 percent.  Accor agreed in August 2011 to sell Lenotre to  Sodexo (SW)  after
completing the disposal of its stake in casino-company Groupe
Lucien Barriere and other assets to focus on its lodging
business.  In May, Accor agreed to sell the Motel 6 chain to
Blackstone Group LP for $1.9 billion to reduce the company’s
debt and pay for its expansion in Asia. The company restated
year-earlier revenue to reflect the planned sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
