Tunisia’s ruling Islamist Ennahda
party re-elected Rashid Ghannouchi as its leader at the first
public congress for a group that was banned until last year’s
popular uprising.  Ghannouchi, who has led Ennahda since 1991, won more than
70 percent of votes, said AbdelLatif Mekki, the congress’ head.
He defeated rival candidates including Sakek Chorou and Habib
Elouz who have backed the inclusion of Islamic law in the new
constitution that is being drafted.  Ennahda won the most seats in the elections in October last
year that followed the overthrow of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and formed a coalition government with two
other parties. The group stressed in its final statement at the
congress that it was committed to a moderate political approach
and a rejection of “extremism.”  Ghannouchi, who didn’t take a government post in the
coalition, was elected to serve another two years as party
leader before a new vote is held in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
