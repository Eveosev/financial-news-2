 Swap contracts for Indonesian
lower-quality coal rose for a second day, Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte said. Prices for  China  shipments fell.  The contract for sub-bituminous coal with a calorific value
of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading from Indonesia in
the fourth quarter gained 15 cents to $63.60 a metric ton on a
net-as-received basis yesterday, the energy broker said in an e-
mail today. The August contract was unchanged at $61.75 a metric
ton on a net-as-received basis.  The swap for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South China in August
dropped 75 cents to $82.50 a ton on a net-as-received basis. The
contract for the fourth quarter fell 50 cents to $84.50 a ton,
Ginga said.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  Thermal coal at the Australian port of Newcastle, the
benchmark for Asian contracts, declined $2.80 to $85.25 a metric
ton in the week ended July 13, according to IHS McCloskey, a
Petersfield, U.K.-based provider of coal data. It dropped for
the first time in three weeks.  About 60 percent of  Indonesia â€™s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
