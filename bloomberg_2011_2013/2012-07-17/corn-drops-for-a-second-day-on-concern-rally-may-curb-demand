Corn fell for a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation a drought-fueled rally to a 13-month high
may curb demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter. Wheat also dropped.  U.S.  output  of ethanol, made from corn, fell 4.2 percent in
the week ended July 6 to the lowest in almost two years, Energy
Department data show. U.S. feedlots likely cut cattle purchases
by 1.5 percent in June from a year earlier amid higher corn
costs, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts before a
government report July 20. Corn has surged 51 percent since mid-
June as Midwest crops withered under the drought.  “Demand is being rationed,” Arnaud Saulais, a broker at
Starsupply Commodity Brokers, said by telephone today from Nyon,
 Switzerland . End users “are just buying day after day, week
after week. They are not buying for the long term.”  Corn for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $7.695 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:05 p.m. in  London . The
grain yesterday reached $7.89, the highest level for a most-
active contract since June 9, 2011, and near the record $7.9925
set in 2008.  September-delivery wheat fell 0.8 percent to $8.7775 a
bushel after yesterday reaching $8.985, the highest for a most-
active contract since February 2011. Soybeans for November
delivery lost 0.2 percent to $15.87 a bushel after yesterday
touching $16.07, the most expensive since July 2008.  Extreme Drought  About 55 percent of the contiguous U.S. states were in
moderate-to-extreme drought at the end of June, the highest
percentage since December 1956, according to the National
Climatic Data Center. Last month was the 14th-warmest ever and
the 10th-driest June based on records going back to 1895.  Corn may climb to $9 a bushel if drought cuts U.S. yields
to below 140 bushels an acre, unless there is a “demand
meltdown,” UBS AG said today in a report. The  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  cut its yield estimate to 146 bushels an acre on
July 11 after projecting record 166-bushel yields in June.  Higher feed costs mean U.S. hog producers may  lose  about
$20 a pig over the next three quarters, according to a report
dated July 9 from Chris Hurt, an agricultural economist at
 Purdue University  in  West Lafayette ,  Indiana . In the U.K., hog
 farmers  are losing about 18 pounds ($28) a head, according to
the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board’s pork unit.  In Paris, milling wheat for November delivery dropped 1.5
percent to 262.25 euros ($320.71) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe
after yesterday touching 269 euros, the highest for a most-
active contract since May 2011. Prices rallied as U.S. weather
concerns were compounded by excess rains in the U.K. and
northern  France  that threatened to erode the quality of crops.  To contact the reporters on this story:
