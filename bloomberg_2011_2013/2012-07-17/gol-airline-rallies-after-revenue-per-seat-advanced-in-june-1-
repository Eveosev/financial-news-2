Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazilâ€™s second-biggest airline, rose the most in a month after
reporting revenue per seat increased last month.  Shares gained 5.2 percent to 8.73 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 1 percent.  Gol reported in a regulatory filing yesterday that revenue
per seat increased 7 percent in June from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
