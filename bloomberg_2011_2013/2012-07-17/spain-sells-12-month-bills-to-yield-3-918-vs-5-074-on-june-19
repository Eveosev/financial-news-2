Spain  sold 3.56 billion euros ($4.4
billion) of bills, exceeding a target of 3.5 billion euros, and
borrowing costs fell after the government announced its fourth
austerity package to contain the region’s financial crisis.  The Treasury in Madrid sold 12-month bills at an average
yield of 3.918 percent, compared with 5.074 percent at the last
auction on June 19, and 18-month bills at an average rate of
4.242 percent, compared with 5.107 percent last month.  Demand for the 12-month securities was 2.23 times the
amount sold, compared with 2.16 times in June, while the bid-to-
cover ratio for the 18-month bills was 3.66 compared with 4.42.  Spain’s  economy , already suffering the second recession
since 2009 and a 25 percent jobless rate, will continue to
shrink next year, the  International Monetary Fund  said
yesterday, forecasting a 0.6 percent contraction. That may make
it harder for the government to implement the deepest austerity
measures on record.  The auction was “positive” Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters in Madrid today. “Demand was strong,
rates were lower. It showed Spain still has access to markets,
which is good news.”  ‘Less Anxious’  The yield on Spain’s  10-year bonds  rose 2 basis points to
6.87 percent at 12:49 p.m. in Madrid after the auction. That
widened the gap with similar German maturities to 5.62
percentage points, compared with a record 5.89 percentage points
on June 18.  “Markets are less anxious about Spain’s near-term solvency
position,”  Raj Badiani , an economist at IHS Global Insight in
 London , said in an e-mailed note. “However, the Spanish
government is short of effective domestic policy options to
bring about a more dramatic fall in yields across its debt
maturity range.”  The central government last week agreed to raise funds for
regional governments locked out of debt markets. The Treasury
will fund most of the 18 billion-euro facility to help regions
finance deficits and meet debt redemptions, while the state-
owned lottery will provide 6 billion euros.  The Spanish Treasury has covered 65.2 percent of the medium
and long-term debt issuance it plans for this year, the  Economy
Ministry  said in a statement following the auction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
