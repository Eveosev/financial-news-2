Mauritius tourist arrivals in the
six months through June were below official forecasts, signaling
a probable slowdown in economic growth this year.  Air Mauritius (AML) 
Ltd. and hotel stocks declined.  Arrivals to the Indian Ocean island nation rose 0.5 percent
from a year earlier to 467,153 in the period, Port Louis-based
Statistics Mauritius said in a  statement  on its website today.
The agency last month predicted a 1.6 percent increase in
visitors this year. June arrivals were little changed from a
year earlier at 54,625.  Tourism, one of Mauritius’s main sources of foreign
currency, has been hurt by the sovereign debt crisis in  Europe .
Visitors from France and other key European markets fell by 10
percent or more in June.  “It will surely affect growth,” said Swadicq Nuthay, an
economist at Port Louis-based Axys Capital Management Ltd.,
which oversees $200 million of investments. “It wouldn’t be
surprising to see a contraction next year in the industry.”  The data agency lowered its economic growth forecast for
this year to 3.5 percent in June, the second reduction in three
months.  Mauritius is luring visitors from  Asia  to compensate for
the drop in European arrivals, Tourism Minister Michael Sik Yuen
said on June 29. Visitors from  China  rose 59 percent to 9,633,
according to the data agency.  Air Mauritius  Air Mauritius, which is sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth-biggest
airline and accounts for about 50 percent of the country’s
passenger traffic, declined 1.9 percent to 10.50 rupees, the
lowest since June 22, at the 1:30 p.m. close of trading.  The carrier, along with hotel stocks, has led a 7.3 percent
drop in the  38-member SEMDEX index  this year.  New Mauritius
Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , Sun Resorts and  Lux Island Resorts Ltd. (NRL)  account for
about 10 percent of it.  Lux Island Resorts fell to a 40-month low, retreating 0.5
percent to 18.90 rupees. Sun Resorts Ltd fell 0.6 percent to
34.10 rupees, its weakest level since March 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
