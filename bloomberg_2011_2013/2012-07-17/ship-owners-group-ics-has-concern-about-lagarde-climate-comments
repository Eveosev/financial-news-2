The International Chamber of
Shipping, representing owners of 80 percent of the merchant
fleet, said it has concerns about comments last month by
International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde .  Shipping and aviation can raise about 25 percent of the
$100 billion needed to meet climate adaptation and mitigation in
developing nations, Lagarde said in a  speech  last month that’s
posted on the IMF’s website.  The nature of shipping means the industry needs global
regulations, ICS Chairman Masamichi Morooka said in a July 13
letter to the IMF that the shipping group published today. Those
are difficult to create and enforce, partly because they need to
dovetail with United Nations climate-change rules, the trade
group said. Owners could also re-register vessels in countries
where charges didn’t apply, thereby avoiding the levies,
according to the ICS.  “The remarks in your speech give rise to serious concerns
because they appear to ignore the major impediments to adopting
the charges on shipping that you suggest,” Morooka wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
