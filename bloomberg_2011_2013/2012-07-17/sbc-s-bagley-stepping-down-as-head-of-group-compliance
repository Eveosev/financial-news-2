HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA)  head of group
compliance, David Bagley, told a U.S. Senate hearing he will
step down as lawmakers probe whether the bank broke anti- money
laundering  rules.  Executives at  Europe ’s biggest bank are being questioned by
the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations over
claims that bank affiliates gave terrorists, drug cartels and
criminals a portal into the U.S. financial system by failing to
guard against money laundering.  The hearing follows the panel’s 335-page report describing
a decade of compliance failures. HSBC enabled drug lords to
launder money in  Mexico , did business with firms linked to
terrorism and concealed transactions that bypassed U.S.
sanctions against  Iran , Senate investigators said in the report.  “As I have thought about the structural transformation of
the bank’s compliance function, I recommended to the group that
now is the appropriate time for me and for the bank for someone
new to serve as the head of group compliance,” Bagley said. “I
have agreed to work with the bank’s senior management toward an
orderly transition of this important role.”  Bagley has been the London-based bank’s compliance chief
since 2002. He joined Midland Bank in 1992, the year the British
lender was acquired by HSBC. Patrick Humphris, a spokesman for
the bank in  London , declined to comment further.  To contact the reporters on this story:
