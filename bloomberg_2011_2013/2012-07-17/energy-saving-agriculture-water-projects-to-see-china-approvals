Agricultural projects that involve
water conservancy measures and energy saving may see more
government approvals in the second half of the year,  China 
Securities Journal reported, citing unidentified people.  China is drafting a plan for the construction of
demonstration projects to increase the efficiency of large-
scale, water-saving irrigation in the five years through 2015,
the report said, without saying where it got the information.  China may continue to speed reviews of infrastructure
projects for electricity and hydropower as well as rail
transport and airports, the report also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
