Saudi Arabia ’s revenue from exports
of crude oil and other petroleum products jumped 48 percent in
2011 as shipment volumes increased over the previous year, OPEC
reported.  The world’s largest crude exporter shipped oil and products
valued at $318.5 billion last year compared with $215.4 billion
in 2010, the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  said
in its annual statistical bulletin. Saudi exports of crude and
other petroleum products rose 6.9 percent to an average of 8.12
million barrels a day last year, according to the data posted on
OPEC’s website yesterday.  Iran, the group’s second-biggest producer after Saudi
Arabia, exported crude and petroleum products valued at $114.8
billion compared with $72.2 billion the previous year, the data
showed.  Iran ’s revenue increased even as the volume of the
nation’s shipments fell 8.5 percent, according to OPEC.  Revenue for OPEC members in the  Middle East  last year was
the highest since 2007, according to the data. Revenue for
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates increased 56 percent last
year to $96.8 billion and $104.5 billion, respectively, while
 Iraq ’s revenue gained 59 percent to $83 billion, according to
the OPEC data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
