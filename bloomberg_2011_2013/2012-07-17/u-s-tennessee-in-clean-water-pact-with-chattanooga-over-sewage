Chattanooga will be required to fix
sewage overflows and make infrastructure investments to its
wastewater treatment system to improve local water quality, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and  Tennessee  announced.  “Today’s agreement with the city of Chattanooga will
rehabilitate their aging sewer system and promote innovative
green infrastructure efforts to reduce stormwater runoff,” the
EPA said in a statement on the Clean Water Act agreement.  Chattanooga “will enjoy public health and environmental
benefits for years to come as a result of the improvements
required,” said Ignacia S. Moreno, assistant attorney general
for the  Justice Department ’s Environment and Natural Resources
Division. They include sewer rehabilitation projects and
stormwater controls to fix overflows and reduce public health
risks from untreated sewage, Moreno said.  Sites for improvements and compliance of water quality
standards include part of the Chattanooga Creek, a tributary of
the South Chickamauga Creek and the Dobbs Branch stream,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
