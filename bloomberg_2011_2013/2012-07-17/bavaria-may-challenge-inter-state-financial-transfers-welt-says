The Bavarian government, at a
Cabinet meeting today, may decide to challenge the system of
financial redistribution between  Germany ’s 16 states at the
country’s highest court,  Die Welt  newspaper reported.  Bavaria, one of four net-contributor states, may go to the
Karlsruhe-based Federal Constitutional Court alone if the other
net payers refuse to join, the newspaper cited Georg Schmid,
head of the ruling  Christian Social Union ’s parliamentary group,
as saying. Bavaria paid 3.7 billion euros ($4.6 billion) last
year to help the 12 weakest states, more than joint
contributions from Hesse, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hamburg, Die
Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
