The French government should focus
on improving the economic environment and avoid interfering with
companies’ strategies and management, Laurence Parisot, head of
the French employers’ association, told  Les Echos  in an
interview.  Parisot added that delaying “necessary decisions” raises
the risk of a worse outcome, the newspaper reported. His
comments came in response to a question about French President
Francois Hollande’s criticism of  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ’s
restructuring plan.  The interview is scheduled to appear in tomorrow’s edition
of the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
