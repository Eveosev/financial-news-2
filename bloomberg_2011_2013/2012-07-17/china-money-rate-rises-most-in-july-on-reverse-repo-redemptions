China ’s overnight money-market rate
rose by the most this month on speculation cash supply will wane
because of reverse-repurchase contract redemptions.  A total of 205 billion  yuan  ($32.2 billion) of reverse
repos come due this week, while 45 billion yuan will be added to
the market through maturing securities, according to Societe
Generale SA. The People’s Bank of China offered seven-day
reverse  repos  at a yield of 3.3 percent today, unchanged from
the last auction on July 12, according to a statement on its
website.  “The one-day market rate is a bit tighter because of the
maturity of the reverse repos,” said Pin Ru Tan, a rates
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong .  The overnight  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 17 basis points to 2.64 percent as
of 5:02 p.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest gain since June 26,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.50 percent, the biggest
increase since June 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.51 percent government bonds due February
2022 climbed one basis point to 3.27 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
