 U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said 13,000 companies had applied for loans worth 2 billion
pounds ($3.1 billion) in total under the government’s credit-
easing program in the face of banks’ reluctance to lend.  “The banks are risk-averse,” Cable told Parliament’s
Business Committee in  London  today. “It’s a constant source of
frustration.”  The National Loan Guarantee Scheme began in March with the
aim of making 20 billion pounds of discounted loans available to
small companies to help ease credit strains and spur economic
growth.  Under the program, banks including Barclays Plc, Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  use government guarantees to borrow cheaply and
then pass on the benefit to companies.  In June,  the government announced it will extend the
program so that companies with annual sales of up to 250 million
pounds, about 99.9 percent of all companies, can benefit.
Previously, only those with sales below 50 million were
eligible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
