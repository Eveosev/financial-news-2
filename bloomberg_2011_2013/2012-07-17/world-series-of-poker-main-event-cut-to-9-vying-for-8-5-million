A 26-year-old poker professional
from  Las Vegas  is the chip leader at the  World Series of Poker ’s
main event, which played down to the final nine competitors from
a starting field of 6,598.  Jesse Sylvia, with 43.9 million in chips, has at least a 14
million chip advantage over each of the other remaining players
in the No-Limit Texas Hold’Em World Championship at the Rio All-
Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.  The tournament, known as the main event, resumes on Oct.
29. The champion will win $8.5 million and each of the remaining
players is guaranteed at least $754,798.  Gaelle Baumann of  France  and Elisabeth Hille of Norway were
trying to become the first women to reach the final table of the
main event since Barbara Enright in 1995. Both were knocked out
by Hungary’s Andras Koroknai, with Baumann finishing 10th and
Hille 11th.  Koroknai, 30, is second with 29.4 million in chips,
followed by 25-year-old Laurel, Maryland, native Greg Merson,
who has 28.7 million. Russell Thomas, a 24-year-old actuary from
Hartford,  Connecticut , is fourth with 24.8 million.  Also still in it are 57-year-old poker pro Steven Gee (16.9
million in chips), 43-year-old commodity broker Michael Esposito
(16.3 million), 27-year-old poker pro Robert Salaburu (15.2
million), 21-year-old  Arizona  State University senior Jake
Balsiger (13.1 million) and 32-year-old poker pro Jeremy Ausmus
(9.8 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
