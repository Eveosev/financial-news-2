A shipping company controlled by
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  sued the U.S. government alleging a
$340 million loan guarantee was improperly delayed because of
the bankruptcy of Solyndra LLC.  American Petroleum Tankers Parent LLC, in a lawsuit filed
today in federal court in  Washington , asked a judge to order
Maritime Administrator David Matsuda to grant or deny the
company’s loan application. American Petroleum Tankers, or APT,
is majority-owned by investment funds managed by Blackstone
Group.  The Transportation Department’s credit council “has
refused to act on APT’s application, based, not on the merits of
the application, but primarily on the fact that APT is owned by
investment funds managed by private equity firms,” according to
the complaint.  Matsuda, during an April 30 meeting with APT officials,
raised the issue of Solyndra defaulting on loan guarantees from
the Energy Department and said “applications for loan
guarantees were being given more scrutiny,” specifically those
sought by companies of private-equity firms, according to the
complaint.  APT, which owns five petroleum tankers, applied for a loan
guarantee in August 2010. The application will expire on Aug.
31, according to the complaint.  “We are reviewing the filing, but do not comment on
pending litigation,” Meghan Keck, a department spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone
Group, declined to comment.  The case is American Petroleum Tankers Parent LLC v. U.S.,
12-cv-01165, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
