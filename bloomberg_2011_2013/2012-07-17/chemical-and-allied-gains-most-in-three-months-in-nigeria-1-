Chemical and Allied Products Plc , a
Nigerian paint and household products maker, gained the most in
almost three months as some investors speculated it will pay an
interim dividend for the first half.  The stock advanced 4.2 percent to 24.10 naira in Lagos,
 Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the most since April 18.  “It’s the payout that is pulling it,” Raheem Mohammed,
chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd.,
said by phone today. “Sometimes they pay an interim dividend so
investors may be betting that it will do so this year.”  Chemical and Allied paid a full-year dividend of 1.6 naira
per share for 2011. Profit for the first quarter through March
rose to 260.32 million naira ($1.6 million), from 219.18 million
naira a year earlier, it said on May 9. Officials of the company
were not immediately available to comment when Bloomberg called
its corporate office in Lagos today.  Chemical and Allied’s shares have risen 66 percent this
year, compared with an 11 percent gain in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
