Beijing health authorities today
denied a newspaper report that a woman in the city was bitten by
ticks, which have been cited for the deaths of five people in
other parts of  China  this year.  Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference today
that ticks had been found in the Chinese capitalâ€™s Changping
district, the Economic Observer newspaper reported on its
website. No one has yet been reported bitten and Beijing
residents need not be too concerned, Pang was cited as saying.  Four people have died in  Henan province  this year because
of illnesses related to tick bites, according to the Xinhua News
Agency. Another person was killed in Shandong province, the Qilu
Evening News reported. The Beijing News reported today that
authorities in the Chinese capital last night confirmed a woman
in Changping district was bitten.  Ticks, which are uncommon in urban Beijing, live mostly in
grass, brushes and trees and can spread various diseases to
people through bites. The Chinese capital is home to more than
19 million people.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
