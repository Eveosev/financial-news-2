Canadian stocks fell for a second
day as raw-materials producers declined on concern  Europe ’s
worsening debt crisis will slow the global economic recovery.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest producer of the
precious metal by market value, slipped 2.9 percent as the  U.S.
dollar  gained against most other major currencies.  Teck
Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s largest base-metals and coal producer,
dropped 3.6 percent after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
sought a confidence vote, risking passage of budget cuts and
asset sales. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. lost 3.3 percent
as the  U.S. Senate  voted to end an ethanol tax credit.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 118.9
points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,853.13, the lowest level since
Nov. 23.  “If you’re having European countries with large debt that
they’re not able to address, that impacts global economic
growth, and right now, the focus is on seeing economic growth
deteriorate,” said Jennifer Dowty, the Toronto-based manager of
the C$844.1 million ($856.4 million) Manulife Growth
Opportunities Fund.  The Canadian stock benchmark slumped 6 percent this month
through yesterday as U.S. employment and manufacturing data
missed economists’ forecasts. Oil, copper, gold and silver all
fell as the U.S. dollar gained.  The S&P/TSX Materials Index fell to the lowest level since
September. Thirty of 33 gold stocks dropped, extending the
S&P/TSX Gold Index’s year-to-date decline to 16 percent.  Risk Aversion   “There’s a lot of risk-aversion,” Dowty said. “People do
not want to hold a gold stock, simply because it’s a stock.
There’s company risk. There’s market risk.”  Goldcorp fell 2.9 percent to C$45.42.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) ,
Canada’s third-biggest producer of the metal, slipped 3.1
percent to C$14.64.  Iamgold Corp. (IMG) , which mines in West Africa,
 South America  and  Quebec , declined 5.7 percent to C$18.21.
 European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , which is developing gold and base-
metals mines, slumped 6.7 percent to C$9.16, the lowest level
since August.  For a second-straight day, all major base metals traded on
the London Metal Exchange retreated.  Mining Shares  Teck lost 3.6 percent to C$43.75.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
decreased 5 percent to C$115.37. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is
building a copper and gold mine in  Mongolia  with Rio Tinto
Group, slipped 3.5 percent to C$21.85.  Evertz Technologies Ltd. (ET) , which makes electronics for
broadcasters, sank 20 percent, the most in 39 months, to C$13
after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that missed the average
analyst estimate by 35 percent, excluding certain items.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by
market value, slid 3.3 percent to C$50.99 as corn futures fell
for a fourth day. The U.S. Senate voted to eliminate a 45-cent-
a-gallon tax credit.  Air Canada (AC/A)  jumped 8 percent, the most since October, to
C$2.17 after reaching a tentative agreement with the Canadian
Auto Workers to end a strike of call-center, check-in and gate
staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
