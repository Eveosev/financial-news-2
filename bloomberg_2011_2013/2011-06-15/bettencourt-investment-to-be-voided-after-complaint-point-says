A 143-million-euro ($203 million)
investment by  L’Oreal SA (OR)  heir Liliane Bettencourt in online
gaming-site owner Stephane Courbit’s holding company is being
annulled at his request,  Le Point  said today, without disclosing
how it learned the information.  Bettencourt’s investment with Courbit prompted a complaint
by her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, who said her
mother’s lawyer, Pascal Wilhelm, shouldn’t have approved the
investment because Courbit is also a client, the magazine
reported on its website.  Wilhelm didn’t immediately return calls for comment by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
