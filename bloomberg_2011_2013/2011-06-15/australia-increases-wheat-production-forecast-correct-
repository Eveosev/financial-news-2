Wheat production in  Australia , the
fourth-largest shipper, may total 26.2 million metric tons in
2011-2012, 7.8 percent more than forecast and in line with last
year’s harvest as favorable weather aids the crop.  The revised prediction compares with a March 1 projection of
24.3 million tons and estimated record output of 26.3 million
tons in 2010-2011, the  Australian Bureau of Agricultural  and
Resource Economics and Sciences said in a report today. The
crop year runs to March 31.  The Australian harvest may help ease a worldwide shortage
caused by droughts in the U.S. and  Europe  that have driven wheat
prices higher and helped push global food costs to a record in
February. Global demand will beat production for a second year
in 2011-2012, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said June 9.  “Good soil moisture in the eastern states and favorable
grain and oilseed prices have encouraged Australian producers to
increase winter-crop plantings this year,”  Paul Morris , deputy
executive director at the bureau, said in an e-mailed statement.  Wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade has rallied 63 percent
over the past year as corn surged 83 percent and soybeans
climbed 49 percent. The September-delivery wheat contract traded
little changed at $7.615 a bushel at 10:35 a.m. in  Singapore .  The area sown to wheat may rise to 14.3 million hectares
(35 million acres) from the 13.8 million forecast in March, the
bureau said. Plantings in Western Australia may reach a record
this year as farmers switch from canola and barley, Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said on June 8.  ‘Rainfall Is Needed’  “Recent rainfall over  Western Australia ’s cropping regions
has also boosted winter-crop prospects in that state after a dry
start,” Morris said. “Further rainfall is needed over the next
few weeks to increase plantings.”  CBH Group, Western Australia’s largest grain handler, said
on May 31 that rains have boosted optimism that the state will
produce an average grain harvest of about 10 million tons after
the previous season fell 35 percent short.  Australia’s total winter-crop production, including wheat,
barley and canola, may be 40.8 million tons in the 2011-2012
season, the bureau said. The 2010-2011 total was estimated at
42.1 million tons, the report said.  Global wheat stockpiles at the end of the 2011-2012 season
may be 184.3 million tons, according to a June 9 projection from
the USDA. That would be lowest level since 2008-2009.  Record Cotton  Cotton production in Australia, the world’s fourth-largest
exporter, may have reached a record 898,000 tons in 2010-2011,
also buoyed by rainfall, the bureau said. Output may gain to 1.1
million tons in 2011-2012, the agency predicted.  La Nina-linked wet weather brought record rainfall to parts
of eastern Australia last year, ending drought and replenishing
dams used for irrigating cotton crops, which are planted in
about November and mostly harvested from April.  Canola production is forecast at 2.3 million tons in 2011-
2012, up from the 2.23 million predicted in March. Australian
output may jump to a decade-high 2.4 million tons this season,
the Australian Oilseeds Federation said on May 17.  The bureau cut its forecast for barley production to 8.09
million tons in 2011-2012 from 8.85 million tons in March and 
compared with 9.33 million tons in the previous year.   To contact the reporter on this story:
