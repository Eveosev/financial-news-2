The  Islamic Development Bank  will
give  Egypt  a financing package worth $2.5 billion over three
years to fund development projects as well as insurance for
imports and exports,and to strengthen private businesses.  Egypt announced on June 5 that it had agreed on a $3
billion loan with the  International Monetary Fund , part of
broader support pledges, as the North African country seeks to
finance its widening budget deficit after a popular revolt
earlier this year.  The IDB said in a statement today that it had signed
several accords with Egypt for the Saudi Arabian bank to
contribute to projects including a power plant with a capacity
of 650 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
