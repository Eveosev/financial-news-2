EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,  Egypt ’s
biggest publicly traded investment bank, said first-quarter
profit plunged 93 percent due to regional political unrest and a
one-time gain a year earlier.  Net income for the period ended March 31 fell to 36 million
Egyptian pounds ($6.1 million) from 484 million pounds a year-
earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing to the Egyptian
bourse today. Investment banking revenue declined 84 percent to
168.2 million pounds.  “This poor performance reflects the weak regional
operating environment in light of recent political events and
regional uncertainty in addition to the closing of the Egyptian
Exchange for 38 trading days,” the company said in a reference
to its investment banking business in a Regulatory News Service
release.  EFG-Hermes said it had a one-time gain of 716.6 million
pounds from the sale of its stake in Beirut-based Bank Audi SAL-
Audi Saradar Group in January, 2010. Net income in the fourth
quarter of 2010, before the start of popular uprisings in the
 Middle East , was 32 million pounds, the company said.  Shares of EFG-Hermes fell 0.1 percent to 22 pounds at 12.42
p.m. in Cairo, the first drop in a week, giving the company a
market value of 8.4 billion Egyptian pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
