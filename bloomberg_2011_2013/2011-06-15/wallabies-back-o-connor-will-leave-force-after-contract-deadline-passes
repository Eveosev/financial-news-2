Wallabies back  James O’Connor  will
leave the Western Force Super Rugby team after failing to agree
on a new contract with the Perth-based franchise.  The Force withdrew their final offer to O’Connor, 20, after
his management didn’t respond before today’s deadline of 9 a.m.
local time, RugbyWA said in an e-mailed statement.  “We all know that James is a wonderfully talented player
however the terms that were being asked of us by his management
were, in our view, unacceptable irrespective of the player in
question,” Force coach Richard Graham said in the statement
without specifying the terms.  O’Connor, who’s scored 10 tries in 27 Tests for  Australia ,
will join the Melbourne Rebels for the 2012 Super Rugby season,
the Australian Associated Press reported, without saying where
it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
