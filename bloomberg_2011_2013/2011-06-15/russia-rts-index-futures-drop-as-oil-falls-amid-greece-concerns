Russia ’s Micex Index dropped the
most in more than a week after oil tumbled below $95 a barrel
for the first time since February as concern increased that
 Greece  will default.  The 30-stock gauge slumped 1.1 percent to 1,663.11 by 10:33
a.m. in Moscow, its biggest intraday loss since June 8. Oil
producers OAO Tatneft and OAO Gazprom Neft both declined 1.2
percent. OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, Russia’s two biggest
lenders, fell 1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index slid 1.5 percent to 1,891.04.  Oil, Russia’s chief export revenue earner, fell the most in
a month yesterday as the European Union struggled to break a
deadlock on a second financial rescue package for Greece. Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  was set to reshuffle his
Cabinet and seek a confidence vote amid protests over budget
cuts.  Crude oil for July delivery yesterday slumped 4.6 percent
to $94.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest settlement since Feb. 22 and the biggest decline since
May 11. The contract traded 0.3 percent higher at $95.08 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
