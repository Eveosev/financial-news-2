Greek banks will be asked to
maintain a 10 percent Core Tier I capital from 2012,  Kathimerini 
reported, citing George Provopoulos, the head of the country’s
central bank.  The 10 percent level will include government preference
shares issued to the lenders and has been agreed with the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund  as part of a plan
to shield banks, the Athens-based newspaper said, without saying
where it got the information.  An international company will be hired to examine the loan
books, non-performing loans and provisions of Greek banks and
issue a report by the end of November, Kathimerini said.  Provopoulos met with the chiefs of  Greece ’s four biggest
lenders and of Emporiki Bank of Greece SA and Hellenic Postbank
SA in Athens yesterday, Kathimerini reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
