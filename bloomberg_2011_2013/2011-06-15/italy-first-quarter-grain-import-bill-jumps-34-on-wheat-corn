Italy , the world’s third-largest
wheat buyer, spent 34 percent more on grain imports in the first
quarter than a year earlier as the cost of wheat and corn
surged, the national cereal-industry association said.  The value of inbound grain rose to 899 million euros ($1.3
billion) in the January-to-March period from 594.6 million euros
a year earlier, the Rome-based Associazione Nazionale
Cerealisti, known as Anacer, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Import volumes rose 13 percent.  Wheat prices jumped 64 percent in  Chicago  in the 12 months
through March, raising the bill for buyers. Italians eat more
wheat products such as bread and pasta as part of their diet
than the French, Germans, Americans or British, according to
 data  from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center.  The volume of Italian grain imports rose to 3.2 million
metric tons in the first quarter of 2011 compared with 2.83
million tons in the year-ago period.  Soft-wheat shipments climbed to 1.22 million tons from 1.16
million tons, while the value rose to 310.4 million euros from
176.4 million euros. Imports of durum wheat, the hard variety
used to make pasta, rose to 461,279 tons from 419,302 tons, at a
cost of 118.8 million euros compared with 91.2 million euros a
year earlier, according to the Anacer data.  Imports Rose  Italy’s wheat imports rose to an eight-year high in 2010 as
domestic production fell. Egypt and  Brazil  were the world’s two
biggest wheat importers in the marketing year through June 2010,
according to data from the International Grains Council.  Italian corn imports rose to 752,027 tons, with a value of
149.7 million euros, in the first three months of 2011, from
553,272 tons and 77.1 million euros a year earlier,
respectively, Anacer said.  Including oilseed and protein-crop products, the value of
Italy’s first-quarter imports increased to 1.26 billion euros
from 906.6 million euros.  Italian cereal-industry exports amounted to 710.7 million
euros in January to March, Anacer said. That resulted in a trade
deficit of 554.1 million euros, almost double the 280 million-
euro shortfall a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
