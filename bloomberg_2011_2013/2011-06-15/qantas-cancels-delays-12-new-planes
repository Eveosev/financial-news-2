Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ,  Australia ’s
biggest carrier, canceled or delayed orders for 12 single-aisle
planes as passenger demand growth slows.  The move will help reduce domestic capacity growth to 5.5
percent in the year starting July 1 from a previous target of 8
percent, Sydney-based Qantas said in a filing today. It didn’t
give details on which types of planes had been canceled. The
airline pared capital expenditure in the period by A$300 million
and cut leasing commitments by the same amount, it said.  The cuts are intended to reduce unfilled seats as the
company, which controls 65 percent of the domestic market, faces
increasing competition from Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. and Tiger
Airways Holdings Ltd. Qantas filled 80.4 percent of seats in the
10 months ended April, down 1.3 percentage points from a year
earlier.  Qantas will take delivery of 34 aircraft in year starting
July 1, down from a planned 43 planes. The carrier has financing
in place for all deliveries within the next 18 months.  “The Qantas group has always taken decisive action to
match capacity to demand,” Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce
said in the statement.  The carrier fell 0.3 percent to A$1.88 at 11:23 a.m. in
Sydney. It has dropped 26 percent this year compared with a 3.6
percent decline in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
