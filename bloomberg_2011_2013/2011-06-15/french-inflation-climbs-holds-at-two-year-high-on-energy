France â€™s inflation rate held at the
highest in more than two years in May, lifted by increasing food
costs.  Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, the same pace as in both March
and April, national statistics office Insee said today.
Economists had forecast a gain of 2.2 percent, according to the
median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.   To contact the reporter on this story:
