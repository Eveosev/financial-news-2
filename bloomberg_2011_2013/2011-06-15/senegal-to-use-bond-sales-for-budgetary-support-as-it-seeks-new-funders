Senegal ’s $200 million sukuk, to be
sold later this year, will be used for budgetary support as the
West African nation seeks new sources of funding, said Finance
Minister Abdoulaye Diop.  “We simply want to experiment, to diversify our sources of
income,” Diop told reporters at a conference in Dakar, the
capital, today. “There is a lot of money in Islamic countries
that is flowing toward European countries and Arab states in the
Middle East. We want to see if it can come to African
countries.”  The sukuk would be Senegal’s second bond sold on
international markets this year, after the May 6 sale of $500
million of 10-year Eurobonds. The Islamic debt will be
denominated in the local CFA franc currency, said Belia Fofana,
a financial analyst with  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  who arranged the
Eurobond sale, in an interview May 13.  Senegal will sell $200 million less in regional Treasury
bills at the  Central Bank  of West African States to make room
for the issue, Fofana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
