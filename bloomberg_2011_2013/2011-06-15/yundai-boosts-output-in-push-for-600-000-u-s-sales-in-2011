Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest automaker, said increased production capacity will allow
it to sell a record 600,000 cars and light trucks in the U.S.
this year as demand for its Sonata and Elantra models grows.  “We’ve now been able to secure production capacity to
safely say that we will surpass 600,000 units,” Mike O’Brien,
Hyundai’s vice president for U.S. corporate and product planning,
told reporters yesterday in  Las Vegas .  The Seoul-based company said in January it didn’t have
enough production capacity to meet that level of U.S. sales.
Since then, Hyundai has raised output at its Montgomery,  Alabama ,
plant that makes Sonatas and Elantras, and it will also have a
larger supply of the new Accent subcompact from South Korea than
initially planned, O’Brien said in an interview.  Hyundai and affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  are among the
fastest-growing automakers in the U.S. this year, with
respective sales increases of 29 percent and 45 percent through
May. Both are adding models with improved styling and fuel
efficiency to win sales from competitors including Toyota Motor
Corp. and Honda Motor Co., which are struggling with reduced
supply after  Japan ’s record earthquake in March cut output.  Hyundai sold 263,588 vehicles in the U.S. in the first five
months of 2011 and could sell more than 630,000 this year if the
current pace continues. It delivered 538,228 cars and light
trucks last year.  Shares of Hyundai fell 0.2 percent to 235,500 won as of
9:35 a.m. in Seoul trading. They have gained 36 percent this
year, compared with a 1.5 percent increase in  South Korea ’s
benchmark Kospi index.  Alabama Plant  Combined U.S. sales for Hyundai and Kia, which operate
separately, were 463,648 through May, behind only GM, Ford,
Toyota, Honda and Chrysler Group LLC. At that pace, full-year
sales for the two would total more than 1 million vehicles for
the first time.  Hyundai has operated its Alabama plant with daily overtime
shifts and some Saturday production since last year to produce
at least 330,000 Sonatas and Elantras in 2011, 10 percent more
than its planned capacity. Last month the company said it will
spend $173 million and hire 214 people at the Montgomery plant
to boost production of four-cylinder engines used in the models.  Hyundai’s U.S. unit is based in Fountain Valley,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
