A 20-karat-gold Vacheron Constantin
from the collection of U.S. car manufacturer James Ward Packard
(1863-1928) sold for almost $1.8 million at Christie’s
International in  New York  today, more than triple the presale
high estimate.  The 1919 watch, one of four Packard timepieces put up for
auction in Christie’s Important Watches sale, features his
signature Art Nouveau monogram in blue enamel and strikes every
quarter hour.  The four watches, which had been stores for 60 years in a
bank vault, brought in a total of $2.75 million, compared with
the presale high estimate of $906,000.  A founder of  Packard Motor Car Co.  in 1902, Packard was an
avid collector of watches. He commissioned an 18-karat gold
minute-repeater from  Patek Philippe  in 1918, one of 17 watches
the Swiss firm made specifically for Packard.  The minute-repeater, which has a power reserve and an
unusual Murat-style case, sold for $986,500, more than double
the high estimate of $400,000  The remaining pieces are two 19th-century pocket watches
that belonged to Packard’s father, Warren Packard, and were made
by American Watch Co. Each sold for $2,750, just below their
presale high estimate of $3,000.  To contact the reporter of this story:
