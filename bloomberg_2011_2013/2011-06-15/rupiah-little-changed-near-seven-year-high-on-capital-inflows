Indonesia ’s rupiah declined,
retreating from near a seven-year high, after Asian stocks fell
on speculation that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will take
longer to resolve.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks slid 0.1
percent, erasing its earlier gains. An emergency session of
finance ministers in Brussels late yesterday failed to reconcile
a German-led push for bondholders to shoulder part of the cost
of a new Greek aid package with European Central Bank warnings
that the move might constitute the euro area’s first sovereign
default.  “The rupiah’s weakness was driven by performance of Asian
stocks and currencies,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The debt crisis in  Europe 
is not over yet and the market is concerned.”  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 8,548 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency rose as much as 0.1 percent earlier and touched 8,528.
It reached 8,499 on June 8, the strongest level since March 2004.  Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said yesterday that
an agreement on a second bailout package for  Greece  may be
delayed until July.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds declined. The yield on
the 8.25 percent debt due July 2021 rose one basis point to 7.41
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
