Peter Gelb , the general manager of
the  Metropolitan Opera , took an 11 percent pay cut in 2009 to
$1.3 million in salary and benefits as the company’s endowment
got sliced by the world financial crisis.  James Levine , the Met’s music director, earned $1.5
million, down 5 percent from a year earlier, according to the
Met’s 2009-2010  tax return .  Salaries at the Met were cut by 10 percent in December
2008, according to Peter Clark, a spokesman. In the year ending
in July 2009, its investments fell by 12 percent, or $40
million, after losing $14 million the year before.  (Due to reporting requirements, Gelb’s pay is for calendar
year 2009 while Levine’s is for the year ending in July 2010.)  Chorus master Donald Palumbo’s compensation was $461,617.
Among the Met’s top stagehands, master carpenter Stephen Diaz
earned $415,377, while assistant head electrician Richard Wagner
made $417,548.  Operating revenue at the Met increased by 7 percent to
$163.9 million in 2009-2010, led by expanded broadcasts of
performances in movie theaters worldwide. Yet the company’s net
assets fell 16 percent to $203.6 million, hurt by ballooning
pension benefits. Two years earlier, in August 2008, net assets
were $380.1 million.  The Met’s 2009-2010 deficit was $1.7 million, Clark said.
The company will end with a balanced budget this season, its
first since 2003-2004, he added.  Joseph Volpe, the general manager who retired in July 2006
after 42 years with the company, received $432,807 in pension
benefits. Advertising agency Serino Coyne received $2.9 million,
down from $3.1 million a year earlier.  To contact the writer of this story:
