Niger’s government has canceled an
agreement for LAP Green Network of  Libya  to buy 51 percent of
state-owned telecommunications companies Sonitel and Sahel Com,
said Salifou Labo Bouche, communications minister.  “We are currently looking for another buyer,” the minister
said on national television yesterday. The decision comes after
the government “waited in vain” for a payment from the Libyan
company, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
