Tanzania’s inflation accelerated to
a 13-month high in May as energy and food costs increased,

9.7 percent last month from 8.6 percent in April, according to
Ephraim Kwesigabo, an official at the National Bureau of
Statistics.  Energy prices jumped 24.5 percent in May from 22.1 percent
the month before, Kwesigabo said in a statement handed to
