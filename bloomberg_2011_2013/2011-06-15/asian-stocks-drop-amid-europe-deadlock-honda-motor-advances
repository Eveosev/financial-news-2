Asian stocks fell, sending the
region’s benchmark index lower for the fifth day in six as
European Union officials struggled to break a deadlock on a
second Greek rescue plan and  China  ordered lenders to set aside
more cash as reserves.  Esprit Holdings Ltd., a global fashion retailer that gets
most its revenue from  Europe , slumped 3.4 percent in  Hong Kong .
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, sank 0.6
percent in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest
mining company by sales, lost 0.4 percent as oil and metal
prices dropped. Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 84
percent of sales outside  Japan , climbed 2 percent after a report
showed U.S. retail sales were better than forecast.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2 percent to 132.61 as
of 1 p.m. in  Tokyo . About five stocks declined for each four
that advanced on the gauge.  “A lack of resolution of Greece’s debt situation adds to
investor uncertainty not only for Greece, but other highly
indebted nations within the European Union,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion in global equities
at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “China increasing its
reserve requirement ratio is a concern. Authorities as yet have
not been able to attain equilibrium.”  ----With assistance from Norie Kuboyama and Satoshi Kawano in
