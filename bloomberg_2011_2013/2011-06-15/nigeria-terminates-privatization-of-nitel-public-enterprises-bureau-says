Nigeria  halted the sale of Nigerian
Telecommunications Ltd. after the second-highest bidder for the
state-owned company failed to meet a payment deadline, the
country’s privatization agency said.  Omen International Ltd. didn’t pay a $105 million bid
security to show it is still interested in Nitel, as the company
is known, “in spite of a grace period granted” to the end of
today, Chukwuma Nwokoh, spokesman for the Bureau of Public
Enterprises, said in an e-mailed statement.  While Nigeria is considering other options, including
liquidating Nitel or a negotiated sale, the government has “not
yet taken a decision as to which of the options to pursue,”
Nwokoh said.  The Abuja-based privatization agency asked Omen
International to confirm its bid on March 14 after New
Generation Group, the winner of the offer, didn’t meet payments
on its bid for the phone company. Omen International had offered
$956 million for Nitel in February 2010, behind New Generation’s
$2.5 billion bid.  Omen had asked for an extension until June 10, according to
the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
