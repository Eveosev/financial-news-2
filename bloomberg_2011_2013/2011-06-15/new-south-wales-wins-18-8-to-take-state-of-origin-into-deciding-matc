New South Wales defeated Queensland
18-8 last night to take Australian rugby league’s State of
Origin into a deciding game as the Blues seek to avoid a record-
extending sixth-straight series loss.  New South Wales rebounded from a 16-12 defeat in last
month’s opener by outscoring the Maroons by three tries to one
at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium. The best-of-three interstate contest
concludes July 6 at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium.  Luke Lewis, Will Hopoate and Anthony Minichiello touched
down for New South Wales, which ensured it will avoid a repeat
of last year’s 3-0 sweep of losses by tying the series at one-
game apiece. Jamie Soward added three conversions.  Cameron Smith  scored a try and Johnathan Thurston kicked
four points for Queensland, which had taken an 8-0 lead.  Queensland, which began its run of titles in 2006, holds a
15-12 lead in series victories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
