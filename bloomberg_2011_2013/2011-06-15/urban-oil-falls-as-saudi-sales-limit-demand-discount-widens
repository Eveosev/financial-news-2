Murban oil declined as  Saudi
Arabia ’s crude sales to Asian refiners cut demand for the grade,
with the discount to its benchmark widening to levels last seen
in August 2010.  The discount for Murban for August loading, produced by Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co., to its official selling price widened 2
cents a barrel to 10 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the deepest discount since Aug. 18. Qatar Land
fell 1 cent a barrel to 21 cents below its official level, the
biggest discount since Aug. 2, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s biggest state-owned oil
producer, has contacted refiners in India and  China  offering
them extra supplies of crude, said refinery officials who asked
to remain unidentified because the negotiations are confidential.  The processors are also shying away from the two grades as
both Abu Dhabi National and Qatar Petroleum issued new official
prices that are at the highest levels since July 2008 when
compared with the benchmark Dubai crude price from publishing
service Platts. The Land grade’s premium to Dubai for last month
rose to $4.27 a barrel, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Murban’s difference climbed to $5.22 a barrel. The higher levels
mean refiners see both types as expensive relative to other
Mideast grades.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell 30 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $111.28 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August declined 0.3 percent
to $110.81. Murban decreased 0.3 percent to $115.68.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for August narrowed
$1.03 to $6.94 a barrel, according to data from London-based
brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The exchange for swaps for
September narrowed 62 cents to $6.38 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery fell $1.39 to $111.39 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:29 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,028 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$112.24 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
