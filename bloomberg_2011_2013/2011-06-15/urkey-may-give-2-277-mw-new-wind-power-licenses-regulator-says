Turkey ’s energy regulator may give
final licenses for 2,277 megawatts of new wind-power plants,
subject to environment assessment reports, Hasan Koktas, head of
the Ankara-based agency said.  The regulator rejected applications for 15,360 megawatts of
wind-power licenses and is studying 23,300 megawatts more for
preliminary licensing, Koktas said in a press release
distributed ahead of an energy conference in Istanbul today.
Wind farm licenses approved by the agency total 5,000 megawatts
so far, including 1,406 megawatts in operation, he said.  The agency asked the central bank and banking regulator to
ease lending restrictions for energy projects as it estimates
Turkey’s annual energy demand rising an average 6.3 percent in
the next 20 years, Koktas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
