Palm oil advanced after a recent
slump in prices widened the discount to  soybean oil  to the
highest in almost three years, increasing the appeal of the
tropical oil for food uses.  The August-delivery contract gained as much as 0.4 percent
to 3,267 ringgit ($1,078) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and was at 3,258 ringgit at 11:52 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. The contract closed at 3,239 ringgit on June 10,
the lowest level since May 12.  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil widened to $214.03 a
ton on June 10, the most since August 2008, and stood at $210.16
today. This compares with a 12-month average of $100.50 a ton,
according to Bloomberg data.  “As a result of the recent fall in crude  palm oil  prices
caused largely by the negative production data for May, the
discount between palm oil and soybean oil has widened,” Hoe Lee Leng, an analyst with RHB Research Institute Sdn, said in a
report today. “We believe these large discounts would
potentially result in price-sensitive countries shifting away
from soyoil and rapeseed oil and back to palm oil.”  Palm oil’s discount to rapeseed oil also widened to $333 a
ton from $282 a ton last month and above historical averages of
$200 a ton, she said.  Malaysia’s palm oil exports rose 25.9 percent to 671,314
tons in the first 15 days of June from the same period in May,
surveyor Intertek said today. Output expanded 13.7 percent to
1.74 million tons in May from April, the highest level in 19
months, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said on June 10.  November-delivery soybeans rose as much as 0.4 percent to
$13.6875 per bushel in  Chicago , while soybean oil for December
delivery gained as much as 0.3 percent to 58.35 cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
climbed as much as 0.3 percent to 9,226 yuan ($1,424) a ton,
before trading at 9,218 yuan. Soybean oil for delivery in the
same month dropped as much as 0.4 percent to 10,272 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
