Elaf Bank B.S.C. , a closely held
lender in  Bahrain , won an international Islamic bank license in
Malaysia that will allow it to conduct Shariah-compliant
business in foreign currencies.  “Elaf Bank’s presence will further strengthen the economic
and financial linkages between Malaysia and Bahrain,” the
Southeast Asian nation’s central bank said in a statement in
Kuala Lumpur today. The lender won’t be allowed to handle
ringgit-denominated transactions, it said.  This is the first of two new Islamic bank licenses the
central bank plans to issue. A permit will also be granted to a
newly created lender that will be jointly set up by financial
institutions from  Asia  and the  Middle East , Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said in October.  Malaysia awarded conventional commercial bank licenses to
five foreign lenders in June last year, including  National Bank
of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD)  and Indonesia’s PT Bank Mandiri.  Kuala Lumpur will be the regional hub for Elaf’s operations
in Southeast Asia, the bank said on its website. “Malaysia is
viewed as an exemplary Islamic finance market,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
