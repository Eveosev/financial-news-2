     June 15 (Bloomberg.com) -- Last week in a talk energy guru
Vaclav Smil made the claim that four cell phones equal one car in
terms of embodied energy from manufacturing. This is not energy
used on daily basis, nor is it a comparison of electrical energy
stored in batteries; this is the energy required to fold, spindle
and mutilate materials into the useful form that we call cars or
cellphones.  Here is the math on the subject, however, from WattzOn. I’m
sure I’m missing something — Smil is a smart guy, and while he
makes many strong claims, they are almost always supported —
because I get nowhere close to 1 cell phone = 0.25 cars in
embodied energy terms.  Click here  to see the story as it appeared on Bloomberg.com.
