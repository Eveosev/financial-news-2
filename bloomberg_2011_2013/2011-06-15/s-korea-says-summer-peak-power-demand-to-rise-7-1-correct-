South Korea ’s summer peak power
consumption may rise between 5.3 percent and 7.1 percent
compared with a year earlier, the state-run Korea Energy
Economics Institute said.  Peak electricity use may reach 73,601 megawatts to 74,846
megawatts this summer, compared with 69,886 megawatts last
summer, the research institute said in an e-mailed statement
today. Reserves may drop to between 4,224 megawatts and 5,469
megawatts, the institute said.  Power tariffs, set by the state, need to take into account
rising manufacturing costs, the institute told government
policymakers in a meeting today. Tariffs must increase to help
curb excessive consumption, according to the statement.  The government controls power prices to contain inflation.
Tariffs were last raised by an average of 3.5 percent in August
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
