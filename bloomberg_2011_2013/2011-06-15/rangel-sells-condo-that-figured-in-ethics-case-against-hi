U.S. Representative Charles Rangel,
censured last year by the House for ethics violations, sold his
Dominican Republic villa that prominently figured in the
charges.  Rangel’s transaction was divulged in financial disclosure
forms released today for members of the House and Senate. They
offer a picture of the financial holdings and dealings of the
lawmakers, listed in broad ranges rather than exact amounts.  Freshman Senator  Marco Rubio , a Florida Republican,
reported owing $100,000 to $250,000 in student loans. Senator
 Maria Cantwell , a Washington state Democrat, still carried loans
of between $1 million and $5 million from her 2000 campaign.  Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, won
$24,835.33 in his state’s lottery.  Senator Scott Brown, the Massachusetts Republican who won
the late Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy’s seat in a special
election last year, reported receiving a $700,000 book advance
for his autobiography published earlier this year. Senator  Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican, received $10,381 in music and book
royalties.  Rangel’s Villa  Rangel, a New York Democrat, reported selling the Punta
Cana Beach Villa in December for between $250,000 and $500,000.  The 81-year-old lawmaker became the first House member
censured in 27 years when the House rebuked him last December.
The charges against Rangel included his failure to pay taxes for
17 years on rental income from the villa. As part of its
resolution, the House voted to require him to pay those taxes.  In other reports,  Senator Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina
Republican, listed earning $1,000 to $2,500 in rent from
Washington property valued at between $500,000 and $1 million.
Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware took in $15,000 to
$50,000 in rent from the Washington property he owned, valued at
between $250,000 and $500,000.  Senator  Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat, and her
husband own a San Francisco hotel valued at between $5 million
and $25 million. Feinstein and her husband also reported owning
a Hawaii condominium, valued at between $1 million and $5
million. Democratic Senator  Tom Harkin  of Iowa and his wife own
a vacation home in the Bahamas, valued at between $500,000 and
$1 million.  Iowa’s Republican senator, Charles Grassley, owns farmland
in his home state valued at between $900,000 and $2 million and
reported spending between $15,000 and $50,000 buying additional
land last year. His family farm operation reported net income of
$76,729.  Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, reported farm
holdings. He is the president of T-Bone Farms in Big Sandy,
Montana, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, with farmland
valued at between $500,000 and $1 million. Ohio Democratic
Senator Sherrod Brown’s family farm was valued at between
$250,000 and $500,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
