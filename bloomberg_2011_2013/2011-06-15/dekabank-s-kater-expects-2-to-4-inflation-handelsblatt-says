Ulrich Kater, chief economist at
DekaBank, expects an inflation rate of 2 to 4 percent for
 Germany  in the coming years, Handelsblatt reported.  Inflation rates will rise because of price increases in
 Asia , above all in  China , which no longer will provide  Europe 
with cheap imports, Handelsblatt cited Kater as saying in an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
