The Trussell Trust, a U.K. charity,
said it fed 61,468 people in Britain in the 12 months ended
March 31, up from 41,000 a year earlier, as food prices and
energy costs accelerated.  “Inflation is causing huge problems for people on low,
static incomes,” Chris Mould, the trust’s chairman, said in a
telephone interview. “A massive number of people being referred
to us are in work. You’ve got six to seven million people in
work for whom their wages are just not enough. A marginal change
in the price of food or energy bills will push them over the
edge.”  The trust has 106 foodbanks nationwide, up from 60 a year
ago. It aims to have 200 by 2013, feeding an estimated 144,000
people, and predicts that foodbanks will have to feed 500,000
people by 2015.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in May from a year earlier
and 0.2 percent from the previous month. The year-on-year
increase matched that recorded in April, the  Office for National
Statistics  said yesterday. The biggest impact on the 12-month
rise came from food and non-alcoholic drinks. Higher energy and
raw-material costs have also put pressure on households.  State benefits rose less than 2 percent, according to the
 Institute for Fiscal Studies , which said last month that the
squeeze is likely to go on as government spending cuts quicken.
It predicted that child poverty will rise by 300,000 by 2014.  “We are working as hard as we can to get as many banks
open as possible, because we are anticipating it will get much
worse for those on marginal incomes,” Mould said. “This is a
‘hidden hunger’ in Britain.”
