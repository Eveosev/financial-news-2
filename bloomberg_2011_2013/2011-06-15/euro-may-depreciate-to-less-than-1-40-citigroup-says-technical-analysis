The euro may fall below $1.40 for
the first time in three weeks, according to Citigroup Inc.,
citing technical indicators.  The failure of the euro to break above $1.4711, the 76.4
percent Fibonacci retracement level from the May 4 high of
$1.4940, has seen the euro weaken 3.3 percent against the
dollar. Today’s break below the 55-day moving average of $1.4409
may see the euro weaken to $1.3970, said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief
technical analyst at Citigroup in New York.  “The inability to break the 76.4 percent retracement level
signaled a danger to push lower,” Fitzpatrick said in an
interview. “The euro is trading heavily, so our sense is we can
go and retest the $1.3968 level and if that breaks there is a
danger we see that move accelerate.”  The euro fell 1.8 percent against the dollar to $1.4185 at
1:14 p.m. in New York, from $1.4440 yesterday. The European
currency touched $1.4181, the weakest since May 27.  Technical analysts who use the Fibonacci ratios described
by Leonardo of Pisa in “Liber Abaci” in 1202 believe the price
of an asset may reverse an earlier gain or decline after
reaching certain levels.  Among those thresholds are the midpoint between an asset’s
high and low points as well as levels marking the recovery of
61.8 percent, 38.2 percent and 23.6 percent of reversals of the
previous trend.  To contact the reporters on this story:
