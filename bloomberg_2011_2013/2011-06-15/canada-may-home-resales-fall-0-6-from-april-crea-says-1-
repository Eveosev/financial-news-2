Canadian existing home sales fell in
May by 0.6 percent, the  Canadian Real Estate Association  said.  Sales fell to 36,410 units on a seasonally adjusted basis,
from 36,621 units in April, the Ottawa-based group said in a
statement sent by e-mail today. Sales during the month were down
0.7 percent in dollar terms and up 12 percent from May last
year. The average sales price was down 0.2 percent on a
seasonally adjusted basis in May, the group said.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  set rules that took effect
March 18 to shorten the maximum amortization period for
government-insured mortgages to 30 years from 35 years and lower
the maximum homeowners can borrow against the value of their
homes, citing concern that Canadians had taken on record debt
levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
