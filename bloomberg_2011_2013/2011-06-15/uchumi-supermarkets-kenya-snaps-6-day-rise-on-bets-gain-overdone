Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer that resumed trading last month after a five-year
suspension due to bankruptcy, fell on speculation its 35 percent
increase in the past six days was overdone.  The shares declined 3.4 percent to 12.80 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi.  “There are people who bought it at 9 shillings and 10
shillings and are picking their gains,” Renaldo D’Souza, an
analyst with Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd. said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
