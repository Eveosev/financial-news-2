Defending Wimbledon champion  Serena Williams  lost in three sets to second-ranked  Vera Zvonareva  in a
grass-court warmup match in Eastbourne, where her sister Venus
won.  Williams lost to the Russian, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 in a
second-round match at the Aegon International grass-court
tournament on  England ’s south coast. Wimbledon starts June 20.  “It was definitely a tough match,” Zvonareva, who lost to
Williams in last year’s Wimbledon final, said in a court-side
interview. “She’s done an unbelievable job coming back after a
year of not playing.”  Williams until this week hadn’t played a professional match
since she won her fourth title at the All England Club in July.
The American, who’s recovered from a foot injury and treatment
for blood clots in her lungs, had been leading 5-3 in the second
set.  Earlier today, five-time Wimbledon champion  Venus Williams 
extended her tennis comeback with a second straight win, beating
former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic of Serbia, 6-3, 6-2.
She’ll play the winner of the match between French Open champion
Li Na from  China  and Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia in the next
round.  “It’s been tough,” Venus Williams, who had been sidelined
with a hip injury for five months before this week, said in a
court-side interview. “My form seems to be better with every
game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
