Greek government bonds led declines
by securities from  Europe ’s most indebted countries as the
region’s finance ministers failed to reach agreement on another
financial rescue for the nation while avoiding a default.  Losses pushed two- and 10-year Greek yields to the highest
since the euro was introduced in 1999, while yields on Irish 10-
year bonds and Portuguese two-year securities also reached
records. Talks may drag into July, Luxembourg’s Finance Minister
Luc Frieden said after an emergency session of finance chiefs in
Brussels yesterday ended with no deal. German bonds gained even
as demand declined at a sale of two-year notes and data showed
European industrial production unexpectedly rose in April.  “The concerns about Greece are stressing the market” for
so-called peripheral bonds, said Norbert Aul, a strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in London. “There’s still uncertainty with
respect to  Greece .”  Greek 10-year bond yields increased 41 basis points to
17.79 percent as of 4:23 p.m. in London. The yield difference,
or spread, versus benchmark German bunds widened to a euro-era
record 1,494 basis points, or 14.94 percentage points. Greek
two-year notes fell for a seventh straight day, driving the
yield as much as 173 basis points higher to 28.15 percent.  Irish 10-year yields rose 11 basis points to 11.49 percent,
posting a seventh consecutive gain. The Portuguese two-year
yield jumped 37 basis points to 12.45 percent.  German, EFSF Auctions  Germany’s two-year notes, perceived to be the region’s
safest securities, gained as the government sold an additional
4.95 billion euros ($7 billion) of the maturity. Investors bid
for 1.4 times the amount on offer, down from a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.9 times in May.  Portugal ’s borrowing costs dropped at a sale of bills
today. The securities due in December were issued at an average
yield of 4.954 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 5.529 percent at a
previous auction of six-month bills on April 20. Demand exceeded
the amount on offer by 3.8 times, compared with 3.7 in April.  The European Financial Stability Facility, the AAA-rated
bailout fund, sold 5 billion euros of 10-year notes at a yield
of 3.49 percent as part of the financial assistance package to
Portugal. The funds will be disbursed to Portugal on June 22,
the EFSF said in a statement.  Spanish bonds declined relative to bunds, pushing the 10-
year spread 13 basis points wider to 258 basis points, before
sales of bonds maturing in 2019 and 2026 tomorrow. The yield on
the country’s 10-year bond increased eight basis points to 5.55
percent.  “ Spain  is underperforming,” RBC’s Aul said. “It’s a
combination of concession-building ahead of tomorrow’s supply,
difficult maturities -- 15 years is always difficult -- and
ongoing discussions on Greece.”  Bund Returns  The German 10-year bund yield declined four basis points to
2.97 percent. It reached 2.94 percent on June 13, the lowest
level since Jan. 12. The 3.25 percent security due July 2021
rose 0.35, or 3.5 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.35.
Yields on two-year notes were seven basis points lower at 1.52
percent. They dropped to 1.51 percent on June 13, the lowest
since March 17.  German  government bonds  have returned 0.1 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
made 2.6 percent. Greek securities handed investors a 16 percent
loss while Portuguese debt fell 17 percent, the indexes show.  Industrial production in the nations that share the euro
rose 0.2 percent in April, after no growth a month earlier, the
European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. The
median estimate of 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a decline of 0.2 percent.  Greek Protests  There is a “likelihood” that the central bank will boost
 interest rates  in July,  European Central Bank  President Jean- Claude Trichet said this week.  While a move is “not certain,”
it was “possible,” Trichet said in an interview two days ago
with  CNN , according to the network’s transcript.  Protesters gathered outside the Greek parliament today as
lawmakers began to debate budget cuts and asset sales. German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
are scheduled to meet in two days in Berlin to resolve their
differences over the terms of a new rescue plan for Greece.  “Any bickering over the solution means any advance on this
issue will probably take longer than expected,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in
Milan.  Standard & Poor’s  slapped Greece with the world’s lowest
credit rating on June 13 and the European Central Bank and
 Germany  clashed over easing the Mediterranean nation’s debt
load. European finance ministers agreed to convene again on June
19. Germany has proposed that maturities on Greek debt be
extended for seven years, which rating companies have said would
amount to a default. Trichet said on June 9 that governments
were flirting with what could be a “enormous mistake.”  The cost of insuring against default on Greek, Irish and
Portuguese government debt surged to records, according to
traders of credit-default swaps. Greece soared 118 basis points
to 1,723 basis points, Portugal climbed 22 to 776 and Ireland
rose 22 to 750, according to CMA prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
