South African stocks declined to the
lowest level in almost three months, led by global mining
companies, as slower-than-estimated U.S. manufacturing output
and concern  China  will raise rates sent metals lower.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index dropped 0.7 percent to
31,011.92 by 4:30 p.m. in Johannesburg. A close at that level
would be the lowest since March 22.  Copper, nickel, lead and zinc retreated in  London  as data
from the  Federal Reserve  showed output at factories, mines and
utilities rose 0.1 percent in May, less than the 0.2 percent
gain forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. China’s
borrowing costs may climb “in weeks, if not days,” according to
an unsigned editorial in the China Daily today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , the diversified mining company that
makes up 9.9 percent of  South Africa ’s benchmark stock index,
fell for the first time in three days, losing 1.6 percent to 318
rand while  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  slipped 1.8 percent to 252.80 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
