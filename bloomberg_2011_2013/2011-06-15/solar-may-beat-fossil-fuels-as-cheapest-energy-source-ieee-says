Electricity from sunlight may become
the most economical source of power within the next 10 years,
according to the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers .  As solar photovoltaic systems become more common and the
technology becomes more efficient, they will reach cost-parity
with fossil fuels, the New York-based trade group said today in
a statement.  Solar power is approaching the point of grid parity, where
the cost of generating power from solar is similar to the cost
of traditional sources, James Prendergast, IEEE’s executive
director, said in an interview yesterday. By “about 2015, we’ll
be at a significant inflection,” and “if you talk about
southern  California , you’re probably already there.”  Worldwide generating capacity for solar photovoltaic
systems has been increasing by about 40 percent a year since
2000. At those rates, solar is expected to provide 11 percent of
total global power by 2050, according to the  International
Energy Association .  “These projections are highly speculative,” Prendergast
said, and solar may provide even more of the world’s power if
adoption accelerates as prices for solar panels fall. “We are
about as close to consensus as you can get that solar will be a
game changer for the generation of energy in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
