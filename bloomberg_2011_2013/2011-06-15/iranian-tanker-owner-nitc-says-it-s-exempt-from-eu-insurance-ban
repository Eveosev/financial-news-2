NITC Co., an Iranian shipowner with
a fleet of 45 tankers, said its vessels are exempt from a ban
that prohibits European Union-based insurers from covering
companies based in the country.  NITC received legal advice its vessels registered in Cyprus
and Malta qualify for an exemption from the measure, according
to a statement from the Tehran-based company distributed by
U.K.-based Denzil Stuart Associates today.  The tanker operator said it arranged so-called hull and
machinery insurance in  Asia  and domestically after it “lost”
the coverage from European providers in May.  Its fleet “routinely” sails to ports in Europe and Asia,
NITC said, adding that it’s not on a list of Iranian companies
targeted by the  United Nations , the EU or the U.S.  The company, formerly known as National Iranian Tanker Co.,
has a fleet that includes 28 very large crude carriers, all
registered in Cyprus or Malta, according to data from  Clarkson
Research  Services. Clarkson Research is a unit of London-based
Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
