WestLB AGâ€™s head of corporate
finance, Volker Bruehl, has quit, the Financial Times
Deutschland reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The unit is likely to be sold under a reorganization plan
imposed by European Union regulators, the newspaper said. Bruehl
will be replaced by Matthias Renner, who currently heads
securitization, according to the FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
