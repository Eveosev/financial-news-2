Vodafone Egypt Telecommunications
Co. received government approval to provide mobile-phone money
transfer once security in the country improves, Chief Executive
Officer Hatem Dowidar said.  “We are ready to press the button when we get clearance on
the security situation” from the National Telecom Regulatory
Authority, Dowidar told Bloomberg on the sidelines of a media
conference in Cairo. “I expect the situation to get better
within two months.”  Mass protests erupted in the North African country on Jan.
25 and lasted for 18 days, culminating in the ouster of former
president  Hosni Mubarak  and the transfer of interim power to the
military. During the uprising, the police withdrew from the
streets and haven’t been fully deployed since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
