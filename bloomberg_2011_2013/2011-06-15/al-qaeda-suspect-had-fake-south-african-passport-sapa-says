A South African passport found in
possession of Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, the suspected head of al-
Qaeda in East Africa, was a fake, the South African Press
Association reported, citing Mkuseli Apleni, the director-
general of the countryâ€™s Department of Home Affairs.  The passport was not issued by any South African authority,
and there was no record of it having been used to enter or leave
the country, Apleni said, according to the Johannesburg-based
 news agency . Mohammed was killed in Mogadishu, Somalia, on June
8, SAPA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
