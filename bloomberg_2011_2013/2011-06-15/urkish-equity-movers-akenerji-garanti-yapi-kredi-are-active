Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 763.80, or 1.2 percent, to 60,952.88, at 4:32 p.m. in
Istanbul, snapping two days of increases.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Acibadem Saglik Hizmetleri & Ticaret AS (ACIBD TI), a
hospital chain, rose for a second day, adding 1.5 liras, or 6.5
percent, to 23.90 liras. Dubai-based owner Abraaj Capital Ltd.
hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch
to find a buyer for Acibadem or offer its shares on the market,
two people with knowledge of the sale said just before markets
closed on June 17. The shares have risen 16 percent since the
June 16 close.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  , Turkey’s biggest
bank by market value, led declines among banks on the index,
dropping 22 kurus, or 3.1 percent, to 6.88 liras. Additional
measures announced over the weekend to curb lending in Turkey
will cut banking-industry profit by about 1 percent, analysts
including BGC’s Muge Dagistan said.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL TI), Turkey’s
biggest mobile operator, rose 10 kurus, or 1.2 percent, to 8.76
liras. The company will save about 300 million liras ($188
million) a year after starting to charge a wireless network
usage fee to prepaid subscribers from today, Radikal newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. The
company previously paid the amount to the government itself, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
