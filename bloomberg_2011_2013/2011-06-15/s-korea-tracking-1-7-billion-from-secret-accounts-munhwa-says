South Korea ’s tax agency is trying
to find out who is responsible for illegally moving 1.8 trillion
won ($1.7 billion) of money out of the country between 2006 and
2008 and into secret Swiss bank accounts, the Munhwa Ilbo
reported. The money then made its way back into South Korea and
was invested in the local stock market, according to the Korean-
language report, which cited an official it didn’t identify at
the National Tax Service.  Officials at the National Tax Service weren’t immediately
available to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
