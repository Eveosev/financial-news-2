Thailand ’s baht weakened toward a
three-month low as concern elections slated for July 3 will
spark unrest prompted overseas investors to pull money from the
nation’s assets.  The baht dropped 0.6 percent this month as global funds
sold $679 million more Thai equities than they bought. Latest
polls show Prime Minister  Abhisit Vejjajiva ’s Democrat party is
trailing main challenger Pheu Thai, led by Yingluck Shinawatra,
the sister of ex-leader  Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a
2006 coup and lives abroad after fleeing a two-year jail
sentence.  “The election is weighing quite heavily on the baht and
Thai assets,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “The political problems
in Thailand seem to be quite deep and can’t be easily solved.”  The baht lost 0.1 percent to 30.49 per dollar as of 3:53
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 30.54 on June 13, the weakest level since March
3. It may weaken beyond 30.50 this month, Nishihama said.  A Bangkok University poll showed Pheu Thai leading in 21 of
the capital’s 33 constituencies. The Democrat party was ahead in
six districts, while six others were too close to call,
according to the survey of 3,323 citizens from June 2 to June 9.
The poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was at 3.285 percent from
3.280 percent yesterday. The yield on the 5.25 percent bond due
May 2014 was little changed at 3.45 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
