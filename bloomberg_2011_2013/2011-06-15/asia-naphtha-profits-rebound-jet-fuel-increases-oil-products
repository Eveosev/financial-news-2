Asia naphtha profits rose from the
lowest in 10 months as crude costs declined. Jet fuel’s premium
to gasoil extended gains.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude 
climbed to $74.04 a metric ton from $60.67 at the end of Asian
trading yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread yesterday was the narrowest since August. It
advanced as Brent futures dropped from yesterday’s six-week high
of $120.16 a barrel in  London  on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will threaten the region’s economic recovery.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  rose $9,
or 0.9 percent, to $969 a ton, the highest in three days,
Bloomberg data showed.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline gained $1.65, or 1.4 percent, to
$121.55 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. Gasoline’s premium to
naphtha increased 65 cents to $15.90. The wider reforming margin
indicates it is more profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline.  PetroChina Co. sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline for
July 5 to July 9 loading to Vitol Group at $121.60 a barrel,
traders said. Vitol sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half
August delivery to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $968 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose 85 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $131.85 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
data. Jet fuel climbed 70 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $132.85.
Each product increased for a second day.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell 52
cents to $20.63 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, dropped the most since June 6.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 10 cents to $1.10 a
barrel, the highest since June 1, PVM said. This regrade widened
for a fifth day, the longest rising streak in a month,
indicating it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel .  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil dropped $6, or 0.9
percent, to $667.25 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The
price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel,
declined $5, or 0.8 percent, to $655. Each variety fell to the
lowest since June 7.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 63 cents to
$7.36 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. This means losses for
turning oil into residual products were the biggest in three
weeks.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was down $1 at $12.25 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. This
viscosity spread has widened 23 percent in the past week,
meaning bunker prices have lagged behind gains for higher-
quality  fuel oil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
