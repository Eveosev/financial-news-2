Copper’s 2 1/2-year rally remains
intact above $8,400 to $8,600 a metric ton because that was the
peak of the last  bull market , according to technical analysis by
Jim Stellakis, an independent analyst.  The attached chart shows prices were capped at about $8,600
from February to July 2008, before falling as recession sapped
demand. The rebound that began five months later breached the
previous ceiling in December, closing at $9,600 that month. The
metal has dropped about 10 percent since reaching a record
$10,190 on Feb. 15.  “Interest came back during last month’s drop,” said
Stellakis, founder of Technical Alpha, a New York-based research
company. “The $8,600-$8,400 area seemed to be a level that
sellers controlled for much of 2008. And since those sellers
have been cleared out, $8,600-$8,400 should be monthly support
after December’s rally.”  Prices tripled since the end of 2008 as mining companies
failed to keep pace with demand, creating shortages for a second
consecutive year, according to  Barclays Capital . Raw-material
producers are contending with higher costs for everything from
steel to energy to wages while extracting ores that contain ever
smaller amounts of metal.  Copper for delivery in three months, a global benchmark,
closed at $9,169 on the  London  Metal Exchange yesterday. Prices
may reach $12,000 by Dec. 31, according to Barclays, which is
forecasting that production will fall 677,000 tons short of
demand, equal to 3.3 percent of consumption.  Technical Strategist  Barclays technical strategist Lynnden Branigan last week
said the commodity may drop to $8,670 within two weeks if it
completed a so-called bear-flag pattern. It closed at $8,912 on
June 13, below the $9,072 level needed to form the indicator
where price movements resemble an inverted flag on a pole.  “It’s not unusual for the market to pull back, and the
longer term outlook looks fine,” Stellakis said. “The area
around the 200-day moving average is acting as support right
now. The trend of the 200-day moving average is still up.”  Copper’s 200-day moving average is at $8,964.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Some analysts and traders use a
combination of indicators and levels to form both short- and
long-term forecasts.  An “upside bias” will continue as long as the metal
remains above the 200-day moving average,  Karen Jones , a
technical analyst at Commerzbank AG in London, said last week in
a report. A failure to hold that level may push prices down to
the 55-week moving average, currently at $8,463, she said.  Fibonacci Analysis  Prices may also climb to $9,347 to $9,546, which would be a
50 percent and 61.8 percent retracement of the decline from the
record in February. They are levels singled out in so-called
Fibonacci analysis.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices tend
to drop or climb by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low. Moving averages can signal directional trends for a
security.  Copper’s 14-day relative strength index, a technical
indicator of price momentum, is at 53.42. A reading of 30 or
less, derived from averaging gains or losses over 14 days,
indicates prices may be poised to rise, while a reading of 70 or
more signals the opposite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
