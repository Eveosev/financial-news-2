The  Zimbabwe  Electricity Supply
Authority, known as Zesa, loses out on about $642 million
dollars a year in potential revenue because of power outages and
poor billing systems, the  Herald  reported, citing former Zesa
Chief Executive Officer Francis Masawi.  Zimbabwe should let private power suppliers compete with
Zesa, the Harare-based state-controlled newspaper cited Masawi
as saying on its website.  A joint venture between Green Fuel Ltd. and the government
will generate 18.5 megawatts to the national grid, the Herald
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
