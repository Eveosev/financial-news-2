Malaysia ’s ringgit gained for a
second day on speculation policy makers across Asia will raise
 interest rates  to cool inflation.  The currency extended a rebound from a three-week low after
a report showed unemployment fell in  South Korea  last month and
economists forecast data will show retail sales in Singapore
grew in April. Industrial output rose more than predicted last
month in China, while consumer prices climbed in both China and
India last month.  “There’s room for one more rate hike across Asia in the
shor term given the inflation pressure, which should support
currencies,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a strategist at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Further out, growth is
tailing off a bit and Europe remains a risk.”  The ringgit climbed 0.1 percent to 3.0273 per dollar as of
9:06 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 3.0470 on June 13, the weakest
level since May 26 amid concern about Europe debt crisis.  Inflation in Malaysia accelerated to 3.2 percent in April
from a year earlier, the fastest since March 2009, following
increases in retail fuel and sugar prices. The statistics
department will report May data on June 22. The government
raised electricity prices by an average 7.1 percent this month.  Bank Negara Malaysia raised its overnight policy rate to 3
percent from 2.75 percent on May 5, saying growth is firmly on a
steady path. Policy makers next meet on July 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
