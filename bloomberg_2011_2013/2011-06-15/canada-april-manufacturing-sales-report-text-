The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for April released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales decreased 1.3% (-$612 million) in April to
$46.7 billion. The transportation equipment sector accounted for
most of the decline. Manufacturers in the petroleum and coal
products industry also reported lower sales. The decrease in total
manufacturing sales for April reversed much of the 1.9% gain for
March.  Lower sales were reported in 15 of 21 industries, representing
about 56% of total manufacturing.  Constant dollar manufacturing sales declined 1.8% in April.  Transportation equipment sales decrease  In the transportation equipment sector, sales fell 7.8% to $7.0
billion in April. The decline reflected an 8.6% drop in the motor
vehicle industry and a 5.4% decrease in the  motor vehicle  parts
industry. Manufacturers in both industries reported that the
tsunami in  Japan  affected the availability of some inputs.

____  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are
expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified.  Preliminary data are provided for the current reference month.
Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for the three
previous months.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and tobacco
products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing, leather
and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-metallic
mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal products,
machinery, computer and electronic products, electrical equipment,
appliances and components, transportation equipment, furniture and
related products and miscellaneous manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the  aerospace industry  and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly sales
of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories of
goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute to
future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current month
or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for the
current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the previous
month to the current month.

____  Production in the aerospace product and parts industry fell
11.6% in April to $1.2 billion. Manufacturers in the petroleum and
coal products industry reported a 1.7% decline, stemming entirely
from reduced volumes by some manufacturers.  Higher sales were led by gains in the food (+1.8%), machinery
(+3.2%) and chemical (+1.7%) industries.  Manufacturing sales down in most provinces  In April, nine provinces posted lower sales compared with
March, with the largest decreases in dollar terms occurring in
Ontario and  Quebec .  In Ontario, sales decreased 1.8% to $20.7 billion. The decline
was largely attributable to an 8.5% drop in motor vehicle and a
5.2% decrease in motor vehicle parts sales. The machinery (-3.2%),
petroleum and coal products (-2.0%) and printing and related
support activities (-6.2%) industries also contributed to the
provincial decrease. A 2.6% gain in the  food industry  partly
offset the overall decline.  Sales declined 1.3% in Quebec to $11.5 billion as a result of a
12.7% drop in production in the aerospace product and parts
industry. Higher sales in the petroleum and coal products (+3.4%),
food (+2.2%) and chemical (+5.2%) industries partly offset the
decline in aerospace.  Sales decreases in Nova Scotia (-5.9%), Saskatchewan (-5.3%)
and Newfoundland and Labrador (-7.5%) were related to lower sales
in the non-durable goods industries.  Alberta was the only province to post an increase in April,
with sales rising 2.3% to $5.9 billion. Sales in Alberta were at
their highest level since October 2008. The advance in April was
related to sales gains in the machinery (+16.7%) and fabricated
metal product (+16.6%) industries.  Inventory levels continue to rise  Inventory levels increased 1.2% in April to $62.7 billion,
their highest level since May 2009. The gain in April was led by a
3.3% increase in the primary metals industry, reflecting in part
higher finished product inventories.  Petroleum and coal product inventories advanced 3.1% in April,
led by higher prices.  Increased levels of inventories were also reported by
manufacturers in the machinery (+2.5%) and aerospace products and
parts (+3.4%) industries.  The inventory-to-sales ratio increased from 1.31 in March to
1.34 in April, bringing the ratio to the highest level since
September 2010.  Unfilled orders up again  Unfilled orders rose for the fourth consecutive month, edging
up 0.4% to $57.6 billion. Following a 9.6% increase in March,
unfilled orders remained at their highest level since June 2009.  The rise in unfilled orders was largely driven by the railroad
rolling stock (+25.3%), machinery (+4.5%) and fabricated metal
product (+1.8%) industries. A 2.0% decline in the aerospace
product and parts industry mostly offset these gains.  Excluding the aerospace industry, unfilled orders in the
manufacturing sector rose 2.4% to $31.6 billion.  New orders declined 10.3% to $46.9 billion in April, reversing
most of the 11.5% increase reported in March. Much of the decrease
in new orders came from the aerospace industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
