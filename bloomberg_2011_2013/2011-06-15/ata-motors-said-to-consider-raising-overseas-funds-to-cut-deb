Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, is considering raising funds overseas to
reduce debt, said two bankers familiar with the matter.  The company may raise about $500 million in external
commercial bonds, the bankers said, declining to be identified
as the information is private. The plan is still in its early
stages and the company is considering the option of a perpetual
bond, one of the bankers said.  Tata,  India ’s biggest maker of trucks and buses, paid $2.4
billion to acquire Jaguar and the Land Rover sport-utility
vehicle brand from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in June 2008. The company will
invest 5 billion pounds ($8.2 billion) in the U.K. in the coming
years, Chief Executive Officer Carl-Peter Forster said on May 6,
without giving a time frame.  Chief Financial Officer Chandrasekaran Ramakrishnan said on
May 26 that Tata Motors will spend 1.5 billion pounds annually
on capital expenditure on Jaguar Land Rover. Tata Motors had net
debt of 320 billion rupees ($7.2 billion) as of March 31, he
said.  “Tata Motors raises  debt capital  from time to time to
increase its debt maturity profile and reduce its interest
cost,” spokesman Debasis Ray said in an e-mailed response to
questions on June 10. He declined to comment specifically on
plans for an overseas bond sale.  Tata Motors shares rose 1 percent to 994.15 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The stock has declined 24 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent decline in the benchmark
Sensitive Index.  Jaguar Land Rover sold $1.63 billion of seven- and 10-year
senior unsecured notes last month to refinance debt, the company
said in a statement on May 13. The company sold $410 million of
7.75 percent notes and 500 million pounds ($818 million) of
8.125 percent debt due in May 2018, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The unit of Mumbai-based Tata Motors also issued
$410 million of 8.125 percent, 10-year securities, the data
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
