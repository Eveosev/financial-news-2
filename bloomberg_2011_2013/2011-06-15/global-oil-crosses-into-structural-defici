     June 15 (Bloomberg.com) -- I’m on the record as a long-term
bull on  oil prices , with us likely to see repeated spikes over
the coming decade as weak new supply wars with stubbornly high
economic growth in  emerging markets . Periodically, high oil
prices will, at best, tip us into recession, and prices will
bounce back and forth until something breaks, whether in supply
or demand.  New analysis from RigZone reinforces this view. Picking up
from where some related analysis from The Economist left off, and
using new BP data, we have the following graph. It shows that
oil, on an annual supply/demand basis, crossed over into
structural supply deficits in 2005 and has never climbed back.
Granted, this does not include biofuels, coal-oil, etc., which BP
doesn’t track, but still thought-provoking.  Click here  to see the story as it appeared on Bloomberg.com.
