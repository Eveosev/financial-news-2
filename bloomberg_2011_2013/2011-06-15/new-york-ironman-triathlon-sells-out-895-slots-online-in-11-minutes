The inaugural  New York  City  Ironman 
triathlon race sold out its regular $895 slots online in 11
minutes, organizer World Triathlon Corp. said in a press
release.  The race, scheduled for Aug. 11, 2012, still has $1,500
slots available, with the additional $605 going to Ironman
Foundation charities, according to spokeswoman Jessica
Weidensall.  The organization doesn’t reveal how many of the 2,500 spots
in the race were sold for $895 and how many were held for the
$1,500 charitable donation, Weidensall said. The majority of the
slots were $895.  The New York Ironman, the first held in the city, is the
most-expensive triathlon in the series. A typical Ironman race
costs $575.  “It’s definitely exciting to do a race in your hometown,”
said Michele Lamberti, 40, an ABS analyst at Deutsche Bank in
New York, who got an entry to New York today. “It’s such a big
sport here now. The course sounds great.”  The race consists of a 2.4-mile swim in the  Hudson River ,
a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run. Competitors have 17
hours to finish.  Ironman Foundation has donated $10 million to charitable
causes around the world since its inception in 2003, according
to the World Triathlon release.  For the New York City race, Ironman Foundation is joining
with more than 20 charities, including  Robin Hood Foundation , to
use the event for fundraising, said Charles Macintosh, a
mortgage trader at Morgan Keegan Inc. and a member of Robin Hood
Foundation team. Robin Hood has about 50 charity slots available
with a fundraising target of $5,950.  To contact the reporters on this story:
