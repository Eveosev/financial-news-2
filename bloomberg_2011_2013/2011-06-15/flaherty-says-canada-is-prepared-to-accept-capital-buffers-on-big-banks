Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said his country is “prepared” to accept additional
 capital requirements  for so-called systemically important
financial institutions.  Flaherty, speaking to reporters today in  New York , said he
doesn’t think additional buffers currently being proposed by
regulators would bring capital requirements above levels that
already exist in  Canada .  “Some countries feel that it is necessary to impose some
additional capital requirements on systemically important
financial institutions and that’s a situation that we are
prepared to accept, depending on the level that is being
proposed,” Flaherty said, adding he is a “believer” of
effective supervision of banks regardless of their size.  Global regulators are discussing forcing so-called global
systemically important financial institutions to hold additional
capital buffers, in proposals that will be decided on by leaders
of Group of 20 nations this year.  Flaherty said a focus on the largest banks may be short-
sighted.  “I realize that we are not capable in an imperfect world
of predicting exactly where the next crisis will come from and
we ought not to assume that it will only be from a large
systemically important financial institution,” he said.  Flaherty also said he is “hopeful” that the  U.S. economy 
will be able to maintain a “modest” rate of expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
