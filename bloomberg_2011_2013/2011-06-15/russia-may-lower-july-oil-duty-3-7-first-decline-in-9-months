Russia  will probably decrease the
export duty on most crude shipments by 3.7 percent on July 1,
the first decline since October after  oil prices  fell.  The standard duty will probably drop to $445.10 a metric
ton ($60.72 a barrel) from $462.10 a ton in June, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on  Finance Ministry  data. Oil taxes
are at the highest this month since a record $495.90 in August
and September 2008.  The discounted rate for oil shipped from 19 east Siberian
fields and from two Caspian Sea deposits may decline to $205.80
a ton from $217.50 in June. OAO Rosneft’s Vankor project, TNK-
BP’s Verkhnechonsk and OAO Surgutneftegas’s Talakan have had to
pay full taxes since May 1 and remain taxed at the full rate
next month, according to the Finance Ministry’s proposals.  Brent and Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, have slid
in the past month on speculation fuel demand may slow with
economic growth. Russia sets its export duties based on Urals
prices from the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the
next. Urals averaged $112.65 during the past monitoring period,
 Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone
today.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign the draft for the
rates to come into effect.  A special tax on gasoline that Putin imposed starting May 1
to fight domestic shortages may be broadened to cover naphtha
and other light distillates in July, Sakovich said. The duty may
be lowered to $400.50 a ton from $415.80 this month. That is 90
percent of the crude duty.  The export tax on light oil products may be cut to $298.20
a ton from $309.60. The duty on heavy products may be lowered to
$207.80 a ton from $215.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
