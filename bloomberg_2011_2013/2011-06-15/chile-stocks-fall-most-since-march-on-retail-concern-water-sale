Chile’s benchmark stock index
declined the most in two months on speculation that retailers
may face increased lending restrictions and as investors sold
stocks to buy water utility shares from the government.  The IPSA fell 1.6 percent to 4,572.09 at 4:07 p.m. New York
time, the biggest drop since April 12. Steel producer  Cap SA (CAP) 
retreated to its lowest almost ten months and retailer Cencosud
SA slid the most in two months.  Chile’s government raised $982 million by selling a 29
percent stake in Aguas Andinas SA on the Santiago exchange
today.  Empresas Hites SA (HITES)  has led declines by department-store
operators after rival  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR)  said June 9 that it
may have to raise provisions for bad loans by 200 billion pesos
($427 million) because of irregular loan practices. La Polar has
been on a trading halt since June 13 after slumping 39 percent.  “Global equities are in the red, there are concerns of
stricter regulations for retailers’ financial operations and
there’s also the sale of the government’s stake in Aguas
Andinas,” Hernan Campos, head of research at asset manager WAC
Inversiones, said in a phone interview today. “People are
selling positions in other shares to pay for Aguas.”  Aguas Andinas,  Chile ’s biggest water utility, fell 4.6
percent to 248.17 pesos after the government sold 1.83 billion
shares for 250 pesos each.  Hites, which like La Polar caters to middle- and lower-
income earners, fell 5.9 percent to 561.78 pesos, extending a
slump since La Polar’s announcement to 18 percent.  Cap, Chile’s largest steel producer, fell 3.5 percent to
20,258 pesos as base metal prices fell. Cencosud,  Latin
America ’s largest retailer by sales, lost 3.5 percent to 3,248
pesos.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell the most in two weeks
amid rising concern for a Greek bailout and growing signs that
the American economy is slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
