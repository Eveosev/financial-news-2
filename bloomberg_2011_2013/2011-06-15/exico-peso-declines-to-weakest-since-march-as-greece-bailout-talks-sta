Mexico’s peso dropped to the weakest
level in 10 weeks as European leaders were unable to agree on
how to deal with the Greek financial crisis, driving the euro
lower and reducing demand for riskier assets.  The peso fell 1 percent to 11.9152 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m. New York time, from 11.7972 yesterday. Earlier, the
currency declined to the weakest level since March 31.  “The crisis in  Europe  is dictating all the movements in
the market right now,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at
Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey. “The finance
ministers were unable to agree on terms and that is making the
market nervous.”  The peso has gained 3.6 percent against the dollar this
year, the third-best performer among the major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg after  Colombia ’s peso and
 Brazil ’s real.  The cost to insure Greek and Portuguese debt rose to
records as European officials failed to agree on a rescue plan
for  Greece  at an emergency session of finance ministers
yesterday. The euro fell as much as 2 percent to $1.4156. Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will name a new government
tomorrow and call a vote of confidence in parliament, a move to
pressure revel lawmakers to back the austerity plan that would
lead to a new bailout.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 fell 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.22 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.18 centavo to 123.85 centavos per peso.  Dollar Options  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. None of the options
have been exercised this month. The bank has been buying as much
as $600 million through the options monthly since March 2010,
boosting foreign reserves and curbing the peso’s gain.  Foreign reserves rose to a record $129.6 billion in the
week ending June 10, the central bank said yesterday.  The central bank sold 133 billion pesos ($11.2 billion) of
Cetes bills today in an extraordinary auction from its holdings,
the agency said on its website. The bank had planned to auction
as much as 145 billion pesos of the securities, as it seeks to
remove liquidity from the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
