German power for next-year delivery
was little changed near its highest in two weeks.  Baseload power for 2012 fell 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
60 euros ($86.21) a megawatt-hour at 10 a.m. Berlin time,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. It traded
yesterday as high as 60.40 euros. Baseload is delivered around
the clock.  The benchmark climbed to a two-year high on May 31,
climbing to 60.90 euros after  Europe ’s biggest economy hastened
its exit from nuclear energy. Germany is the largest nation to
abandon atomic power after the March disaster at Japan’s
Fukushima plant stoked concerns about nuclear safety.  Germany’s 17 reactors generated 23 percent of the country’s
electricity last year.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered the halt
of the country’s seven oldest reactors after the Japan crisis.  Brent crude  for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to $120.09 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil
prices  affect the cost of coal and natural gas, fuels used at
power stations in Europe.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullet Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
