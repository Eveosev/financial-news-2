U.S. ethanol production slumped 3.8
percent to 880,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department, the steepest drop since April 15.  Output was the lowest since the week ended May 6.
Stockpiles grew 0.5 percent to 19.7 million barrels from 19.6
million, the department said, enough to supply the market for
22.3 days.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
surged 5.2 percent to a record 5.2 million barrels a day. Thatâ€™s
the biggest gain since Feb. 18. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax
credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery sank 2.1 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.73 a gallon at 10:44 a.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have climbed 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
