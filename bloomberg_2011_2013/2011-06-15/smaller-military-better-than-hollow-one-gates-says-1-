A smaller, capable military is
better than a larger “hollow” one, Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  told the Senate in budget testimony today.  Gates said that meeting President  Barack Obama ’s goal of
$400 billion in cutbacks over 12 years means “real cuts,” not
only finding efficiencies.  Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said that military health care costs are “eating us alive.”
Gates, testifying with Mullen, said the health system is “not
sustainable” without higher fees.  Gates said Congress should also consider reducing benefits
for working-age military retirees. He acknowledged that was
‘politically challenging’ to accomplish.  The reductions in force size and benefits would help
protect other programs, Gates and Mullen said.  Gates told the Senate Appropriations Committee that he is
“very concerned” by a House-approved cut of $1 billion in
funding for a program to modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons.  Spending on modernizing the nation’s aging nuclear arsenal
was part of an accord with the Senate when it ratified the New
START treaty with  Russia , he said. That accord calls for
reducing the number of strategic nuclear weapons held by both
countries over the next seven years.  Gates and Mullen also warned against closing foreign
military bases and pulling back into a “fortress America.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
