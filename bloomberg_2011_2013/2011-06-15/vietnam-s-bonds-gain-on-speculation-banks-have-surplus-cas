Vietnam ’s bonds rose, driving down
five-year yields to the lowest level in four weeks, on
speculation banks have more cash to invest in government debt.  “Demand for bonds increased a lot from banks, especially
private ones, as cash liquidity has improved lately,” said Vu Anh Duc, a fixed-income dealer at Vietnam Bank for Industry and
Trade. “Many banks chose to invest in bonds when lending is
capped at 20 percent by the central bank.”  Vietnam’s State Treasury sold all of the 3 trillion dong
($146 million) of three- and five-year notes on offer at its
most recent sale on June 10, according to the Hanoi Stock
Exchange, where the auction took place. There were 18 bidders,
compared with seven at a debt offering on May 12, when the
Treasury only sold 100 billion dong of a planned 2 trillion dong,
according to figures from the exchange.  The yield on the five-year securities dropped 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 12.55 percent, the lowest
level since May 19, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,575 per dollar as of 4:38 p.m. in
Hanoi, little changed from 20,565 yesterday, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the dong’s daily reference rate at
20,618, unchanged this week. The currency is allowed to
fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
