House Republican leader  Eric Cantor ’s argument that economic uncertainty keeps large amounts
of investment capital on the sidelines is informed by personal
experience.  Cantor, 48, lists cash holdings with a value ranging from
$452,000 to $1.03 million in bank, money-market and credit-union
accounts on his annual financial disclosure statement released
yesterday.  “One of the reasons why we continue to see an ailing
economy is that people have very little confidence” and feel
“very little certainty,” and that “negatively impacts their
willingness to put capital to work and create jobs” Cantor said
at a June 13 news conference.  Cantor listed financial assets, including stocks and
holdings on bond funds, that he valued between $2.6 million and
$6.75 million.  The Virginia lawmaker’s disclosure report ranked him as
potentially the wealthiest among the new House Republican
leadership. House Speaker  John Boehner , a one-time Ohio small
business owner, listed assets ranging from about $1.97 million
to $5.8 million.  House Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy of California listed
assets valued at between $114,016 and $485,000 that included a
mix of mutual fund and stock investments.  Pelosi Report  The wealth of the two top House Republicans pales in
comparison to House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi , the former
speaker. The California Democrat and her husband, San Francisco
commercial real estate investor Paul Pelosi, reported a net
worth of at least $34 million in 2010, according to her
disclosure statement.  House Minority Leader  Steny Hoyer , of Maryland, is one of
the least wealthy members of Congress. The House’s second-
ranking Democrat listed bank-account and money market accounts
valued between $18,001 and $96,000.  In the Senate, Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Democrat,
reported assets ranging from about $2.9 million to $9.4 million,
with much of his net worth tied up in real estate holdings in
his home state of Nevada and in Arizona. He also disclosed a
personal loan of between $50,001 and $100,000 to his re-election
campaign last year.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky
Republican, reported assets ranging in value from $4.8 million
to $19.8 million -- most of them held by his wife, Elaine Chao,
who served as labor secretary throughout former President George W. Bush’s eight years in office.  Condominium Investment  In addition to cash, Cantor and his wife, Diana, a former
Goldman, Sachs & Co. vice president who is now a partner in
 Alternative Investment Management LLC,  also own an Arlington,
Virginia, condominium valued between $500,001 to $1 million.  The unit produces rental income ranging from $15,001 to
$50,000 annually, Cantor’s statement said.  A major theme of the Republican critique of President
Barack Obama’s policies is that economic doubts due to spiraling
government deficits and the fear of higher taxes has stifled job
growth.  That is because investors and small businesses won’t commit
capital needed to expand production and services that leads to
more hiring, Republicans argues.  Cantor repeatedly asserts that deficit reduction through
cuts in  government spending , not higher taxes, is needed to
encourage business investment to lower the U.S. jobless rate of
9.1 percent.  “You do that by creating an environment for the private
sector to put capital at risk and to grow,” Cantor said at an
April 12 news conference.  Retirement Account  The Cantors’ cash is held in accounts at Bank of America
Corp., BB&T Corp. and the  Virginia Credit Union , the statement
said. He also listed $100,001 to $250,000 from an individual
retirement account in the Goldman Sachs Financial Square Money
Market Fund, which invests in U.S. government securities.  The Cantors’ investments include some stock and corporate
bond holdings, such as shares in Qualcomm Inc., a maker of
digital wireless communications equipment that are valued from
$100,001 and $250,000.  They also listed a note in a commercial real estate venture
called Richmond Resources Hickory Park LLC, valued between
$500,001 and $1 million, and another note, valued between
$250,001 and $500,000 in Richmond Resources Ltd., a real estate
development firm.  The couple also held stock valued between $250,001 and
$500,000 in another Richmond real estate venture called Water
Tower Associates LLC.  Range of Figures  Financial disclosure forms filed by members of Congress
require lawmakers to state the value of holdings in broad
ranges. Precise figures aren’t made public.  The Cantors also held $50,001 to $100,000 worth of
Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-services company and $15,001 to
$50,000 worth of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s largest oil
company.  Diana Cantor, who heads the Virginia State Retirement
System, is a director of Media General Inc., a Richmond-based
newspaper and broadcast company and Domino’s Pizza Inc. Cantor
lists his wife’s Domino’s  stock options  at more than $100,001.
Diana Cantor also received as deferred compensation stock in
Media General valued between $250,001 and $500,000.  Boehner’s report showed that a portion of his holdings was
in an individual retirement account that owns shares in
companies such as Decatur, Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  of  New York .  Bank Accounts  Boehner reported cash balances in bank accounts ranging
from $51,000 to $115,000.  The House speaker, who sold his plastics packaging-sales
company while he was still in the minority leadership, also
reported that he and his wife, Debbie, jointly own more than a
dozen mutual funds. Boehner disclosed he has at least $50,001
in an Ohio public employee retirement pension plan.  Leading sources of Boehner’s unearned income included
$15,001 to $50,000 in dividends and  capital gains  from American
Funds’ Growth Fund of America, and $15,001 to $50,000 in similar
investment income from the Davis New York Venture fund.  Boehner, 61, also reported that he took a paid trip from an
outside group in the spring of last year. He received a one-way
trip to  Palm Beach ,  Florida , from the  Club for Growth , a group
that supports low taxes and reduced government spending and
gives to Republican candidates that support its agenda. Boehner
spoke at an event hosted by the group, said  Michael Steel , the
speaker’s spokesman.  Duke Energy  McCarthy owns shares in companies that include Alexander
and Baldwin Inc., a Honolulu-based freight and property
management company, and Duke Energy Corp., the Charlotte,  North
Carolina , power utility.  McCarthy, 46, also reported a March 2010 publishing deal
for the book “Young Guns” that he co-wrote with Cantor and
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin
Republican. The book, produced last year before the elections in
which Republicans gained control of the House, laid out elements
of the party’s agenda.  Pelosi, 71, who yielded the speakership to Boehner after
Republicans won control of the House, and her husband own a St.
Helena,  California , vineyard, valued between $5 million and $25
million.  Pelosi’s minimum net worth increased 56 percent in 2010
from $21.9 million in 2009. The maximum net value of the
couple’s assets in 2010 could be as high as $185 million.  Miner’s Son  Reid, the son of a Nevada hard-rock miner, has amassed his
wealth with holdings in bonds and stock mutual funds and other
investments. His largest sources of unearned income last year
stemmed from bonds that matured during 2010.  Reid, 71, also disclosed that he got a free trip back to
Nevada on Dec. 23 on a jet plane thanks to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. Reid disclosed the gift was
worth $14,500, according to a value established by the Senate
Ethics Committee.  Hoyer reported that, in addition to his annual salary of
$193,400 last year when he was House majority leader, he
collected a $20,481 pension for his prior service as a  Maryland 
legislator.  In addition, Hoyer, 72, sold mutual funds valued between
$166,000 and $415,000 and placed the proceeds in a thrift
savings program, according to the report.  McConnell, 69, disclosed that Chao, his wife, is largely
invested in stock mutual funds, although the disclosure form
shows she sold as much as $100,000 in restricted stock in Dole
Food Co. Inc. She has served on the company’s board of directors
since 2009.  Chao earned income from about half a dozen speeches to
groups including the American Chamber of Commerce. She also
spoke at events at Corning Inc., Dole Foods and Vanguard Group
Inc. The couple jointly owns shares in some Vanguard mutual
funds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
