European coal prices fell from their
highest close in six weeks.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year fell $1.40, or 1.1 percent, to $130.50 by
2:26 p.m. in  London . It closed yesterday at its highest level
since May 4. Prices have gained 19 percent in the past year.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for the next
month, the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 6.03 euros
($8.62) a megawatt-hour, compared with 7.11 euros from burning
natural gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest energy consumer,
and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were 1.5 percent lower at 16.26 euros a
ton. Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012
to the U.K., Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, declined 0.9
percent to 67.20 pence ($1.09) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
