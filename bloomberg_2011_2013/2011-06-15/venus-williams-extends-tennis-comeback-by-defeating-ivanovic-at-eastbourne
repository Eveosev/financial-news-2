Five-time Wimbledon champion  Venus Williams  extended her tennis comeback with another win, beating
former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic in Eastbourne, England,
in straight sets.  Williams defeated the former world No. 1 from Serbia, 6-3,
6-2 in the round of 16 at the Aegon International grass-court
tournament on England’s south coast. She’ll play the winner of
the match between French Open champion Li Na from  China  and
Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia in the next round.  “It’s been tough,” Williams, who had been sidelined with
a hip injury for five months before this week, said in a court-
side interview. “My form seems to be better with every game.”  Earlier today, the seeding committee at  Wimbledon , the
year’s third Grand Slam event that starts June 20 in  London ,
gave Williams a No. 24 seeding. She is ranked 33rd on the WTA
Tour.  Wimbledon seeded her younger sister Serena at No. 8, even
though the American hadn’t played a professional match in almost
a year before this week because of injury and illness. That
means the four-time Wimbledon champion won’t face any of the
other top eight seeds until the quarterfinals.  Also today in Eastbourne, Serena plays  Vera Zvonareva  of
Russia, in a re-match of last year’s Wimbledon final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
