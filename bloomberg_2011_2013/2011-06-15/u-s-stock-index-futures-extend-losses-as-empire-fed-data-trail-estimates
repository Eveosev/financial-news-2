U.S. stock futures extended losses
after a report showed New York-area manufacturing unexpectedly
contracted, adding to evidence economic growth is slowing.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1 percent
to 1,272.30 at 8:32 in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures dropped 0.9 percent to 11,909.  The  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York’s general economic
index dropped to minus 7.8, the lowest level since November,
from 11.9 in May. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists was 12. Readings greater than zero signal
expansion in the so-called Empire State Index, which covers New
York, northern  New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut .  The consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent, compared
with the 0.1 percent median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, figures from the Labor Department showed today
in  Washington . The so-called core measure, which excludes more
volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.3 percent, the biggest
increase since July 2008.  The  S&P 500  yesterday advanced the most since April 20
after better-than-estimated data on American retail sales and
Chinese industrial production. The S&P 500 and Dow average had
fallen for six weeks, their longest losing streaks since 2008
and 2002, respectively, as reports on jobs and manufacturing
spurred concern that the economic recovery was slowing.  The S&P 500 has still rallied 90 percent from its low in
March 2009, as the Federal Reserve used large-scale asset
purchases to buoy the economy and companies posted earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates.  U.S. futures followed European stocks lower earlier as
leaders couldn’t come to an agreement on Greece’s debt crisis.
In Brussels, an emergency session of finance ministers late
yesterday failed to reconcile a German-led push for bondholders
to shoulder part of the cost of a new Greek aid package with
European Central Bank warnings that the move may constitute the
euro area’s first sovereign default.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
