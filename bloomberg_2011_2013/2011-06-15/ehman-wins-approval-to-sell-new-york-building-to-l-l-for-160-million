Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  won a
bankruptcy judge’s approval to sell a building at 1107 Broadway
in Manhattan to L&L Holding Co. for about $160 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said today he “endorsed”
the decision by Lehman and its creditors committee to “monetize
an asset.” Hedge fund Paulson & Co., a Lehman creditor, opposed
the sale.  Bryan Marsal , the co-founder of restructuring firm Alvarez
& Marsal LLC who is running Lehman, aims to raise $61 billion by
selling the defunct company’s assets to pay $322 billion in
claims. Creditors would get 18.6 cents on the dollar, on
average.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman is
fighting over control of its liquidation plan with a group of
bondholders including Paulson and a rival group of derivatives
creditors that includes  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Morgan
Stanley. Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, with
assets of $639 billion.  Closely held L&L, founded in 2000, acquires and develops
Manhattan office buildings, according to its  website . L&L
Chairman David W. Levinson is the former vice chairman of  CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)   The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
