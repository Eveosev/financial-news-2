Alliance Healthcare Services Inc. (AIQ) ,
an outpatient diagnostic-imaging company, is seeking $590
million in loans to refinance existing debt, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal.  The financing package will include a $470 million term loan
B and a $120 million revolving line of credit, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and SunTrust Banks Inc. are
arranging the deal for the Newport Beach, California-based
company, according to the person. The banks will hold a lender
meeting today.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
