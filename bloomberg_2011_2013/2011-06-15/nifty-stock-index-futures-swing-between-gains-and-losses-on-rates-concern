Indian stocks dropped the most in
three weeks as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned inflation will
remain a “key headwind” for the economy ahead of a central
bank interest-rate decision tomorrow.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest lender, declined
2.1 percent.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the largest carmaker,
fell 1 percent as a strike at one of its factories entered a
10th working day. The Reserve Bank of  India  will boost rates a
further 75 basis points by the end of the year, including a 25
basis-point increase tomorrow, Goldman Sachs analysts Vishal Vaibhaw and  Tushar Poddar  wrote in a report dated yesterday.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
176.42 points, or 1 percent, to 18,132.24, its lowest since May
26, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on
the National Stock Exchange lost 1 percent to 5,447.50. Its June
futures settled at 5,452.65. The BSE 200 Index lost 0.9 percent
to 2,259.94.  “The main reason why people are not investing is because
there’s no clarity where things will move in the next three to
six months,” said Shishir Bajpai, vice president at IIFL Wealth
Management Ltd., which has $1.8 billion in assets under
management and advisory. “Yesterday’s inflation numbers were
bad. The  Reserve Bank  has clearly said it doesn’t expect
inflation to come down substantially before September.”  A government report yesterday showed that the wholesale-
 price index  rose 9.06 percent in May from a year earlier, after
an 8.66 percent jump in April. The central bank has raised rates
nine times since March 2010 to cool inflation as food and fuel
prices surged.  ‘Anti-Inflationary Stance’  “We think the RBI will continue with its ‘anti-
inflationary’ stance in the remainder of 2011,” the Goldman
Sachs analysts wrote. “The May WPI numbers suggest that
pressure on headline inflation remains high.”  State Bank  slid 2.1 percent, the most since May 23, to
2,182.5 rupees. Nearest rival  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  shed 2.3 percent
to 1,031.15 rupees, its first decline in three days.  Maruti decreased 1 percent to 1,210 rupees and its June
futures settled at 1,206.20. The stoppage at the company’s
Manesar factory, which builds as many as 1,200 cars daily, is
costing the Indian unit of  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  $9 million a day,
Chairman R.C. Bhargava said on June 8.  Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last month he
was willing to risk a slowdown in growth to curb price
pressures, which undermine spending power in a nation where the
 World Bank  estimates three-quarters of people live on less than
$2 a day.  Worst Performer  “Inflation is a big worry and policy makers’ objective
would be to fight price gains rather than worry about growth,”
Samiran Chakraborty, Mumbai-based chief economist at Standard
Chartered Plc, said yesterday.  The Sensex,  Asia ’s worst performer this year, has lost 12
percent amid concern higher borrowing costs will crimp earnings.
Stocks on the measure are valued at an average 14.7 times
estimated profit, down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last
year’s high. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at 10.9
times earnings.  The  Reserve Bank of India  will increase its repurchase rate
by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.5 percent tomorrow,
according to 18 of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with two
predicting no change. India’s 10-year bonds declined for a third
day, pushing yields to the highest level this month.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams, roads and
bridges, lost 2 percent to 82.6 rupees on speculation higher
borrowing costs will hurt constructors and developers.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) ,
the biggest developer, sank 3 percent to 225.1 rupees, extending
this year’s loss to 23 percent.  Overseas investors sold a net 1.17 billion rupees ($26.1
million) of Indian equities on June 13, paring investments in
equities this year to 846 million rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
