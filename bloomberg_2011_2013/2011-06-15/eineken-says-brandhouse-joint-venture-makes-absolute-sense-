Heineken NV (HEIA) ’s drinkmaking and sales
joint venture with  Diageo Plc (DGE)  in South Africa “makes absolute
sense” as a selected project to boost growth, Chief Financial
Officer Rene Hooft Graafland said today.  Distributing beer, premixed drinks and spirits together
through the Brandhouse venture is pragmatic, and partnering with
Diageo, owner of the Guinness beer brand, is useful in other
African countries, Hooft Graafland said in a webcast.  “In a number of markets, Guinness is a very strong
addition to our portfolio,” though the Dutch brewer usually
wouldn’t favor combining beer and spirits distribution, Hooft
Graafland said during his presentation at a Deutsche Bank
consumer conference in Paris. “But there are special
circumstances where we help each other.”  Brandhouse said in April that it controls about 14 percent
of the South African beer market, up from 12 percent. Amsterdam-
based Heineken, the world’s third-largest brewer, and London-
based Diageo, the biggest distiller, could team up to buy
Brazilian brewer Primo Schincariol Industria de Cervejas &
Refrigerantes SA,  Valor Economico  reported in May, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
