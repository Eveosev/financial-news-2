Bank of Ireland extended by seven
days the deadline for a debt exchange offer it’s made as part of
a plan to raise 4.2 billion euros ($6 billion), the Financial
Times reported.  The extension allows holders of the bank’s outstanding
permanent interest-bearing shares a further seven days to make
up their minds, after complaints that the deadline was too
tight, the newspaper said.  Holders of the bank’s junior bonds can have either 20
percent of the value of their bonds in cash, or 40 percent if
they accept shares instead, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
