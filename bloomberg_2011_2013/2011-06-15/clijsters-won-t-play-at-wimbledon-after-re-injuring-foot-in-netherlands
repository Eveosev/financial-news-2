Second seed  Kim Clijsters  dropped
out of Wimbledon because of a foot injury, the tennis
tournament’s organizers said today.  Clijsters hurt her foot at an event in the Netherlands, the
e-mailed statement said. She said she was “disappointed” that
the injury would cause her to miss the Grand Slam tournament.  “I feel frustrated that it has to happen now before one of
my favorite tournaments,” Clijsters said in the statement.  American  Sam Querrey  and Germany’s Benjamin Becker also
won’t play because of elbow injuries, the Wimbledon referees
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
