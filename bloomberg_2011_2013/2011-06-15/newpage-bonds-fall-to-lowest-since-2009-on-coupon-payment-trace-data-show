NewPage Corp. bonds fell to the
lowest level since March 2009 on concern that the junk-rated
coated-paper maker owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP will
be unable to make an upcoming coupon payment and will
restructure its debt.  The company’s $806 million of 10 percent second-lien notes
due May 2012 fell 3 cents to 29 cents on the dollar as of 2:38
p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
has dropped about 8.75 cents this week and is at the lowest
level since March 2009.  NewPage’s high level of debt and falling profits could mean
that it might not be able to service its debt over the next
year, according to a June 7 report by Standard & Poor’s. The
Miamisburg, Ohio-based company faces a $100.7 million coupon
payment June 30 on its $1.77 billion of 11.375 percent, first-
lien debt due December 2014, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The fall in bond prices is “solely to do with the
uncertainty of whether NewPage will pay the June 30 coupon or
not,”  Rahul Gandhi , an analyst at debt-research firm
CreditSights Inc. in  London , said in an e-mail today. Management
may use this opportunity to file for restructuring, he wrote.  Amber Garwood, a spokeswoman for NewPage, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  “Although the company may have enough liquidity to pay
the June coupon on the first-lien notes, we think run rate
EBITDA this year likely won’t cover annual interest expense,”
Kimberly Noland, an analyst at  Gimme Credit , wrote in a May 26
report.  The first-lien bonds were trading at 91.9 cents at 3:02
p.m. in New York, Trace data show, the lowest level since
November.  Apollo’s Role  Leon Black ’s Apollo Global Management LLC and Avenue
Capital Group, run by  Marc Lasry , hold more than $400 million of
NewPage’s 10 percent second-lien bonds, two people familiar with
the matter said last month. Lazard Ltd., FTI Consulting Inc. and
law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP are working with NewPage as a debt
restructuring looms, the people said.  Junk or high-yield bonds are those rated below BBB- by
 Standard & Poor’s  and lower than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
