BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, Societe Generale SA
and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,  France ’s largest banks by market value,
may have their credit ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service
as soon as next week because of their investments in Greece, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Moody’s placed the three banks’ ratings on review in June
to examine “the potential for inconsistency between the impact
of a possible Greek default or restructuring and current rating
levels,” the rating company said at the time. Cuts are expected
next week as the review period concludes, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Group of Seven finance chiefs vowed yesterday to support
banks and buoy slowing economic growth as  Europe ’s debt crisis
roiled financial markets and threatened a global recession.
Renewed fears that European policy makers are failing to prevent
a Greek default and contain their debt woes yesterday prompted
investors to sell stocks and push the euro to a six-month low
against the dollar. European bank and sovereign credit risk
reached all-time highs as 10-year Treasury and German bund
yields fell to record lows on demand for a haven.  “We will take all necessary actions to ensure the
resilience of banking systems and financial markets,” G-7
finance ministers and central bankers said in a statement
released during talks in Marseille, France late yesterday.  Credit Agricole  spokeswoman Anne-Sophie Gentil declined to
comment.  Societe Generale (GLE)  spokeswoman Laetitia Maurel said she
couldn’t immediately comment on the matter. A BNP Paribas
spokeswoman declined to comment. Voicemail messages left on the
mobile and office lines of Moody’s chief European spokesman
Daniel Piels today, outside of working hours, weren’t
immediately answered.  Stocks Decline  Societe Generale has dropped 55 percent in Paris trading
since June 15, while Credit Agricole tumbled 45 percent and BNP
Paribas fell 42 percent.  The reviews of Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas are unlikely
to lead to downgrades of more than one level, Moody’s said when
it put the banks under review. Societe Generale’s debt and
deposit ratings may be cut as much as two grades because of the
“uplift it receives from systemic support, which is currently
higher than average for the French banking system,” the rating
company said at the time.  Moody’s currently rates BNP Paribas’ long-term debt at Aa2,
the third-highest investment grade. Credit Agricole is rated
Aa1, the second highest, while Societe Generale is Aa2.  Credit Agricole’s main risk arises from its Greek
subsidiary Emporiki Bank of  Greece  SA, which was downgraded
earlier this month, Moody’s said in June. Societe Generale,
France’s second-largest bank by market value, faces risks from
its stake in General Bank of Greece. Credit Agricole is France’s
third-largest bank.  BNP Paribas doesn’t have a local unit in Greece and is
instead at risk from direct holdings of Greek government debt,
Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
