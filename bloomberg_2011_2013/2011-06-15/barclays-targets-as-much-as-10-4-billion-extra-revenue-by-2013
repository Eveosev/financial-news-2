Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank, said it intends to generate additional revenue of
as much as 6.4 billion pounds ($10.4 billion) by 2013.  The bank is still seeking a return-on-equity of 13 percent,
it said in a statement today before a presentation to investors.
Between 4.3 billion pounds and 6.4 billion pounds extra income
will be sought compared with 2010, the bank said.  “This looks like a pretty ambitious target to set,” Alex Potter, an analyst at Berenberg Bank who has a “buy” rating on
the bank and a 310 pence a share target, said. “They’re going
to have to give the market quite a lot of detail on exactly
where this is coming from before the market will believe them.”  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  cut Barclays’s
return-on-equity target in February to 13 percent from an
average of 18 percent over the past three decades as higher
 capital requirements  from regulators erode profitability.
Diamond that month described the bank’s 2010 returns of 7.2
percent as “unacceptable.”  “The presentations reaffirm the Barclays target return-on-
equity of 13 percent by 2013 and outline a number of new
targets,” the statement said.  The bank traded down 2.7 percent to 257.4 pence at the
close in  London , the biggest decline in the FTSE 350 Index of
the U.K.’s five largest banks.  ‘Stark Disparity’  “It looks like the current share price is equivalent to a
return-on-equity of 7.5 percent,” said Cormac Leech, an analyst
at Canaccord Genuity Ltd., who has a “buy” rating on the
stock. “So there’s a stark disparity between management’s
expectation of the business and the current share price.”  Barclays’s European consumer banking business had a return
on equity of zero last year, compared with 11 percent in the
U.K. and 12 percent in  Africa  the bank said.  “The problems in  Europe  are significant, we all know
that,” said  Antony Jenkins , head of retail, when asked about
the bank’s performance on the continent. “Our base case
assumption is that those problems are not going to unwind
themselves any time soon.”  Barclays plans to eliminate 700 jobs at its Spanish
consumer unit, a person with knowledge of the matter said last
month. The London-based bank also has units in Portugal, Italy
and  France .  The lender will budget operating expenses of 16.8 billion
pounds by 2013, saving at least 1 billion pounds in costs, it
said.  Barclays forecast as much as 2.4 billion pounds, or 38
percent of its targeted 6.4 billion pounds of additional revenue
will come from  Barclays Capital , while retail and business
banking will contribute as much as 2 billion pounds, Finance
Director Chris Lucas said. Its corporate banking and wealth
management units may each add as much as 1 billion pounds, Lucas
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
