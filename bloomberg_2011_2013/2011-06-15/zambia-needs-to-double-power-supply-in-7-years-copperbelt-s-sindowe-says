Zambia , Africa’s biggest copper
producer, needs to double electricity capacity at a cost of
about $4 billion over the next seven years, Copperbelt Energy
Corp. Plc Chairman Hanson Sindowe said.  Demand for power will outstrip supply from next year
through 2015, he said in a speech in the capital, Lusaka, today.
The southern African nation needs $12 billion of electricity
investment, or 4,400 additional megawatts, by 2030.  To contact the reporter on this story:
