Crude oil tumbled below $95 a barrel
for the first time since February on concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will deepen and on signals the  U.S. economy  is slowing,
reducing fuel consumption.  Futures dropped 4.6 percent as European finance ministers
struggled to break a deadlock on a second rescue plan for
 Greece , sending the euro and most commodities lower. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index slipped to the
lowest level since November. An Energy Department report today
showed U.S. fuel demand fell for the first time in five weeks.  “The Greek crisis is making people worry about further
bank failures in Europe and cascading defaults hitting the
economy and fuel demand,” said Michael Lynch, president of
Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “The demand numbers in today’s report were
terrible, especially for industrial fuels.”  Crude oil for July delivery fell $4.56 to $94.81 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
Feb. 22. It was the biggest decline since May 11. Prices are up
23 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for July delivery dropped $3.06, or 2.5
percent, to end the session at $117.10 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract expired today.
The more actively traded August futures fell $6.34, or 5.3
percent, to $113.01.  Oil in New York had traded between $95.02 and $104.60 from
May 9 through yesterday. Futures climbed to $99.95 at 10:53 a.m.
before dropping.  ‘Big Support Level’  “We failed to break $100, another psychological resistance
number, and a lot of momentum selling came in,” said Joe Posillico, senior vice president of energy derivatives at MF
Global Inc. in New York. “And $95 was a big support level.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet on June 17 in Berlin to try to resolve
their differences on a rescue for Greece, which was downgraded
this week to the country with the lowest credit rating by
Standard & Poor’s. EU finance ministers will meet on June 19.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said he will make
changes to his cabinet tomorrow and will then immediately seek a
vote of confidence in Parliament.  The euro was down 1.9 percent at $1.4171 after dropping to
$1.4156, the lowest level since May 27. A stronger  U.S. dollar 
reduces the appeal of raw materials to investors.  Panic Mode  “People are in full panic mode,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of Schork Group Inc., a Villanova, Pennsylvania-based
consultant. “If we don’t hold here, hold your breath as the
market heads for $90. This is make-it or break-it time for the
bulls.”  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s manufacturing index
declined to minus 7.8 from 11.9 in May. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected 12. The so-called Empire State Index
covers New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut .  Nationwide industrial production rose less than forecast in
May, restrained by a slump in utility output and shortages of
auto parts from  Japan . Output at factories, mines and utilities
rose 0.1 percent, Federal Reserve figures showed. Economists
projected a 0.2 percent gain, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The oil market continues to follow economic indicators
because they provide signals on demand,” said  Adam Sieminski ,
chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in  Washington .
“Trading continues to get hit by occasional periods of panic
due to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.”  Equities Decline  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index dropped 1.7 percent to
1,266.16, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 176.65
points to 11,899.46 at 3:30 p.m. in New York  U.S. consumption of distillate fuel, a category that
includes diesel and heating oil, tumbled 5.2 percent to 3.6
million barrels a day, the lowest level since January, according
to the Energy Department.  “The demand picture isn’t looking good, especially for
distillate fuel,” said Carl Larry, director of energy
derivatives and research with Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New
York. “The poor distillate number is a sure sign that the
economy is weakening.”  U.S. crude-oil stockpiles fell 3.41 million barrels to
365.6 million last week, the department said. A 1.8 million-
barrel decline was projected, according to the median of 13
analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Cushing Supplies  Stockpiles of oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade, slipped
1.14 million barrels to 37.76 million in the week ended June 10,
the lowest level since February. Cushing is the terminus of the
 Keystone  pipeline, which carries Canadian oil to the central
U.S. and was closed from May 29 to June 5.  “It looks like the drop in supply was a result of the
Keystone issue,” Larry said.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 962,463
contracts as of 3:28 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 741,412
contracts yesterday, 12 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.58 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
