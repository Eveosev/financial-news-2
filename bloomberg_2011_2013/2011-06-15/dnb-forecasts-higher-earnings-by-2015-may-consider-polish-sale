DnB NOR ASA (DNBNOR) , the Nordic region’s
second-largest bank, forecast profit will rise by 2015 as it set
new financial targets and said it may consider selling its
Polish business.  Pretax operating profit may reach 30 billion kroner ($5.52
billion) by 2015, up from 22 billion kroner to 25 billion kroner
for 2012, the Oslo-based company said in a statement today. The
bank also seeks to lower expenses further to reduce its cost-
income ratio to 45 percent by 2015 from 46 percent in 2012.  “Norway has emerged from the financial crisis relatively
unscathed, and the Norwegian economy is one of the strongest in
a  Europe  dominated by challenges such as national debt and low
growth,” said Chief Executive Officer Rune Bjerke.  DnB, which aims to be “among the best-capitalized banks in
the Nordic region,” said its financial targets are based on
requirements drawn up by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision . Group of 20 leaders last year endorsed the new
rules on capital and liquidity to prevent future crises.  The lender aims for a return on equity of more than 14
percent by 2015, it said today. DnB took full control of DnB
NORD, its business focusing on the Baltic region and  Poland , six
months ago and said the integration is “well under way.”  DnB may consider selling its Polish operations because its
market position in the country “is relatively modest and this
market is considered to be very exposed to competition,” it
said. “The Baltic states show a healthier development since the
financial crisis, and sound growth is expected,” DnB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
