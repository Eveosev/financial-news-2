Australia  should introduce a cap-
and-trade system to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and act
“earlier rather than later” to tackle climate change,  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said.  “The clock is ticking,”  Ann Pickard , chairman of Shell’s
operations in Australia, said today in a speech in Sydney,
according to an e-mailed copy of her presentation. “I do think
that it’s in our interest for Australia to be an example to the
rest of the world.”  Australia, which has about A$200 billion ($214 billion) of
proposed liquefied natural gas projects targeting Asian demand
for the fuel, also needs “well thought-out policies on labor
and immigration” to deliver a skilled work force, she said. A
surging Australian dollar has made labor “even more important
to solve,” she said.  Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, expects to invest
about $30 billion during the next five years on oil and gas
developments in Australia, it said in May. The company plans to
pioneer the use of floating LNG technology to develop the
Prelude project off northwest Australia and is  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s
partner in the proposed Gorgon LNG project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
