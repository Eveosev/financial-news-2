The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may increase the scope of broker-dealer audits and
what firms must report to the agency, after moving in 2009 to
increase protections for clients of investment advisers.  SEC commissioners will vote today on proposed changes to
broker-dealer auditing and reporting rules at a meeting in
 Washington . As with the 2009 rules, which tightened oversight of
advisers’ custody of client assets after Bernard Madoff Ponzi
scheme was exposed, the new changes increase oversight of the
minority of about 300 broker-dealers who hold customers’ cash.  The proposals -- which would be opened for a 60-day comment
period -- would require that a broker-dealer’s internal controls
be checked by a registered public accounting firm and would let
regulators examine the broker-dealer’s audits. Broker-dealers
would have to file quarterly reports describing whether they
have access to client money and how any access is controlled.  The existing law requires broker-dealers to be audited each
year by a firm registered with the  Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board . Last year’s Dodd-Frank Act required the PCAOB
to start inspecting those audits. The industry-funded regulator
established an interim inspection program at a meeting
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
