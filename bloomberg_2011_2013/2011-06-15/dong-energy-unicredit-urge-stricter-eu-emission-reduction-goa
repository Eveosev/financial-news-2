A group of 72 companies including
 Denmark ’s biggest utility Dong Energy A/S and Italy’s largest
bank UniCredit SpA called on the European Union to deepen the
bloc’s emissions-reduction target, environmental group  WWF  said.  In a declaration published before a meeting of EU
environment ministers on June 21, the companies joined WWF in
urging European governments to support the move to a 30-percent
cut in greenhouse gases, compared with the current goal of a 20-
percent reduction by 2020 from 1990 levels.  The companies, which also include world’s second-biggest
wind farm operator  Acciona SA (ANA)  and the largest home-furnishings
retailer Ikea Group, “agree that the many benefits of a swift
transition to the low-carbon economy outweigh the costs of
emissions reductions,” WWF said in an e-mailed statement today.  A move to a more ambitious target of cutting  greenhouse
gases  by 25 percent domestically in 2020, or by 30 percent
including offsets earned by companies for emissions-reduction
projects in  developing countries , would “significantly lower”
the costs of reaching the EU long-term climate target, according
to a report published last week by Climate Strategies, an
international network of climate experts, and the Institute for
 Sustainable Development  and International Relations in Paris.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a
policy paper in May that the EU may exceed its current goal and
cut carbon discharges by 25 percent internally in 2020 if it
steps up energy efficiency measures.  The most cost-effective path for the EU to attain its long-
term target of cutting emissions by at least 80 percent in 2050
would be to reduce them by 40 percent in 2030 and by 60 percent
in 2040, the commission said in its low-carbon roadmap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
