Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501) ,  Japan ’s
fourth-largest brewer, will ally with Bacardi Japan Ltd. to sell
spirits including Dewar’s scotch, targeting 10 billion yen ($124
million) in annual sales of western-style liquor by 2016.  Sapporo will be the exclusive Bacardi distributor in the
country from Oct. 1, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement. The agreement covers 29 brands including Grey Goose
vodka, Bombay Sapphire gin, cognac, tequila and sparkling wine.  “We want to make western liquor one of our profit pillars,
as beer now is,” Norifumi Sumiyoshi, Sapporo wine and spirits
division head, told reporters in  Tokyo  today.  The brewer and its Japanese rivals are diversifying into
spirits from other regions to lure drinkers who have been
shifting away from beer to whiskey and cocktails. Sapporo
earlier this month said it will begin sales in Japan of
makgeolli South Korean liquor made by  CJ CheilJedang Corp. (097950)   Shipments of beer and beer-like drinks in Japan fell 1.3
percent in the first five months of this year, according to data
provided by the nation’s brewers including Sapporo and market
leader Asahi Breweries Ltd. Brewery sales have contracted by
about 20 percent since the 1994 peak, the data showed.  Sapporo had wine sales of 10.8 billion yen last year, while
Japanese local spirits, or shochu, brought in 8.6 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
