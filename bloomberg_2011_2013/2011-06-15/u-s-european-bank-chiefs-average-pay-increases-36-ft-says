Bank chief executive officers’
average pay in the U.S. and Europe increased by 36 percent last
year, to $9.7 million, the Financial Times reported, citing
analysis by Equilar, a U.S. pay-research company.  Jamie Dimon of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Lloyd Blankfein of
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  received more than 15 times their 2009
compensation, the newspaper said.  Dimon headed the list, with almost $21 million in 2010, the
FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
