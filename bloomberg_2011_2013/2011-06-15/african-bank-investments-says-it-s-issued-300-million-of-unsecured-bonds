African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , a
South African owner of a lender and a furniture retailer, said
it sold $300 million of five-year notes in its first issue of
dollar-denominated debt.  The bonds, which mature on June 15, 2016, were priced to
yield 425 basis points above the five-year dollar mid-swap rate
and were issued as part of a $1 billion program, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a stock-exchange statement.
The debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange.  The South African Reserve Bank raised African Bank’s
capital reserve requirement to 24.5 percent from April 1, the
company said on May 23. The lender would maintain “a steady
flow of available funding and a further reduction in the cost of
funding” to meet  capital requirements , the company said.  South African companies have sold $5.4 billion of debt this
year, the most on record for the first half, to take advantage
of borrowing costs that are the lowest in three decades,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On March 8, African
Bank sold 1 billion rand ($147 million) of four-year bonds at a
yield of 240 basis points above the three-month Johannesburg
interbank acceptance rate.  African Bank said it bought derivative contracts to fix the
rand amount of coupon and redemption payments to its dollar-bond
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
