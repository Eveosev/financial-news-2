South Korea , Asiaâ€™s fourth-largest
economy, forecasts global crude  oil prices  between $100 and $105
per barrel in the second half of this year, state-run Korea
National Oil Corp. said in an e-mailed statement.  Asian benchmark Dubai prices may extend gains in the second
half, following an increase of 36 percent in the first half, the
state-run company said, citing views from the Bank of Korea, the
Ministry of Knowledge Economy and other state and private-sector
experts.  Growth in demand for crude oil may be sustained in the
second half as global economies are gradually recovering, driven
by emerging countries, according to the statement.  Risk premiums are likely to disappear unless political
unrests in the Middle East spread to other oil-producing
countries including  Saudi Arabia , Korea National Oil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
