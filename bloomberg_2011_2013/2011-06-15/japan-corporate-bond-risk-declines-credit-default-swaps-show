The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2.5 basis points to 127
as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The index fell 6.25 basis points, the most since March 21,
yesterday to 129.75, according to data from CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 to 113.5 as of 8:31 a.m. in
Beijing, according to prices provided by Credit Agricole CIB.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 0.5 to 113 as of
10:31 a.m. in Sydney, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editor: Hugh Chow  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
