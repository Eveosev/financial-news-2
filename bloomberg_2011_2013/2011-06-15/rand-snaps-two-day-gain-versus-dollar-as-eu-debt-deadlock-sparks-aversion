The rand declined for the first day
in three against the dollar as European Union officials reached
a deadlock on a Greek debt rescue plan, damping investor demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The South African currency slipped as much as 1.1 percent
to 6.8366 per dollar, and traded 0.8 percent weaker at 6.8132 at
4:35 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand gained 0.6 percent to 9.7263
per euro.  Emerging-market stocks fell and commodity prices dropped
after EU finance ministers failed to reconcile a German-led push
for bondholders to share part of the cost of a new Greek aid
plan.  South Africa ’s benchmark stock index slipped 0.8 percent,
led by mining companies including BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo
American Plc.  “Markets are likely to remain cautious until a resolution
to the Greek dilemma is found,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, wrote in a research note. The rand will likely
trade in a range between 6.70 and 6.80 per dollar, they said.  EU finance ministers yesterday agreed to convene again on
June 19 to resolve their differences over a rescue for  Greece ,
which was downgraded this week to the world’s lowest credit
rating by  Standard & Poor’s .  Retail Data  The rand pared its decline after retail sales growth
unexpectedly accelerated to its fastest pace in almost four
years in April, adding pressure on the central bank to raise
 interest rates  this year as the economy recovers. Sales in South
Africa jumped 9.8 percent in April, from 5.3 percent the
previous month, according to the statistics office.  “Retail sales growth overshot expectations by a wide
margin,” Shireen Darmalingam, a Johannesburg-based analyst at
Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in an emailed research note.
“The rand could strengthen in the short term.”  Bonds declined for a sixth day, the longest losing streak
since Jan. 18. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 fell 15 cents to
121.10 rand, driving the yield up three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.57 percent, the highest since May 25. The
6.75 percent securities due 2021 dropped 11 cents to 88.96 rand,
boosting the yield two basis points to 8.453 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
