ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG’s owners are
asking lenders to change the terms on the company’s loans so
that a share sale won’t trigger a debt repayment,  Reuters 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Lavena Holding, which is the ownership vehicle of private
equity firms KKR & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP, has asked the
lenders to lower a “change of control” trigger to 35 percent
from 50 percent so that Lavena could reduce its shareholding to
35.1 percent from currently 88 percent without triggering a debt
repayment, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
