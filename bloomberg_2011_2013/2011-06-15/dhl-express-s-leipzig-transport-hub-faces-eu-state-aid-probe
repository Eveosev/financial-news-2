European Union regulators will
investigate payments made by the German government to expand
Leipzig Halle Airport, the European hub for  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s
DHL Express parcel-delivery unit.  Public investments of 255 million euros ($365 million) and
state loans to the airport’s operator may give Leipzig “an
unfair advantage” over rival airports, the  European Commission 
said in an e-mailed statement today.  A large regional airport such as Leipzig “should be able
to finance at least part of its infrastructure costs,” the EU’s
antitrust agency said.  Uwe Schuhart, spokesman for airport operator Flughafen
Leipzig/Halle GmbH, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. DHL’s press office didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
