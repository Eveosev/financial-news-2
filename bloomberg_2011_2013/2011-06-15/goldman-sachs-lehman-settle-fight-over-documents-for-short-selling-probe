Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  settled a
dispute with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. over documents
related to a short-selling investigation the failed investment
bank is conducting.  A lawyer for Goldman Sachs announced the settlement today
during a hearing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. He
didn’t disclose details. Goldman Sachs is competing with Lehman
and a creditor group led by hedge fund Paulson & Co. to propose
a liquidation plan for the defunct firm.  Goldman Sachs yesterday accused Lehman of harassment in
making a “baseless” demand for documents as part of a probe of
whether rival firms contributed to its September 2008 failure by
putting pressure on its stock through rumors and so-called short
sales.  Lehman said the fifth-biggest U.S. bank was  “deliberately
moving at glacial pace” in handing over information. It asked
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to order New York-based Goldman
Sachs to produce the documents within two weeks.  The case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
