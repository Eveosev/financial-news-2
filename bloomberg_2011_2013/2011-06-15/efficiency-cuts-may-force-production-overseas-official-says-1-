Cuts proposed by Republicans in the
budget for  energy-efficiency  programs may push production
overseas, a U.S. Energy Department official said.  “We’ve gotten a wake-up call that the technologies that
are going to dominate world markets in the future in clean
energy may no longer be made in the United States,” Henry
Kelly, acting assistant secretary for energy efficiency and
renewable energy, said today at a House committee hearing in
 Washington .  President Barack Obama’s administration has set a goal of
doubling electricity from clean-energy sources such as wind and
solar power by 2035. The president wants to advance research to
put 1 million electric vehicles on U.S. roads by 2015.  House Republicans have proposed reducing the budget for the
department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy  to
$1.3 billion for 2012, compared with a White House
recommendation for $3.2 billion, according to documents from the
House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
