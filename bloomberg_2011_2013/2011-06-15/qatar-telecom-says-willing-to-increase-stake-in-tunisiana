Qatar Telecom  QSC, the Persian Gulf
country’s biggest company by revenue, is willing to raise its
its stake in Tunisian telecom operator Tunisiana above the
current 75 percent share, the company’s chairman said in a
release posted on RNS Newswire.  “We have signaled our willingness to increase our stake,”
Abdullah Bin Mohammed Bin Saud Al Thani said after meeting the
Tunisian Interim Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi, according to
the release. The increase would depend on agreement with the
Tunisian government, the company said.  The announcement comes after Qatar Telecom, through its
majority-owned unit Wataniya Telecom, and Princesse Holding of
Tunisia completed the purchase of Orascom Telecom Holding’s 50
percent interest in Tunisiana earlier this year for $1.2
billion.  Increased competition is driving Middle Eastern telephone
companies such as Qtel and Emirates Telecommunications Corp., or
Etisalat, to expand beyond the United Arab Emirates into markets
in  Asia  and Africa. Qatar Telecom, called Qtel, faces pressure
in its home market from  Vodafone Qatar (VFQS) , which began offering
cellphone services in the emirate in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
