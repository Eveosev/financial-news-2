Fundtech Ltd. (FNDT)  surged the most in
more than two years after the Israeli provider of banking
software said a multinational corporation has expressed interest
in acquiring the company.  The shares climbed 14 percent, the most since January 2009,
to 68.02 shekels as of 10:21 a.m. in  Tel Aviv , giving the Ramat
Gan-based company a market value of 1.02 billion shekels ($299
million). Clal Industries & Investments Ltd., which owns a 59
percent stake in Fundtech, gained 2.1 percent to 25.63 shekels.  Fundtech also said itâ€™s involved in preliminary discussions
regarding other potential transactions, including a merger with
a U.S.-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
