Turkey ’s lira slid for a fourth day
on reports regulators may increase deposit insurance premiums on
banks as the government seeks to rein in inflation while keeping
the benchmark interest rate at a record low.  The lira depreciated to the lowest level in two weeks,
weakening 0.8 percent to 1.5974 per dollar at 5:50 p.m. in
Istanbul. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.95 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest level in a week, according
to the TEB Local Benchmark Bond Index.  Turkey has attempted to contain its ballooning current-
account deficit by raising bank reserve requirements while
holding its benchmark interest rate at an all-time low of 6.25
percent. The country is now considering an increase on bank
 deposit insurance  premiums, Savings Deposit and Insurance Fund
Chairman Sakir Ercan Gul confirmed to Bloomberg HT television
today, without saying by how much.  “The fight with the widening current-account deficit will
continue by using the banks as the main intermediary going
forward,” HSBC Yatirim Turkey, the Turkish investment arm of
HSBC Holdings Plc, said in an e-mailed research note today.
“These potential actions stand as the Damocles’ sword on the
Turkish banks, until the regulators announce them and investors
assess the potential outcome.”  The fund may increase deposit insurance to cover as much as
100,000 euros ($143,000), the European Union average, from
50,000 liras ($31,300), Haberturk newspaper reported today. That
would double the burden on the banking system to $1 billion,
Oyak Securities said in an e-mailed research note.  The benchmark  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  dropped 1,246.62, or 2
percent, to 60,938.92. Turkey’s banking index slumped 2.6
percent, closing at the lowest level in more than three months.
 Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country’s biggest listed bank,
slid 3.1 percent in a third day of declines and  Turkiye Is
Bankasi (ISATR)  AS dropped 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
