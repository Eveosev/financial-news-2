Natural gas shipments to U.S.
electricity generators were set to drop as milder weather
reduced demand for the power-plant fuel. Deliveries to  New York 
declined to a one-week low.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation fell 6.7 percent to 16.2 million dekatherms (15.8
billion cubic feet) from yesterdayâ€™s 17.4 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2 p.m. in New York.  Scheduled gas deliveries to New York power plants decreased
for a second day, down 5.1 percent to 506,196 dekatherms, the
lowest level since June 6.  Prices at the Transco-Z6 hub, which delivers gas to the New
York City region, dropped 1.04 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $4.7548
per million British thermal units as of 1:41 p.m. on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, fell 6.21 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $4.5248. The hub is the benchmark for gas
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Temperatures will be normal or below-normal in the
Northeast through June 19, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The high temperature in Washington tomorrow may be 76
degrees Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 8 degrees below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.
New York will have a high of 82 degrees, 3 above normal.  U.S. nuclear-power production nationwide increased by 50
megawatts from yesterday to 92,013 megawatts, or 91 percent of
capacity, according to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  and
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
