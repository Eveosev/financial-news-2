Sales at major South Korean
department stores expanded at the slowest pace in three months
as frequent rain and cool weather damped demand for summer
clothes.  Outlays at the three biggest chains increased 8.7 percent
from a year earlier in May, after rising 15.1 percent in April,
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.  Discount-store sales rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier
after a 4.6 percent gain in April, today’s report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
