Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, fell 5.3 percent from a week earlier,
said analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors were 72,311 bags in
the week to June 12, Hartmann wrote in a report yesterday. That
compares with 76,321 bags he reported a week earlier. Total
arrivals across Brazil were 91,062 bags, against 94,324 bags a
week earlier. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bahia represents almost 80 percent of the country’s cocoa
output and 95 percent of its grindings, Hartmann said in a Jan.
19 e-mail. He is a board member of the Commercial Association of
Bahia and is in charge of the group’s statistical service on
Brazilian cocoa output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
