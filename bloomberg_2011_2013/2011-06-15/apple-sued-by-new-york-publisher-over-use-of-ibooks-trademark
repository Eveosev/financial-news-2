Apple Inc. (AAPL) , maker of the iPad tablet
computer and the iPhone, was sued by New York publisher John T.
Colby in federal court today for trademark infringement over its
use of the term “iBooks.”  Colby bought in 2006 and 2007 the assets of various
entities owned by New York publisher Byron Preiss, who had
published more than 1,000 hardcover and paperback books under
the “ibooks” name starting in September 1999, according to the
lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in  Manhattan 
today.  Apple has a trademark on the name “IBOOK” for computers
and once sold a personal computer known as the “iBook,”
according to the lawsuit. The Cupertino, California-based
company never used the term as a designation for electronic
books or an application for the delivery of electronic books
until it began selling the iPad in April 2010, Colby said in the
lawsuit.  “Apple’s use of the mark ‘iBooks’ to denote the electronic
library that can be accessed via its iPad tablet computer and
its iPhone is likely to overwhelm the good will of plaintiffs’
‘ibooks’ and ‘ipicturebooks’ marks and render them virtually
worthless,” the lawsuit says.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment
in a telephone interview.  The case is J.T. Colby & Co. vs. Apple Inc., 11-cv-4060,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
