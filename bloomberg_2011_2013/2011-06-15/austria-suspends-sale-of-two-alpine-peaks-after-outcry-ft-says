The Austrian government postponed a
planned sale of two Alpine mountain peaks to raise cash after a
public outcry, the Financial Times reported.  The Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft,  Austria ’s real-estate
company, planned to sell the Rosskopf and the Grosse Kinigat, in
eastern Tyrol, for a minimum of 121,000 euros ($174,000), the
newspaper said.  Reinhold Mittelehner, Austria’s economy minister,
intervened, saying the mountains should stay in public hands,
the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
