The euro dropped the most in almost
six weeks against the dollar after the Greek prime minister’s
government lost political support as the European Union
struggled to break a deadlock on a second financial rescue for
the nation.  Europe ’s shared currency fell versus most of its major
counterparts, except for  Sweden ’s krona, Norway’s krone and
 Denmark ’s krone, which dropped as commodity prices slumped.
Demand for assets linked to economic growth also eased after
reports showed slowing manufacturing in the U.S. Sterling fell
versus the dollar after a report showed Britain’s jobless claims
rose in May more than economists forecast.  “There is a lot of noise going on in Europe and in
Greece,” said Sara Yates, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Barclays Plc in  London . “What we’ve seen from the opposition
party, that they don’t seem to be on the same page wanting to
push through fiscal austerity and more privatization, that is
worrying.”  The euro fell 1.8 percent to $1.4181 at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
from $1.4440 yesterday, after touching $1.4156, the lowest level
since May 27. It weakened as much as 2 percent against the
dollar, the biggest intraday drop since May 5, when it fell as
much as 2.1 percent.  Dollar, Yen  The common currency slid 1.2 percent to 114.80 yen, from
116.23. The dollar gained 0.6 percent to 80.96 yen, from 80.49,
after touching 81.06, the highest level since June 2.  The threat of the Greek debt crisis spilling into the
banking sector is the biggest risk to the region’s financial
stability, European Central Bank Vice President  Vitor Constancio 
said at a briefing in  Frankfurt  today.  “Some resolution is necessary and the longer Greece kind
of wavers in this grey area the more toxic for the euro,” said
 Jessica Hoversen , a New York-based analyst at futures broker MF
Global Holdings Ltd. “Euro weakness will be broad based.”  The euro may fall below $1.40 for the first time in three
weeks, according to Citigroup Inc., citing technical indicators.  The failure of the euro to break above $1.4711, the 76.4
percent Fibonacci retracement level from the May 4 high of
$1.4940, has seen the euro weaken 3.3 percent against the
dollar. Today’s break below the 55-day moving average of $1.4409
may see the euro weaken to $1.3970, said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief
technical analyst at Citigroup in New York.  Technical Level  “The inability to break the 76.4 percent retracement level
signaled a danger to push lower,” Fitzpatrick said in an
interview. “The euro is trading heavily, so our sense is we can
go and retest the $1.3968 level and if that breaks there is a
danger we see that move accelerate.”  The premium for euro three-month put options granting the
right to sell the common currency against the greenback reached
as much as 2.58 percentage points today over calls, which allow
for purchases. That’s the most since June 2010 on an intraday
basis.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou , struggling to push
through austerity measures demanded by international lenders,
was told to step aside and let the president name a so-called
technical government to renegotiate the terms of the nation’s
rescue package, said an official in the opposition New Democracy
Party.  Police fired tear gas at 20,000 people that encircled the
Parliament House in  Athens  today to protest Papandreou’s
additional wage cuts and tax increases. The nation’s two biggest
unions were on strike.  EU Meeting  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will meet on June 17 in Berlin, with pressure
mounting for the leaders to resolve their differences over a
rescue for  Greece . EU finance ministers agreed yesterday to
convene again on June 19 after they failed to reconcile a
German-led push for bondholders to share part of the cost of a
new plan for Greek aid.  The euro has depreciated 0.8 percent in the past week
against nine other developed-nation currencies, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar has
risen 1.8 percent.  Sterling weakened as the  Office for National Statistics 
reported that the U.K.’s jobless claims rose by 19,600 in May
after a revised 16,900 increase in the prior month. The median
forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
increase of 6,500. The pound lost 1.1 percent to $1.6194.  U.K. Confidence  U.K. consumer confidence jumped the most in 5 1/2 years in
May, figures from the Nationwide Building Society show.
Nationwide’s index of sentiment gained 11 points to 55, the
highest in five months. The pound touched 87.51 pence per euro,
the strongest since June 1.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.7 percent, and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities fell 2.3
percent.  Canada ’s dollar declined 1.1 percent to 97.91 cents per
 U.S. dollar .  Norway ’s krone dropped 0.8 percent to 7.8717 per euro, and
the Swedish krona lost 0.3 percent to 9.1811 per euro.  The consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent, compared
with the 0.1 percent median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, figures from the Labor Department showed today
in  Washington . The core measure, which excludes more volatile
food and energy costs, climbed 0.3 percent, the biggest increase
since July 2008.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index dropped to minus 7.8, the lowest level since November,
from 11.9 in May. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists was 12. Industrial production in the U.S. rose 0.1
percent in May after no change the prior month, figures from the
Fed showed today.  The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against the
currencies of its six major trade partners, rose 1.7 percent to
75.578, the biggest gain since August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
