Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell for
a second day after Euro-area finance chiefs said they may need
more time to reach a deal in aiding Greece on its debt, and
after China ordered lenders to set aside more cash as reserves.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a global fashion retailer that gets
most of its revenue from  Europe , sank 5.1 percent.  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the nation’s biggest lender by
market value, slid 0.8 percent. Property developers declined
after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the sector’s outlook to “negative”
from “stable.”  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.7 percent to 22,343.77 at the
close, after rising as much as 0.5 percent. More than three
stocks retreated for each that advanced on the 46-member gauge.  China ’s reserve-requirement hike is having a
“psychological impact, with people worrying about further
tightening, the hard-landing of  China’s economy  and its slower
growth,” said Benjamin Tam, a portfolio manager at IG
Investment Ltd., which oversees about $1 billion.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’
H shares lost 0.7 percent to 12,397.60 after People’s Bank of
China yesterday raised banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 50
basis points effective June 20. The announcement came after a
report showed inflation accelerated to 5.5 percent in May, the
fastest pace in almost three years.  Esprit dropped 5.1 percent to HK$26.30, the biggest decline
on the Hang Seng Index.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates
container facilities at  Greece ’s Piraeus port, sank 2.3 percent
to HK$13.64.  Sovereign Default  An emergency session of finance ministers in Brussels
yesterday failed to reconcile a German-led push for bondholders
to shoulder part of the cost of a new Greek aid package with
European Central Bank warnings that the move might constitute
the euro area’s first sovereign default.  The Hang Seng Index has fallen 3 percent this year on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis and tightening measures by
China will slow global economic growth. Shares in the gauge
traded about 12 times forecast earnings on average, compared
with 14.4 times at the end of last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Industrial & Commercial Bank declined 0.8 percent to
HK$5.88. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s third-
largest lender by market value, fell 1.4 percent to HK$4.12.  Developers’ Outlook Cut  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, fell 1.4 percent to HK$15.62,
while  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer,
sank 1.4 percent to HK$13.02.  Chinese developers’ outlook was cut by Standard & Poor’s,
which said tighter credit and further government curbs may lead
to rating downgrades in the next six months to a year.  Property sales may start to slow as the government’s policy
takes effect, leading to price cuts as developers push sales to
meet funding needs with limited liquidity, the credit rating
company said in a statement today.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 1.1 percent to 22,240.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for  Hong Kong 
stock options, jumped 4.9 percent to 19.59, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 5.6 percent in the Hang Seng Index in
the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
