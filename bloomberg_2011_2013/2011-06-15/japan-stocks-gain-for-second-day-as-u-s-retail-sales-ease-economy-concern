Japanese stocks gained for a second
day after a report showed U.S. retail sales were better than
forecast, boosting the outlook for exporters.  Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that earns about a third of
its revenue in  North America , gained 0.8 percent.  Hino Motors
Ltd. (7205) , a maker of buses and trucks, climbed 4.4 percent after it
forecast a return to profit and said it restored production to
normal levels on a parts-supply recovery.  Tokyo  Electric Power
Co., owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant,
soared 32 percent, extending yesterday’s record gain after the
bourse clamped down on short-selling of the shares.  “Excessive concern about the future of the  U.S. economy 
will recede because retail sales, the most important data
showing U.S. personal spending, weren’t as bad as the market
expected,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Investors will likely buy companies
sensitive to the global economy.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.3 percent to 9,574.32
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, after earlier falling as much 0.3
percent. The broader Topix gained 0.2 percent to 824.65. The
index has tumbled 11 percent since March 10, the day before a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated  Japan ’s northeast
coast, triggering the worst nuclear accident in 25 years,
disrupting supply chains, and leaving almost 24,000 people dead
or missing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
