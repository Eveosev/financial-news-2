Colombia  plans to auction 20
trillion ($11.2 billion) worth of peso bonds next year, up from
18 trillion pesos in 2011, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said today.  Under the financing plan announced by Echeverry at a
conference in Bogota today, Colombia will issue a total of 27.5
trillion pesos worth of peso bonds next year and will also seek
to sell $3 billion in overseas bonds next year.  The central government will target a budget deficit next
year equal to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product compared
with an estimated shortfall of 4 percent of GDP this year,
Echeverry said. The consolidated budget deficit, which also
includes states, municipalities and state-run companies, should
shrink to 2.2 percent of GDP next year from an estimated 3.4
percent this year, he said.  Colombiaâ€™s economy will expand 5 percent to 6 percent both
this year and next, Echeverry said.  The government will seek $1.36 million in funding from
multilateral lenders next year, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
