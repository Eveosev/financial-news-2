Peru’s President-elect Ollanta Humala appointed chief economic adviser Kurt Burneo to head the
transition team at the  Finance Ministry , his Peru Wins party
said.  Humala, who will take office July 28, also appointed former
Central bank Vice President Oscar Dancourt and economic adviser
Felix Jimenez as finance and budget coordinators for the
transition, respectively, according to a statement last night.
Former Congressman Manuel Dammert will head the transition team
at the Energy & Mines Ministry.  The designated coordinators won’t necessarily be named
