Slovak car makers will probably
boost production 12 percent this year as foreign demand has
revived, the Association of the Slovak Automotive Industry said.  The Slovak units of  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , PSA Peugeot Citroen
and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  will assemble a record 630,000 vehicles this
year, compared with 561,993 cars in 2010, the industry
association said today in an e-mailed statement from Bratislava,
Slovakia.  The Slovak economy is benefiting from a revival in export
demand after the 2009 recession. Peugeot and Volkswagen have
announced plans to expand production in the eastern European
country, attracted by its euro-area membership and labor costs
lower than in the West.  Slovakia in the previous decade became a regional hub for
carmaking industry as manufacturers followed their customers in
setting up plants in the country. Automotive companies accounted
for 37 percent of total industrial sales last year, according to
the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
