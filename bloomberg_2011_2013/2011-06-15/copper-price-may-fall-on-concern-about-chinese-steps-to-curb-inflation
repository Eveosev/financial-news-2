Copper fell for the fifth time in
six sessions on concern that rising interest rates may curb
demand in  China , the world’s biggest metals consumer.  The country’s central bank yesterday increased lenders’
reserve requirements to a record after consumer prices
accelerated at the fastest pace in almost three years. Borrowing
costs may climb again within “weeks, if not days,” according
to an unsigned editorial in the  China Daily  today. Copper prices
have dropped 6.9 percent this year.  “Monetary tightening remains a concern,” said Nic Brown,
an analyst at Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. in  London . “The
high levels of inflation remain a concern. They haven’t gone
away.”  Copper futures for September delivery declined 3.45 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to settle at $4.139 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York .  The metal erased a gain of as much as 0.6 percent as
separate reports showed manufacturing in New York unexpectedly
contracted this month and U.S. industrial production rose less
than forecast in May.  The market was “choppy” after “disappointing” U.S.
economic data,  Randy North , a New York-based analyst at RBC
Capital Markets, said in an e-mailed report.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $15, or 0.2 percent, to $9,154 a metric ton
($4.15 a pound)  Zinc, lead, aluminum, nickel and tin fell in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
