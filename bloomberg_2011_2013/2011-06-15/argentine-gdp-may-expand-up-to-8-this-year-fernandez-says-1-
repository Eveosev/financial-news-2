Argentina ’s economy will expand 7.5
percent to 8 percent this year, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said today in Buenos Aires.  South America’s second-biggest economy expanded 9.9 percent
in May from a year earlier, Fernandez said.  “This is not going to be sustained the whole year,”
Fernandez said. “Growth by itself isn’t enough because there
are other countries in the region that grew, but there isn’t
always equity in that growth.”  Fernandez’s forecast for 2011 would mean that gross
domestic product growth will slow from last year’s 9.2 percent
expansion. After a 9.2 percent rise in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the
national statistics agency on June 17 to report year-on-year GDP
growth of 8.6 percent in the first quarter.  The country had a trade surplus of $4.8 billion in the
first five months of the year, Fernandez said.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 4.0955 per dollar from
4.0920 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
