Asia ’s naphtha crack spread fell to
the weakest in about 11 months, signaling eroding profit for
refiners making the petrochemical feedstock. Jet fuel’s premium
to gasoil strengthened.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$4.14 to $50.57 a metric ton at 12 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread is at
the narrowest since July 19.  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half July delivery were bid at $961 a ton against offers
at $964, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte, a broker.
That’s up from yesterday’s settlement of $960.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday dropped to $15.25 a
barrel, the lowest in a week, based on Bloomberg calculations. A
narrowing reforming margin shows motor fuel is becoming less
profitable to produce.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian benchmark Dubai
crude declined 54 cents to $20.61 a barrel, according to PVM Oil
Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of refining
profit, fell the most since June 6.  Gasoil swaps for July gained 5 cents to $132.60 a barrel,
PVM said. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil added 10 cents to $1.10.
This regrade is up for a fifth day, the longest rising streak in
a month, indicating it’s more profitable to make  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 24 cents to
$8.30 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference is the widest
since June 1, signaling growing losses from turning oil into
residual products.  July high-sulfur fuel oil swaps rebounded $2.25, or 0.3
percent, to $674 a ton after a two-day decline, PVM said. The
premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade was
unchanged after decreasing to $13.25. This viscosity spread has
narrowed 3.6 percent in the past week, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, has climbed more than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
