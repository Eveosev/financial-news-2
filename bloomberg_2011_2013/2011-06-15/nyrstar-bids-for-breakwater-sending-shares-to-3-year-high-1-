Nyrstar (NYR)  NV, the largest producer of
refined zinc, agreed to make a friendly C$619 million ($630
million) bid for  Canada ’s  Breakwater Resources Ltd. (BWR) , sending
shares of the Toronto-based company to a three-year high.  Nyrstar will offer C$7 a share in cash for Breakwater,
whose stockholders will also receive a special dividend of
C$0.50 a share, bringing the offer to C$663 million on a fully
diluted basis, Nyrstar said today in a statement.  Breakwater, which mines base and precious metals, surged as
much as 45 percent to C$7.55 in Toronto, the highest price since
May 2008, and traded at C$7.42 as of 12 p.m. local time.
Nyrstar, based in Balen,  Belgium , climbed 2.3 percent to 8.95
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close in Brussels.  The acquisition will add four zinc poly-metallic mines,
according to the statement. After ramping up by the end of 2012,
the assets will boost Nyrstar’s annual mine output to about
475,000 metric tons of zinc in concentrate, 28,000 tons of lead
in concentrate and 15,000 tons of copper in concentrate, as well
as increasing production of silver and gold, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
