Jordan  called on companies to send
offers by the end of June to be used for the first nuclear
reactor planned for the kingdom, the official Petra news agency
said, citing Energy Minister Khalid Touqan.  The government’s nuclear program remains a “top strategic
option” as energy generated from oil, gas, wind and sun won’t
be enough to cover Jordan’s needs, he said. The project is due
to cost as much as $4.5 billion at a generation capacity of
1,100 megawatts, he said. Jordan imported 97 percent of its
energy in 2010 at a total cost of $4 billion, he said.  Jordan’s atomic commission has pre-selected possible
technologies from Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Russia’s ZAO
Atomstroyexport, and Paris-based Atmea, a joint venture between
France’s Areva SA and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  of  Japan .
The kingdom plans to make the final selection by the end of the
year. The Arab country plans to build at least one reactor by
2019 and has signed nuclear cooperation agreements with about a
dozen countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
