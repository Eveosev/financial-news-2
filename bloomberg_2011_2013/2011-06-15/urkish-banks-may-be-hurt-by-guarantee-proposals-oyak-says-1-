Turkish banking industry profit will
be hurt by a proposed increase in deposit guarantees to their
customers, Oyak Securities said.  An increase in the savings  deposit insurance  guarantee to
the European Union average of 100,000 euros ($144,000) from
50,000 liras ($31,000) would affect 2.5 percent of depositors in
 Turkey  and double the burden on banks to $1 billion, Oyak said.  “Deposit rates for private banking clients should be
affected in principle, but we do not think banks can push the
costs to the segment, which has high bargaining power,” Oyak
said in a e-mailed note to clients today. ‘The increase will
affect banking system profits.’’  The Savings Deposit Insurance Fund is reviewing the level
of the guarantee and hasn’t made any decision, Sakir Ercan Gul,
head of the fund, said in a statement carried by state news
agency Anatolia today. Any decision will be taken in
consultation with the central bank, the banking regulator and
the Treasury, he said.  The fund is considering increasing the guarantee to as much
as 100,000 euros to align the amount with EU regulations,
 Haberturk  reported today, citing the fund.  The fund is also considering changes to the premiums banks
pay for the deposit insurance, Gul said, according to Anatolia.
The fund collects about 200 million liras ($125 million) from
the industry in premiums every three months, he said.  The index of Turkish banks has dropped almost 18 percent
since December 1, 2010.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s
largest listed bank by market value, has fallen almost 19
percent. Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, owned by  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Koc
Holding AS (KCHOL) , dropped 28 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
