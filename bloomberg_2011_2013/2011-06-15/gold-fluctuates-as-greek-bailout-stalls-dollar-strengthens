Gold fluctuated in  New York  as
investors weighed a stronger dollar against a weaker euro.  The euro fell as much as 1.2 percent against the dollar and
European stocks slid as the region’s finance ministers failed to
reach an agreement on another rescue package. Last month, gold
denominated in dollars and euros reached records.  “We’ve got a tug-of-war in gold,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “If you’re holding
gold in dollars, you’re selling into the rallies. If you’re
holding gold in euros, you’re buying the dips.”  Gold futures for August delivery fell $2 to $1,522.40 an
ounce at 12:19 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the price
gained as much as 0.7 percent and fell as much as 0.6 percent.
Before today, the metal advanced 7.2 percent this year, reaching
a record $1,577.40 on May 2. Gold denominated in euros touched
an all-time high on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
