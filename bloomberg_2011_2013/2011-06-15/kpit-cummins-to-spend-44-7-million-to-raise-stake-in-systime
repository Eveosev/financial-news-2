KPIT Cummins Infosystems Ltd. (KPIT)  will
spend 2 billion rupees ($44.7 million) in the next three years
to buy shares it doesn’t own in Mumbai-based Systime, which
installs and manages software made by Oracle Corp.  KPIT Cummins last month paid 1 billion rupees to acquire 50
percent of Systime. The Pune, India-based  software developer 
will use its own funds to raise stake in Systime, Chairman Ravi Pandit said in a phone interview.  The acquisition helped KPIT Cummins expand into providing
software solutions and add clients such as BP Plc, Burmah
Castrol Plc, and Exxon Mobil Corp., Ankita Somani, an analyst at
Angel Broking Ltd., wrote in a May 27 report. The purchase will
increase KPIT Cummins’s earnings-per-share from the year
beginning April 2012, wrote Somani, who recommends investors buy
the shares.  Software such as anti-skid braking systems for cars and for
customers in the energy and utilities industry are boosting
growth, Pandit said. “The third area that is driving growth is
emerging markets like India and  China ,” he said.  KPIT Cummins fell 0.9 percent to 170.05 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The shares have risen 17 percent this year,
compared with a 12 percent drop in the Bombay Stock Exchange’s
benchmark Sensitive Index.  The  company  increased prices for clients by as much as 7.5
percent, Pandit said. Net income is forecast to increase by
about 27 percent to $26.6 million on sales of $285 million in
the year ending March 31, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
