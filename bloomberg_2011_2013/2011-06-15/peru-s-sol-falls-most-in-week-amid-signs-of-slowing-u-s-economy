Peru’s sol fell the most in more
than a week on concern about a slowing U.S. economy and a
bailout for  Greece , curbing demand for the Andean nation’s sol-
denominated assets.  The currency weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7623 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, from 2.7595 yesterday.  U.S. stocks fell after the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s manufacturing index dropped to the lowest level since
November, while separate data showed U.S. industrial production
rose less than expected. The euro fell on concern that Greek
austerity measures needed to qualify for international aid will
be put in jeopardy after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
offered to step aside amid protests over budget cuts.  “Banks and foreign investors increased their dollar
holdings because of the poor U.S. economic indicators and the
problems in Greece,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco
Santander  in Lima.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the spot
currency market today or issue certificates of deposit payable
in dollars.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.50 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
