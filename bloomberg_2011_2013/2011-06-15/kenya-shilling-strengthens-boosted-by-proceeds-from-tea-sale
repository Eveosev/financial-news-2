Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day against the dollar as traders sought the local
currency to convert dollar proceeds following a tea auction.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
1.1 percent to 88.35 per dollar by 4:44 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, from yesterday’s close of 89.30.  African tea prices rose to $2.68 per kilogram at a sale in
the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, from $2.65 a week earlier, Tea
Brokers East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today. Kenya
is the world’s biggest exporter of black tea.  “The tea sale proceeds have boosted the local unit by
increasing dollar supply,” Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
