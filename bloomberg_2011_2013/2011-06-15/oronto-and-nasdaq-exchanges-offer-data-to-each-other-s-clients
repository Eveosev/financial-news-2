The companies that own the Toronto
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market will make one another’s
quotation and trading data available to customers who place
their servers near each venue’s main computers.  TMX Group Inc. (X)  and  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  said today their
information-services divisions agreed to provide each other’s
data feeds to brokers, high-frequency traders and others using
the bourses’ co-location services, which enable the customers to
maintain their computers near the exchange’s engines that match
buy and sell orders. That reduces the time it takes their
systems to receive data and make trading decisions.  “Our collaboration with TMX benefits our market data
customers by offering access to our respective data sets in
secure and reliable data centers in a more cost-effective
fashion,” Brian Hyndman, senior vice president of global data
products at Nasdaq OMX, said in a statement. “This agreement
allows domestically based customers access to a broader and
richer data set without the high cost of developing direct
connections.”  Nasdaq OMX clients can pay to receive real-time data
including the last sales, quotations and dividends from the
Toronto market and  TSX Venture Exchange . They can also get
information about the prices at which investors are willing to
buy and sell securities traded on the Canadian markets away from
the best level.  TMX customers can get similar trading and quotation
information from Nasdaq OMX. Nasdaq OMX is based in  New York  and
TMX is in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
