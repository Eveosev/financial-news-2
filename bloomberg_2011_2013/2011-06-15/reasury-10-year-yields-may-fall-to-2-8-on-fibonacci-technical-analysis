Treasury 10-year yields may fall to
a six-month low of 2.8 percent if they break through a key level
of resistance, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said, citing
trading patterns.  Rates will extend their downtrend if they drop below 2.97
percent, which represents the last 38.2 percent of their decline
from last year’s high of 4 percent on April 5 to the Oct. 8 low
of 2.33 percent, said Kenichi Imai, chief manager of proprietary
trading at the unit of  Japan ’s largest bank, referring to
Fibonacci analysis.  “U.S. 10-year note yields have a stronger bias toward a
drop,” Tokyo-based Imai said, forecasting yields will range
between 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent in the near term. “If rates
resume declining again, they may fall toward 2.8 percent.”  The benchmark 10-year note yielded 3.08 percent as of 10:40
a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
last time the yield was at 2.8 percent was on Dec. 1.  Ten-year rates dropped below 3.17 percent last month,
breaching the 50 percent mark of last year’s decline. Rates had
then stalled for almost two weeks near the 2.97 percent
resistance level before closing at 3.10 percent yesterday.  Ten-year yields will climb to 3.14 percent by June, 3.42
percent by September and 3.63 percent by year-end, according to
the weighted average forecasts of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentages include 23.6, 38.2, 50 and 61.8.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
