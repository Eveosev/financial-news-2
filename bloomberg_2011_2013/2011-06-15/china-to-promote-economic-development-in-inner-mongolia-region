China will increase the building of
transportation, water projects, electricity grid and information
networks in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to a
 statement  on the central government’s website.  The government will promote the construction of national
energy reserves, develop equipment manufacturing and resource-
based industries and modernize the animal husbandry industry,
the statement said, citing a meeting chaired by Premier  Wen
Jiabao . The government will also halt the deterioration of the
environment and increase grasslands and forests, it said.  Building the region will “solidify ethnic unity and
maintain social stability in the border region,” the statement
said. The government will raise the living standards of the
residents above national levels by 2020, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
