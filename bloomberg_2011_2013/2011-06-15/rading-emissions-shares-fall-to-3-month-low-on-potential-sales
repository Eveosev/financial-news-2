Trading Emissions Plc fell to its
lowest level in three months in  London  trading after the company
received possible offers for its private equity and carbon
assets.  The shares dropped 9.7 percent today to 98 pence as of
11:20 a.m. after the company said it expected it will return a
“minimum” of 50 pence a share.  “The carbon assets should be worth more, raising a concern
that the sale could be made at a discount,” said Adam Forsyth,
an analyst in London for the Matrix Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
