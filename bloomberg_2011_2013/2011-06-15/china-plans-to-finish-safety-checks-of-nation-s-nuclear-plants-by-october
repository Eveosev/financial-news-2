China  plans to finish safety checks
of all its nuclear plants by October, completing one stage of a
nationwide review of its atomic power industry following Japan’s
Fukushima crisis.  Inspection of existing reactors has been completed, the
Ministry of Environmental Protection, said in a  report  posted on
its website. The checks, which include plants under
construction, started in April and will last six months,
according to the report dated yesterday.  China, the country with the most nuclear reactors being
built, suspended approval of new projects on March 16 after a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami led to Japan’s worst atomic
disaster in 25 years. The government will review its long-term
development plan for the industry, it said then.  The nation has 13 nuclear generators in commercial
operation and 28 under construction, the ministry said. China
may have more than 100 atomic reactors by 2020, it said.  Radiation leaks during  Japan ’s nuclear crisis sparked panic
among the Chinese public, including a rush to buy salt, which
was seen as a defense against radiation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
