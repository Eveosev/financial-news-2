Conergy AG (CGY) , the maker of equipment
for generating solar power, forecast it will no longer reach its
full-year targets for more than 1 billion euros ($1.42 billion)
in sales and “mid-double-digit” million euros in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  The first months of the second quarter “saw no significant
improvement in the solar markets that would have been able to
compensate for the overall disappointing first quarter,”
Conergy said in a regulatory statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
