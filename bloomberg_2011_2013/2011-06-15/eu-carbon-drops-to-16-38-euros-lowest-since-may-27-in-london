European Union carbon allowances for
December 2013 dropped at a faster pace than those for this year
as 72 companies including  Denmark ’s biggest utility Dong Energy
A/S urged the bloc to adopt a stricter 2020 climate target.  Carbon permits for 2013 fell 1.9 percent to close at 18.20
euros ($25.84) a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange,
the lowest level since May 23. Permits for December 2011
declined 1.5 percent to 16.25 euros.  The companies joined environmental group  World Wide Fund
for Nature , or WWF, in urging European governments to support a
move to a 30-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions, compared
with the current goal of a 20-percent reduction by 2020 from
1990 levels, according to a  declaration  published before a
meeting of EU environment ministers on June 21. The EU is
finalizing rules for the third phase of the market, which runs
from 2013 through 2020.  “ Greece  is going bankrupt, other countries possibly as
well, and the EU is pressing ahead with a market that
undoubtedly will hurt the economy, without putting enough
pressure on its peers --  China  and the U.S.,” said Jan Pravda,
director of the Dublin-based emissions brokerage Carbon
Warehouse.  “I don’t think Europe, with its 10 percent of emissions,
can become the sole air conditioner of the planet,” Pravda said
today in a phone interview from Prague. “A geopolitical game”
between  Brazil , Russia,  India , China, the U.S. and the EU is
making the carbon market very risky, he said. “I would not take
a position in carbon these days. I spend my time on it, but not
a lot of capital.”  The premium of 2013 carbon over 2012, traded as a separate
contract, narrowed 5.2 percent to 1.27 euros on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
