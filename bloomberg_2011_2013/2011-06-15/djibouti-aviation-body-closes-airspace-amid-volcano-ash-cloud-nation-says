Djibouti  closed its airspace and the
main airport yesterday because of an ash cloud emitted by an
erupting volcano in neighboring Eritrea,  La Nation  reported,
citing the Horn of Africa nation’s aviation authority.  Airlines in the country delayed their departures, while
arrivals were also postponed, the Djibouti-based newspaper said.  Eritrea’s Nabro volcano erupted on June 12, spewing an ash
cloud about 13.5 kilometers (8.4 miles) into the atmosphere,
according to the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Toulouse,
 France . Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise, the state-owned carrier,
said yesterday some of its flights to northern Ethiopia,
Djibouti and Sudan had been affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
