Team Health Inc., the provider of
health-care professionals to hospitals and clinics, is seeking
lender commitments by June 23 on $575 million in loans to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
deal.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the transaction, which
includes a $300 million, seven-year  term loan  B that may pay
2.75 percentage points to 3 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the person, who declined to
be identified because the terms are private. Libor, the rate
banks charge to lend to each other, will have a one percent
floor.  The Knoxville, Tennessee-based company is proposing to sell
the loan at 99.5 cents on the dollar, the person said. Lenders
to the facility will get one year of 101 soft-call protection,
meaning Team Health would have to pay one cent more than face
value to reprice the debt in its first year.  The deal includes a $165 million revolving  credit line  and
a $110 million term loan A, both due in five years, the person
said. These loans will pay 2.25 percentage points more than
Libor. There’s a 45 basis points fee for unused portions on the
revolver.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. A term loan B is
sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan
obligations, bank loan mutual funds and  hedge funds . A term loan
A is sold mainly to banks. In a revolving credit facility, money
can be borrowed again once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it
can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
