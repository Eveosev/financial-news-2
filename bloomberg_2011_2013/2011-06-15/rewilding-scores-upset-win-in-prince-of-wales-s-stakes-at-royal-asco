Rewilding, ridden by Frankie Dettori, overhauled odds-on favorite So You Think in the closing
yards to win the Prince of  Wales ’s Stakes, the main race on the
second day of horseracing’s Royal Ascot meeting.  The 17-2 winner just got ahead of 4-11 chance So You Think
on the finish line as the Australian import couldn’t maintain
the lead he took when turning into the home straight.  Sri Putra (66-1) was third in the 1 1/4-mile event, which
carried a top prize of 227,000 pounds ($370,000).  “It was a tremendous battle, two great horses. It’s a
sheer joy to be in the race,” Dettori told the British
Broadcasting Corp. “Rewilding showed his true colors today. It
was a good effort from So You Think as well.”  Rewilding is trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni as part of Dubai
ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum’s Godolphin racing
stable, a keen rival of Ireland-based Coolmore Stud, the owner
of So You Think.  The second-placed horse, ridden today by  Ryan Moore  and
trained by Aidan O’Brien, won five Group One races in  Australia .
Coolmore purchased a majority share in him in November after he
won Australia’s Cox Plate for the second straight year and
finished third in the Melbourne Cup.  The five-day Royal Ascot meeting in Berkshire west of
 London , celebrates its 300th anniversary this year. It’s one of
the top events in U.K. flat racing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
