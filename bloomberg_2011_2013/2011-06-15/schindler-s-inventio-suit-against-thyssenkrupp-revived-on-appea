Schindler Holding AG (SCHP) , the world’s
second-largest maker of elevators, won an appeals court ruling
that revives a patent-infringement lawsuit brought by its
Inventio unit against competitor  ThyssenKrupp AG. (TKA)   A federal judge erred when he said two Inventio patents
covering a process of upgrading elevators were invalid because
they didn’t adequately define the invention, the  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in  Washington  said today in an
 opinion  posted on its website. The panel sent the case back to
the trial court in Wilmington, Delaware, for further review.  The dispute is over patents involving a way to add new
functions to existing controls in an elevator. Schindler, based
in Hergiswil, Switzerland, got about 66 percent of its revenue
last year from its elevator and escalator unit.  ThyssenKrupp,  Germany ’s largest steelmaker, said in May
that its elevator production and servicing division had sales of
1.28 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the quarter ended in March.
Chief Executive Officer Heinrich Hiesinger said last month that
the Essen, Germany-based company is looking to buy “smaller and
medium-sized” elevator service providers to expand the
business.  The case is Inventio AG v. ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas
Corp., 2010-1525, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Inventio AG v.
ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas Corp., 08CV874, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
