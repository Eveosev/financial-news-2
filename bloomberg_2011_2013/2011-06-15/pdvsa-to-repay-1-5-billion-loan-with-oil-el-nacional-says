The  Japan Bank for International
Cooperation  is preparing a $1.5 billion loan for Petroleos de
 Venezuela  SA that would be paid back with oil, newspaper El
Nacional  reported , citing a Japanese diplomat.  PDVSA, as Venezuela’s state oil company is called, would be
able to repay the loan with as much as 3 million barrels of oil
a year that would be sent to Japanese companies over a five-year
period, the Caracas-based daily newspaper reported, citing
Takashi Kondo, a diplomat at the Japanese embassy in Caracas.  “The oil blend will be  Santa Barbara , the only kind of
Venezuelan oil that we can use in our refineries because of its
light density,” Kondo told El Nacional. “This will help us
with power generation problems we are confronting after the
tragedy we suffered.”  PDVSA will sign an agreement for the loan with Japanese
officials on June 28, El Nacional reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
