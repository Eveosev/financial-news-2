Following is the text of the May
consumer prices from the Labor Department.  Consumer Price Index - May 2011  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
increased 0.2 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis,
the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Over the
last 12 months, the all items index increased 3.6 percent
before seasonal adjustment.  The index for all items less food and energy increased
0.3 percent in May, its largest increase since July 2008. The
indexes for apparel, shelter, new vehicles, and recreation
all contributed to the acceleration, rising more in May than
in April. These increases more than offset declines in the
indexes for airline fare, tobacco, and personal care.  The food index rose in May as well. The food at home
index repeated its April increase of 0.5 percent as four of
the six major grocery store food group indexes increased,
with the index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rising the
most. In contrast, the energy index, which had been rising
sharply, declined in May.  The gasoline index decreased for
the first time since last June, although the index for
household energy increased.  The upward trend among the 12 month increases of major
indexes continued in May. The 12 month change in the all
items index, which was 1.1 percent as recently as November,
reached 3.6 percent in May. The energy index has increased
21.5 percent over the last 12 months, the food index has
risen 3.5 percent and the index for all items less food and
energy has increased 1.5 percent. All of these figures have
been rising in recent months.  Consumer Price Index  Data for May 2011  Food  The food index rose 0.4 percent in May, the same
increase as in April. The food at home index increased 0.5
percent and has risen 3.7 percent since December. Among major
grocery store food groups, the index for meats, poultry,
fish, and eggs rose 1.5 percent and the cereals and bakery
products index increased 1.0 percent. The dairy and related
products index and the index for other food at home posted
smaller increases, while the index for nonalcoholic beverages
was unchanged. The only group to decline was the fruits and
vegetables index, which declined 1.3 percent as a sharp
decline in the index for tomatoes caused the fresh vegetables
index to fall for the second straight month after sharp
increases early in the year. The food at home index has risen
4.4 percent over the last 12 months with all major grocery
store food groups posting increases. The index for food away
from home rose 0.2 percent in May after rising 0.3 percent in
each of the previous two months.  Energy  The energy index declined 1.0 percent in May ending a
series of ten consecutive advances. After a series of several
sharp increases, the gasoline index declined 2.0 percent in
May. (Before seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices rose 3.6
percent in May.) Despite the May decline, the gasoline index
has increased 23.7 percent over the past six months. The
index for household energy increased in May, rising 0.5
percent after a 0.7 percent increase in April. The index for
electricity rose 0.8 percent, more than offsetting a 0.8
percent decline in the fuel oil index and a 0.3 percent
decrease in the index for natural gas. The household energy
index has risen 2.9 percent over the last 12 months, with the
fuel oil index up 36.0 percent and the electricity index up
1.8 percent but the index for natural gas down 1.2 percent.  All items less food and energy  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3
percent in May after increasing 0.1 percent in March and 0.2
percent in April. The shelter index rose 0.2 percent in May
after increasing 0.1 percent in each of the seven previous
months. Both rent and owners' equivalent rent rose 0.1
percent; the acceleration in shelter was due to the index for
lodging away from home, which rose 2.9 percent in May after
being unchanged in April. The apparel index increased in May,
rising 1.2 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in April. The
index for new vehicles rose 1.1 percent in May after
increasing 0.7 percent in April; the index for used cars and
trucks also rose 1.1 percent. The index for recreation, which
was unchanged in April, rose 0.3 percent in May. The medical
care index rose 0.2 percent, with the index for medical care
commodities unchanged and the index for medical care services
up 0.3 percent. The index for household furnishings and
operations advanced 0.2 percent, the same increase as in
April. In contrast to these increases, the index for airline
fares fell 1.3 percent in May, and the indexes for tobacco
and for personal care both declined 0.2 percent.  The index for all items less food and energy increased
1.5 percent over the last 12 months, with virtually all of
its major component indexes rising at a faster rate over the
past six months than they did from May to November of 2010.  Not seasonally adjusted CPI measures  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
increased 3.6 percent over the last 12 months to an index
level of 225.964 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index
increased 0.5 percent prior to seasonal adjustment.  The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
Clerical Workers (CPI-W) increased 4.1 percent over the last
12 months to an index level of 222.954 (1982-84=100). For the
month, the index rose 0.5 percent prior to seasonal
adjustment.  The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
(C-CPI-U) increased 3.3 percent over the last 12 months. For
the month, the index increased 0.4 percent on a not
seasonally adjusted basis. Please note that the indexes for
the post-2009 period are subject to revision.  The Consumer Price Index for June 2011 is scheduled to
be released on Friday, July 15, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  To contact the reporter on this story:
