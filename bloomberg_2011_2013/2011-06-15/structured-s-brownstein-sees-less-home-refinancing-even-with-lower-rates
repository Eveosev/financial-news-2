Don Brownstein, whose mortgage hedge
fund was the top performer last year, said that most homeowners
won’t refinance even though rates are at record lows.  “The refinancing is apt to be subdued,” Brownstein, head
of Stamford, Connecticut-based Structured Portfolio Management
LLC, said today in an interview with Erik Schatzker on
Bloomberg Television.  Mortgage rates  for a 30-year loan are now
at 4.5 percent compared with 6.3 percent three years ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fewer people will refinance, he said, because homeowners’
credit ratings have declined along with housing prices. Lenders
are also charging higher fees.  Brownstein’s main fund, Structured Servicing Holdings LP,
returned 50 percent in the first 10 months of 2010, putting him
at the top of Bloomberg Markets’ list of the 100 best-performing
funds managing $1 billion or more.  Brownstein, 67, a former philosophy professor, said that to
boost economic growth, the government needs to make banks lend
more money.  “There was an opportunity missed back in 2008 and 2009,”
he said, when the government could have insisted that the money
they handed out to banks be used to make loans.  “Had the pressure been put on them, perhaps we would have
gotten more bang for the buck,” he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
