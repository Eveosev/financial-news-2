Trading of bullish euro options
climbed to a record in the U.S., boosted by a single wager that
the exchange-traded fund tracking the common currency will
reverse declines in the next month.  More than 33,300 calls to buy the Euro Currency Trust
changed hands in  New York  today, 10 times the four-week average,
as the ETF slipped 1.9 percent, the biggest decline in more than
a month, to $141.16. An investor bought 5,000 July $141 calls,
according to a report from strategists at Susquehanna Financial
Group LLLP. The ETF has retreated 4.5 percent from this year’s
peak of $147.74 on May 2.  “This investor appears bullish on the euro and risks
losing the entire premium paid should shares trade below $141 at
expiration,” the  Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania-based strategists
wrote.  The euro today fell 1.8 percent, the most in more than a
month, to $1.4181 per  U.S. dollar  as European officials
struggled to agree on a second Greek financial rescue. The
shared currency weakened against 13 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts, dropping the most against the Taiwanese dollar,
1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
