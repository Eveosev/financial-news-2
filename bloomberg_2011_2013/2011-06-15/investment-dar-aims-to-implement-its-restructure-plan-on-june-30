Investment Dar Co., the Kuwait-based
owner of half of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., said it will start
implementing a plan to restructure 1.37 billion dinars ($5
billion) of debt on June 30.  Investment Dar said June 2 that Kuwait’s Special Circuit
Court of Appeal approved the company’s request for application
of the country’s Financial Stability Law, providing the legal
framework enabling it to implement the plan.  “Approximately 82 million dinars in total will be paid out
in the first year, which will go to individual investors and
small non-financial institutions,” Investment Dar said in an e-
mailed statement today. “In the second, third, fourth and fifth
years there will be fixed payments to the remainder of the banks
and investors, followed by a final payment before June 30, 2017,
which will make up the balance owed to this group plus an amount
equating to an annual profit over the 8.5 year period.”  Throughout the plan, the company will be subject to certain
commercial restrictions, including a freeze on dividends to
shareholders and new investments, the statement said.  The company said in March last year that it submitted an
application in court seeking protection under the Financial
Stability Law. The law was enacted by the government in April
2009 to bolster financial institutions hurt by the credit
crisis.  Investment Dar, which missed a payment on a $100 million
Islamic bond in May 2009, started talks in 2009 to restructure
its debt after the global financial crisis hit Kuwaiti banks and
investment firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
