Slovenian banks, inlcuding Nova
Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.,
agreed to sell more than 50 percent of  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR) 
d.d., the largest supermarket chain in the Balkans as they seek
to dispose of assets and strengthen their capital.  Signatories include lenders Abanka Vipa d.d., Banka Celje
d.d., Gorenjska Banka d.d., the Slovenian unit of  Austria ’s Hypo
Alpe-Adria Bank d.d., financial group NFD Holding d.d. and
Pivovarna Lasko Group d.d., the single largest investor in
Mercator, Nova Ljubljanska said in an e-mailed statement today.  Banks in Slovenia are seeking to sell assets and improve
their capital base which is still under strain from the impact
of the worst recession in two decades. The country’s three
largest lenders, Nova Ljubljanska, Nova Kreditna and Abanka had
their deposit and debt ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service
on June 8 amid concern over rising bad loans, especially from
the  construction industry .  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR) , which in May rejected an offer from
Agrokor d.d., Mercator’s Croatian rival for a 23 percent stake
in the Slovenian company, also needs to sell assets to repay
debt of about 400 million euros ($571 million) this year,
according to its chief executive officer Dusan Zorko.  The sale also attracted bids from private equity groups Mid
Europa Partners Ltd. and Warburg Pincus LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
