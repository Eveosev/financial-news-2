Ukraine may temporarily ban the sale
of farmland to foreigners once Parliament adopts legislation
designed to encourage investment in agriculture by allowing
landowners greater control over their plots, Interfax-Ukraine
reported, citing President  Viktor Yanukovych .  There are 6.5 million farmland plots in Ukraine and owners
need a fair price for leasing their fields, the Kiev-based
newswire cited the president as saying. Conditions will also be
set to allow owners to sell their plots, Yanukovych said,
according to Interfax. The legislation may be sent to Parliament
for approval in September, he added.  Yanukovych said in February that the country will allow
farmland sales next year for the first time to stimulate
investment. Currently, food production companies lease plots
from individual owners.  To contact the reporters on this story:
