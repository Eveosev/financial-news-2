Tea production in  Kenya , the world’s
biggest exporter of the black variety of the leaves, fell 12
percent in April to 31,482 metric tons from a year earlier, the
 Kenya National Statistics Bureau  said.  Export of the leaves increased to 32,083 tons in the month
from 27,945 tons in April 2010, the Nairobi-based bureau said in
a statement on its website today.  Unseasonably dry weather has curbed agricultural output in
Kenya, which relies on farming for a quarter of its gross
domestic product. On June 8, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta 
forecast that growth in East Africa’s largest economy will slow
to 5.3 percent this year from 5.6 percent in 2010.  Kenyan coffee exports rose 1.1 percent to 4,253.5 tons in
April, up from 4,205.7 tons the same month a year earlier, while
sugar output surged by a fifth to 54,968 tons in March from a
year ago.  Cement production grew to 310,276 tons in April from
284,987 tons a year earlier and consumption of building
materials advanced 9 percent in the same period to 266,951 tons,
the bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
