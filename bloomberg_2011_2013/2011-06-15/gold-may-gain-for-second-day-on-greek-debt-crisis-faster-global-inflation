Gold may advance for a second day on
concerns that a rescue plan for debt-saddled  Greece  will take
longer to craft and global inflation may accelerate, boosting
demand for precious metals as a protection of wealth.  Immediate-delivery gold rose as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,530.35 an ounce before trading at $1,521.68 at 3:02 p.m. in
Singapore. The August-delivery contract was little changed at
$1,523.60 an ounce. Cash silver climbed as much as 0.9 percent
to $35.7150 an ounce before declining 0.2 percent to $35.3350.  Euro-area finance chiefs struggling to break a deadlock on
how to enroll investors in a second Greek rescue without
triggering a default said yesterday they may need more time to
reach a deal. Data showed inflation in  China  accelerating to the
fastest pace since 2008 and exceeding estimates in  India .  “Concerns over the euro-zone debt situation and global
inflation have reemerged,” Marc Ground, an analyst at  Standard
Bank  Plc, said in a note. An increased likelihood of default in
Greece “raised anxiety in markets, enhancing the safe-haven
appeal of precious metals, especially gold and silver.”  Gold will climb to more than $1,600 this year as low
 interest rates  and concern inflation may quicken boost demand,
Standard Bank said yesterday. Gold may extend a decade-long
rally as demand surges from emerging markets including China,
according to the producer-funded World Gold Council, or WGC.  Bullion is up 7.2 percent this year, touching a record
$1,577.57 an ounce on May 2, as individual investors, pension
funds and central banks seek to preserve their wealth against a
weaker dollar, debt turmoil in  Europe  and inflation. The dollar
has slumped 5.5 percent this year against six major currencies.  China, India  China’s inflation pressures have yet to be contained by
four interest-rate increases since September. The People’s Bank
of China yesterday raised banks’ reserve requirements to drain
cash from the economy after consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in
May. India also reported a bigger-than-forecast 9.06 percent
gain in its wholesale-price index for the same month.  “There’s a tidal wave of gold demand coming,” Jason Toussaint, WGC’s managing director of U.S. and investment, said
yesterday at the Bloomberg Link Money Managers Conference in
 Boston . “A key is the long-term fundamental change in emerging
markets. The biggest markets of growth are China and India.”  Spot palladium increased as much as 0.7 percent to $799.25
an ounce and last traded at $794.50 an ounce. Immediate-delivery
platinum declined 0.2 percent to $1,789.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
