KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, extended
gains into a second day after saying it expects first-half net
income will climb more than 50 percent.  The shares rose as much as 4.9 percent to 10.80 shillings
before trading 1.5 percent higher at 10.45 shillings by 11:35
a.m. in Nairobi.  “The company gave a profit forecast, that is why it is
going up,” Renaldo D’Souza, an analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “Consumption
should go up due to increased economic activity”.  Kenya ’s Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  last week forecast
economic growth of 5.3 percent this year and 6.1 percent in 2012
in a speech to parliament.  The east African nation cut the cost of so-called super
petrol, the most commonly used gasoline, by 0.4 percent in the
capital, Nairobi. The decision reduces the price of a liter (0.3
gallon) of super petrol to 114.93 shillings ($1.29) from today
until July 14, the Nairobi-based  Energy Regulatory Commission 
said in its monthly review of fuel costs, emailed yesterday.  Nairobi accounts for as much as 55 percent of fuel
consumption in east  Africa ’s biggest economy. The price of
kerosene, which is used for cooking and lighting, will drop by
6.9 shillings per liter in Nairobi after the government removed
excise duty on the fuel, while diesel will decrease by 1.72
shillings per liter, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
