Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , an
Egyptian luxury-property developer, retreated the most this
month after denying it was in talks to sell a stake to a Persian
Gulf investor.  The shares of the Cairo-based company lost 3.2 percent, the
most since May 31, to 2.45 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. The benchmark EGX 30 Index retreated 0.9
percent.  The company isn’t negotiating to sell a stake to a Persian
Gulf real-estate developer, Bassem el-Shawy, senior investor
relations manager at  Palm Hills , said in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg News yesterday after the market closed.
“But the company is open to all options,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
