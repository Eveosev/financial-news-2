Gold rose for the second straight
day as Greek bailout talks stalled, driving the euro lower and
boosting the appeal of the precious metal as a haven.  The euro fell as much as 2 percent against the dollar and
European equities slid as the region’s finance ministers failed
to reach an agreement on another rescue package. BNP Paribas SA,
 France ’s biggest bank, and rivals Societe Generale SA and Credit
Agricole SA may have their credit ratings cut by Moody’s
Investors Service because of their holdings in Greece.  “All the bickering in Europe over the Greek bailout is
making investors nervous,” said Matt Zeman, a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in  Chicago . “It sucks gold buyers back into
the market.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $1.80, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1,526.20 an ounce at 1:54 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Earlier, the price climbed as much as 0.7
percent after gaining 0.6 percent yesterday. The metal has
advanced 7.4 percent this year, reaching a record $1,577.40 on
May 2.  S&P gave  Greece  the firm’s lowest credit rating, moving to
CCC from B. Yields on 10-year Greek bonds approached 18 percent,
the highest in the 17-nation euro area’s history.  “Gold is a safe-haven instrument,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago. “With the movement in currencies, there’s a shift back
into gold.”  Gold’s gains were limited as the dollar’s rally eroded the
appeal of the metal as an alternative investment. Earlier, the
commodity dropped as much as 0.6 percent.  ‘Tug of War’  “We’ve got a tug of war in gold,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “If you’re holding
gold in dollars, you’re selling into the rallies. If you’re
holding gold in euros, you’re buying the dips.”  Silver futures for July delivery were little changed at
$35.41 an ounce. The price has gained 14 percent this year.  Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $16.75, or
2.1 percent, to $776 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for July delivery fell $20.70, or 1.2
percent, to $1,774.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
