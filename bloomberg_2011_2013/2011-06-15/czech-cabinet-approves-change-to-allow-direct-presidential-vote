The Czech government approved draft
legislation to allow direct elections of the president, who
selects policy makers and appoints prime ministers.  The bill will go to lawmakers in both houses of parliament,
who up to now were the ones to elect the country’s head of
state, Radek John, leader of the Public Affairs party, one of
the three ruling coalition members, told reporters in  Prague 
today.  The president doesn’t hold executive powers, although he
selects the political leader who attempts to form the government
after general elections. The president may also influence
monetary policy as the position holds the sole right to name
members of the central bank’s rate-setting board.  The second term of Czech President Vaclav Klaus, who
delayed signing the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty in 2009 and
has opposed a rush into the euro area, will end in 2013 and the
current law forbids him to seek the post again.  The change in the way presidents are elected will require
an amendment to the country’s Constitution, which needs the
support of the opposition in order to have enough votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
