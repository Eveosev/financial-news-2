Governor Luc Coene, comments on  European Central Bank  monetary
policy.  He spoke to reporters in Brussels today.  “With negative real  interest rates , monetary policy is
still very accommodative and the pace of economic growth in
European countries is exceeding potential growth rates, a clear
signal that monetary policy is still accommodative.”  “The European Central Bank also takes into account the
financial problems which exist, particularly with regard to
sovereign debt, because we have taken a couple of non-standard
measures such as providing liquidity at fixed rate and for an
unlimited period of time, which has even been extended, and the
mechanism of bond purchases, which has equally been
maintained.”  “That gives an indication that we try to take into account
specific elements in certain countries and we don’t believe that
an interest-rate increase with 25 basis points is of such a
nature that it would stop the recovery at this time.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
