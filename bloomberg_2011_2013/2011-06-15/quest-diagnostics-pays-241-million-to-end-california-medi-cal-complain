(Corrects to say May 19 settlement announcement was
inadvertently reposted temporarily on attorney general’s website
and not e-mailed.)  Quest Diagnostics Inc.,  California ’s
largest provider of medical laboratory testing, agreed to pay
$241 million to settle state claims that it overcharged
California’s medical program for the poor, Attorney General
Kamala Harris said in a May 19 settlement announcement that was
inadvertently reposted temporarily today on her web site.  The accord is the largest recovery in the history of
California’s False Claims Act, Harris said. The settlement
resolved a 2005 lawsuit filed by a whistle-blower alleging that
Madison, New Jersey-based Quest overcharged the Medi-Cal program
for more than 15 years and gave kickbacks in the form of
discounted or free testing to doctors, hospitals and clinics
that referred patients to the labs, Harris said.  Quest, which announced the settlement last month, denied
wrongdoing, according to the agreement. The company will take an
after-tax charge of $195 million, or $1.19 a share, reducing by
the same amount its income from continuing operations reported
on April 20, Quest said in a May 9 statement.  The charge results in Quest restating its earnings to a
loss for continuing operations of $53 million, or 33 cents a
share, from the previously reported profit of $141 million, or
86 cents a share, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
