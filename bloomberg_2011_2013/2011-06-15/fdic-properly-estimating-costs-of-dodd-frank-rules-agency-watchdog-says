The  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
is properly estimating the costs of new capital and derivatives
regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Act, according to the
agency’s internal watchdog.  “We found that the FDIC assigned highly qualified subject
matter experts to develop the technical aspects of the proposed
rules and to conduct economic analysis, where appropriate,” the
FDIC inspector general said in  a report  requested by Republicans
on the Senate Banking Committee.  The report reviewed the agency’s proposed rules for capital
and margin requirements in swap transactions, retention of risk
in securities and broader capital standards.  Senate Republicans have sought reviews by inspectors
general for five agencies, questioning whether regulators are
properly estimating the economic impact of Dodd-Frank rules.  In an April 15 report, the inspector general of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the regulator has
relied mainly on lawyers instead of agency economists to produce
“one-size-fits-all” cost estimates of swaps regulations. That
review was requested by Representative Frank D. Lucas, an
Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee, and Representative Michael Conaway, a Texas
Republican.  Companies including CME Group Inc. have said the CFTC,
which oversees most of the swaps market, hasn’t adequately
estimated the costs of the new derivatives rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
