What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.   -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  after the Canadian Wheat Board
said excessive rainfall may prevent farmers from sowing 6
million to 8 million acres, boosting demand for U.S. supplies,
said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that demand for cooking oil and animal
feed will outpace global production, Grow said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound
higher, and soybean-meal futures may open little changed, he
said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the CBOT on speculation that warm, wet weather forecast
for the next two weeks in the U.S. Midwest will aid crop
development after rains curbed planting this year, Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
