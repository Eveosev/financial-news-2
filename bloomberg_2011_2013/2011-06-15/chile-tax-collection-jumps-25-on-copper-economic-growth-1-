Chile , the biggest copper-producing
nation, reported a 25 percent jump in annual  tax revenue  as the
metal’s price climbed and authorities raised royalties on mining
companies including BHP Billiton Ltd. and Xstrata Plc.  The internal revenue service collected $12.9 billion, up 25
percent in real terms from the previous year’s $9.67 billion,
the agency wrote in a statement distributed today. Chile
collected $923 million from a specific tax on private mining
companies compared with $373 million the previous year.  The result is “good news” and reflects economic growth
and changes to the mining royalty system, Finance Minister
Felipe Larrain told reporters in Santiago.  Units of BHP, including the world’s biggest copper mine
Escondida,  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX)  and Antofagasta Plc were among companies to accept the
optional royalty system that the government estimates will
generate an additional $1 billion in two years for earthquake
reconstruction and health and education programs.  South America’s fifth-largest economy expanded 5.2 percent
last year, the fastest pace in five years, and could grow 5.5
percent to 6.5 percent in 2011, according to central bank
forecasts. The price of copper, which accounts for more than
half of Chile’s exports, rose 30 percent last year.  Larrain said that while a fiscal surplus this year is
possible, there are no guarantees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
