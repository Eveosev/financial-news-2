European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said arguments that the ECB is
turning into a bad bank are based on a “flawed” analysis of
the level of risk it has assumed.  “Some commentators have stated that, since the ECB’s
balance sheet is expanding and is allegedly taking on large
risks, the ECB may be turning into a ‘bad bank,’” Bini Smaghi
said in a speech in Amsterdam today. “This argument is based on
a clear misunderstanding of the type of operations conducted by
the Eurosystem and of the risk control measures applied to those
operations.”  The ECB swelled its balance sheet during the financial
crisis by lending banks as much money as they need against
 eligible collateral  and purchasing the assets of distressed
nations.  Germany ’s Spiegel magazine reported on May 23 that the
ECB’s laxness in vetting asset-backed securities submitted as
collateral in peripheral European countries masks risks on its
balance sheet that may amount to as much as several hundred
billion euros.  Bini Smaghi said that the ECB’s risk control measures and
its capital position “should help dispel such
misunderstanding.”  “The data have actually confirmed that the Eurosystem’s
financial results have proved resilient to the global financial
crisis, and its total capital position has even increased,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
