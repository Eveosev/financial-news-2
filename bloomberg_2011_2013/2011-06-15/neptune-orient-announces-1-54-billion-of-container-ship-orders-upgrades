Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest container-shipping line, announced $1.54 billion
in ship orders and upgrades as it adds larger vessels to pare
operating costs on European and trans-Pacific routes.  The company ordered 10 ships, able to carry 14,000
containers each, from Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries Co. and two
with capacities of 9,200 from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co., it said in a statement today. The Singapore-
based shipping line also enlarged 10 ships already on order at
Daewoo to 9,200 boxes from 8,400, it said.  The 22 vessels, due to be delivered in 2013 and 2014, will
replace less fuel-efficient ships and allow unit APL Ltd. to add
capacity as  China  boosts exports of auto parts and furniture to
the U.S. and  Europe . A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S in February ordered
as many as 30 18,000-container vessels, the world’s largest,
from Daewoo as shipping lines work to pare fuel usage following
an 51 percent jump in prices in the past year.  Neptune Orient will use the 14,000-container ships, which
will be its largest, on Asia-Europe routes, it said. The smaller
vessels likely will be deployed on trans-Pacific services, it
said.  The company, which has about 150 vessels, fell 5 percent to
S$1.53 in Singapore trading today, the biggest decline on the
 Straits Times Index. (FSSTI)  It has dropped 30 percent this year, the
worst performance on the benchmark.  The shipping line has signed letters of intent for the
orders, which still are subject to final agreements, it said.  The price of 380 Centistoke Bunker Fuel, used by ships, was
little changed at $668.50 a ton in Singapore trading today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was $441.50 a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
