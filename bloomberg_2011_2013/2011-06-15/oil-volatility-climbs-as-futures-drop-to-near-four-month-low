Oil options volatility increased as
July futures plunged below $95 a barrel for the first time since
February on growing signals that the  U.S. economy  is slowing and
concern that  Europe â€™s debt crisis will deepen.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 32.6 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New
York , up from 29.6 percent yesterday.  Crude for July delivery tumbled $4.56, or 4.6 percent, to
$94.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Feb. 22. It was the biggest one-day drop since
May 11. Prices have climbed 23 percent in the past year.  August futures decreased $4.60, or 4.6 percent, to $95.26 a
barrel.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $95 puts, with 9,245 lots changing hands. They gained 79
cents to 91 cents a barrel. July $90 puts, the next-most active
option, edged up 7 cents to 10 cents a barrel with 3,936 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  July options expire at the close of floor trading tomorrow
on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  July $100 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,881 lots changing hands. They gained 32
cents to 71 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July
$98 puts, dropped $1.21 to 50 cents a barrel on volume of 5,424
lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,027 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 40,760
and December 2011 $150 calls with 38,281.  To contact the reporter on this story:
