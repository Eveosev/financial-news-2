Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in June to terminals near  New Orleans  were unchanged
relative to Chicago futures as exporter demand ebbed.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was steady at 60 cents to 62 cents a bushel above July
futures, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The average
cash price has dropped for four straight sessions after reaching
a record $8.495 a bushel on June 9. The soybean basis was 75
cents to 80 cents a bushel above July futures.  “Exporters and grain elevators are taking a break after
aggressively buying supplies in May,” said Bryce Stremming, a
risk consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington,
 Illinois . “It’s very quiet with most buyers seemingly content
with supplies.”  Corn futures for July delivery fell 29.75 cents, or 3.9
percent, to $7.2575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest decline since May 11. On June 10, the contract reached a
record $7.9975.  Soybean futures for July delivery were unchanged at $13.68
a bushel, after falling for four straight sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
