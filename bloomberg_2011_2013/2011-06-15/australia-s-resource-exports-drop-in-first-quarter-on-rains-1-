Australia ’s energy and mineral
resource export earnings fell 10 percent in the March quarter as
adverse weather including floods affected production and volumes,
according to the nation’s commodity forecaster.  Export earnings were A$40.25 billion ($43.1 billion) in the
three months ended March 31, the  Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences  said in a
report today.  Australia’s mineral and energy commodity export earnings
may rise 16 percent to A$214.6 billion in 2011-2012, buoyed by
higher prices for coal and higher shipments and prices for iron
ore, the agency said March 1.  “Heavy rain and flooding in Queensland and New South  Wales 
affected metallurgical and thermal coal production, while heavy
rain in  Western Australia  resulted in lower  iron ore 
production,” Jammie Penm, the bureau’s chief commodity analyst,
said in an e-mailed statement. The fall in earnings also
reflects lower export volumes for some commodities, he said.  Export earnings declined 29 percent for metallurgical coal,
27 percent for iron and steel and 15 percent for copper,
according to the report. Nickel rose 18 percent and zinc
increased 6 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
