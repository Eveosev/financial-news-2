(Corrects wheat contract in first paragraph of story first
published June 14.)  NYSE Liffe said it expects to
publish reports on speculator trading in the London cocoa, sugar
and coffee markets and feed wheat similar to reports released by
the U.S. in the third quarter.  The bourse started a trial taking information in speculator
trading in February. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission produces weekly reports on speculator and commercial
holdings in commodities including gold, oil and cocoa.  “Internal testing and validation is continuing with the
aim of publishing the new CFTC-style reports sometime during the
third quarter of 2011,” Ian Dudden, Director of Commodity
Derivatives at NYSE Liffe, said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
