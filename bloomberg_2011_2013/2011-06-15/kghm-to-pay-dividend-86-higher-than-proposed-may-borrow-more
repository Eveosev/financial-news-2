KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  shareholders
approved a dividend 86 percent higher than proposed by
management, prompting Chief Executive Officer Herbert Wirth to
say  Poland ’s sole copper producer may need to increase debt.  Shareholders approved a motion by the Polish government,
the controlling shareholder, to pay out 2.98 billion zloty, or
14.9 zloty a share, compared with management’s proposal of 1.6
billion zloty, or 8 zloty a share, voting results at a meeting
in Lubin, southwest Poland, showed today.  KGHM aims to invest 10.9 billion zloty this year, or more
than 30 percent of its 2011-2018 spending plan, Wirth said in
a presentation at the meeting. The company may have to
increase borrowing after paying out the dividend, he told
reporters during a break in the meeting, declining to give
details.  Shares in the company rose 1.4 percent to 189.7 zloty
after declining as much as 0.3 percent before the vote. The
benchmark WIG20 Index slipped 0.3 percent.  KGHM plans to increase production to 700,000 tons a year
from about 500,000 tons at the moment buying deposits outside
Poland, including the Afton-Ajax investment in  Canada ,
forecast to produce 50,000 tons a year.  The company, Poland’s biggest energy consumer, also plans
to increase investment in electricity generation, working with
 Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  on a gas-fired power plant after
buying a 10 percent stake in Poland’s second-largest utility
last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
