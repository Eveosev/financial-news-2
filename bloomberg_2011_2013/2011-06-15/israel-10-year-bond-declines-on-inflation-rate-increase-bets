Israel ’s 10-year government bonds
fell on bets a report today will show inflation accelerated,
raising the likelihood the central bank will boost the pace of
interest rate increases.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 rose one basis point to 5.18 percent at 1:17 p.m. in  Tel
Aviv . The yield gap between inflation-linked bonds due June 2012
and fixed-rate notes of similar maturity has widened 16 basis
points, or 0.16 of a percentage point, to 354.8 since May 16, a
day after a report showed April inflation slowed. That implies
expected inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
payments, of about 3.5 percent.  “Investors are selling fixed-rate  government bonds  ahead
of the report on expectations inflation will accelerate”
raising bets the central bank will lift interest rates sooner
than expected, Jonathan Haddad, an analyst at Meitav Mutual Fund
Management in Tel Aviv, said by telephone. “Yields aren’t
showing a big move today as the market has already been pricing
in an increase in inflation.”  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.2 percent in May from 4
percent in April, according to the median of 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  will release the latest data today at 6:30 p.m.
Israeli consumer prices have surged as the economy recovers from
the global recession faster than most advanced countries. Growth
is expected to accelerate to 5.2 percent this year from 4.7
percent in 2010, the  Bank of Israel  said in a June 1 forecast.  Central bank governor  Stanley Fischer  increased the
interest rate for a fourth time this year at the end of May in a
bid to curb rising prices. Fifteen of 17 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg expect him to leave the benchmark at 3.25 percent this
month, while two predict a quarter percentage point increase.  The shekel fell 0.8 percent to 3.4221 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
