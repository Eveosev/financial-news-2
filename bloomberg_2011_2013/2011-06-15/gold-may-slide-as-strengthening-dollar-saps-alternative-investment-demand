Gold declined in  New York  as a
stronger dollar curbed demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  The dollar gained against six major currencies as European
Union officials failed to agree on a second Greek rescue plan.
Bullion typically moves counter to the greenback.  China 
yesterday ordered lenders to set aside more cash as reserves
after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in almost three
years.  “Precious metals have come under pressure as a result of
the firmer dollar,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said today in a report. Still,
“rising inflation indicators, ongoing debt issues and the
increasing risk of default by  Greece  will likely limit downside
pressure, with investors to view corrections as buying
opportunities.”  Gold for August delivery fell $7.10, or 0.5 percent, to
$1,517.30 an ounce by 7:58 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Immediate-delivery gold was 0.5 percent lower at $1,516.35 in
 London .  Bullion rose to $1,517.75 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,516 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  EU finance ministers yesterday agreed to convene again on
June 19 after they clashed over how to ease Greece’s debt
burden. European Central Bank warnings were backed by  France 
that the move might constitute the region’s first sovereign
default.  Rescue for Greece  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will meet on June 17 in Berlin, with pressure
mounting for the leaders to resolve their differences over a
rescue for Greece, which was downgraded this week to the world’s
lowest credit rating by  Standard & Poor’s .  Gold is up 6.7 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades in
London. Europe’s debt crisis helped bullion futures reach a
record $1,577.40 on May 2. Bullion may extend its rally as
demand surges from emerging markets including China and India,
according to the producer-funded World Gold Council.  “There’s a tidal wave of gold demand coming,” Jason Toussaint, the council’s managing director of U.S. and
investment, said yesterday at the Bloomberg Link Money Managers
Conference in Boston. “A key is the long-term fundamental
change in emerging markets. The biggest markets of growth are
China and India.”  Silver Falls  Silver for July delivery fell 1.1 percent to $35.025 an
ounce in New York. Futures reached a record $50.35 in January
1980. Silver held in exchange-traded products dropped 197.1
metric tons to 13,605.1 tons yesterday, the lowest level since
September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “A 10 percent downside correction now looks more likely
than a 10 percent rebound,”  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst
at UBS AG, said in a report. “While we think another shot at
$50 is very possible later this year, for now the risk-reward
doesn’t seem worth it.”  Palladium for September delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$789.05 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was down 0.2
percent at $1,791 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
