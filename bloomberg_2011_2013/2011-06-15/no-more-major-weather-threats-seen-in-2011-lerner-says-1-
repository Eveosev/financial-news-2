Weather threats to commodity markets
have passed for the rest of 2011 as more neutral conditions are
expected, with the exception of possible extended dryness
affecting grain in the U.S., said Drew Lerner, the president at
World Weather Inc.  “There’s not going to be a weather market internationally
this summer,” Lerner said today at the INTL FCStone Outlook
Conference in  Chicago . “We probably will have still a weather
scare or two in the U.S., but worldwide, the odds of having a
major weather event that’s going to control the markets is a lot
lower.”  In the U.S., the biggest risk for domestic grain prices
might be a drier, warmer Midwest bias in the next few weeks,
Lerner said. Those conditions may curb corn yields and push
prices higher, he said.  La Nina, the cooling of waters in the  Pacific Ocean , has
ended, signaling more neutral and less extreme weather
conditions. There’s “a chance” La Nina might return in October
through December, Lerner said. If this occurs and the pattern
lasts into the middle of 2012, severe weather may occur next
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
