Corn fell, extending a slide to a
four-week low, and soybeans declined on bets that the sluggish
economy will curtail demand for food, animal feed and biofuel.  Industrial production in the U.S. rose less than forecast
in May and confidence among U.S. homebuilders slumped in June to
the lowest in nine months, government and industry reports said
today. Last week, output of ethanol, made mostly from corn, fell
3.8 percent, the biggest drop since mid-April.  “The economic news is showing a slowdown in growth, and
that is reducing investment demand in the grain markets,” said
Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in  Chicago .  Corn futures for December delivery fell 15 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $6.70 a bushel at 11:24 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.6775, the lowest for the
most-active contract since May 12.  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 3 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $13.6075 a bushel, the contract’s fifth straight
decline. The U.S. government said last week that reserve
supplies before the next harvest will rise as export demand
ebbs.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
