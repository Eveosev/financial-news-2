Shinnecock Hills Golf Club  in
Southampton,  New York , will host the 2018  U.S. Open , the U.S.
Golf Association said today.  It will be the fifth U.S. Open to be staged at the private
club, the only venue to hold the championship in three
centuries, and the 19th time the tournament will be played in
the state of New York.  The last time the event was staged at Shinnecock, in 2004,
Retief Goosen outlasted  Phil Mickelson  on a dried-out course
that forced organizers to water greens during competition to
keep conditions playable.  Shinnecock, one of the five founding clubs of the U.S. Golf
Association, also hosted the U.S. Open in 1896, 1986 and 1995.
The 2018 Open is scheduled for June 14-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
