CCP Games said it restored its EVE
online multiplayer game after an attempt to break into its
systems didnâ€™t succeed.  The company disconnected its servers from the Internet for
six hours late yesterday after becoming aware of concerted
attempts to shut down or break into its computers, according to
an e-mailed statement today. No user information or credit card
numbers were taken, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
