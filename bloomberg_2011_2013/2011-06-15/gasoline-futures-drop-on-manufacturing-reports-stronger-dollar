Gasoline sank to a four-week low as
two manufacturing reports indicating the economic recovery has
stalled sent stocks tumbling and as a surging dollar reduced the
investment appeal of commodities.  Prices lost the most in four weeks as U.S. industrial
output rose less than forecast in May and manufacturing in the
 New York  region unexpectedly dropped. The U.S. currency reached
the highest level against the euro this month on concern Greek’s
debt crisis threatens  Europe ’s economic health.  “The market is refocused on the  Greece  debt problem, which
sent the euro tumbling and brought out sellers in the market,
and there’s growing worries about the economic recovery
stalling,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for July delivery declined 14.11 cents, or 4.6
percent, to settle at $2.9235 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.7 percent to
1,265.42, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 1.5
percent to 11,897.27.  “This is just another global stock market meltdown
precipitated by the Greek crisis and, of course, the dollar got
a lot stronger,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York and a trader at the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Dollar Rises  The dollar gained 1.9 percent to $1.4164 against the euro
at 3:18 p.m. in New York, the biggest increase since May 5,
after European officials failed to break a deadlock on creating
a second rescue plan for Greece.  Futures and equities extended losses and the dollar widened
gains after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he will
make changes to his Cabinet tomorrow and will then immediately
seek a vote of confidence in Parliament.  Gasoline was the third-biggest loser today on the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities. The index
retreated 2.3 percent as of 3:30 p.m. in New York as 16 of 19
commodities declined.  “This is all being currency-driven and that is about
concern about the European debt crisis,” said  Tom Knight , vice
president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana, Texas. “As a result, most of the dollar-denominated
markets moved sharply lower.”  Factory Output  Output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1
percent after no change the prior month, figures from the
 Federal Reserve  showed today. Economists projected a 0.2 percent
gain, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index dropped to minus 7.8, the lowest level since November,
from 11.9 in May. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists was 12.  Prices also fell after the U.S. Energy Department reported
at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington  that gasoline supplies rose less
than expected.  Stockpiles of gasoline increased 573,000 barrels to 215.1
million in the week ended June 10, the report showed. The median
forecast of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a
gain of 1.05 million barrels.  “Economic concern is No. 1 and the unsure demand we have
for the rest of the summer as we’re building supplies,” said
 Gordon Elliott , a risk management specialist at INTL FC Stone
LLC in  St. Louis Park , Minnesota.  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline demand jumped 2.3 percent to 9.37 million barrels
a day. The four-week average rose to 9.25 million, 0.5 percent
above a year earlier.  The July gasoline crack spread on Nymex narrowed $1.36 to
$27.98 a barrel.  “The crack spread is down mostly because of the crude
draw,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “If refiners are
using it, there is going to be more domestic gasoline coming
into the market.”  Oil inventories fell 3.41 million barrels to 365.6 million,
more than the 1.8 million-barrel drop projected in the survey.
Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for Nymex
crude futures, fell to the lowest since February.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 0.7 cent to $3.689
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website, the lowest
level since April 4.  Heating oil for July delivery slipped 14.1 cents, or 4.5
percent, to settle at $2.9848 a gallon on the Nymex, the lowest
level since May 26.  Distillate Supplies  Supplies of heating oil and diesel declined 105,000 barrels
to 140.8 million, the report showed. The survey projected an
increase of 1 million barrels. Distillate demand sank 5.2
percent to 3.6 million barrels a day, a 5-month low. Exports
rose 183,000 barrels to 854,000 barrels a day last week,
according to the department.  “There’s a relatively mild draw in diesel inventories and
a big drop in demand, so it’s got to be going outside the
country,” Cohan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
