Asian stocks swung between gains and
losses after a report showed U.S. retail sales were better than
forecast, boosting the outlook for exporters.  QBE Insurance
Group Ltd. (QBE)  slumped after issuing a profit forecast.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 84 percent of
sales outside  Japan , climbed 1.3 percent in  Tokyo , while rival
advanced 1.2 percent. Billabong International Ltd., a surfwear
maker that gets almost half its revenue from the Americas,
gained 1.5 percent in Sydney. QBE Insurance dropped 3.5 percent
after  Australia ’s largest insurer by market value forecast that
its insurance margin in the first half will be lower than last
year.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 132.85 as
of 11:30 a.m. in Tokyo, having swung between gains and losses at
least 15 times. About the same number of stocks rose as fell on
the gauge.  “Investors were pleased to see U.S. retail sales beat
expectations, despite still being negative,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion in global equities
at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “QBE’s profit warning
last night highlights the risks that remain for some companies
ahead of reporting season.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 0.1 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index slipped 0.3 percent, while Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index also declined 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang
Seng Index fell 0.2 percent.  Retail Sales  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.3
percent today. In  New York , the index gained 1.3 percent
yesterday, the most since April 20, after better-than-estimated
data on American retail sales and Chinese industrial production.  The Commerce Department in  Washington  yesterday reported
sales at retailers fell 0.2 percent in May, less than forecast,
indicating American consumers are weathering higher gasoline
costs. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for a drop of 0.5 percent. Another report showed U.S.
wholesale costs rose last month.  Also boosting the global economic recovery,  China  reported
yesterday that its industrial production rose 13.3 percent last
month compared with a 13.1 percent forecast.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  , the world’s biggest carmaker by
revenue, gained 0.3 percent to 3,240 yen in Tokyo. Honda rose
1.3 percent to 2,970 yen. Hino Motors Ltd., a maker of trucks
and buses, gained 4.4 percent to 453 yen after saying it will
post a 12 billion yen ($149 million) net profit this fiscal year,
compared with a loss of 10 billion yen last year. Billabong
advanced 1.5 percent to A$6.24 in Sydney.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 3.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 2.4 percent by the
S&P 500 and a drop of 1.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 13.5 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the
 S&P 500  and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  ‘Unprecedented’ Claims  QBE Insurance dropped 3.5 percent to A$16.68 in Sydney
after the insurer forecast a narrower insurance margin after
“unprecedented” claims from catastrophes. After-tax profit for
the six months ending June 30 will be 50 percent to 60 percent
higher than a year earlier, Sydney-based QBE said in a statement
late yesterday.  “Elevated catastrophe claims mean that QBE’s first half
insurance margin will likely be at its lowest level in seven
years,” said Sydney-based analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc including Richard Coles in a note to investors. “It
would now appear quite a stretch for QBE to achieve the bottom
end of its full-year guidance, despite putting through
substantial price increases in catastrophe affected
portfolios.”  HTC Corp. (2498)  fell 7 percent to NT$1,070 in Taipei trading
after the smartphone maker was cut to “neutral” from
“outperform” at Macquarie Group Ltd., which cited the
prospects of competition for makers of handsets using Google
Inc.’s Android system as low-cost rivals gain market share.  ----With assistance from Norie Kuboyama and Satoshi Kawano in
