Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  offered to step aside to permit the formation of a
unity government, as long as all opposition parties agreed to
cuts required by an international bailout, said a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Papandreouâ€™s bid, coming amid mounting opposition and
defections among allies, countered a demand by the New Democracy
opposition party that he quit and that a cross-party coalition
renegotiate the terms of the rescue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
