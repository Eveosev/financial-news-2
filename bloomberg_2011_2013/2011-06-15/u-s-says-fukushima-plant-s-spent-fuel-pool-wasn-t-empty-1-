A pool with radioactive fuel rods at
 Japan ’s crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant unit 4 probably didn’t
lose all its cooling water early in the crisis, the U.S.  Nuclear
Regulatory Commission  said.  “It’s unlikely that the pool ever went completely dry,”
Bill Borchardt, NRC executive director for operations, said
today at an agency meeting in Rockville,  Maryland . After the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami, NRC officials feared the unit 4
pool was dry and would worsen radiation leaks, Borchardt said.  The disaster knocked out  power lines  and backup generators
at Fukushima, owned by Tokyo Electric Power Co. Without
electricity, cooling systems failed and fuel rods overheated,
causing fires, explosions and radiation leaks in the worst
nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  Conditions at the site “continue to improve,” although
the stricken reactors still aren’t completely under control,
Borchardt said.  “Full stability may be several months away,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
