Jeremy Ratcliffe, the former head of
a charity started by  Nelson Mandela , was acquitted on a charge
of illegally possessing uncut diamonds, the South African Press
Association reported, citing Magistrate Renier Boshoff.  The state prosecutor failed to prove its case against
Ratcliffe, Boshoff said, according to Johannesburg-based SAPA.  Ratcliffe said he received three gems from model  Naomi Campbell  and he kept them because he did not want Campbell to
get into trouble.  Campbell told the war crimes trial of former Liberian
President  Charles Taylor  in  The Hague  in August that she was
given uncut diamonds after a 1997 dinner at Mandela’s home and
that she gave them to Ratcliffe, SAPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
