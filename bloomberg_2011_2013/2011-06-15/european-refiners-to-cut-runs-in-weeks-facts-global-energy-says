European refiners may be forced to
reduce processing rates this summer as rising crude prices erode
profits, according to Singapore-based researcher Facts Global
Energy Inc.  “I think the weaker refiners will need to cut back within
the next few weeks,”  Roy Jordan , a Facts analyst in London,
said by telephone today. “With the  Brent crude  price so strong,
it’s very difficult to make money on gasoline.”  Profits from refining are being eroded by reduced demand in
 Europe  and the U.S., combined with ample fuel supplies, he said.  Northwest European refiners that make high-quality products
such as gasoline lost an average $1.30 a barrel last week, after
breaking even in the previous week, according to Facts.  The motor fuel’s premium to Brent crude fell to a three-
month low yesterday at $4.49 a barrel, according to data from
London-based broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd. Naphtha’s discount
to Brent dropped to $10.62 a barrel yesterday, the lowest since
Jan. 8, 2009, the PVM data showed.  North Sea Brent futures have advanced 25 percent this year.
The July contract was $1.67, down 1.4 percent, at $118.49 a
barrel as of 1:25 p.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
