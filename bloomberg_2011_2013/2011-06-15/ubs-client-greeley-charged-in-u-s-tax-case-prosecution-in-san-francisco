A  UBS AG (UBSN)  client, Robert E. Greeley,
was charged by prosecutors in  California  with filing a false tax
return that failed to disclose two Swiss accounts held in the
name of Cayman Islands entities that he controlled.  Greeley controlled a UBS account named Meyrin Investors
from 2002 through at least 2008 and one named Exchange Preferred
Limited from 2004 through at least 2008, according to a criminal
charge filed yesterday in federal court in  San Francisco .
Greeley was charged with filing a 2008 tax return that didn’t
disclose those accounts or the interest income earned.  Greeley couldn’t immediately be located for comment, and
court records didn’t include the name of his lawyer.  Greeley is one of more than two dozen former UBS clients
accused of tax crimes since 2007. Zurich-based UBS avoided U.S.
prosecution in February 2009 by paying $780 million, turning
over the names of U.S. account holders and saying it helped
Americans hide assets from the  Internal Revenue Service .  The case is U.S. v. Greeley, 11-cr-374, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
