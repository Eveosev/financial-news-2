Nigeria ’s naira appreciated the most
in six weeks against the dollar after central bank data showed
reserves have increased this month.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer jumped 1
percent to 155.20 per dollar in the  interbank market  by 10:29
a.m. in Lagos, the largest intraday advance since May 5.  The West African nation’s gross reserves stood at $34.1
billion as of June 13, a 6.2 percent increase this month,
according to central bank data. Governor Lamido Sanusi has been
defending the naira by using foreign reserves in a bid to curb
inflation. The bank attempts to keep the naira within a 3
percentage-point band above or below 150 per dollar at its
twice-weekly auctions.  “We still believe the naira should be stable on the 150
mark,” Victor Ndukauba, an analyst at Lagos-based Afrinvest
West  Africa  Ltd., said by phone today.  “A lot of the surge in
dollar demand in our view is more artificial than real. We
should find some accretion of reserves.”  Demand for dollars at central bank auctions peaked this
year at $586.4 million on March 28, before dropping to as little
as $277.1 million on April 27, during elections which returned
incumbent President  Goodluck Jonathan  to power. Banks sought to
buy $383.8 million at the last auction on June 13. The central
bank will hold another sale today.  Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics may today release
inflation data for last month. The inflation rate fell to a
revised 11.3 percent in April from 12.8 percent a month earlier.
The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate half a
percentage point to 8 percent on May 24, a third increase this
year, as it tries to stabilize the naira and bring inflation
below 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
