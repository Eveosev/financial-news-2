Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
fourth-biggest U.S. payments network, said its board approved a
stock buyback of as much as $1 billion.  The repurchase expires on June 14, 2013, and buybacks will
be made “from time to time based on market conditions and other
factors,” Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover said today in a
statement.  Discover boosted its dividend in March to 6 cents a share
from 2 cents after posting its highest first-quarter profit ever
as it had fewer charge-offs. The company earlier this year
bought Citigroup Inc.’s Student Loan Corp. and agreed to buy
Tree.com Inc.’s home-lending business to expand beyond its core
credit-card and payment-processing.  “Our intention is to manage our capital to maintain a
strong capital level and return on equity while investing in
growth opportunities and returning excess capital to our
shareholders,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Nelms
said in the statement.  Discover fell 23 cents, or 1 percent, to $22.95 at 4 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 24 percent this year, and rose 65 percent in the last 12
months, compared with 0.6 percent and 13 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
