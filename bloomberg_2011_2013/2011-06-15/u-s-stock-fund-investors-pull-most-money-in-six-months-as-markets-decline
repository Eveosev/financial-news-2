U.S. investors last week pulled the
most money from domestic stock funds in six months after
equities fell on concerns that the economic recovery may be
faltering.  Funds that invest in U.S. stocks lost $5.46 billion in the
week ended June 8, the biggest redemptions since the week ended
Dec. 8, when investors withdrew $7.6 billion, according to the
Washington-based  Investment Company Institute . Funds that invest
in international equities had $291 million in withdrawals last
week, the ICI said today in an e-mail.  U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in more than a
year in May,  consumer spending  rose less than forecast in April
and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent
last month. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has tumbled 7.2
percent from an almost three-year high at the end of April as
investors prepare for the end of the  Federal Reserve ’s $600
billion bond-purchase program known as quantitative easing.  Taxable-bond funds attracted $5.09 billion last week and
municipal-bond funds drew $298 million, the most since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
