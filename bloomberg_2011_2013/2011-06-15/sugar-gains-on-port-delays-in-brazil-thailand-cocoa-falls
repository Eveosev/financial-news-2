Sugar rose for the first day in
three in New York as ships waited to take on cargoes of the
sweetener at ports in  Brazil  and  Thailand , the world’s two
biggest exporters. Cocoa in New York declined.  As many as 68 vessels were lining up at Santos and
Paranagua in Brazil to load about 2.22 million metric tons of
sugar, shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. said
June 9. Port congestion in Thailand is also driving up global
prices.  “Sugar shipments are still slow to emerge from Brazil and
Thailand, and demand from the European Union should remain
high,” said Luis Rangel, vice president of commodity
derivatives at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  Raw sugar for October delivery advanced 0.18 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 25.33 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. by 9:05 a.m.
in  New York . White, or refined, sugar for August delivery
climbed $3.20, or 0.5 percent, to $706.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe in
London.  In Thailand, vessels are waiting to load as much as 7
percent of this year’s supply, according to Piromsak Sasunee,
chief executive officer of Thai Sugar Trading Corp., the largest
shipper. A shortage of barges, a sunken ship blocking the
biggest river and a lack of labor delayed exports, he said.  Sugar output in Brazil’s main producing region rose 6.8
percent in May’s second half as farmers sped up the harvest on
dry weather, industry group Unica said yesterday. Still, dry
weather also impeded further development of the crop due to be
gathered in the next few months and yields will be lower, Unica
said.  Sugar Output  “The annual decline in yields means smaller year-on-year
volume of sugar will be produced, just at a much faster pace,”
Rangel said.  Brazil’s sugar-cane harvest usually runs from April to
December, peaking between July and September. It was delayed
this year because of rains. Unica in March estimated the main
region’s harvest at 568.5 million tons and said May 26 lower
yields might result in a smaller crop than initially forecast.  Cocoa for September delivery fell $4, or 0.1 percent, to
$2,990 a ton in New York. Cocoa for July delivery gained 8
pounds, or 0.4 percent, to 1,857 pounds ($3,016) a ton in
 London .  Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 2.3 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.70 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for
September delivery climbed $61, or 2.6 percent, to $2,452 a ton
in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
