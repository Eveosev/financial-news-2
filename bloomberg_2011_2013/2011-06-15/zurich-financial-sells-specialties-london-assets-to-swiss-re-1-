Zurich Financial Services Group
agreed to transfer the run-off business of its Zurich
Specialties London Ltd. unit to Swiss Reinsurance Co. at book
value as the insurer sells assets to focus on its main markets.  The deal is part of an “announced strategy to divest most
of its non-core businesses to release and redeploy $1.5 billion
of capital,” the Zurich-based company said in a statement on
its website today. The sale will allow “repatriation” of about
$360 million of regulatory capital from the London unit to the
Swiss parent company, it said.  Zurich Financial in February agreed to pay as much as $2.1
billion for 51 percent of Banco Santander SA ’s insurance
business in  Brazil ,  Mexico ,  Chile ,  Argentina  and Uruguay. Since
then, it has sold stakes in CaixaSabadell Vida SA de Seguros y
Reaseguros and New China Life Insurance Co.  The transfer of about $950 million of assets and
liabilities to Swiss Re is pending regulatory approval, Zurich
Financial said today. The Specialties London unit hasn’t
underwritten new insurance policies since 2005, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
