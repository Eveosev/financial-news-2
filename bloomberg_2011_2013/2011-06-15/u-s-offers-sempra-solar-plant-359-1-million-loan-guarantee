Sempra Energy (SRE) ,  California ’s third-
largest utility, received a $359.1 million conditional loan
guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department to build a solar power
plant in  Arizona .  The company’s Sempra Generation unit is developing the 150-
megawatt Mesquite Solar 1 plant in Maricopa County, about 45
miles (72 kilometers) west of Phoenix, the Energy Department
said today in a  statement .  The  Mesquite  project is expected to be complete in 2013 and
will generate enough electricity for 56,000 homes, according to
Sempra’s website. It will sell power to Pacific Gas & Electric
Co., California’s largest utility under a 20-year contract.  Sempra Generation said in February that Mesquite would use
800,000 multicrystalline silicon solar panels from Wuxi, China-
based manufacturer Suntech Power Holdings Co., the world’s
largest solar-panel maker. Mesquite is the first phase of a
planned 700-megawatt development. Sempra, of  San Diego , has not
said how much the project will cost.  The Energy Department has issued loans and guarantees or
offered conditional loan guarantees totaling more than $33
billion to support 33 clean-energy projects. That includes more
than $10 billion in loan guarantees for solar projects,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
