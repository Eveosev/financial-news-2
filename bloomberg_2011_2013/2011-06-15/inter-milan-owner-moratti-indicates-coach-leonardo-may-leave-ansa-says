Inter Milan’s owner Massimo Moratti
indicated the soccer club’s coach Leonardo may be leaving and
the club has contacted  Chile  national team manager Marcelo
Bielsa as a possible replacement, news agency Ansa reported.  Leonardo, a former player and coach at crosstown rival A.C.
Milan, is a coach “with a lot of passion and drive, but it’s
not his ambition for the future,” Moratti was quoted as saying
by the agency at a conference in  Rome . “He should follow his
ambitions and we’ll find a new coach.”  Moratti said “an initial contact” had been made with
Bielsa, a former Argentine national coach who last year led
Chile to its first World Cup qualification since 1998.  Leonardo joined Inter in December after former Liverpool
manager  Rafael Benitez  was fired six months into a two-year
contract. French daily L’Equipe reported today that Leonardo has
been offered the general manager’s job with Paris St. Germain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
