India’s 10-year bonds declined a
third day, pushing their yield to the highest level this month,
on speculation the central bank will increase borrowing costs at
its policy review tomorrow after inflation quickened in May.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will increase the repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent, according to 19 of 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey. One predicts no change. The
central bank has increased rates nine times since March 2010.
The wholesale-price index rose 9.06 percent from a year earlier
after an 8.66 percent jump in April, the commerce ministry said
in a statement yesterday.  “Bonds are reflecting inflation concerns as they continue
to surprise on the upside,” said Gaurav Kapur, senior economist
in Mumbai at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “The RBI may
remain on a preemptive mode.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.40 percent as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That’s the highest since May 31.  A decline in prices of food articles may help to slow
inflation in  India  in the coming months, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
government will watch local and global developments in the
coming months and make “appropriate adjustments” to curb
inflation, Mukherjee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
