Uruguay’s gross domestic product
rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2011 from a year
earlier, the central bank said today on its  website .  GDP climbed 2.3 percent in the January-through-March period
from the fourth quarter of 2010, the bank said.  Last year, the agriculture-based economy grew 8.5 percent,
fueled by growing domestic demand and increased exports.  In March, the central bank raised the overnight lending
rate to 7.5 percent while signaling concern about increasing
inflationary pressures in a context of rapid growth.  Consumer prices rose 8.53 percent in May from a year
earlier, the national statistics institute reported on June 2.  Central bank policy makers will meet on June 23 to discuss
the benchmark rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
