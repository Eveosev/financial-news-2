Sudanese authorities lifted
restrictions on the movement of aid workers in South Darfur
state announced on May 17, the  United Nations-Africa Union
peacekeeping mission  said in an e-mailed statement.  Authorities cited “ongoing military operations and
security threats” when they imposed restrictions on aid workers
and the peacekeepers to within a 15-kilometer (9-mile) radius
around Nyala, the state capital, the mission said today.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing the
government of neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the
deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and
starvation, and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes,
according to UN estimates. The Sudanese government has put the
death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
