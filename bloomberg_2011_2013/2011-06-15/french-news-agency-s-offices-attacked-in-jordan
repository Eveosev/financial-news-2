Club-wielding men broke into the
offices of  Agence France-Presse  in the Jordanian capital Amman
and broke equipment and furniture, the  news agency  said.  The attack came a day after about 300 protesters held a
demonstration outside the AFP offices to denounce a report two
days ago which said that the motorcade of King Abdullah had been
pelted with stones. The report, also carried by the  Associated
Press , was denied by the government.  The assailants escaped before the police arrived, following
a call from a neighbor, said AFP journalist Kamal Taha, an Iraqi
national, who was alone in the office at the time of the attack.
Taha managed to escape unharmed through a back door.  Jordanian opposition groups staged protests this year to
demand more freedoms and democratic changes. The rallies, which
were met by some violence, were inspired by pro-democracy
revolts that ousted the longstanding rulers of Tunisia and Egypt
and spread to other countries in the  Middle East  and North
Africa. The Jordanian monarch responded by changing the
government in February and asking the new Cabinet to bring in
political and economic changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
