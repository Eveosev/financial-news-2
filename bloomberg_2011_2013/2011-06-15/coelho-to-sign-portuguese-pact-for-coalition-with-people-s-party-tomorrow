Pedro Passos Coelho ,  Portugal ’s
incoming Social Democratic prime minister, said his party will
sign an agreement on forming a coalition government tomorrow
with the People’s Party, known as the CDS-PP.  “We have all the conditions to have a majority for
change,” Passos Coelho told reporters in Lisbon today after a
meeting with Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva. “The
country will have a majority for the next four years.”  Cavaco Silva today named Passos Coelho as Portugal’s next
prime minister, according to the presidency website. The
president said on June 6 it would be “convenient” for Passos
Coelho to attend a summit of European Union leaders on June 23.
Passos Coelho’s Social Democrats defeated the Socialist Party of
Prime Minister Jose Socrates in June 5 elections.  Having a majority in parliament will help the new coalition
in implementing an austerity plan that was a condition of a 78
billion-euro ($111 billion) bailout from the EU and the
 International Monetary Fund . With the country’s debt and
borrowing costs surging, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in
April in having to seek a rescue.  Borrowing costs have increased since then. The difference
in yield that investors demand to hold Portugal’s 10-year bonds
instead of German bunds reached a euro-era record of 777 basis
points on June 13 and was at 770 basis points today, up from 511
basis points when Socrates sought the bailout on April 6. The
10-year bond yield was at 12.344 percent today and the five-year
yield rose to 12.364 percent, the highest level since the euro
was adopted in 2000.  Debt Auction  Even so, yields fell today when Portugal auctioned 1
billion euros of six-month and three-month bills. The securities
due in December were issued at an average 4.954 percent, less
than the 5.529 percent at the previous auction on April 20. The
bills due in September were sold at an average 4.863 percent,
compared with 4.967 percent at the previous auction on June 1.  Socrates’ minority government fell in March, leading to the
early elections, after lawmakers rejected his proposed deficit-
cutting plan as he struggled to avoid a bailout.  Coelho’s Social Democrats and the  People’s Party  won a
combined 129 seats in the 230-member parliament in the June 5
vote. The winners of four seats representing Portuguese living
abroad are still to be determined.  Golden Shares  The new government will have to carry out various measures
by the end of July, including the sale of failed lender Banco
Portugues de Negocios SA and the elimination of all “golden
shares” or other special rights held by the state in publicly
traded companies. It will also have to propose a law on reducing
severance payments and present a plan to cut employers’ social
security contributions.  The aid package calls for spending reductions for 2012 and
2013 amounting to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, while
revenue increases will represent 1.4 percent of output. The
government will freeze public-sector workers’ salaries through
2013 and cut pensions of more than 1,500 euros a month, while
 tax deductions  will be limited. Portugal also agreed to phase
out rent control and merge some of its municipalities.  The three-year aid plan set goals for a budget deficit of
5.9 percent of GDP this year, 4.5 percent in 2012 and 3 percent
in 2013. The country had the fourth-biggest gap in the euro
region last year at 9.1 percent of GDP.  Portugal’s public debt swelled to 93 percent of GDP in 2010
from 68 percent in 2007. The European Commission forecasts
Portugal’s debt will increase to 101.7 percent this year and
107.4 percent in 2012. The debt ratio will start declining from
2013, according to outgoing Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos.  Teixeira dos Santos said on May 5 the economy will shrink 2
percent this year, twice as much as he previously forecast, as
further austerity measures are implemented. GDP will also
decline 2 percent in 2012, he said. Portugal’s economic growth
has averaged less than 1 percent a year in the past decade, one
of  Europe ’s weakest rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
