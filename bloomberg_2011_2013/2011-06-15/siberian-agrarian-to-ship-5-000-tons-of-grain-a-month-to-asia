Siberian Agrarian Holding Co. will
ship as much as 5,000 metric tons of grain a month to  Asia  this
year after its first deliveries to the region in 2010 were
halted by a Russian ban on exports of the commodity.  Grain including feed and milling wheat and feed barley will
be shipped from Novosibirsk region in West Siberia to countries
including Thailand and Vietnam during the marketing season that
begins in July, Chairman Pavel Skurikhin told reporters today.  The exports to Asia may be lower should Russian prices
become more commercially attractive, he said in Moscow.  The company is still in talks with investors from  Saudi
Arabia , Jordan and  Iran  on the possible sale of a stake of 25
percent to 49 percent to help pay down debt, Skurikhin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
