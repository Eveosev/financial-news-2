Following is the text of the U.S.
 industrial production  and capacity utilization report for May
released by the Federal Reserve.  Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization  Industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in May, the
second consecutive month with little or no gain.  Revisions to
total industrial production in months before May were small.  In
May, manufacturing production rose 0.4 percent after having
fallen 0.5 percent in April.  The output of motor vehicles and
parts has been held down in the past two months because of
supply chain disruptions following the earthquake in  Japan .
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output
advanced 0.6 percent in May and edged down 0.1 percent in April;
the decrease in April in part reflected production lost because
of tornadoes in the South at the end of the month.  Outside of
manufacturing, the output of mines increased 0.5 percent in May,
while the output of utilities fell 2.8 percent.  At 93.0 percent
of its 2007 average, total industrial production in May was 3.4
percent above its year-earlier level.  Capacity utilization for
total industry was flat at 76.7 percent, a rate 3.7 percentage
points below its average from 1972 to 2010.  Market Groups  The production of  consumer goods  edged down 0.1 percent in
May after having been unchanged in April.  Within consumer goods,
the index for durables rose 0.2 percent, while the index for
nondurables declined 0.2 percent. Among durable goods categories,
the output of automotive products fell 0.5 percent, but the
indexes for its other major components increased:  The output of
home electronics advanced 1.7 percent; the output of appliances,
furniture, and carpeting rose 1.8 percent; and the index for
miscellaneous  consumer durables  increased 0.7 percent.  The
decrease in consumer nondurables reflected a drop in residential
sales by utilities; elsewhere, the output of fuels advanced and
the production of non-energy nondurable goods edged up.  Among
non-energy nondurables, the indexes for clothing, chemical
products, and paper products all increased by about 3/4 percent,
but the index for foods and tobacco decreased nearly 1/2 percent.  The output of business equipment rose 1.2 percent in May
after 2 months of declines; the index has advanced 9.2 percent
over the past 12 months.  Sizable gains were recorded both in
May and over the past year for all of the major components of
business equipment:  transit equipment, information processing
equipment, and industrial and other equipment.  The increase for
industrial and other equipment in May was the first substantial
gain in this index since January.  The production index for defense and space equipment rose
0.9 percent in May after having been unchanged in each of the
previous two months.   This index stands 2.5 percent above its
year-earlier level.  Among nonindustrial supplies, the output of construction
supplies rose 1.4 percent in May.  This index is more than 10
percent above its 2009 trough but remains more than 25 percent
below its pre-recession peak.  The production of business
supplies fell 0.3 percent in May; this index stands only about 3
percent above its 2009 trough and more than 13 percent below its
pre-recession peak.  The output of materials to be processed further in the
industrial sector edged down 0.1 percent for a second
consecutive month in May.  The output of durable materials rose
0.4 percent in May; a decline of 0.4 percent in consumer parts
was more than offset by an increase of 0.7 percent in equipment
parts and a gain of 0.4 percent in other durable materials.  The
output of nondurable materials moved up 0.4 percent after having
fallen 0.9 percent in April.  The increase in nondurable
materials in May was due to a sizable increase for textile
materials and a gain for chemical materials; the output of paper
materials was unchanged in May.  The index for energy materials
declined 0.8 percent, with decreases for both primary energy and
converted fuel.  Industry Groups  In May, manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent after having
fallen 0.5 percent in April.  The index for manufacturing in May
was 3.7 percent above its year-earlier level.  Capacity
utilization for manufacturing moved up 0.3 percentage point to
74.5 percent, a rate more than 10 percentage points above its
trough in June 2009 but still 4.5 percentage points below its
average from 1972 to 2010.  The production index for durable goods moved up 0.6 percent
in May after having fallen 0.8 percent in April. Durable goods
industries with gains in output included nonmetallic mineral
products, fabricated metal products, machinery, computer and
electronic products, aerospace and miscellaneous transportation
equipment, furniture and related products, and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  However, losses in output were recorded for the
following industries:  wood products; primary metals; electrical
equipment, appliances, and components; and motor vehicles and
parts.  The production of nondurables rose 0.3 percent in May after
having declined 0.3 percent in April. In May, decreases for food,
beverage, and tobacco products and for printing and support were
more than offset by gains for all other categories.  Production
in the non-NAICS manufacturing industries (logging and
publishing) rose 0.7 percent after having fallen for five
consecutive months.  In May, mining output rose 0.5 percent.  Gains in oil and
gas extraction, in support activity for mining, in metal ore
mining, and in nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying more
than offset a drop in coal mining.  Capacity utilization for
mining moved up 0.3 percentage point to 88.6 percent, a rate 1.2
percentage points above its average for the period from 1972 to
2010.  The output of utilities fell 2.8 percent, and the
capacity utilization rate for utilities fell 2.4 percentage
points to 79.0 percent, a rate 7.6 percentage points below its
average from 1972 to 2010.  Capacity utilization rates in May for industries grouped by
stage of process were as follows:  At the  crude stage,
utilization was unchanged at 86.8 percent, a rate 0.4 percentage
point above its long-run  (1972-2010) average; at the primary
and semifinished stages, utilization edged down 0.2 percentage
point to  73.8 percent, a rate 7.5 percentage points below its
long-run average; and at the finished stage,  utilization moved
up 0.2 percentage point to 75.9 percent, a rate 1.4 percentage
points below its long-run average.  Notice
Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization  The  Federal Reserve  Board released its annual revision to
the index of industrial production and the related measures of
capacity and utilization on March 25, 2011.  This revision
incorporated detailed data from the 2009 Annual Survey of
Manufactures, which was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.  In
addition, data from selected editions of the Census Bureau’s
2009 Current Industrial Reports and annual data from the  U.S.
Geological Survey  regarding metallic and nonmetallic minerals
(except fuels) for 2009 were incorporated.  Monthly indicators
(either product data or input data) were revised, and the
estimation methods for some series were changed.  The new
monthly production estimates reflected the incorporation of
updated seasonal factors and monthly and quarterly source data
that became available (or were revised) after the closing of the
reporting window.  Data on capacity utilization from the Census
Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity for 2010 were
incorporated in the revision.  Release Schedule  At 9:15 a.m. on  2011: January 14, February 16, March 17, April 15, May 17, June
15, July 15, August 16, September 15, October 17, November 16,
and December 15.
