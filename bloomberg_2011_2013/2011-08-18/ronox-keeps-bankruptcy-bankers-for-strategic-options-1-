Tronox Inc. said it’s working with
the same investment bankers who advised the paint-pigment maker
during its bankruptcy reorganization as the company explores
“strategic options.”  “They are giving us advice on strategic options going
forward,” Chief Executive Officer Dennis L. Wanlass said today
in response to a question on Tronox’s earnings conference call.  Wanlass declined to identify the banks or say whether
they’re helping Oklahoma City-based Tronox assess a possible
sale. Tronox hired Moelis & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
explore mergers and acquisitions and dividend options, Debtwire
reported Aug. 16. Goldman organized a loan for Tronox in October
to help it exit bankruptcy. Investment bank Rothschild Inc.
advised Tronox, according to an Oct. 1 court filing.  Tronox is the world’s fifth-biggest producer of titanium
dioxide, a white pigment that adds opacity to paint. Tronox,
which was spun off from Kerr-McGee Corp., went into Chapter 11
bankruptcy in May 2009 after being saddled with environmental
clean-up costs. It exited bankruptcy in February.  Tronox expects to keep running its plants at full capacity
amid “moderate growth” in demand for the remainder of the
year, Wanlass said.  Second-quarter net income jumped to $66.2 million, or $4.18
a share, from $11.8 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier as
sales gained 42 percent to $428.3 million, the company said
today in a statement.  Tronox is updating its 2008 and 2009 financial statements
in order to file by the end of September for listing its stock
on a major exchange, Wanlass said.  Tronox fell $12.25, or 8.3 percent, to $135.75 at 3:59 p.m.
in over-the-counter trading, valuing the company at $2.04
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
