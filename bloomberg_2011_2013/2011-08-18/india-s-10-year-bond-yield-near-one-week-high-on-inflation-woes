India ’s 10-year bond yield stayed
near a one-week high on speculation persistently high inflation
will deter the central bank from reducing borrowing costs.  Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor K.C. Chakrabarty
said yesterday the bank’s policy stance “stays as of now.” The
wholesale-price index rose 9.22 percent in July from a year
earlier, the eighth month in a row it has exceeded 9 percent,
the commerce ministry said this week. The RBI has increased the
repurchase rate five times this year to 8 percent. The next
policy review is due on Sept. 16.  “Bonds may remain around this level as investors are
adequately aware that inflation may hold around these levels for
at least two more months,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income
trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.30 percent as of
10:01 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 8.32 percent yesterday, the highest
level since Aug. 4.  The  finance ministry  will auction 100 billion rupees ($2.2
billion) of notes due in 2017, 2022 and 2032 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
