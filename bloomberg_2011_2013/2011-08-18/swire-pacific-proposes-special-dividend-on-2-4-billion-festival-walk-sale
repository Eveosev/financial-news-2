Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) , the biggest
commercial landlord in  Hong Kong ’s Island East district, said it
will give a special interim dividend after selling its Festival
Walk mall and office complex.  The company plans to pay HK$3 per ‘A’ share and 60 Hong
Kong cents per ‘B’ share for the dividend, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Swire, which owns 17.8 million square feet of investment
properties in Hong Kong, said last month it has agreed to sell
the Festival Walk complex in Hong Kong’s Kowloon Tong area for
HK$18.8 billion ($2.4 billion) to a unit of  Singapore ’s Temasek
Holdings Pte in the company’s biggest property transactions.  The shares rose as much as 1.6 percent in Hong Kong today
and were trading 1.3 percent up at HK$99.75 as of 2:01 p.m.
local time. The stock has declined 22 percent this year,
compared with the 12 percent drop in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index. (HSI)   Swire built and operates complexes such as Tai Koo Shing
residential district and the Pacific Place commercial complexes
in the Admiralty district.  First-half underlying profit fell 48 percent to HK$4.6
billion after several one-time gains the previous year weren’t
repeated, the company said Aug. 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
