Malaysia’s ringgit fell, retreating
from a two-week high, after slowdowns in economic growth and
inflation reduced the likelihood of more interest-rate increases.  Swap traders pared bets this month for higher borrowing
costs and HSBC Holdings Plc said its forecast for the central
bank to raise the overnight policy rate next month is
“increasingly at risk.” Reports yesterday showed gross
domestic product grew the least since 2009 in the second quarter
and inflation cooled from a two-year high in July.  “With slower GDP and inflation, the chances of rate
increases have diminished,” said Nik M. Khairul, a treasury
dealer at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The ringgit
cannot be expected to appreciate very fast now.”  The ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to 2.9775 per dollar as of
10:02 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has risen 2.9 percent this year and
reached 2.9335 on July 27, the strongest level since 1997.  Malaysia’s economic growth slowed to 4 percent in the
second quarter from 4.9 percent in the previous three months,
 Bank Negara Malaysia  said yesterday after the close of trading
in local financial markets. Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent
from a year earlier in July after climbing 3.5 percent in June.  “With the peak in inflation behind, we reiterate our
forecast of BNM remaining on hold in the rest of the year,”
Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING Groep NV in  Singapore , wrote
in a research note today. The central bank may choose to leave
rates unchanged on Sept. 8 following the July inflation figures,
HSBC said in a report late yesterday.  The central bank last raised its overnight rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 3 percent in May, after lifting
it three times in 2010. The one-year interest-rate swap fell 27
basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, this month to 3.195
percent.  The yield on the 4.16 percent government bonds due July
2021 was steady at 3.66 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.
That’s the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note since
October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
