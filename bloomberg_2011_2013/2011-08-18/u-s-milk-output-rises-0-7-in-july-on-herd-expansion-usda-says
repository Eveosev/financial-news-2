U.S. milk production climbed 0.7
percent in July, the Department of Agriculture said, as rising
prices spurred dairy farmers to increase cow herds.  Production climbed to 16.553 billion pounds (7.508 billion
kilograms) last month from 16.436 billion in July 2010, the USDA
said today in a  report . The dairy herd rose 0.9 percent to 9.215
million cows, while the average cow produced 1,796 pounds of
milk, down from 1,799 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
