U.S. investors who sold equities in
their retirement accounts during market volatility in 2008 and
2009 did worse than those who stayed in stocks,  Fidelity
Investments  said.  Participants in 401(k) savings plans who dumped stocks from
Oct. 1, 2008, to March 31, 2009, when the  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index fell 31 percent, and hadn’t returned to equities as of
June 30, 2011, had an average account balance increase of 2
percent, according to the study released today. Those who
maintained some equity allocation during that period saw their
balances rise 50 percent on average.  “Staying the course does prove to be an effective strategy
in the long term,” said  Beth McHugh , vice president of market
insights for the Boston-based mutual-fund company. “Any move
can have a dramatic long-term effect.”  Fidelity, the largest provider of employer-sponsored 401(k)
plans, based its data on 7.1 million worker accounts. About
117,000 participants sold all their equities between October
2008 and March 2009, McHugh said. About half of them hadn’t
reinvested in stocks as of the end of the second quarter this
year, she said. From March 31, 2009, through June 30, the  S&P 500 
gained about 66 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  The average balance of Fidelity’s 401(k) plans was $75,200
as of June 30, compared with $74,900 at the end of the first
quarter, the company said.  Money Transfers  The study may hold lessons for savers during the current
market turmoil. Participants in 401(k)s transferred almost 1
percent of assets this month, or about $1.2 billion, mainly from
equities to fixed income, according to an index that tracks
daily transfers in some 401(k) plans administered by Aon Hewitt.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 6 percent from Aug. 1
through Aug. 17. Stocks declined in response to Standard &
Poor’s downgrade of the nation’s credit rating and concern that
the  U.S. economy  may lapse into another recession.  Aon Hewitt’s index, which represents 1.5 million workers
and $123 billion in assets, reported its fifth-highest trading
volume on Aug. 8. That day the S&P 500 plunged 6.7 percent, its
biggest slump since December 2008.  The amount of funds transferred is “significant” given
that it was only a two-week time period, said Pamela Hess,
director of retirement research for Aon Hewitt, a unit of
Chicago-based  Aon Corp. (AON)  During the financial crisis in 2008
through the first quarter of 2009, about 6 percent of 401(k)
assets moved out of stocks, Hess said.  No Rush  Participants had an average of 67 percent in equities
before the market decline in 2008, said Hess. This month the
average equity allocation is 58 percent, she said.  “Plan participants aren’t rushing to jump out of, or into,
the stock market,” Steve Utkus, director of Vanguard Group
Inc.’s Center for Retirement Research, said in an Aug. 12
 report . “The percentage of participants actually moving money
remains small.”  Two percent of Vanguard 401(k) participants executed a
trade in the first eight trading days of August, the report
said. Vanguard has more than 3 million participants in more than
2,000 plans, according to the  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based
mutual-fund company.  Investors should be aware that they’ll get end-of-day
pricing when moving money in their 401(k)s while the market is
open, Hess said. People often sell at the bottom and if they buy
back stocks at all it’s after the market rallies, she said.  “Timing the market doesn’t work,” Hess said. “If it did
people would be on the beach somewhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
