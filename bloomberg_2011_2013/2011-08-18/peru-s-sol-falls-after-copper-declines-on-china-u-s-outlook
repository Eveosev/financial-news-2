Peru ’s sol fell from a three-week
high after copper, the country’s top export, declined on concern
slower economic growth will cut demand in the U.S. and  China .  The sol weakened 0.2 percent to 2.7414 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.7370 yesterday.  Deutsche Bank reduced its 2011 growth outlook for China,
the world’s biggest copper consumer, and Morgan Stanley said the
global economy will expand more slowly than expected this year.
More Americans than forecast filed applications for  unemployment
benefits  last week, a government report showed today. The U.S.
is the second-largest copper user.  “The U.S. is most likely going into recession,” said Dirk Willer, head of Latin American local markets strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in  New York . “The S&P is pricing that, the whole
world should be pricing that, and most things do price that.”  Copper futures for December delivery dropped 2.7 percent on
the Comex in New York.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.94 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries declined four basis points to
204, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Peru’s central bank didn’t buy dollars in the spot currency
market today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
