The  U.S. Treasury  has received an
additional $2.15 billion in repayment from  American
International Group Inc. (AIG) , the department announced today.  The repayment is from proceeds of the company’s sale of its
Nan Shan life insurance subsidy. The action leaves AIG with $51
billion in outstanding government capital. The Federal Reserve
Bank of New York also has loans to Maiden Lane II and Maiden
Lane III worth $18.8 billion, including principal and interest.  “This is another important milestone in AIG’s remarkable
turnaround,” Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial
Stability Tim Massad said in a release. “We continue to make
progress in recovering the taxpayers’ investments in AIG.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
