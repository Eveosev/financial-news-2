Support for  Norway ’s ruling Labor
Party surged to its highest level in more than 12 years after
last month’s attacks on government offices in Oslo and a Labor
Party youth camp, which killed 77 people, a  Sentio poll  for
Dagens Naeringsliv showed.  According to the survey, 39.1 percent of those questioned
said they would vote for the party led by Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, an increase of 10.8 percentage points from a poll
in July, the Oslo-based newspaper said today.  Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted to carrying out
both attacks, began eight weeks of pre-trial detention on July
26 after telling a court hearing that he wanted to inflict the
“greatest possible loss” on the  Labor Party  and halt what he
saw as an “Islamization” of Norway and  Europe .  The poll, based on 1,000 telephone interviews on Aug. 9 to
Aug. 15, also showed that support for the opposition
Conservatives slipped 5.7 percentage points to 22.2 percent and
backing for the Progress Party fell 5.1 percentage points to
17.5 percent.  The survey had a margin of error of between 0.7 and 3.6
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
