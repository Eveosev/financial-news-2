Russian natural-gas supplies to
 South Korea , which imports almost all its energy needs, could
compete with the Asian country’s liquefied natural gas
purchases, according to Russian Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko.  Russia , which already sends LNG to Korea via tanker, is
“interested in long-term deliveries to the promising growing
Korean market” and is studying building a pipeline via North
Korea, Shmatko told reporters in Moscow today. The cost of such
a project hasn’t been calculated, he said.  South Korea gave approval to  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  this month to
import LNG from Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA. The expected
shipments are valued at 90 trillion won ($84 billion) and are
equivalent to 17 percent of Korea’s gas consumption last year,
the government said in a statement yesterday.  “Russian pipeline gas could offer competition” to Korea’s
LNG deal, Shmatko said. Russia is talking to North Korea and
South Korea on arranging supplies, while state gas exporter OAO
Gazprom is negotiating a contract with Korea Gas, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
