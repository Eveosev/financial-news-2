Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL)  has
delayed development of the Rowghat iron-ore mine in the central
state of Chhattisgarh that is meant to supply its biggest mill
due to “security reasons,” the government said.  Current iron-ore reserves for the plant at Bhilai, which
has an annual capacity of 5.8 million metric tons, will last
five to six years, Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma said in
reply to a question in parliament in New Delhi today. He didn’t
elaborate on the security problem.  Mineral-rich Chhattisgarh is one of a dozen of  India ’s 28
states where Maoist rebels are active. Steel Authority, India’s
second-biggest producer of the alloy, plans to increase its
annual capacity by 55 percent to 21.4 million tons by next year.  “Development of Rowghat mine is facing problems because of
a delay in clearing the forest by state government agencies due
to security reasons,” Steel Authority Chairman C.S. Verma said
in an e-mailed comment today. “Steel Authority is carrying out
other mine-development activities, such as obtaining clearances
for establishing water and power facilities,” without delay.  Steel Authority declined 2 percent to 104.40 rupees. The
stock has declined 43 percent this year, compared with a 20
percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  Armed Maoists are waging an anti-state battle in states
including Chhattisgarh, claiming to defend the rights of the
poor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
