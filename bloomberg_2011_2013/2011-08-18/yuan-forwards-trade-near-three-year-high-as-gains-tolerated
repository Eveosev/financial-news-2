China ’s yuan traded near a 17-year
high after policy makers fixed the currency’s reference rate
higher, signaling it may tolerate gains.  The People’s Bank of China set the rate 0.08 percent
stronger at 6.3942 per dollar. The yuan rose beyond 6.4 for the
first time in 17 years last week after the nation’s trade
surplus for July swelled to the largest since 2009. Conditions
are ripe for the yuan’s trading band to be widened, the China
Securities Journal wrote in a front-page editorial on Aug. 16.  “The belief in the market is that since the move below
6.40, the Chinese authorities are perhaps looking at more
flexibility for the renminbi,” said Emmanuel Ng, a currency
strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore .
“We’re still overweight on the yuan versus the dollar.”  The yuan traded at 6.3877 as of 5:03 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
compared with 6.3871 yesterday, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency reached 6.3820 on Aug. 16,
the highest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore
market, the yuan slipped 0.09 percent to 6.3750.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.12 percent
to 6.2873 in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contracts reached 6.2585 on Aug. 16, the strongest level
since March 2008. The premium to the onshore spot rate was 1.6
percent, up from a two-year low of 0.4 percent on Aug. 9.  The People’s Bank of China allows the yuan to fluctuate as
much as 0.5 percent on either side of its daily  reference rate 
versus the dollar, a trading range that was boosted from 0.3
percent in May 2007 as part of currency-market reforms.  China had a trade surplus of $31.5 billion last month, the
most since January 2009, the government said on Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
