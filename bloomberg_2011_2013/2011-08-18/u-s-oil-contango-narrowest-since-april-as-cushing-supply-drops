The premium traders pay for later
deliveries of U.S. crude compared with immediate supplies, or
contango, shrank to its narrowest since April as inventories
declined at the country’s storage center in Cushing,  Oklahoma .  October contracts of West Texas Intermediate oil on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , trading at about $86.22, were 17 cents
above September futures as of 11:01 a.m. London time. They were
15 cents higher when the two contracts settled yesterday, the
smallest gap since April 19. A market in which later contracts
are more expensive than earlier ones is described as being in
contango, and often signals an excess of immediately-available
supplies or declining demand.  The contango in U.S. futures is typically driven by
inventory levels at the Cushing storage hub, where the WTI
contract is delivered. Stockpiles at that location dropped 9
percent in the past three weeks, to 33.7 million barrels in the
week to Aug. 12, according to data published yesterday by the
U.S. Energy Department.  “There are some empty tanks in Cushing and the WTI
contango is rightfully narrowing,” said  Olivier Jakob , managing
director consultants Petromatrix GmbH in Zug,  Switzerland .  --Raj Rajendran, Alessandro Vitelli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
