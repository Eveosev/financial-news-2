China Minmetals  Corp., China’s
biggest state-owned metals trader, and Sinosteel Corp. must face
claims they conspired to fix the price of magnesite sold in the
U.S., a federal appeals court ruled.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia yesterday
reversed a lower-court decision dismissing the lawsuit. The
lower court erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to
decide the dispute based on a federal statute, the appeals panel
said, remanding the case for further proceedings.  Animal Science Products Inc. and Resco Products Inc., U.S.
buyers of magnesite, sued 17 Chinese companies in 2005 claiming
they conspired since at least April 2000 to fix the price of the
metal exported and sold in the U.S. Magnesite is mined from
magnesium deposits and used to melt steel, clean wastewater and
make cement, the appeals court said.  The appeals case involves only the  China  Minmetals and
Sinosteel defendants, who had argued that the dispute should be
arbitrated in China, according to court papers. Sinosteel is
China’s biggest iron-ore trader.  Jonathan S. Caplan, an attorney for Sinosteel, didn’t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on
the appeals court ruling. Shepard Goldfein, an attorney for
China Minmetals, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  The case is Animal Science Products Inc. v. China Minmetals
Corp., 10-2288, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
