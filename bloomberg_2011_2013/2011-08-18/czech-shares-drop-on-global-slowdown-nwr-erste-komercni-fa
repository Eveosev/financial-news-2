Czech shares dropped the most in a
week, led by  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and mining
company New World Resources Plc as concern deepened the global
recovery is faltering.  The PX equity gauge slid 1.6 percent to 1,005.8 at its 4:28
p.m. close in  Prague , its biggest one-day drop since Aug. 10.
Erste, Komercni and NWR, which account for a combined 44 percent
weighting in the index, fell more than 2.5 percent.  Financial shares led losses in  Europe  after Lars Frisell,
chief economist at  Sweden ’s financial regulator, said yesterday
in an interview that “it won’t take much” for interbank
lending to freeze. Stocks extended losses after a U.S. report
showed manufacturing in the Philadelphia region unexpectedly
contracted in August by the most in more than two years.  “Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on
financial markets,” RBC Capital Markets analysts led by  Nick Chamie  in Toronto said in an e-mailed report to clients today.  Austria’s Erste slid 7.4 percent to 604 koruna, its biggest
one-day drop in more than 14 months. Komercni, the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, slumped 2.8 percent to 3,130 koruna. NWR,
the largest Czech producer of coking coal, dropped 5.9 percent
to 161 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
