German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  ruled out an expansion of the euro’s bailout fund in
the “near term,” according to a letter sent to coalition
leaders in Berlin.  Euro-region leaders on  March 11  agreed to expand the
effective lending power of the European Financial Stability
Facility to 440 billion euros ($630.8 billion) and agreed last
month to add new instruments to the fund’s tool box. “What’s
clear” is that the leaders don’t foresee adding more lending
power, Schaeuble wrote the letter that was dated Aug. 12.  The changes to the fund include pushing up  Germany ’s share
of EFSF loan guarantees to 211 billion euros from 123 billion
euros, said Schaeuble. “I don’t see any need for any further
near-term legal initiatives,” he stated in the letter, a copy
of which was obtained by Bloomberg News.  Schaeuble’s letter fulfills pledges to improve
communication to lawmakers in the debt crisis. Schaeuble still
needs the lower chamber’s support for the euro-region leaders’
proposals.  Schaueble’s two-page letter came before Aug. 16 talks in
Paris between  Chancellor Angela Merkel  and President  Nicolas Sarkozy , both of whom ruled out expanding the EFSF beyond 440
billion euros.  The  Christian Democrat  urged lawmakers, who don’t return
from summer recess before Sept. 5, to push the proposals through
the chamber by Sept. 23. A vote in the upper house, where Merkel
lacks a majority, is not needed  “from the current vantage
point,” Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
