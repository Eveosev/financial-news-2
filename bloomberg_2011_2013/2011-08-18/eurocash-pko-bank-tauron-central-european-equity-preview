The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in central European
markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names.
Share prices are from the last close.  Poland ’s WIG20 Index was little changed, the Czech PX Index
jumped 1.7 percent, as did  Hungary ’s BUX Index.  Eurocash SA (EUR)  : Poland’s largest distributor of non-
durable  consumer goods  was rated “reduce” in new coverage at
Raiffeisen Centrobank AG. Its stock was unchanged at 23.8 zloty.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW): The Polish government may sell
fewer shares of its largest bank than earlier planned,  Gazeta
Wyborcza  reported, without saying where it got the information.
The decision whether to reduce the September offering of 15
percent will be made next week, the newspaper said. PKO shares
declined 0.5 percent to 37.39 zloty.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  : Poland’s second-largest
power utility said first-half net income rose to 704 million
zloty ($245 million) from 481.8 million zloty a year earlier.
That compares with the 680 million-zloty mean estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company’s shares lost 1.1
percent to 5.4 zloty.  To contact the reporters on this story:
