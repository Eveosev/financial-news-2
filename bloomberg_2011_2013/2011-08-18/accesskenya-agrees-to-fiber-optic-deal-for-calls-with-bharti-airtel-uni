AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, will
provide Airtel Kenya, the local unit of Delhi-based  Bharti
Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , with a fiber-optic connection for fixed-line calls,
AccessKenya said.  “This deal marks our first wholesale contract with a
mobile operator and that further enhances our services and
leverages our investment in infrastructure,” the Nairobi-based
company’s managing director, Jonathan Somen, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Airtel Kenya will buy fixed-line voice circuits from
AccesKenya’s fiber optic network in more than 300 buildings in
the capital, Nairobi and Mombasa, the second biggest city.
AccessKenya is linking an average of 10 buildings a month to its
fiber optic network, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
