The market for tankers that haul
liquefied natural gas will remain “structurally tight for the
foreseeable future,” according to  Golar LNG Ltd. (GOL) , an operator
of the carriers.  The shutdown of Japanese nuclear-power stations bolstered
demand from the world’s biggest importer of the fuel, Hamilton,
Bermuda-based Golar said in an e-mailed report today. Charter
rates for the vessels “remained strong” in the second quarter,
exceeding $90,000 a day for modern ships, it said.  Golar LNG said it is seeking to secure charters of longer
lengths for its tankers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
