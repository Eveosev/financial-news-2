Chelsea goalkeeper  Petr Cech 
has been ruled out for three to four weeks after picking up a 
medial ligament injury in training, the Premier League club said
on its website.  John Obi Mikel will be available to play against West Brom
at the weekend, the club added. The player’s representatives
today said a “sizeable” ranson demand had been received for
Mikel’s father, who was abducted in  Nigeria  last week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
