European  stock futures  fell,
indicating the Stoxx Europe 600 Index may decline from a two-
week high, as two Federal Reserve officials said the central
bank shouldn’t act to protect equity investors. U.S. futures and
Asian shares retreated.  Banks may be active after the Swedish financial regulator
said the nation’s lenders must prepare for a deterioration in
the debt crisis that could freeze interbank markets and cut off
funding. SABMiller Plc may move as Foster’s Group Ltd. rejected
its A$9.5 billion ($10.1 billion) takeover bid as too low.
Holcim Ltd. might retreat as the world’s second-biggest cement
maker reported profit and sales that missed estimates.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in September
dropped 1.7 percent to 2,290 at 7:02 a.m. in  London , while FTSE
100 Index futures sank 1.3 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
fell 1.4 percent and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
declined 0.9 percent after the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities
increased 0.1 percent yesterday.  The Stoxx 600 has climbed 6.5 percent from this year’s low
on Aug. 10, reducing the decline from this year’s peak on Feb.
