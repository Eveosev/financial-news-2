     Aug. 18 (Bloomberg) --The U.S. will contribute as much as
$900,000 in emergency assistance to  North Korea  to help cope
with recent flooding, the State Department announced.  The U.S. Agency for International Development will provide
the aid to North Korea’s Kangwon, North Hwanghae and South
Hwanghae provinces through non-governmental organizations, the
department said today in a written statement.  The pledge of support follows a $600,000 contribution made
in September 2010 in response to severe flooding, the department
said.  “This emergency relief demonstrates our continuing concern
for the well-being of the North Korean people,” the statement
said.  The new aid will provide plastic sheeting, tents and other
housing needs, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, at a press briefing today. It will not include any food,
she said.  A separate evaluation of North Korea’s food shortages is
still being reviewed, she said. The U.S. has been studying North
Korea’s food needs for weeks in response to reports of famine.  Nuland said on Aug. 15 the U.S. must determine the extent
of the need for food and how to monitor any food distribution
before such aid would be provided.  “It has been the  United States ’ longstanding position that
the provision of humanitarian assistance is separate from
political and security concerns,” the State Department
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
