Vietnam ’s commercial lending rates
will likely decline next month as liquidity at banks has
improved and the rate of inflation has slowed, said Le Xuan Nghia, vice-chairman of the National Financial Supervisory
Commission.  Interbank lending rates have also been stable and at low
levels, Nghia, who advises the prime minister on economic
matters in his role on the commission, said in an interview in
Hanoi today.  “The chance for  interest rates  to come down a bit next
month is real,” Nghia said. “If we don’t bring down borrowing
costs to help companies to do their business, this can result in
an economy of both inflation and stagnation, which is very
dangerous.”  The country’s central bank raised interest rates every
month this year through May to tame accelerating inflation
stoked by surging energy and food costs and a weaker currency.
Companies in Vietnam have found it “difficult” to pursue
projects when the cost of capital was as high as 30 percent,
Nghia wrote in a statement released at a conference in Hanoi
today.  Nguyen Van Binh, who became governor of the  State Bank  of
Vietnam this month, said earlier that the central bank aimed to
lower dong lending rates to a range of 17 percent to 19 percent
starting from mid-September through to the end of 2011.  Consumer prices in Vietnam increased 22.16 percent in July
from a year earlier, the fastest rate among 17 Asian economies
tracked by Bloomberg.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. Editors: Alan Soughley, Tony Jordan  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
