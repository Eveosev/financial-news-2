Australia ’s dollar advanced for the
first week this month against its U.S. counterpart, after
touching the lowest level last week since March, as commodities
prices increased.  “It’s risk on, risk off, really -- simple as that,” said
 James Shugg , a senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp. in
 London . “It’s just been ebbing and flowing on the back of risk
appetite.”  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell for a third
straight week, dropping against all of its 16 most-traded peers.
It was the longest losing streak since May 2010. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials gained 1.2 percent
in its first weekly increase in a month, while the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of stocks fell 2 percent.  Australia’s dollar appreciated 0.8 percent for the week to
$1.0438 and was up 0.5 percent today at 1:20 p.m. in  New York .
The Aussie advanced 0.4 percent this week and rose 0.2 percent
today to 79.74 yen.  New Zealand’s currency depreciated 1.2 percent to 82.19
U.S. cents, from 83.22 cents on Aug. 12. It was little changed
today. The kiwi lost 0.6 percent against the greenback this
week. It dropped 1.7 percent this week and fell 0.2 percent
today to 62.79 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
