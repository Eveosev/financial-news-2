Cree Inc. (CREE) , a maker of energy-
efficient lighting, sank after saying its purchase of Ruud
Lighting Inc. will reduce profit margins in the current quarter.  Cree fell $3.40, or 9.8 percent, to $31.34 at 9:31 a.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. At the close of regular trading
yesterday, Durham, North Carolina-based Cree had dropped 55
percent this year.  Cree bought Ruud for about $525 million in cash and stock
and expects Ruud’s results to “slightly” dilute its fiscal
2012 net income, the company said yesterday in a statement.  The combination will give Cree access to a larger market
for light-emitting diodes, which many municipalities are
adopting for streetlights to reduce power consumption in the
$17.3 billion U.S. lighting industry.  Ruud, a customer of Cree’s LED components, will help its
new owner expand sales of both lighting products and the parts
that go into them, Cree’s Chief Executive Officer Chuck Swoboda
said today on a conference call.  “If we drive adoption faster, it will help increase demand
for both our lighting products and our components,” Swoboda
said. “By changing the lighting industry to LED, we become the
market leader.”  Gross margin for the combined company will be 37 percent to
38 percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter ending in
September, compared with prior guidance of 38 percent to 39
percent.  Closely held Ruud’s results will be combined with Cree’s
and revenue for the first quarter will be in the range of $265
million to $275 million, up from the company’s Aug. 9 guidance
of $245 million to $255 million. Ruud will continue to be based
in Racine,  Wisconsin , and operate as a subsidiary of Cree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
