The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
declined 889.86, or 3 percent, to 29,288.86 by the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg, its biggest drop since Aug. 8.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.        Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , slumped to its
lowest in more than a week, falling 11.38 rand, or 4 percent, to
276.98 rand. Copper led a decline on commodity markets on
concern that slower economic growth will weaken demand for raw
materials.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, dropped 11.51 rand, or 4.9 percent, to 225 rand.  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)  , a South African company with
interests from catering to cosmetics, fell the most in 2 1/2
years, slumping 8 rand, or 5.2 percent, to 147 rand. The group
said it won’t sell its Foodservice unit and will make
acquisitions to bolster the division, its largest.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
gold producer, added 55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 91.65 rand.
Gold surged to records in  New York  and  London  as mounting
concern about debt crises and slower economic growth spurred
investors to sell equities and seek the perceived safety of
bullion and Treasuries.  DRDGold Ltd. (DRD)  ,  South Africa ’s fourth-largest
producer of the metal, rose for a third day, adding 8 cents, or
2.40 rand, to 3.42 rand.  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  , the operator of the world’s
deepest platinum mine, declined for the first day in six,
falling 80 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 34 rand. Net income for the
12 months to June 30 dropped to 349.2 million rand ($49 million)
from 641 million rand a year earlier.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, fell the most in 15 months, retreating 13.24 rand, or
5.3 percent, to 238.66 rand. Foster’s Group Ltd. rejected a
hostile A$9.5 billion ($10 billion) takeover bid by SABMiller as
too low, adding pressure on the brewer to raise its offer.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, closed at its lowest in a week, falling 12.30
rand, or 3.8 percent, to 310.20 rand. Oil dropped in New York on
signs that faltering economic growth in the U.S., the world’s
largest consumer of crude, is causing supplies to accumulate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
