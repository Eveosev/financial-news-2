The Czech Republic’s PX stock index
declined the most in a week, retreating 1.6 percent to 1,005.8
at its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  retreated 7.4
percent to 604 koruna, its biggest one-day drop in more than 14
months.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , the Czech unit of Societe
Generale SA, declined 2.8 percent to 3,130 koruna.  Banks led European shares lower as two Federal Reserve
officials said the U.S. central bank shouldn’t act to protect
stock investors and Swedish regulators said lenders are
unprepared for a freeze in money markets.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the largest Czech coking-
coal producer, slumped 5.8 percent to 161 koruna. Oil slid and
 Europe ’s benchmark coal futures contracts slid to the lowest in
a week in Amsterdam on concern the global economy will slow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
