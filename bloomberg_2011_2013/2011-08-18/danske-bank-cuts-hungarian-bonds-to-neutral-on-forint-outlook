Hungarian government bonds were cut
to “neutral” from “overweight” at Danske Bank A/S, which
cited a “less bullish view” on the forint because of “less
bright” growth expectations in the country.  “We see a risk of some forint weakness on a three to six
month basis,” Copenhagen-based analysts Lars Christensen and
Antero Atilla wrote in a research report today, explaining the
changed view on their “old favourite.”  “We have reduced our underweights on both Poland and
 Turkey , primarily because both the zloty and the lira have been
under significant depreciation pressure recently,” the Danske
analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
