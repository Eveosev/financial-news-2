Connecticut ’s state-worker unions,
after rejecting Governor Dannel Malloy’s demand for $1.6 billion
of concessions in June, have relented to stop thousands of job
cuts.  A collection of 15 unions today authorized the approval of
Malloy’s deal including a two-year wage freeze and changes to
pension and health-care benefits projected to yield $1.6 billion
of savings over two years. In return, workers will get a
guarantee of four years of  job security , according to Larry
Dorman, a spokesman for the group.  “We have achieved something the skeptics said was
unachievable: we’ve made the relationship between the state and
its workforce sustainable,” Malloy said today in a statement.
“Unlike in most other states, we did it without going to war
with public employees.”  Malloy, a Democrat, had notified about 3,000 workers of
impending job losses, out of 6,000 cuts he threatened to make,
after the unions in June rejected proposed concessions. The
governor kept negotiating with labor leaders, while they changed
their  rules  to make approving a deal easier.  The Democratic-controlled Legislature in May passed a two-
year, $40.1 billion budget that included a record $2.6 billion
in higher income and sales taxes, as well as the proposed worker
concessions that were then projected to save $2 billion.  “The real value of this agreement lies in the $21.5
billion it will save taxpayers over the next 20 years in the
form of lower health-care and retirement costs for state
employees,” Malloy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
