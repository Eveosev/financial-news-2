Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-owned oil producer, plans to declare its Carioca field
commercial by the end of this year as the company accelerates
development of deepwater discoveries.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
has had 100 percent exploration success in the so-called pre-
salt area of the  Santos Basin , Production Coordinator Eduardo Molinari told reporters today in Rio. Carioca is in the same
area as Lula and Libra, Brazil’s two largest oil deposits.  Petrobras is adding equipment to Santos, a key part of the
company’s plan to more than double oil and natural-gas
production to 6.4 million barrels a day in 2020. The company’s
most-productive oil well is in the basin, where deposits sit
miles beneath the ocean floor under a thick layer of salt.  BG Group Plc and  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  are minority partners at
Carioca, located at the BM-S-9 concession where another field,
Guara, has as many as 2 billion barrels of oil. Exploration
success in the so-called Santos Cluster, a 250 square-kilometer
(97 miles) area about 270 kilometers off the coast of Sao Paulo
state, beats Petrobras’s 57 percent overall rate in Brazil,
Molinari said.  Petrobras fell 77 centavos, or 3.7 percent, to 20.10 reais
in Sao Paulo trading at 11:49 a.m. New York time. The benchmark
Bovespa index dropped 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
