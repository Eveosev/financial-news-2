Chancellor Angela Merkel  said joint
European bonds are “not the right answer” to the euro area’s
debt crisis and that  Germany ’s deficit-cutting steps are a model
for other countries.  Merkel sounded the theme at a rally of her Christian
Democratic Union party today as she hit the campaign trail in
her home state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which holds
elections on Sept. 4. Her remark drew applause from a crowd of
several hundred in the main square in the town of Parchim.  Each euro country “must set its own savings program,” a
step that is a precondition for “solidarity” with nations
struggling under debt loads, Merkel said. She cited Germany’s
decision to enshrine step-by-step reductions in government
deficits in the constitution.  “It’s a policy of not living on borrowing money and that
works for a balanced budget as soon as possible,” Merkel said.  Investors are questioning whether  Europe ’s highly indebted
countries can repay their creditors, leading some people to call
for joint European debt, she said. “No, that is not the right
answer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
