Tiger Woods needs more playing time
if he wants to be one of captain  Fred Couples ’s two picks for
the U.S.  Presidents Cup  golf team.  Couples said in June that he’d like to choose Woods for the
squad. Yesterday he reiterated that he wants the 14-time major
tournament winner for the Nov. 17-20 event in Melbourne -- if
Woods is willing to alter his schedule.  Woods, 35, missed the cut at last week’s U.S. PGA
Championship and isn’t scheduled to play again until the
Australian Open in Sydney from Nov. 10-13. He failed to qualify
for the U.S. PGA Tour playoffs that start Aug. 25.  “For him to play, I think he needs to play a little bit,”
Couples told reporters yesterday at the Constellation Energy
Senior  Players Championship  in Harrison,  New York . “He just
can’t show up the week before in Australia.”  The Presidents Cup, which is held every two years, features
the U.S. against a team of players from countries outside Europe.
Couples will announce his picks Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
