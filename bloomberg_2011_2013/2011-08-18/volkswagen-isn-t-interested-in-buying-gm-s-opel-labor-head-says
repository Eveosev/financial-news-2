Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest
carmaker, has no interest in buying  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel
unit because the manufacturers’ operations don’t fit together,
said Bernd Osterloh, the head of VW’s works council.  “How would that happen?” Osterloh, who is also VW’s
deputy supervisory-board chairman, said at a Hamburg business-
journalist event yesterday evening in response to a question.
The two German companies use different technologies to build
cars, he said.  German publications including  Der Spiegel , Die Welt and
Auto Bild reported in June that GM may be considering selling
Opel. GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said on July 27
that Opel isn’t for sale, about two weeks after the Detroit-
based carmaker said VW CEO Martin Winterkorn was stoking
speculation of a disposal. VW replied that Winterkorn’s reported
comments on Opel had been in response to a journalist’s
questions.  GM held talks on selling Ruesselsheim-based Opel during the
global recession before deciding in late 2009 to keep the unit
and its sister U.K. brand, Vauxhall. GM’s European operations
would have broken even in the first quarter without a $395
million charge to goodwill, the U.S. company said in May. It
lost $1.8 billion in  Europe  last year.  Opel’s and Vauxhall’s combined European market share rose
to 7.5 percent in the first half of 2011 from 7.2 percent a year
earlier, according to  industry figures .  To contact the reporter on this story:
