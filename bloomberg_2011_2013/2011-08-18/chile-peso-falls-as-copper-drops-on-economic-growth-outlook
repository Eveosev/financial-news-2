Chile ’s peso weakened as copper
tumbled on concern global economic growth will be slower than
previously forecast, cutting demand for the metal and weakening
the nation’s terms of trade.  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 469.80 pesos per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:21 a.m. New York time, from 466.71 yesterday. The currency
has depreciated against the dollar in three of the last four
sessions.  “It’s always important to look at our terms of trade, and
there has been a drop in commodities today,” Cesar Perez-Novoa,
a managing director at Celfin Capital SA, said in a phone
interview from Santiago. “In the case of Chile, we have seen
copper fall, which has a negative impact on the peso.”  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
1.1 percent to $4.01 per pound in  New York  after Morgan Stanley
and Deutsche Bank AG cut forecasts for economic growth worldwide
and in  China , the biggest consumer of the metal.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
