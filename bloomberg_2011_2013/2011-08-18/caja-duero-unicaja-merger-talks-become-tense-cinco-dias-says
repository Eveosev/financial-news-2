Merger talks between Caja Espana-
Duero and Unicaja, two Spanish savings banks groups, have become
tense after Unicaja demanded a greater stake in the entity
resulting in the combination,  Cinco Dias  said.  Unicaja is requesting control of more than 70 percent of
the bank that would result from the merger, compared with the 63
percent the groups had previously agreed on, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
