for the company,  Jil Mazer-Marino .  The terms of that accord allowed the trustee to sell the
name for restaurants outside New York,  New Jersey , Connecticut
and part of Pennsylvania and for food products. Proceeds are to
go to creditors.  A hearing to approve bidding procedures will be Aug. 31,
according to a court filing. If the rights are sold to another
company, the stalking-horse bidder is to receive a breakup fee
of $65,000, the filing states.  The Chapter 7 case is Tavern on the Green LP, 09-15450,
