South African bondholders are paring
bets on price increases before tomorrow’s auction of inflation-
linked debt amid signs growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy is
faltering.  The central bank will auction 600 million rand ($83.9
million) of securities maturing in 2022, 2028 and 2033. The
secondary-market yield on the 2022 inflation-linked bonds
climbed 2.5 basis points, or 0.025 percentage point, to 2.37
percent today after falling to a record low of 2.345 percent on
Aug. 15.  The 10-year breakeven rate, or yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate notes of similar maturity,
narrowed six basis points to 5.41 percent today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate, a reflection of investors’
expectations for inflation, has narrowed from 5.6 percent on
Aug. 8, when  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S.’s debt rating,
sending stocks tumbling and fueling speculation debt crises in
the U.S. and Europe will slow global growth.  “Certainly, when people start talking about softer
economic growth it doesn’t support higher inflation
expectations,”  Leon Myburgh , a Johannesburg-based analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said by phone.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 5.5 percent this year even as inflation climbed to
a 15-month high of 5 percent in July. While the economy expanded
an annualized 4.8 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace
in a year, unemployment has increased, undermining spending.  The central bank aims to keep the inflation rate within a
range of 3 percent to 6 percent. Inflation is forecast to breach
the upper limit of the target band in the fourth quarter and
average 6.3 percent in the first three months of 2012, according
to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
