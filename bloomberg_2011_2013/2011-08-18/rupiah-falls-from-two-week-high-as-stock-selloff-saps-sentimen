Indonesia ’s rupiah retreated from
near a two-week high as the biggest selloff in regional stocks
in more than a week sapped investor sentiment toward emerging-
market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares dropped 1.5 percent,
the most since Aug. 9. The rupiah has lost 0.4 percent this
month as global funds sold $551 million more Indonesian stocks
than they bought in the period through Aug. 16, exchange data
show. A global slowdown may disrupt economic growth, President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told parliament this week.  “Asian equities are down and that puts pressure on the
rupiah,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The currency will stay rangebound
today.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent from Aug. 16 to 8,545 per
dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Financial markets in Indonesia were closed yesterday
for a national holiday. The currency touched 8,498 today, the
strongest level since Aug. 4.  Government bonds  rose. The yield on the 8.25 percent
securities due July 2021 fell 11 basis points from Aug. 16, or
0.11 percentage point, to 6.83 percent, according to midday
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
