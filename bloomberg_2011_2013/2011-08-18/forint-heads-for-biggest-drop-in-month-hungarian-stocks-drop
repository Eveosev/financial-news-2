The forint fell the most in a month
amid growing concern the global economy is slowing and
speculation that European banks lack sufficient capital.
Hungarian stocks dropped.  The currency weakened 1.3 percent to 273.2 per euro as of
the 5 p.m. end of trade in Budapest, the biggest depreciation on
a closing basis since July 18. The benchmark BUX stock index
slid 2.8 percent to 18,103.60, led by a 6.8 percent drop in OTP
Bank Nyrt., the country’s biggest lender.  Financial companies led losses in stocks after Lars Frisell, chief economist at  Sweden ’s financial regulator, said
it won’t take much for interbank lending to freeze and the Wall
Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators were scrutinizing
the American operations of  Europe ’s largest lenders to assess
their vulnerability. Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for global
growth this year to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent. Equities
extended losses after U.S. existing home sales unexpectedly
dropped and a gauge of Philadelphia manufacturing shrank more
than estimated.  “The sharp fall in central Europe is probably due to the
plunge in banking stocks,” said  Murat Toprak , a currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  London . “Moreover, the Swiss
franc is again on the rise, which puts local currencies under
pressure because of the large debt denominated in francs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
