Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s major
buildings and equipment at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi and Dai-Ni
nuclear power plants weren’t directly damaged by the March 11
earthquake, Junichi Matsumoto, general manager at the utility,
told reporters in Tokyo today.  The utility was asked by  Japan ’s nuclear regulator to
assess damage directly caused by the earthquake to facilities
including the reactor and turbine buildings at its two Fukushima
plants.   The plant’s cooling systems were crippled after the March
earthquake and tsunami, leading to three reactor meltdowns.   To contact the reporter on this story:
