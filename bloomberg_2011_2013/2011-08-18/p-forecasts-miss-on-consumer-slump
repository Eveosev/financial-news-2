Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s
largest computer maker, forecast fiscal fourth-quarter and full-
year earnings that missed analysts’ estimates because of
lackluster  consumer spending .  Sales for the period ending in October will be $32.1
billion to $32.5 billion,  Palo Alto , California-based Hewlett-
Packard said in a statement today. That missed the average $34
billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings
excluding some items will be $1.12 to $1.16 a share, compared
with analysts’ $1.31 average estimate.  For the full fiscal year, revenue will be $127.2 billion to
$127.6 billion, compared with an average estimate of $129
billion. Earnings excluding some items will be $4.82 to $4.86,
missing the average $5 estimate.  Hewlett-Packard confirmed it’s considering a spinoff for
its PC business and that it has agreed to buy software maker
Autonomy Corp. for $42.11 a share, or $10.3 billion. The company
also said it is discontinuing products running WebOS software,
including smartphones and tablet computers, and will explore
options for that business.  Chief Executive Officer  Leo Apotheker , who took the helm in
November, has said he wants to expand in software and so-called
cloud services, which help customers perform computing tasks
over the Internet. Hewlett-Packard has been aiming to lessen its
dependence on PCs, where growth has stalled as consumers flock
to smartphones and tablet-style computers like those made by
Apple Inc.  Third-quarter net income rose to $1.93 billion, or 93 cents
a share, from $1.77 billion, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Profit
excluding some items was $1.10, beating the average $1.09
analyst estimate. Revenue rose 1.5 percent to $31.2 billion,
matching estimates.  Hewlett-Packard shares fell $1.88, or 6 percent, to $29.51
on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has declined 30
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
