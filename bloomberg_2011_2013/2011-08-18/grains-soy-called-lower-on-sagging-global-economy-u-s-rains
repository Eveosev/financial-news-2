What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on signs that the sagging
global economy will curtail demand for the grain used in
livestock feed, fuel and food,  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on speculation that rain in the next week will boost
U.S. yields, Roose said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open down 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures
may open $2 to $3 lower for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 14 cents to 17 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after Morgan Stanley cut is forecast for global
economic growth this year, increasing speculation that worldwide
demand will ebb as production rebounds, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
