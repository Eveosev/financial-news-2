The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
continue its slump as investors hesitate to buy, based on an
analysis of prior periods where the gauge fell 15 percent or
more over two weeks, according to Bespoke Investment Group LLC.  There have been eight periods since 1928 before this year
where the  S&P 500  declined at least 15 percent in 10 days after
not having done so in a year, Bespoke data show. In each period,
the index fell to a new low after the 15 percent decline. The
median return three months after the plunge was a decline of 3.2
percent and a return of 4.8 percent after one year.  “It takes time before investors heal from the bruise of
the decline and step back into the market,” Bespoke, a
Harrison, New York-based research firm said. “The biggest
question being posed right now is whether or not now is the time
to buy,” Bespoke wrote in an Aug. 16 report, “the median
return for the S&P 500 following the eight prior occurrences is
hardly anything to write home about.”  The S&P 500 fell 18 percent from this year’s high on April
29 through Aug. 8 on concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and the
political battle over the U.S. debt ceiling. It has recovered
6.7 percent since then amid a decline in jobless claims, an
increase in retail sales and better-than-estimated profits. The
index is trading at 13.1 times earnings in the past year,
compared with its average since 1954 of 16.4, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The median additional decline after the 15-percent-plus was
17 percent after 159 calendar days, the report showed. The index
took 153 days to drop to a new low following the tumble in
September and October 2008, and lost an extra 32 percent,
Bespoke said.
