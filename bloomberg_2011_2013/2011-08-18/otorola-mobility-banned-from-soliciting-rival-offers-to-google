Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., the
mobile-phone maker that agreed to be bought this week for $12.5
billion by  Google Inc. (GOOG) , cannot solicit other offers, according
to terms of the merger agreement published today.  All employees and directors of the company as well as
outside advisers and legal counsel had to stop any solicitation
of other proposals as of Aug. 15, the document states. Still,
Motorola’s board has a fiduciary duty to consider any
unsolicited superior proposal it may receive, according to the
agreement.  Google, the world’s largest maker of smartphone software,
is buying Motorola Mobility to gain mobile patents and expanding
in the hardware business. Both boards have approved the
takeover, which provides Motorola Mobility shareholders a 63
percent premium over the stock’s closing price on the trading
day preceding the offer.  Motorola Mobility, based in Libertyville,  Illinois , fell 28
cents to $37.85 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , declined $28.27, or
5.3 percent, to $504.88 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Google has agreed to pay Motorola Mobility $2.5 billion if
the deal falls through, the contract states. Motorola Mobility
would pay $375 million if it decided not to sell to Google,
according to the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
