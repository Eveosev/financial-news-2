Hyundai Oilbank Co., one of six
liquefied petroleum gas distributors fined by  South Korea ’s Fair
Trade Commission for price fixing, lost an appeal against the
antitrust regulator’s 26.3 billion won ($24 million) penalty.  The Seoul High  Court  ruled that the commission’s fine was
appropriate as suppliers looked to implicitly reach an agreement
on fixing prices, Hyundai spokesman Koh In Soo said by phone
today.  The commission imposed fines totaling 668.9 billion won
last year on companies including GS Caltex Corp.,  S-Oil Corp. (010950) ,
 E1 Corp. (017940)  and SK Gas Co. for fixing fuel prices for six years. SK
Energy Co. wasn’t required to pay its fine after being the first
company admit to wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
