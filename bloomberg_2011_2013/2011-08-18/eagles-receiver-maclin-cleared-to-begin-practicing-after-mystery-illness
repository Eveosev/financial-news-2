Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver
Jeremy Maclin could return to practice within seven to 10 days
if he doesn’t have any setbacks from a still undiagnosed illness,
team trainer Rick Burkholder said.  Maclin, 23, should be ready for the team’s season opener on
Sept. 11 in  St. Louis , Burkholder said last night in a story
posted on the team’s website.  The team still doesn’t know what caused Maclin to
experience  weight loss  and low energy starting in February. The
third-year Eagles player has been excused from training camp
while doctors did tests, including abdomen surgery last week.  “All the tests have come back negative, so he’s going to
return to our team this weekend,” Burkholder said in a video
posted on the Eagles’ website. “Initially we were all concerned
that he had a life-threatening illness, which he doesn’t.”  Maclin, who is around his playing weight of 198 pounds,
hasn’t experienced any symptoms since the start of training camp,
Burkholder said.  “We know he has an inflammatory condition in his body that
he’s fighting off,” the trainer said in the video. “We don’t
have a confirmed diagnosis.”  Maclin, the Eagles’ first-round draft pick in 2009, has had
126 catches for 1,737 yards and 14 touchdowns in his first two
seasons.  “The whole time we were just believing and praying for
Jeremy, and I’m just glad it worked out,” quarterback  Michael Vick  said in the video on the team website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
