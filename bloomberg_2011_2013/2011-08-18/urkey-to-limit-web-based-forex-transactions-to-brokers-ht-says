Turkey â€™s capital market regulator
will limit web-based foreign currency transactions to authorized
brokers, in effect excluding banks from the transactions,
Haberturk said, without saying where it got the information.  Banks will only be allowed to carry out transactions
through their brokerage units, the newspaper said.  The Turkish Banking Association, a grouping of non-Islamic
banks, asked the regulator to include the banks in the
authorized companies that can do web-based foreign exchange
transactions, which have a daily volume of $13 billion,
Haberturk reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
