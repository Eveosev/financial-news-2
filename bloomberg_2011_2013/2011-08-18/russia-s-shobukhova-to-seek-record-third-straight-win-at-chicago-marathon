Liliya Shobukhova  of  Russia  will
attempt to become the first person to win the  Chicago Marathon 
three straight years when she runs in October’s race.  The feat has been accomplished in each of the sport’s four
other major events, in London, New York City,  Boston  and Berlin.  “This year, there is additional pressure,” Shobukhova
said in a statement released today by race organizers.  There have been 12 runners, including seven women, who have
won the Chicago Marathon in consecutive years. Catherine Ndereba
of Kenya came the closest to three straight wins, finishing
second in 2002 after winning the two previous years.  Shobukhova, who set the Russian women’s marathon record of
2 hours, 20 minutes, 15 seconds while finishing second at this
year’s  London  marathon, said Chicago will be her final marathon
before the 2012 Olympics in London.  The Chicago Marathon is scheduled for Oct. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
