Sishen Iron Ore Co., a unit of  Kumba
Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) , denied committing fraud in its application for a
disputed mining license that was awarded to a rival.  “The submission that Sishen Iron Ore has admitted to fraud
is quite frankly absurd,” Chris Loxton, Kumba’s lawyer, told
the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria today.  Sishen arranged with an official to date its rights
application May 1, 2009, a day after it submitted the proposal,
Willie Vermeulen, the Department of Mineral Resources’ senior
counsel, said in court yesterday. The date is significant as the
21.4 percent share that had been held by  ArcelorMittal South
Africa Ltd. (ACL)  expired April 30. The ministry said it will seek
criminal charges against Sishen.  Kumba and  ArcelorMittal (MT)  are asking the North Gauteng High
Court to overturn the award of prospecting rights for the Sishen
mine to Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd., whose owners
include Jagdish Parekh, a business partner of Duduzane Zuma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
