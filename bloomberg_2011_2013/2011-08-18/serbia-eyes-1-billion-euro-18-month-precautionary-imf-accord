Serbia is looking for an 18-month
precautionary loan accord with the International Monetary Fund
worth around 1 billion euros, ($1.4 billion) or twice its quota
with the lender, the Belgrade-based central bank said.  Discussions with the lender, whose mission will be in
Belgrade between Aug. 18 and Aug. 30, will focus on fiscal
policy for the rest of 2011 and 2012 with the aim of keeping the
 budget deficit  in line with self-imposed rules, the Narodna
Banka Srbije said in an e-mailed statement today.  Serbia will also discuss its latest macroeconomic
developments, the impact of the global financial crisis on the
economy and measures meant to help the country protect itself
from the possible consequences of the crisis, the National Bank
of Serbia said.  If the agreement is reached, the IMF board will likely
endorse the new program by the end of September, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
