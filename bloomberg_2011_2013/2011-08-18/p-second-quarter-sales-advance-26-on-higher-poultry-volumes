Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA, a
Ukrainian agribusiness company, said second-quarter sales rose
26 percent on stronger demand for chicken and higher sunflower-
 oil prices .  Sales climbed to $281 million from $223 million a year
earlier, Kiev-based MHP, as the company is known, said today in
a statement. Revenue jumped 25 percent to $527 million in the
first half, it showed.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization climbed 19 percent to $158 million in the first
half, according to the statement. Chief Executive Officer
Viktoria Kapelyushna predicted a 12 percent gain for this year
on that basis in a phone interview, citing a favorable grain
harvest.  “The main driver will be our grain business, as we
increased our capacity significantly,” the CEO said. “The
chicken business will increase by between 2 percent to 3
percent, because we are now using all our capacity.”  MHP increased its bank land by 60 percent to almost 300,000
hectares (741,315 acres) and plans to expand it by 500,000
hectares by 2015, Kapelyushna said.  The company may take in as much as $150 million in revenue
from selling grains this year, according to the CEO. It has sold
20,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of rapeseed so far and may
sell between 300,000 and 400,000 tons of corn, she said.  Second-quarter net income was unchanged at $67 million,
according to the statement. First-half profit fell 16 percent to
$86 million on that basis, it showed.  MHP’s U.K.-listed shares rose 79 cents, or 5.8 percent, to
$14.35 by 10:16 a.m. London time, increasing the company’s
market value to $1.55 billion. That reduced this year’s decline
to 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
