Cotton futures fell on signs of
dwindling demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter.  Orange juice  rose.  In the week ended Aug. 11, overseas buyers scrapped orders
for 337,000 bales of upland cotton, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today. A bale weighs 480 pounds (218
kilograms).  “Export sales were pretty dismal,”  John Flanagan , the
president of Flanagan Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina,  North
Carolina , said in a telephone interview. “What that says is
that there’s not much demand for cotton this year. Factories
aren’t going to buy cotton if stores aren’t going to buy
clothes.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 0.87 cent, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1.0695 a pound at 2:45 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. Earlier, the price tumbled 4 cents, the most
allowed by the exchange. The fiber has tumbled 26 percent this
year as demand slumped in  China , the leading importer.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
dropped as much as 2.5 percent as concerns mounted that the
global economy is sagging.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 0.1 cent to
$1.645 a pound on ICE. The commodity has climbed 20 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
