Nigeria ’s navy arrested a vessel
carrying 441,953 liters of suspected stolen crude oil in the
country’s southern Niger River delta, Jerry Unoarumhi, a navy
commander, told reporters today in the oil industry hub of Port
Harcourt.  The crew of the vessel, which was stopped near the Nun
River by a military patrol on Aug. 16, “had no valid document
to confirm the source of what it was carrying,” he said. The
arrested crew are being held at a military camp near the Brass
oil export terminal, he added.  Africa ’s top oil producer loses an average of 300,000
barrels of the commodity everyday to criminal gangs that steal
from pipelines and illegally sell to tankers on the coast,
according to the Petroleum Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
