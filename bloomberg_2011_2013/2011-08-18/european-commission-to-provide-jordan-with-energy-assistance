The European Commission will provide
Jordan with 71 million euros ($102 million) in assistance for
renewable energy, education and knowledge-sharing programs.  About half the amount will be used to help implement
Jordanâ€™s 2007-2020 plan to achieve energy savings of 20 percent,
the commission said in a statement on its website yesterday.  Of the remainder, 23 million euros will be used train
teachers, build centers for special-needs education and help
children from poor areas gain access to preschool education.
Funding will also be used to assign experts from member states
to the Jordanian government to share knowledge and skills,
according to the commission.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports almost all of its energy and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
