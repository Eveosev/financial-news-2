China  Datang Corp. Renewable Power
Co., a unit of the nation’s second-biggest electricity producer,
doubled first-half profit on increased sales of wind power.  Net income was 415.9 million yuan ($65 million), compared
with 202.6 million yuan a year earlier, the unit of China Datang
Corp. said today in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Sales increased to 1.86 billion yuan from 1.04 billion yuan.  The company “maintained its rapid growth momentum,”
according to the statement, as it seeks to increase wind-power
capacity and develop other renewable resources.  China, the biggest energy consumer, set provincial quotas
for  wind energy  to ease pressure on electricity grids, enabling
project developers to increase their revenues. The country is
aiming to install 110 gigawatts of wind capacity by 2015.  “Datang Renewable’s significant increase in its
accumulated wind power generation for the first half of 2011 was
primarily attributable to its additional installed capacity last
year,” said Lynda Peng, an analyst at BOCOM International
Holdings Co.  While consolidated wind power capacity rose 52 percent to
4.1 gigawatts by June 30 from a year earlier and the full-year
target is for 5.5 gigawatts, approval for projects is becoming
more difficult, the Beijing-based company said in the statement.  Datang Renewable is diversifying into solar power as the
government pushes to develop the industry. The company last
month won approval from the Jiangsu Development and Reform
Commission for a 2-megawatt rooftop solar power project.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
