MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) , the energy company
controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, is negotiating
contracts to sell coal from Colombian mines to customers in
Asia, Europe and the U.S.  MPX expects to announce contracts to supply coal from its
Colombian unit in the first half of next year, Chief Executive
Officer Eduardo Karrer said today in an interview in  Rio de
Janeiro , where the company is based. Output from its open-pit
mine is set to start in the fourth quarter of 2012, he said.  “We have expectations of having thermal coal of very good
quality, which would guarantee us steady sales of these products
in the international market,” Karrer said, declining to name
the companies involved in the negotiations. “ Colombia  will
increase its coal exports by a lot.”  MPX, the only one of Batista’s five publicly traded start-
ups whose shares have risen in Sao Paulo trading this year, is
exploring for coal in the Colombian province of La Guajira and
plans to produce 35 million tons by 2020. Xstrata Plc, BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc are expanding capacity at
the nearby Cerrejon, the world’s biggest open-pit coal mine for
exports, to 40 million tons a year by 2015 as part of a $1.3
billion investment.  MPX gained 4 centavos, or 1.2 percent, to close at 35.40
reais in Sao Paulo trading . The stock has jumped 45 percent
this year, compared with a 23 percent decline for  Brazil ’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
