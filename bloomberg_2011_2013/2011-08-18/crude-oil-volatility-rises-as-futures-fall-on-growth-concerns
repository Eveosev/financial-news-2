Oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures slid after Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank
AG cut their global economic growth forecasts for 2011 and
equities plunged.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 49.85 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New
York , up from 37.47 percent yesterday.  Crude for October delivery fell $5.22 to $82.51 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The September-delivery
contract lost $5.20 to settle at $82.38. The front-month
contract has declined 28 percent since hitting a 2011 high of
$113.93 on April 29.  The most active options contract in electronic trading
today was October $80 puts, with 4,137 lots changing hands. They
rose $2.15 to $3.55 a barrel. October $75 puts, the next-most
active option, advanced $1.46 to $2.18 a barrel with 3,810 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $70 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 7,783 lots changing hands. They fell 20 cents to
$1.52 a barrel. The next-most active options, Dec. $60 puts,
