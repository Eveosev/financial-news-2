Demand for oil-product tankers will
improve in the second half of the year, according to Torm A/S, a
Danish owner and operator of the vessels.  “As we approach autumn and winter we will have an upward
trend in the product tanker market demand from here,” Chief
Executive Officer Jacob Meldgaard said by phone from Hellerup,
 Denmark , today. Charter rates for the ships are “likely to
improve,” he said, declining to forecast when that will happen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
