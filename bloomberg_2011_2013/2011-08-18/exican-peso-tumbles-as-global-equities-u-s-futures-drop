Mexico ’s peso declined as global
stocks and U.S. equities slid amid growing signs the world
economy is slowing and speculation that European banks lack
sufficient capital.  The peso weakened 0.8 percent to 12.2725 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.1689 yesterday. The currency earlier
lost as much as 2.2 percent and has gained 0.6 percent this
year.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 4.5 percent to
1,140.74, while The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 4.8 percent in
its worst plunge since March 2009. Morgan Stanley cut its
forecast for global economic growth this year to 3.9 percent
from 4.2 percent. U.S. initial jobless claims climbed by 9,000
to 408,000 in the week ended Aug. 13, topping the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The Fed Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index unexpectedly plunged to minus 30.7, the
lowest level since March 2009.  “The first half of the day was exactly following
equities,” Jorge Perez-Duarte, managing director for emerging-
market foreign exchange at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto, said
by phone. There was a “disconnect” toward the end of the day
between the peso and U.S. equities.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.04 percent, according to
Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose 1.46 centavos
to 136.14 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
