Spanish police arrested seven people
last night after demonstrators protesting Pope Benedict XVI’s
visit clashed with church supporters and police in the capital.  Eleven people were injured, including two officers, said a
police spokeswoman, who declined to be identified in line with
policy. Demonstrators protesting the cost of Benedict’s trip
insulted and threw bottles at youths gathered in central Madrid
for the pontiff’s visit, she said.  Youths from  Latin America ,  Europe  and the U.S. have flocked
to the Spanish capital for the  World Youth Day  celebrations to
coincide with the pope’s arrival today. Organizers estimate as
many as 1 million young people will take part in events through
Aug. 21 that have closed parts of the city center to traffic.  The pro-secular march through central Madrid yesterday was
backed by 140 groups, according to the website of the Madrid
Association of Atheists and Freethinkers.  Spain  is struggling to
trim one of the region’s largest budget gaps, and Development
Minister Jose Blanco said yesterday expenses linked to the papal
visit would be more than offset by revenue it generates, without
giving details.  The six-day event is being paid for by pilgrims at no cost
to taxpayers, according to the organizers’ website. The pope is
 scheduled  to remain in Madrid until Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
