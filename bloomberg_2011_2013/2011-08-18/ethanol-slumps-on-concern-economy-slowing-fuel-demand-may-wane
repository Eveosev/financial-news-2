Ethanol futures slumped in  Chicago 
on concern that the economy is slowing and will curtail fuel
demand.  Futures snapped a seven-day string of gains after Morgan
Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG cut their forecasts for global
economic growth. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to augment
supply.  “That’s very disturbing,” said Peyton Feltus, president
of Randolph Risk Management in  Dallas . “The markets are down as
they should be. That’s the correct reaction to something like
that. The problems are on the demand side. There’s not sustained
growth.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery slipped 2.6 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.779 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the first decline since Aug. 8. Futures are up 17 percent
this year.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 20 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn is the primary basis for the fuel in the U.S.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 8.71 cents, or 3
percent, to settle at $2.7832 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract includes reformulated
gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December delivery plunged 12.5 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $7.13 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
