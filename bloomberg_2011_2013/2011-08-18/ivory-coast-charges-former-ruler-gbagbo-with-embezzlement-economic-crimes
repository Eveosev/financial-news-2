Ivory Coast  has charged former
leader  Laurent Gbagbo  with economic crimes including aggravated
theft and embezzlement of public funds, the office of the
prosecutor said today.  The wife of the former ruler, Simone Gbagbo, was also
charged with economic crimes, prosecutor Simplice Kouadio Koffi
told reporters today.   Gbagbo ruled the worldâ€™s top cocoa grower from 2000 until
2010. His refusal to acknowledge defeat in November elections
triggered a violent five-month confrontation that ended with his
arrest on April 11. At least 3,000 people were killed during the
crisis, according to the UN.    To contact the reporter on this story:
