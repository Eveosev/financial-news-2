Bank of Communications Co.,  China ’s
fifth-largest bank, said second-quarter profit jumped 32 percent
as economic growth fueled growth in loans and fees.  Net income rose to 13.1 billion yuan ($2.1 billion), or
0.19 yuan a share, from 9.9 billion yuan, or 0.18 yuan, a year
earlier, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange
today. First-half profit increased 30 percent to 26.4 billion
yuan, and compared with the average 25.5 billion yuan from six
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net interest income climbed 22 percent in the quarter to
25.6 billion yuan, the Shanghai-based bank said. Net fee and
commission income increased 39 percent to 5.09 billion yuan.  Shares of BoCom, the second-worst performer of the Hang
Seng Finance Index over the last 12 months, have dropped 19
percent in  Hong Kong  this year. The stock fell 1.9 percent to
close at HK$5.75 before the earnings announcement.  Chinese banks’ net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, widened to 2.7 percent in the second quarter from
2.5 percent in the fourth quarter last year, the China Banking
Regulatory Commission’s  data  showed. BoCom’s net interest margin
widened 11 basis points in the first-half to 2.54 percent from a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
