Swaziland labor unions plan to lead
five days of demonstrations to demand political change in the
country, the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions said.  The unions will hold protests from Sept. 5 to Sept. 9, the
labor group said in a statement, e-mailed by the Johannesburg-
based Congress of South African Trade Unions today.  “The underlining demand is the call for a democratic
Swaziland, the unbanning of political parties and the release of
political prisoners,” the Swazi group said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
