(Corrects attribution in second paragraph.)  International Potash Co. , a trader
of the fertilizer ingredient for Russian producer OAO  Uralkali (URKA) ,
agreed to supply 400,000 metric tons to  India  by year-end,
industry consultant Fertecon Ltd. said in a report obtained by
Bloomberg News.  IPC, as the trader is known, will supply potash to India on
the same terms as Belarusian Potash Co., Uralkali’s main trader,
Uralkali Head of Sales Oleg Petrov told reporters on Aug. 4.
Belarusian Potash agreed to sell potash to India for $490 a ton.  IPC will stop working with Uralkali at the end of this
year, the company said in June.  Alexei Sotskov, a spokesman for Berezniki-based Uralkali,
said he couldn’t comment immediately on the Fertecon report when
Bloomberg News called.  To contact the reporters on this story:
