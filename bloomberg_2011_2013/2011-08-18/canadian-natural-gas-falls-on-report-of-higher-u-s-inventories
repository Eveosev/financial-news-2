Canadian natural gas fell after a
U.S. government report showed last week’s inventories increased
more than expected and meteorologists forecast normal
temperatures that may trim demand for the power-plant fuel.  Prices, which usually follow their U.S. counterparts on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , declined 0.2 percent as the Energy
Department said U.S. stockpiles climbed 50 billion cubic feet to
2.833 trillion. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg forecast
a gain of 47 billion cubic feet. MDA EarthSat Weather of
Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted normal temperatures in the
U.S. Northeast and Midwest for most of the month.  “It’s a little bit of a build, but to me the bigger issue
is the forecast, which is cooler and much more beneficial to
conserving natural gas consumption,” Gordy Elliott, a risk-
management specialist at INTL FCStone Inc. in  St. Louis Park ,
Minnesota, said in a telephone interview. “The big worry about
any demand issues due to hot weather and generation of
electricity is past.”  Alberta gas for September delivery shed 0.75 cent to C$3.37
per gigajoule ($3.22 per million British thermal units) as of
11:30 a.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and
the U.S. and is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  In New York, natural gas for September delivery fell 5.9
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.874 per million Btu as of 11:34
a.m.  Gas Flows  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.4 billion cubic
feet as of 10:30 a.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.97 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.91 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.4 billion cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.36 billion cubic feet today, about 49 percent of its
capacity of 2.58 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
dropped 2.95 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $4.0741 per million Btu
yesterday on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 0.64 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $3.803.  To contact the reporter on this story:
