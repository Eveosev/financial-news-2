U.S. regulators are stepping up
scrutiny of local operations for  Europe ’s largest banks on
concern that the region’s sovereign debt crisis may lead to
funding problems, the Wall Street Journal reported today.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  has been holding talks
with the lenders and sought information about their access to
funds to maintain operations in the U.S., the Journal said,
citing people it didn’t identify. The regulator has also been
asking some lenders to overhaul their structure, it said.  Policy makers, who aim to avert a repeat of the 2008 global
financial crisis, are concerned that Europe’s debt problems may
curtail the banks’ ability to fund loans and meet their
obligations in the U.S., or lead them to siphon funds from the
U.S., the newspaper said. The problems haven’t yet escalated to
the level of previous crises, it said.  Overseas lenders that don’t have big branch networks in the
U.S. can borrow dollars from other lenders, the central bank or
money-market funds, or swap their domestic-market currencies,
the newspaper said. Those avenues of funding typically disappear
in a crisis, it said.  Fed officials are in touch with European regulators over
the issue, the newspaper said. The  New York  Fed is also
coordinating with Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York’s superintendent
of financial services, to oversee the banks’ funding situation,
the Journal reported.  Jack Gutt , a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to
comment to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
