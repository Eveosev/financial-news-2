European equities plummeted the most
in more than two years as U.S. economic data missed forecasts,
two Federal Reserve officials said the central bank shouldn’t
act to protect stock investors and Swedish regulators warned
that lenders are unprepared for a freeze in money markets.  Dexia SA (DEXB)  and Societe Generale SA slid more than 12 percent
as the Wall Street Journal also said that U.S. regulators are
stepping up scrutiny of  Europe ’s largest lenders.  Fiat SpA (F)  lost
12 percent as a gauge of carmakers fell 7.4 percent.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) 
sank 8 percent as the world’s second-biggest cement maker
reported profit that missed estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index plunged 4.8 percent to 226.7 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the biggest drop since March
2009, as only four stocks gained. The gauge has tumbled 22
percent from this year’s peak in February amid concern that
Europe will fail to contain its sovereign-debt crisis and that
the economic recovery in the U.S. will falter.  “If investors were looking for proof that we could be
heading for recession, you have it here,” Henrik Drusebjerg, a
senior strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen, said in a
telephone interview. “We’ve been decreasing risk since the
beginning of the year.”  Benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 markets in western
Europe as the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 4.5 percent and the German
DAX lost 5.8 percent, the most since 2008. Sweden’s OMX 30
declined the most of any European market, sinking 6.7 percent.  VStoxx Jumps  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, jumped
35 percent, the most since May 2010.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s pledge last week
to keep  interest rates  near zero until mid-2013 was
“inappropriate policy at an inappropriate time,”  Charles Plosser , president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg Radio interview.  Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said the central bank
shouldn’t enact policy to protect stock investors. Both
officials dissented from the Fed’s Aug. 9 statement.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as much as 28 percent
after Bernanke foreshadowed a second round of so-called
quantitative easing on Aug. 27 of last year. The central bank
finished the program of asset purchases at the end of June.
Bernanke may announce policy intentions at a conference in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , on Aug. 26.  Rate Policy  “The comments from Plosser and Fisher put focus back on
how committed the Fed is to the zero-interest rate policy ahead
of Bernanke’s comments next week,” said Anders Eklof, a
currency strategist at Swedbank in Stockholm. “The Fed has
obviously been wrong about the economy, once last summer and
then now.”  A report today showed U.S. initial jobless-benefit claims
climbed by 9,000 to 408,000 in the week ended Aug. 13, the
highest in a month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
projected 400,000 claims, according to the median forecast.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell more than forecast to minus 30.7 in August, the
lowest since March 2009, from 3.2 the prior month. Readings
greater than zero signal expansion in the area covering eastern
Pennsylvania, southern  New Jersey  and Delaware.  Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for global growth this
year, citing an “insufficient” policy response to Europe’s
debt crisis, weakened confidence and the prospect of fiscal
tightening. The bank now estimates expansion of 3.9 percent,
down from a previous forecast of 4.2 percent.  New Lows  U.S. stocks may slip to new lows in the next few weeks,
setting the stage for a rally of more than 20 percent, Tom
DeMark, the creator of indicators meant to identify turning
points in the price of securities, said in an interview on Aug.
16. The  S&P 500 , which closed at 1,193.89 yesterday, will
probably drop below the 11-month low of 1,119.46 set on Aug. 8
before surging above 1,363.61, its peak on April 29, he said.  Dexia, Belgium’s biggest lender, tumbled 14 percent to 1.57
euros today, leading a gauge of banks in the Stoxx 600 to a two-
year low.  Societe Generale (GLE) ,  France ’s second-largest lender,
dropped 12 percent to 21.60 euros, the lowest since March 2009.
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest bank by market value,
declined 6 percent to 509.6 pence.  The WSJ reported that U.S. regulators are stepping up
scrutiny of local operations for Europe’s largest banks on
concern that the sovereign debt crisis may lead to funding
problems. The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  has been holding
talks with the lenders and sought information about their access
to funds to maintain operations in the U.S., the newspaper said,
citing people it didn’t identify.  Swedish Banks  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  retreated 9 percent to 83.55 kronor in
Stockholm, the largest decline in two years.  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ,
Sweden’s biggest bank, fell 7.4 percent to 54.70 kronor.  Swedish banks must do more to prepare for a deterioration
in Europe’s debt crisis that could freeze interbank markets and
cut off funding, said  Lars Frisell , chief economist at the
country’s financial regulator.  “It won’t take much for the interbank market to
collapse,” Frisell said yesterday in an interview in Stockholm.
“It’s not that serious at the moment but it feels like it could
very easily become that way and that everything will freeze.”  Fiat fell 12 percent to 4.33 euros to pace European
automakers lower as the gauge fell the most of the 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600.  Continental AG (CON) , Europe’s second-largest
auto-parts supplier, retreated 8.6 percent to 49.37 euros.  Holcim Slides  Holcim sank 8 percent to 44.03 Swiss francs after reporting
second-quarter net income of 347 million francs ($437 million),
missing the 373.3 million-franc average estimate of analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Sales dropped 11 percent to 5.49 billion
francs, compared with an estimate of 5.56 billion francs.  FLSmidth A/S, the world’s biggest maker of cement kilns,
fell 14 percent to 277.60 kroner as its earnings also missed
analysts’ forecasts.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the third-largest
maker of cement, sank 9.5 percent to 29.13 euros in  Frankfurt .  Royal Boskalis Westminster NV plunged 13 percent to 22.96
euros, the largest drop since 2002. The world’s biggest dredging
company said first-half net income fell to 114 million euros
($164 million) from 124 million euros a year earlier. The
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts was for
profit of 116 million euros.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  retreated 6 percent to 2,010 pence after the
board of Australian brewer Foster’s Group Ltd. rejected its
hostile A$9.5 billion ($10 billion) takeover bid. The London-
based brewer may have to raise its offer by 6 percent to A$5.20
a share to win over investors, according to the median estimate
of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Coloplast A/S had the biggest gain in the Stoxx 600. The
world’s largest maker of ostomy and urology products rose 5.5
percent to 767 kroner in Copenhagen after reporting third-
quarter net income of 485 million kroner ($94 million), beating
the average analyst estimate of 433 million kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
