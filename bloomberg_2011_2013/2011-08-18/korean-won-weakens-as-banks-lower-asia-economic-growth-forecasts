South Korea’s won fell for a second
day as overseas investors reduced holdings of the nation’s
stocks amid a deteriorating outlook for Asian economies.  Morgan Stanley cut the 2011 growth estimate for the nation
to 3.8 percent today from 4.5 percent. The New York-based lender
and Deutsche Bank AG lowered predictions for  China ’s expansion,
saying an unfavorable global environment will sap demand for
Asian exports. The won reversed earlier gains as the  Kospi Index (KOSPI) 
of local shares lost 1.7 percent and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index
declined for the first time in four days.  “Reported downgrades of economic forecasts reduced
appetite for regional assets,” said Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based
senior currency trader at Hana Bank. “Stock-market declines
affected Asian currencies including the won.”  The won weakened 0.2 percent to 1,074.00 at the 3 p.m.
close in Seoul, after earlier touching a one-week high of
1,067.57, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
lost 1.8 percent so far this month, a decline second only to
 India ’s rupee among Asia’s 10 most-used exchange rates.  Overseas funds reduced holdings of South Korean equities by
$4.2 billion this month through yesterday, exchange data show.
Morgan Stanley scaled back its 2012 growth forecast for  South
Korea  to 3.6 percent from 4.0 percent, according to a research
note published today. The bank also cut its estimate for India’s
expansion in the year ending March 2012 to 7.2 percent from 7.7
percent.  Inflation Pressures  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today that inflation
pressures remain high in South Korea and the government will use
“all possible” measures to stabilize prices. The Bank of Korea
kept  interest rates  unchanged for a second month at an Aug. 11
review, after three increases this year, as a slide in equities
worldwide heightened concern the global economic recovery is
faltering.  Three-year  government bonds  fell for a third day, pushing
yields to the highest level in more than a week. The yield on
the 3.5 percent debt due June 2014 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.56 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
