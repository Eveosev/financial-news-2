New Zealand  recalled four players
for their first Test appearance of 2011 in the All Blacks’ final
match before their Rugby World Cup squad is announced.  Backs Israel Dagg, Isaia Toeava, Richard Kahui, and
loosehead prop Tony Woodcock will get the chance to prove their
fitness in this weekend’s Tri-Nations game against South Africa
in Port Elizabeth. Prop John Afoa, who made two appearances as a
replacement last month, returns after fracturing his cheekbone
against the Springboks.  “Playing the Springboks at home is always a massive
occasion and with Rugby World Cup spots also up for grabs, our
players will be looking to put in a big performance,” All
Blacks coach Graham Henrysaid in a statement. “We will have to
be ready for a huge physical contest.”   New Zealand, which is level with  Australia  atop the Tri-
Nations standings, is scheduled to name its 30-man squad for the
Sept. 9-Oct. 23 tournament on Aug. 23. The All Blacks face
Australia in the Tri-Nations finale four days later in Brisbane.  ALL BLACKS: Israel Dagg, Isaia Toeava, Richard Kahui, Sonny
Bill Williams, Hosea Gear, Colin Slade, Jimmy Cowan, Liam
Messam, Adam Thomson, Jerome Kaino, Ali Williams, Sam Whitelock,
John Afoa, Keven Mealamu (captain), Tony Woodcock.  Reserves: Andrew Hore, Ben Franks, Jarrad Hoeata, Victor
Vito,  Andy Ellis ,  Piri Weepu , Cory Jane.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
