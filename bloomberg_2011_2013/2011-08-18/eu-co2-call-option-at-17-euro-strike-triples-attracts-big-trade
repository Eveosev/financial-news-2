Traders today bought  call options 
totaling 3.5 million metric tons in the December European Union
carbon futures contract at a strike price of 17 euros ($24) a
metric ton, even after the price tripled in the past two weeks.  That’s the biggest ever daily volume for the option,
according to data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. The price was 18 cents a ton yesterday, compared with a
record low of 6 cents on Aug. 5, ICE data show. At 18 cents, the
bet would have cost 630,000 euros plus brokerage and exchange-
clearing fees.  December carbon futures have dropped 27 percent since May
31 to 12.46 euros today as of 12:14 p.m., partly because of
concern the EU program is oversupplied with allowances through
next year and beyond. They’ve already rebounded 16 percent from
an Aug. 5 low of 10.71 euros. Call options give the buyer the
right to purchase at a set level. Put options give the buyer the
right to sell at a certain price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
