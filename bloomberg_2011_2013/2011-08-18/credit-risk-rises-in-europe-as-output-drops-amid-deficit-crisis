The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign debt in Europe surged by the most in more than a year
on concern that global economic growth is stalling.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 40 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
increased 44.5 basis points, the most since May 2010, to 644,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 4 p.m. in  London . The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index tied to the debt of 15
governments rose 21 basis points 298.  European construction output dropped for the first time in
three months in June, led by declines in Germany and  France .
U.S. sales of previously owned houses unexpectedly dropped in
July and manufacturing in the Philadelphia region contracted
this month by the most in more than two years.  “The bottom line is that concerns about the euro zone debt
crisis and economic growth fears coupled with inflationary
worries are contributing to safe-haven flows,” Stefan Kolek, a
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich, wrote in a note today.  The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 9.5 basis points to 152.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 13 basis points to 233 and
the subordinated index climbed 18 to 393.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
