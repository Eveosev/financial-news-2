Soon Tit Koon, chief financial
officer of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,  Southeast Asia ’s
second-largest bank, comments on loans linked to the Singapore
dollar swap offer rate after the benchmark gauge turned negative
for the first time last week.  Soon made his comments in an e-mailed response today to
questions from Bloomberg News.  On use of the swap offer rate:  “The recent movement of SOR rates to negative territory
while interbank rates stayed positive clearly indicates that SOR
is no longer a fair or objective benchmark for the cost of
Singapore dollar funds in the wholesale financial markets.”  On the relevance of the peg:  “While the recent movement of SOR into negative territory
might not by itself translate to that significant a difference
in absolute terms for our loan margins, the use of SOR as the
interest rate basis for Singapore dollar-lending is clearly
inappropriate and unsustainable under the current market
conditions.”  On pegging home loans to Singapore’s interbank offered rate:  “Since March this year, we have also switched to SIBOR-
based housing loans for our floating rate housing loan products,
and we continued to offer our usual board rate variable and
fixed rate loans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
