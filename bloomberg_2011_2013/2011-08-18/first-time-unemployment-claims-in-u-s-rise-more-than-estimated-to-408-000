More Americans than forecast filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week, signaling the
labor market is struggling two years into the economic recovery.  Jobless claims climbed by 9,000 to 408,000 in the week
ended Aug. 13, the highest in a month, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News projected a rise in claims to 400,000, according to the
median forecast. The number of people on unemployment benefit
rolls rose, while those receiving extended payments fell.  Companies like  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  are paring
staff, one reason consumers are limiting their spending, which
accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Unemployment at
9.1 percent helps explain why Federal Reserve policy makers last
week pledged to hold  interest rates  at a record low until at
least mid-2013 to spur growth.  “People continue to get laid off,”  David Semmens , a U.S.
economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York, said before
the report. “The uncertainty in the economic outlook is
continuing to give hiring managers sleepless nights and is
keeping businesses from expanding. We have an incredibly long
way to go” to get a healthy labor market, Semmens said.  Jobless benefits applications were projected to rise from
the 395,000 initially reported for the prior week, according to
the median forecast of 41 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 390,000 to 420,000.  Stock-index futures held earlier losses after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in
September fell 2.2 percent to 1,163.40 at 8:39 a.m. in  New York .
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.1
percent from 2.17 percent late yesterday.  Four-Week Average  Today’s data showed the four-week moving average, a less-
volatile measure than the weekly figures, dropped to 402,500
last week, the lowest since April 16, from 406,000.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
climbed by 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to 3.7 million.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
43,700 to 3.66 million in the week ended July 30.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.9 percent in
the week ended Aug. 6, today’s report showed.  By State  Thirty-four states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 18 reported a decline. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Businesses reducing headcount include Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. The world’s largest custody bank plans to eliminate
1,500 jobs, or 3 percent of the workforce, after expenses surged
in the second quarter. It will implement an immediate hiring
freeze across most departments and reduce its use of temporary
workers, consultants and contractors.  “Expenses have been growing unsustainably faster” than
revenue,  Robert Kelly , BNY Mellon’s chief executive officer,
said in a statement on Aug. 10. “We expect our natural turnover
and immediate hiring freeze will reduce the impact on existing
staff” from the reductions.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  July Employment  Payrolls grew by 117,000 in July, bringing the average gain
over the past three months to 111,000, according to Labor
Department data. That was about half the 204,000 increase on
average in the first four months of the year.  The lack of a pickup in hiring and an economy that’s
growing “considerably slower” than expected prompted Fed
policy makers to pledge for the first time to keep the benchmark
interest rate at a record low at least through mid-2013.  “Indicators suggest a deterioration in overall labor
market conditions in recent months,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said in a statement on Aug. 9 after its meeting. “The
unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that
the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate” of
maximum employment and price stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
