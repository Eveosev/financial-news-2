Soccer fans visiting Britain last
year to watch Premier League matches spent 38 percent more on
average than other tourists.  More than 750,000 people came to Britain to watch the
league last year, spending 595 million pounds ($980 million),
VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, said in a statement.
Their average of 776 pounds spent per person was higher than the
average of 563 pounds for all visitors, the agency said.  Manchester United’s Old Trafford was the most-visited
stadium, drawing 114,000 overseas fans. Liverpool’s Anfield
(89,000), Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium (88,000), Chelsea’s
Stamford Bridge (54,000) and Tottenham’s White Hart Lane
(38,000) rounded out the top-five destinations.  “Nothing quite beats the excitement of match day, being
inside a full Premier League ground and seeing a competitive
match in the flesh, so it’s very encouraging to hear that so
many international visitors want to experience football in this
country,” Richard Scudamore, chief executive officer of the
Premier League, said in the statement.  About 40 percent of visitors going to a match said
attending a sporting event was the main reason for their trip.
The largest number of visitors came from Ireland (164,000),
followed by  Norway  (77,000), the U.S. (56,000), the Netherlands
(41,000) and  Germany  (39,000).  To contact the reporter on this story:
