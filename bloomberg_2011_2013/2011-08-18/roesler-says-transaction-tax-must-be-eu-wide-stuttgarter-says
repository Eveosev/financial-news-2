German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said his Free Democrats Party will only vote in favor of
a financial-transaction tax if the levy is implemented in all 27
European Union member states,  Stuttgarter Zeitung  reported.  “Our approval for a transaction tax will only come about
-- if at all -- if it’s levied in all 27 EU countries,” Roesler
told the Stuttgarter Zeitung in an interview. Roesler is
chairman of the FDP, the junior coalition partner of  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic-led bloc.  Roesler rejected setting up a transaction tax only in
countries that share the euro, saying it would put them at a
disadvantage to non-euro-area states, Stuttgarter reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
