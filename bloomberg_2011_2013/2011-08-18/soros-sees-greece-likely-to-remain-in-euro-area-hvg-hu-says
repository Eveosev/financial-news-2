Greece is more likely to remain in
the euro area than exit it,  George Soros , the billionaire
investor, said in an interview with Hungarian news portal  hvg.hu 
published today.  The meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  showed that the bigger member states
“want to do everything” to keep Greece in the currency area,
“so I am seeing a bigger chance of that,” the website quoted
Soros as saying.  A failure of euro-area countries to issue joint euro bonds
would make the group lose its credibility, which would have
“unthinkable” implications for the global economy and
financial system, Soros added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
