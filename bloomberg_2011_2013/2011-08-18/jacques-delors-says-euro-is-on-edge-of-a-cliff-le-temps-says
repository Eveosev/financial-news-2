Former European Commission President
Jacques Delors said  Europe  and the euro are “on the edge of a
cliff” and member states must embrace closer economic
cooperation,  Le Temps  reported, citing an interview.  The proposal for a European  finance ministry  is a “crazy
gadget” and cooperating in economic matters without ceding some
sovereignty won’t achieve anything, Delors said, according to
the Swiss newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
