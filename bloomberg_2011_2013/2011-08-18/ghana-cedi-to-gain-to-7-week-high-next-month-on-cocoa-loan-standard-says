Ghana ’s cedi is set to appreciate to
a seven-week high against the dollar by the end of September as
the country gets a $1.75 billion credit facility from
international banks, according to Standard Chartered Bank Plc.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
will gain as much as 0.4 percent to 1.5200 per dollar, from
yesterday’s close of 1.5260, Othniel Kwainoe, a currency trader
at the local unit of the bank said in a telephone interview
today from the capital, Accra. That would be the strongest level
since Aug. 8, when the currency closed at 1.5181 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ghana Cocoa Board will raise the funds to buy the
chocolate ingredient in the 2011-12 crop season, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Yaw Adu-Ampomah said July 20. The facility is
exepcted to be signed on Sept. 21 in  London , Ama Sedegah, an
officer at the public relations department of Cocobod, as the
board is known, said by phone today from the capital, Accra.  “The Cocoa Board’s pre-export finance facility, to be
signed in September is quite a significant amount,” Kwainoe
said. “We think it will help the cedi recover previous losses
and close stronger by the end of September.”  The currency gained as much as 0.6 percent to 1.5175 per
dollar, before trading 0.1 percent up at 1.5250 by 3 p.m. in the
capital, Accra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
