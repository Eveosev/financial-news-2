The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  may raise
dong reserve ratios to manage capital flow between banks,
according to a news item posted on the central bank website,
citing governor Nguyen Van Binh.  The move would not put pressure on deposit rates and would
enable the central bank to balance funds among banks without
increasing the  money supply , Binh is quoted as saying in the
Thoi Bao Kinh Te Saigon story.  The central bank may issue t-bills to reduce dong surplus
at some banks, according to the paper, citing Binh.  The monetary authority may also remove a regulation that
currently limits banks to lend up to 80 percent of deposits,
according to the story, citing Binh.  Some banks may have surplus funds but canâ€™t lend the money
to other banks because of the regulation, Binh is quoted as
saying. The central bank will review the regulation and if it is
deemed to hinder capital flow, the regulation could be removed
permanently, the article said, citing Binh.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
