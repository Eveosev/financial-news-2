(Corrects share decline in fifth paragraph, analyst name
in seventh paragraph.)  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-
largest cement maker, fell the most in two years in Zurich
trading after reporting profit declined more than analysts
expected due to the strong Swiss franc.  Second-quarter net income fell 13 percent to 347 million
Swiss francs ($437 million) from the year earlier, missing the
373.3 million-franc average estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales dropped 11 percent to 5.49 billion
francs, less than the average estimate of 5.56 billion francs.  Chief Executive Officer Markus Akermann is fighting rising
raw material costs and the appreciation of the franc, which has
gained 18 percent against the dollar this year. Currency effects
shaved 916 million francs off sales in the quarter and reduced
operating profit by 203 million francs. That’s more than the
combined effects on revenue and profit in the previous three
quarters.  “To the best of my knowledge, we’ve never seen a currency
impact this strong,” said Martin Huesler, an analyst at
Zuercher Kantonalbank. He has a “market weight” recommendation
on the stock.  The shares fell as much as 7.7 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since March 2009. They traded at 45.51 francs,
down 5 percent, at 10:16 a.m. local time.  ‘No Sign’  The North American  construction industry  showed “no sign
of any substantial progress,” demand for construction from
European government was “subdued,” and Indian homebuilding
weakened, Holcim said.  Serge Rotzer, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, said he may cut
his estimate for Holcim’s full-year earnings per share by 10
percent to 20 percent.  Holcim said it will invest 720 million francs in  Brazil  to
tap faster growth in  Latin America . The Jona, Switzerland-based
company said it plans add a second kiln line at its Barroso
plant north of  Rio de Janeiro  and improve a rail terminal,
increasing capacity 49 percent to 7.9 million tons by 2014.  Holcim said it expects 2011 earnings before interest and
taxes, depreciation and amortization to be close to last year’s
level, excluding currency and portfolio effects. Analysts
expected Ebitda to decline to 4.41 billion francs this year from
4.99 billion francs last year, according to the average of 32
estimates.  Sales volumes in the quarter grew 2.6 percent for cement,
while they grew 7.5 percent for aggregates, and 2.5 percent for
ready-mix concrete, Holcim said.  The company said it will continue to raise prices to offset
rising costs for energy, raw materials and transportation and
will focus on managing costs. Net debt declined to 12.21 billion
francs as of June 30 from 14.08 billion francs at the end of
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
