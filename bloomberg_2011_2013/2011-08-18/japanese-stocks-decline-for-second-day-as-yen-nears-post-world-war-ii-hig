Japanese stocks fell to the lowest
in five months as the yen approached a post-World War II high,
hurting prospects for exporters’ earnings, and after Morgan
Stanley MUFG Securities Co. cut Japan’s economic forecast.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, declined
to the lowest since January 2009.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of
solar panels that gets 17 percent of its sales in the U.S., lost
2.3 percent. Minebea Co., a ball-bearing maker, tumbled 5.7
percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its profit and share
price estimates of Japanese electronic components makers.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.3 percent to 8,943.76
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index declined
1.2 percent to 767.31 with five stocks retreating for every two
that rose. Both gauges dropped to the lowest since March 15.  “The yen’s appreciation is weighing on Japanese stocks,”
said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. “The
yen and the clouded overseas economic outlook are making people
worried. Even though a panicking situation in the market has
eased, nothing has been resolved yet.”  The Topix has lost 8.8 percent this month amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis will damage the banking system and damp
demand in one of  Japan ’s biggest export markets. Japanese stocks
also fell after  Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 5 cut its rating on
U.S. government debt.  Topix Valuation  Declines in Japanese shares this month reduced the average
price of stocks in the Topix to 0.9 times book value, the lowest
level since March 2009. A level below 1 means a company’s assets
are worth more than its market capitalization.  Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities cut Japan’s 2012 economic
growth forecast to 1.3 percent from 2.9 percent following
“weakening prospects for the global economy,” according to a
report dated today.  Other report from Morgan Stanley showed the bank cut its
forecast for global growth this year, citing an “insufficient”
response to  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence
and the prospect of fiscal tightening. The bank estimates
expansion of 3.9 percent, down from a previous forecast of 4.2
percent, according to an e-mailed report dated today. A
prediction of 3.8 percent for next year is down from 4.5 percent
previously.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1
percent today. In  New York , the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent to
1,193.89 yesterday. About 18 stocks fell for every 17 that rose
on U.S. exchanges as Dell Inc. forecast weaker sales and two
Federal Reserve officials expressed concern about the amount of
stimulus being applied to the economy.  Fed Criticism  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s pledge last week
to keep  interest rates  near zero until mid-2013 was
“inappropriate policy at an inappropriate time,”  Charles Plosser , president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said
yesterday in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. Dallas President Richard Fisher
said the central bank shouldn’t enact policy to protect stock
investors. Both officials dissented from the Fed’s Aug. 9
statement.  “People are trying to identify what measures will be taken
while sentiment is worsening globally, so the market will lack
direction,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $600
million in  Tokyo  at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Falling Exports  In Japan, exports fell more than expected in July amid the
global slowdown and strengthening currency. Overseas sales
decreased 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, the  Finance
Ministry  said today in Tokyo. The median estimate of 24
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 2.6 percent
decline, after a 1.6 percent decrease in June.  Toyota lost 1.7 percent to 2,807, the lowest since January
2009. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker, slumped
2.6 percent to 2,486 yen, a level not seen since July 2009.
Kyocera slid 2.3 percent to 7,130 yen.  The yen appreciated to 76.45 yen today and touched 76.41
after the stock market closed yesterday in Tokyo, approaching
its post-World War II high of 76.25 yen reached on March 17. A
stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it cuts the value
of overseas sales.  Minebea, TDK  Electronic components makers declined after Goldman Sachs
Group cut its estimates of profits and share prices of companies
including Minebea,  TDK Corp. (6762)  and Shinko Electric Industries Co.
because of the yen’s appreciation and weakening demand. Goldman
Sachs analyst Daiki Takayama said the companies have a high risk
of cutting profit forecasts.  Minebea tumbled 5.7 percent to 313 yen, a level not seen
since February 2009. Takayama said operating profit will decline
to 16.5 billion yen ($215 million) this year, down 8.3 percent
from his earlier estimate. The bank cut its 12-month share price
target by 5.1 percent to 370 yen.  TDK slumped 4.1 percent to 3,320 yen. Shinko Electric lost
3.5 percent to 526 yen, its lowest since December 2008.  Among stocks that rose, Fast Retailing Co.,  Asia ’s biggest
clothing chain, jumped 3.3 percent to 14,850 yen, the highest
since April 2010. The company had its rating increased to
“buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, which said that the
company will benefit from increasing spending on clothes in
 China  and increase market share in  South Korea ,  Hong Kong  and
 Taiwan . The company’s operating profit will double to 247
billion yen by 2020, according to a report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
