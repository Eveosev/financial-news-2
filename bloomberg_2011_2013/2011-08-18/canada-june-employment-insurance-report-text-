The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for June released
by Statistics Canada.  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance benefits was little changed in June at 577,400,
following eight consecutive months of declines.  The number of beneficiaries was down in Ontario,  Quebec 
and British Columbia, while Newfoundland and Labrador
recorded the only notable increase.  Number of claims edges down in June  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  Following two months of small increases, the number of
initial and renewal claims edged down 1.6% in June to
233,100.  The largest percentage decrease occurred in
Newfoundland and Labrador (-24.4%), which offset a similar
increase in May. In Saskatchewan, the number of claims
declined 14.0%, partially offsetting May's increase.  At the same time, there were increases in Prince  Edward
Island  (+6.7%) and Alberta (+5.2%).  Fewer beneficiaries in Ontario, Quebec and British
Columbia  Provincially, the largest percentage decline in the
number of people receiving regular EI benefits occurred in
Ontario, where it fell by 2.7% to 169,500. This continued
the downward trend that began in October 2010.  The downward trend also continued in Quebec (-1.9%) and
British Columbia (-1.3%) in June. This was the ninth
consecutive monthly decline for both provinces. In Prince
Edward Island, the number of beneficiaries decreased by
1.3% after two months of increases.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of
beneficiaries increased 4.1%, mostly offsetting the 4.6%
decrease in May. In Manitoba, 1.2% more people received
regular benefits.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Most large centres show year-over-year declines  Between June 2010 and June 2011, the number of people
receiving regular benefits at the national level fell by
105,300 (-18.2%). Declines occurred in 129 of the 143
large centres (see map). Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, there were fewer
beneficiaries in all five large centres in June. The
fastest pace of decline occurred in St. John's (-15.8%),
continuing the trend of monthly year-over-year decreases
that began in April 2010. There were also marked
percentage declines in Corner Brook and Grand Falls-
Windsor.  The number of regular beneficiaries fell in 27 of the
33 large centres in Quebec between June 2010 and June
2011. The largest percentage declines occurred in Saint-
Georges, La Tuque and in the census metropolitan area
(CMA) of Quebec. In the Quebec CMA, the number of
beneficiaries declined 26.9% to 6,600 in June, the second
consecutive month of year-over-year declines. At the same
time,  Montreal  recorded a 22.1% decrease to 46,600,
continuing a series of consecutive months of year-over-
year declines that began in March 2010.  In Ontario, nearly all large centres posted year-over-
year declines in beneficiaries, with the largest
percentage decrease occurring in Greater Sudbury. In
Toronto, the number of beneficiaries fell 24.0% to 60,800,
the fastest pace of year-over-year declines since the
downward trend began in March 2010. Other notable
decreases occurred in Tillsonburg, Thunder Bay, Guelph,
Chatham-Kent and Belleville.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular
benefits fell in three of the four large centres in the 12
months to June. Most of the change occurred in Winnipeg,
down 27.9% to 4,800 and the 10th consecutive monthly year-
over-year percentage decrease.  In Saskatchewan, there were year-over-year declines in
all eight large centres. The largest percentage decline
occurred in Saskatoon, down 33.2% to 1,400. In Regina, it
fell 29.1% to 900, continuing the trend of monthly year-
over-year declines which started in July 2010.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres recorded fewer
beneficiaries compared with June 2010. In Calgary, the
number fell 33.5% to 9,700. In  Edmonton , it declined 30.6%
to 9,400, the largest percentage decrease since the
downward trend began in April 2010. Year-over-year
declines exceeded 35% in Camrose, Brooks, Medicine Hat,
 Grande Prairie  and Red Deer.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell
in all 25 large centres in the 12 months to June. The
largest percentage declines were in Fort St. John,
Campbell River, Kamloops,  Vancouver  and Prince George. In
Vancouver, the number of people receiving benefits fell
28.3% to 24,400, the fastest pace since the start of the
downward trend in June 2010. In Victoria, the number of
beneficiaries decreased 13.6% to 2,900.  Demographic groups  In June, the number of men receiving regular benefits
fell by 19.6% to 279,600 from 12 months earlier.  The largest rates of decline among men occurred for
those aged 25 to 54 (-21.7%) and youths under 25 (-20.1%).
Among men aged 55 and over, the number of beneficiaries
fell 12.5%.  During this year-long period, the number of women
receiving regular benefits decreased 16.0% to 194,400.  The largest rates of decline occurred among women under
25 (-20.9%), followed by those aged 25 to 54 (-17.2%). The
number of female beneficiaries aged 55 and over decreased
9.7%. For this latter age group, it was the largest of
four consecutive monthly year-over-year declines.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and characteristics of those affected by
changes in the labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data
sources provided by Service Canada and Human Resources and
Skills Development Canada. These statistics may, from time
to time, be affected by changes to the Employment
Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The number of
regular beneficiaries and the number of claims received
for May and June are preliminary. In this release, large
centres correspond to those with a population of 10,000 or
more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from June 12 to 18. This period
coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
