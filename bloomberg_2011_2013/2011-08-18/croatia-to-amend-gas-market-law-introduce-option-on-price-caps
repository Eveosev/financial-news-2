The  Croatian government  proposed
amending the law on the natural gas market, allowing the
government the possibility of capping prices for industrial
users in the future.  The new law, which will probably be approved by  Parliament ,
is aimed at protecting  Croatia â€™s economic interests and ensuring
its international competitiveness, Economy Minister Djuro
Popijac told the Cabinet today.  The government on Aug. 3 set a maximum gas price for some
industrial users to 2.13 kuna (41 cents) per cubic meter.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
