Lionel Messi  scored twice and set up
the other goal as Barcelona beat archrival Real Madrid 3-2 to
win Spanish soccer’s Super Cup.  World Player of the Year Messi got the winning goal in the
87th minute at the Camp Nou stadium last night to give La Liga
champion Barcelona a 5-4 victory over the two-match series. The
teams had drawn 2-2 in Madrid four days ago.  Barcelona also won the matchup between the league champion
and the Copa del Rey winner, the traditional curtain-raiser to
the Spanish league season, the past two years.  Messi’s defense-splitting pass set up  Andres Iniesta  for
Barcelona’s 15th-minute opener before  Cristiano Ronaldo  tied it
five minutes later.  Although Messi restored the home team’s lead in the 44th
minute, Karim Benzema made it 2-2 on the night and 4-4 overall
with nine minutes remaining. Cesc Fabregas came on as a
substitute moments later for his first appearance since
returning to his hometown club from Arsenal.  With the match headed for extra time, Messi exchanged
passes with Adriano and stretched to volley the winner inside
the near post.  Real  Madrid ’s Marcelo was then red-carded for a tackle on
Fabregas. The incident prompted a stoppage-time confrontation
between the teams and their benches that resulted in red cards
for Mesut Ozil and  David Villa , both of whom had already been
substituted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
