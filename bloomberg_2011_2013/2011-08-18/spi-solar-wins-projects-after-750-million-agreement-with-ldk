SPI Solar Inc.  won a contract to
build a 9.7 megawatt solar farm from LDK Solar Co., a Chinese
manufacturer of polysilicon wafers and modules, as part of an
agreement between the companies.  A three-year accord between SPI, a photovoltaic solar
developer, and KDC Solar LLC, a unit of Jiangxi, China-based
LDK, announced in June, made SPI the preferred contractor for a
minimum of 150 megawatts of projects. LDK agreed to provide as
much as $750 million in financing for the ventures.  The first project under the pact will supply energy to the
New Jersey headquarters of an international pharmaceuticals
company, Roseville, California-based SPI said in a  statement .
LDK and Hong Kong-based GCL Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. are the
world’s largest producers of solar wafers by capacity.  SPI has also won a contract to develop a 4.4 megawatt solar
utility in  Greece , selling power to Public Power Corp. SA, the
country’s biggest electricity producer, it said. Construction of
the park at Evros in northeastern Greece will begin in November.
SPI plans to sell the venture while it’s being built or once
it’s operating, the company said in a  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
