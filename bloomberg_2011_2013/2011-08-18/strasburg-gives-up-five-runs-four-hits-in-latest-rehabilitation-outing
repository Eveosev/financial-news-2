Washington Nationals pitcher  Stephen Strasburg  had a tough game against the Lexington Legends, having
come off three scoreless innings against the Myrtle Beach
Pelicans six days ago.  Strasburg, in his third rehabilitation game since Aug. 7,
last night gave up five runs and four hits against 11 batters in
1 2/3 innings for the Single A Hagerstown Suns, who won 9-6.  Strasburg was charged with a walk, two doubles and a single
before he struck out the first of three batters. His appearance
was cut short as he neared his 50-pitch limit.  The 23-year-old right-hander, who had surgery to repair a
ligament in his elbow 11 months ago, wants to return to the
Major League Baseball teamâ€™s roster in September.  He signed a record $15 million, four-year contract after
being the No. 1 pick in the 2009 baseball draft, then struck out
14 in his first big-league game last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
