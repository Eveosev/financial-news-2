Japan ’s bonds gained, sending 10-
year yields toward this year’s low, as the yen trading near a
postwar high dimmed the earnings outlook for exporters and
boosted demand for the relative safety of government debt.  Yields on 30-year bonds slipped to a one-week low before a
U.S. report today that may show the cost of living barely
increased, adding to signs that the world’s largest economy is
losing momentum. Yen-denominated debt gained after Treasuries
advanced in  New York  and a report that showed Japan’s exports
fell last month by more than economists forecast.  “Japan’s yields are following a further decline in U.S.
Treasury rates yesterday on concern over an economic slowdown,”
said Shinji Hiramatsu, senior investment manager in  Tokyo  at
Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. Ltd., which oversees
about $50 billion. “But it doesn’t seem like a move to
aggressively buy long-term debt from here.”  The benchmark 10-year yield decreased 2.5 basis points to
0.995 percent as of 3:06 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker, nearing this
year’s low of 0.975 percent set on Aug.9. The 1.1 percent
security due June 2021 gained 0.225 yen to 100.939 yen.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery advanced 0.32
to 142.61 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Thirty-year yields dropped 3.5 basis points, or 0.035
percentage points, to 1.955 percent, the least since Aug. 11.  U.S. 10-year yields declined five basis points to 2.17
percent yesterday. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell as much
as 1.4 percent today as the yen traded at 76.66 per dollar, near
the record high of 76.25 reached on March 17.  U.S. consumer prices, excluding volatile food and fuel
costs, climbed 0.2 percent in July, the smallest gain in three
months, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. With
the U.S. economic recovery showing signs of stress, the  Federal
Reserve  on Aug. 9 pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate  at
a record low at least through mid-2013.  Japan’s exports decreased 3.3 percent in July from a year
earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said today in Tokyo. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 2.6
percent decline, after a 1.6 percent decrease in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
