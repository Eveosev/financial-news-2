Ports in Syria are running normally
amid reports of escalating civil unrest in the country,
according to Thenamaris Ships Management Inc.  “We have contacted our P&I club, and they said Banias and
the other ports are operating normally,” said Dimitris Tsahalis, chartering manager at Athens-based Thenamaris. “Today
a gas carrier is discharging in Banias.”  Protection and indemnity is a form of marine insurance
provided by a mutual association, or club. The insurance covers
ship owners, operators and charterers for their liabilities to
third parties during vessel operations.  Syrian security forces killed at least 25 protesters
yesterday, activists said today, as U.S. President  Barack Obama 
led international calls for Bashar al-Assad to step down as the
Middle East nation’s leader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
