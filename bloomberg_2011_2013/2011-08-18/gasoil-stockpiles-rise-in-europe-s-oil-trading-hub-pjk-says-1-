Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, rose for the first time in seven weeks, according to PJK
International BV.  Gasoil inventories increased 0.6 percent to 2.37 million
metric tons in the week to today on imports from Latvia,  Norway 
and the U.S., according to PJK, a researcher based in the
Netherlands. Supplies of the fuel, which includes diesel and
heating oil, were sent to Gibraltar and Spain.  “It seems that because of the drop in prices end-users are
replenishing their stocks,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said
by telephone from Oosterhout where the company is based.  Gasoil prices declined 5.9 percent this month to $913.25 a
ton as of 4:10 p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. It reached as much as $1,000 on Aug. 1.  Gasoline stockpiles rose for the first time in five weeks,
increasing 4.7 percent to 580,000 tons, according to PJK.
Cargoes arrived from  France , Norway,  Russia  and the U.K. while
the motor fuel was shipped to Benin, Canada, Morocco, Mexico and
Nigeria.  Naphtha inventories gained for a second week, rising 16
percent to 59,000 tons on imports from Norway and Russia, PJK
data shows. That’s the highest level since July 21.  Fuel oil stockpiles advanced 1.6 percent to 701,000 tons on
imports from  Brazil ,  Finland , France,  Lithuania , Norway, Poland
and the U.K., the data shows. Imports were offset by a very
large crude carrier going to  Singapore .  Jet fuel stores declined 0.2 percent to 523,000 tons even
as supplies arrived from the United Arab Emirates.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
