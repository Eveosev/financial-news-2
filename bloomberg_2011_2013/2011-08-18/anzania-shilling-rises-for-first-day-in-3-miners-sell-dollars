Tanzania’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in three days against the dollar as some mining
companies sold the U.S. currency to pay for local costs.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 1,618.3 per dollar and
traded at 1,627.5 by 1:51 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Inflows came in from non-governmental organizations and
some mining companies supplying dollars,” Zainul Chandoo, head
of Treasury at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by
phone “There otherwise have not been any major deals; we have
had normal inflows and outflows.”  Tanzania vies with Mali to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
