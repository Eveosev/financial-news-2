Tecan Group AG (TECN) , a Swiss maker of
 laboratory equipment , rose the most in eight years in Zurich
trading after raising its forecast for sales growth this year.  Tecan climbed as much as 7.85 Swiss francs, or 14 percent,
to 64 francs, the biggest intraday gain since June 6, 2003, and
was up 10 percent as of 11:04 a.m. That pared the stock’s
decline this year to 19 percent.  The manufacturer expects full-year sales growth in local
currencies to be in the “high-single-digit percentage range,”
compared with a previous forecast of an increase in the “mid-
single” digits, Maennedorf, Switzerland-based Tecan said in a
statement today.  First-half sales rose 12 percent in local currencies,
helping offset gains in the Swiss franc, which is eroding the
value of revenue in other countries, Tecan said. Operating
profit in the period declined 9.8 percent to 20.8 million
francs, and amounted to 11.5 percent of sales. Tecan repeated a
forecast for a full-year operating margin in a range of 12
percent to 13 percent.  -- Editors: Tom Lavell, Robert Valpuesta  To contact the reporters on this story:
