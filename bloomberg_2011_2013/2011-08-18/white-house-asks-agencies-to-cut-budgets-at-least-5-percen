White House Budget Director Jack Lew
told government agencies to submit budgets with cuts of at least
5 percent and offer additional options to save at least 10
percent as policy makers look to reduce federal spending.  Offering pared-down fiscal 2013 budgets below 2011 levels
will “provide the president with the information to make the
tough choices necessary to meet the hard spending targets in
place and the needs of the nation,” Lew said in an Aug. 17
 memo .  Even as they target programs to cut, department and agency
heads should also identify programs to “double down” on if
they can boost economic growth, Lew wrote.  President  Barack Obama  is seeking to combine long-term U.S.
deficit reduction through entitlement benefit cuts and tax
increases with immediate steps to boost job growth.  He plans to press Congress for billions of dollars in new
spending to reduce unemployment as he pursues a compromise on
long-term deficit cuts. He will lay out his ideas in a speech
shortly after the Sept 5. U.S. Labor Day holiday.  As part of a deal to cut spending and raise the debt limit,
a 12-member congressional panel is charged with finding $1.5
trillion in budget savings by Nov. 23 to head off a round of
automatic, across-the-board spending cuts.  Obama last year ordered federal agencies to trim budget
requests by 5 percent as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
