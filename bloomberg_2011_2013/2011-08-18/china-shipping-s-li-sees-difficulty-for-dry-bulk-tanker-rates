China Shipping Development Co.
Chairman Li Shaode comments on the outlook for the dry-bulk and
oil-tanker markets. He spoke to reporters yesterday in  Hong Kong .  Rates outlook:  “The second half, particularly the third quarter, is
traditionally the peak season, but freight rates in the second
half of this year, including dry-bulk and oil, will have
difficulty in recovering because the supply of capacity exceeds
demand.  “We have to prepare for a relatively long period with
pressure on rates. We will control costs to cope with this.”  Fleet expansion:  “Compared with the company’s long-term development, the
volatility in the market can be short-lived. We want to have an
adjustment in the fleet structure. We will spend heavily on new
ships this and next year. The market is bad for these two years,
but we still have opportunities in 2013 and beyond. We want to
get prepared before the market recovers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
