Transit traffic through the Kenyan
port of Mombassa declined by 0.5 percent to 7,545 metric tons in
the first half, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing Kenya Ports
Authority Managing Director Gichiri Ndua.  Imports at the port fell 1.5 percent, while exports grew 15
percent, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, without providing
tonnage figures.  Rising fuel prices and debt crises in the U.S. and Europe
may slow the portâ€™s performance further, it said. Mombasa
handles cargo to and from Uganda, Burundi, South Sudan, eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
