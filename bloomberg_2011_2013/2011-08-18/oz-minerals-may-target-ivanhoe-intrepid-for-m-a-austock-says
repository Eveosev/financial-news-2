OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) , Australia’s third-
biggest copper producer by value, may target companies including
 Ivanhoe Australia Ltd. (IVA)  and Intrepid Mines Ltd., Austock Group
Ltd. said.  OZ Minerals, which had a cash balance of A$908 million
($953 million) as of June 30 and has agreed terms for a $180
million loan, may “wave as carrot” cash of around A$950
million to companies caught in general market volatility, Anna Kassianos, an Austock resources analyst, said in an e-mailed
report today.  Marengo Mining Ltd. (MGO)  and  Highlands Pacific Ltd. (HIG)  may also be
targets as Melbourne-based OZ Minerals seeks companies with a
copper resource of more than 1 million metric tons and who
operate in “palatable”  jurisdictions, Kassianos said. OZ
Minerals spokeswoman Natalie Worley was unavailable for comment
when contacted by phone.  “Given market volatility” due to concerns over sovereign
debt levels in the U.S. and  Europe , companies may be more
willing to agree to a cash deal, Kassianos, who has a ‘buy’
rating on OZ Minerals, said.  OZ Minerals, which owns the A$1.2 billion Prominent Hill
mine in South Australia, reiterated on Aug. 15 it has set aside
A$750 million in cash for potential acquisitions. The company
bought the Carrapateena project in South Australia in May for
$250 million and last year acquired about 19 percent of copper
developer Sandfire Resources Ltd. for A$100 million.  OZ Minerals fell 2.6 percent to A$11.86 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading. The stock has declined 4.7 percent over
the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
