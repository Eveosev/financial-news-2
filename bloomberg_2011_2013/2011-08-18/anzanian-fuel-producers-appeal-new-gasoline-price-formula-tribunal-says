Tanzanian fuel companies, including
British Petroleum Tanzania Ltd. and Total Tanzania Ltd., want a
new pricing formula used to reduce prices this month scrapped,
the country’s antitrust body said.  The 12 companies lodged an appeal with the Fair Competition
Tribunal of Tanzania, the tribunal said in a statement published
in the Dar es Salaam-based Daily News today.  The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority didn’t
correctly calculate the cost of supplying petroleum in Tanzania
when it introduced the formula, it said, citing the fuel
producers.  The energy-industry regulator on Aug. 12 suspended BP
Tanzania’s wholesale license for three months amid a fuel
shortage which the authority blames on producers holding back
supplies because they were unhappy with a decision to cut the
gasoline price by 9.2 percent on Aug. 3. The regulator, which
sets prices every two weeks, raised gasoline costs 5.5 percent
on Aug. 15 after international fuel prices rose and the
Tanzanian shilling weakened against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
