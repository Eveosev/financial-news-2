Xstrata Plc (XTA) ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and
 Anglo American Plc (AAL) , partners in the world’s biggest open-pit
coal mine for exports, approved a $1.3 billion expansion at the
Colombian site to boost output as prices for the fuel rise.  The expansion will increase production by 8 million metric
tons to 40 million tons annually, Xstrata, the world’s largest
exporter of power-station coal, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The companies, equal owners in the mine, will each
spend $437 million to raise their share of output to 13.3
million tons a year from 10.7 million tons.  Demand for coal is rising as China and India, the world’s
fastest-growing major economies, produce more electricity and
steel, prompting companies to increase output as prices trade
near records. Energy coal may average about $130 a ton this
year, up from $98 a ton last year, Morgan Stanley said July 26.  Construction of the Cerrejon expansion in  Colombia  will be
completed by 2013 and the mine will reach its new capacity by
2015, the companies said in separate statements.  Bumi Plc, owner of stakes in Indonesia’s biggest coal
assets, yesterday said prices will “remain strong over the
short and medium term,” citing higher demand from Asia and
 Europe .  Glencore International Plc, the largest listed commodities
trader, said in May it planned to spend $2.6 billion expanding
its Prodeco power-station coal operation in Colombia. Output
will climb to 19.9 million tons a year in 2013 from 10 million
tons last year, it said.  BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, declined 6.5
percent to close at 1,890 pence in  London  trading, the largest
drop in more than 15 months. Xstrata dropped 10 percent, the
most in more than two years, and Anglo American fell 7
percent,the most since March 2009. The U.K.’s benchmark FTSE 100
index slid 4.5 percent, the most since March 2009, amid renewed
concern global growth is slowing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
