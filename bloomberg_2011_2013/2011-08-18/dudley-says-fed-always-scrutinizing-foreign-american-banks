Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said the central bank always keeps
an eye on the performance of U.S. and foreign banks, not
monitoring one group more than the other.  Dudley spoke today in response to a question referring to a
Wall Street Journal report that U.S. regulators are stepping up
scrutiny of  Europe ’s largest lenders on concern that the
sovereign debt crisis may lead to funding problems.  The Fed is “always scrutinizing” domestic and foreign
banks in terms of capital levels, Dudley, 58, said in response
to audience questions after a speech in  Newark ,  New Jersey .  “This is standard operating procedure,” he said. “We’re
not focusing on foreign banks any more than U.S. banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
