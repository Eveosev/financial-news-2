Crude oil capped the third-largest
decline of 2011 as commodities fell around the world after
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG cut their forecasts for
global economic expansion.  Futures dropped 5.9 percent and stocks plunged after Morgan
Stanley cited an “insufficient” policy response to  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence and the prospect of
fiscal tightening. The declines accelerated after U.S.
government data showed that jobless claims rose last week.  “The most recent economic data is what’s guiding all asset
classes,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at
Deutsche Bank in Washington. “This means that just about
everything but gold is falling right now.”  Crude oil for September delivery fell $5.20 to settle at
$82.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The two
largest declines of 2011 were 8.6 percent on May 5 and 6.4
percent on Aug. 8. Futures have decreased 9.8 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement fell $3.55, or 3.2
percent, to $106.99 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The price has risen 13 percent this year.  The European benchmark’s premium to the U.S. futures
contract reached a record of $24.48 a barrel, based on closing
prices for October. Brent prices have exceeded the cost of West
Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, for a year.  Morgan Stanley estimates global economic expansion of 3.9
percent, down from a previous forecast of 4.2 percent, according
to an e-mailed report dated today. Morgan Stanley cut its  China 
growth forecast for next year and Deutsche Bank reduced its
estimates for the nation for 2011 and 2012.  Chinese Growth  China’s economic growth estimate for next year was cut to
8.7 percent from 9 percent by Morgan Stanley. The bank projects
the  U.S. economy  will increase 2.1 percent in 2012.  “China is going to grow a lot faster than the U.S. even
with the downgrade,” Sieminski said. “This will keep WTI under
greater downward pressure than Brent.”  The U.S., China and the European Union were responsible for
48 percent of global oil demand in 2010, according to BP Plc’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  U.S. jobless claims climbed by 9,000 to 408,000 in the week
ended Aug. 13, the highest in a month, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The consumer-price index increased
0.5 percent in July from the prior month, according to the
department. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general
economic index plunged to minus 30.7 this month, the lowest
since March 2009, from 3.2 in July.  ‘Extremely Sensitive’ Markets  “All of the markets are extremely sensitive to economic
news, especially when it’s negative,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. “We were
down overnight on the European debt crisis. The increase in
jobless claims, rising CPI and Philly Fed number only added to
the negative outlook.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks declined 4.5
percent to 1,140.65 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped
3.7 percent to 10,990.58 at 4:01 p.m. The dollar increased 0.7
percent to $1.4333 against the euro at 3:58 p.m. A stronger U.S.
currency reduces the appeal of dollar-denominated commodities as
an investment.  “Equities are getting pounded and the euro is falling
against the dollar,” said Stephen Schork, president of the
Villanova, Pennsylvania-based Schork Group Inc.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell 3.6 percent to
633.43. Gold, silver and coffee were the only commodities to
advance. Gold for December delivery rose 1.6 percent to $1,822
an ounce on the Comex in New York, a record settlement.  ‘The One Exception’  “The revised growth projections and weak markets are
adding to fears about demand going forward,” Bentz said.
“Almost all commodities are falling on this concern. Gold is
the one exception because it’s seen as a safe haven.”  Libyan rebels are battling forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi 
for control of the Zawiya oil refinery and say they are
advancing from the city of Misrata south toward a strategic
highway linked with Tripoli, the capital.  New York oil climbed to an intraday high of $114.83 a
barrel on May 2 as unrest spread in the  Middle East  and North
Africa. Libyan output fell 50,000 barrels, or 33 percent, to
100,000 in July, the lowest since at least 1962 based on yearly
data, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “The Libyan rebels are making big gains,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “We’re getting closer to the end of
this conflict. Once that occurs we may be surprised by how fast
output will come back.”  U.S. President  Barack Obama , joined by the leaders of the
U.K.,  France ,  Germany  and  Canada , called on Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad to leave office, saying “the time has come”
for the Syrian people to determine their future.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 844,781
contracts as of 3:27 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 674,170
contracts yesterday, 1 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.52 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
