Natural gas futures for January
delivery will be more expensive than December’s on higher gas
demand, Citigroup Inc. said.  Investors should buy the January contract and sell the
December one as the spread between the two contracts will
increase after reaching 8.8 cents on Aug. 8, the lowest level
since June 10,  Edward Morse , an analyst at Citigroup, said in a
report released Aug. 16.  The spread is among the lowest in the past 10 years at this
time of the year, he said.  “It appears that the spread typically widened late in the
summer,” said Morse. Prices will rise as demand increases,
“particularly in January when demand is the highest,” he said.  Natural gas for December delivery fell 3.9 cents to $4.274
per million British thermal units at 9:55 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The January contract declined 3.9 cents to
$4.378.  To contact the reporter on this story:
