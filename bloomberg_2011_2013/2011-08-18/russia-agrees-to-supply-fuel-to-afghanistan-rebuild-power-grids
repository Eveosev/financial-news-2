Russia ’s government agreed to supply
Afghanistan with oil products and other forms of fuel with the
help of non-state companies, according to an accord signed by
officials from both countries in Moscow today.  OAO Lukoil, Russia’s largest non-state oil company, OAO
Gazprom Neft and TNK-BP have held talks on shipping oil products
to Afghanistan, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko told
reporters in Moscow today.  The nation expects to receive 500,000 tons of Russian
refined products a year, said Anwar-Ul-Haq Ahady, Afghanistan’s
minister of commerce and industries.  The oil shipments won’t be used to meet the needs of the
U.S. military because it’s self-sufficient in fuel supplies,
Shmatko said.  Russia’s Energy Ministry also agreed to help  Afghanistan 
modernize and expand its electricity network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
