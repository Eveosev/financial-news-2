U.S. Gulf oil premiums surged after
the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to Brent
moved toward a record.  The gap between October contracts widened $1.67 to $24.54 a
barrel, below the Aug. 12 intraday record of $25.54. When Brent
increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur
U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced against
the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained $1.40 to $26 a barrel over WTI
at 2:09 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the widest gap since at least 1991. The
premium has increased 27 percent since the  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
said July 13 it temporarily shut a portion of its Heavy
Louisiana Sweet crude pipeline for tests.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $1.10 to $22.75 a
barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened $1.30 to $22 while Poseidon gained $1.25 to $21.75
a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $2 to $20.25 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 7 cents to 80 cents.
Thunder Horse strengthened $1 to $26.50 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude widened 30 cents to $15 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select increased 90 cents
to $13.40 a barrel. Yesterday the grade narrowed to the smallest
discount to WTI in more than a year.  Demand for the grade has increased as Midwest refiners
boost processing rates to capture a fourfold surge in the profit
from turning crude into gasoline and diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
