China ’s government will give  Rwanda 
100 million yuan ($15.7 million) in grants and loans to
encourage economic development and trade with China, Vice
Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said.  The East African country will receive half the amount as a
grant and the remaining 50 million yuan as a five-year,
interest-free loan, Gao told officials and reporters today in
Kigali, Rwanda’s capital. Trade between the two countries
doubled to $76.4 million in the first half from a year earlier,
he said.  “The economic cooperation between Rwanda and China has been
growing rapidly,” Gao said.  Chinese investment in  Africa  may grow 70 percent to $570
billion by 2015 from 2009 as the country seeks to acquire
resources on the continent, according to Standard Bank Group
Ltd., the continent’s biggest lender. Bilateral trade will reach
$300 billion by 2015, double the level in 2010, it said in
February.  China also plans to build a government administrative
building, a 25-kilometer (16-mile) road in Kigali and provide
medical devices and pharmaceuticals to Rwanda, as well as
providing support for exports to China, Gao said.  “On top of the 60 percent tariff-free treatment China
already has granted to Rwandan exports to China, we will
continue to help you to publicize and promote your products to
the Chinese market,” he said.  Rwanda doubled the size of its economy in the nine years to
2010 as it recovers from a 1994 genocide in which 800,000 mainly
ethnic Tutsis died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
