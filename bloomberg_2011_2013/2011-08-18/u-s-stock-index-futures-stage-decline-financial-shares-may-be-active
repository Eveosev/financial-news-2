U.S. stock futures retreated before
reports that may show initial jobless claims rose, an index of
leading economic indicators declined and manufacturing in the
Philadelphia area cooled.  Financial shares may be active after the Wall Street
Journal said U.S. regulators are stepping up scrutiny of
European banks’ local operations on concern that the region’s
sovereign debt crisis may lead to funding problems. NetApp Inc.
tumbled 13 percent after the maker of data-storage products
reported first-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
slid 1.8 percent to 1,168.1 at 10:14 a.m. in  London . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures retreated 179 points, or 1.6 percent,
to 11,202.  The  S&P 500  rose as much as 28 percent after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke foreshadowed on Aug. 27 of last
year a second round of so-called quantitative easing. The
central bank finished the program of asset purchases at the end
of June. Bernanke may announce policy intentions at a conference
in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, on Aug. 26.  “Economic data hasn’t been that great,” said Louis de
Fels, a Paris-based  money manager  at Raymond James Asset
Management International, which oversees $30 billion worldwide.
“Recovery isn’t as strong as expected. The market will remain
uncertain until Jackson Hole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
