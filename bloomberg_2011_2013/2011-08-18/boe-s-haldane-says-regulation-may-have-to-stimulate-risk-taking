Andrew Haldane , the  Bank of
England ’s executive director for financial stability, said
policy makers may have to use regulation to help boost risk
taking if banks curtail lending and hurt growth.  “As long as aversion to risk taking is causing financial
congestion, growth (like traffic) will remain sluggish,”
Haldane said in a  research paper  released by the central bank in
London today. “Macro-prudential policy may have a role to play
in shouldering the heavy burden of damaged balance sheets and
diminished risk appetites.”  Haldane’s comments come amid the U.K. government’s shake-up
of bank rules, which will invest the Bank of England with
control of financial regulation. The central bank’s interim
Financial Policy Committee recommended in June that banks take
the opportunity of periods of “strong earnings” to build up
capital. As well as helping institutions to weather losses, it
could also help them increase risk taking, Haldane said.  “The FPC, like the Monetary Policy Committee, needs to act
symmetrically in response to these developments,” he said.
“Its job is to cushion the fall as well as arrest the rise in
credit and debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
