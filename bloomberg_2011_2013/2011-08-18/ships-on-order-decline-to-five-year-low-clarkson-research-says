The number of new ships on order
fell for a 26th straight month to the lowest level since April
2006, according to  Clarkson Research Services Ltd. , a unit of
the worldâ€™s largest shipbroker.  There are 6,849 vessels contracted at shipyards, with
tanker orders at the lowest level since February 2004, London-
based Clarkson said in a monthly report today. Bulk-carrier
investments declined to $78.1 million, the least since 2003, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
