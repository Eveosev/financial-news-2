Red River Computer Co., a closely
held reseller of computer products, agreed to pay $2.3 million
to resolve allegations it violated the  False Claims Act  in its
dealings with federal agencies.  Red River, based in Claremont, New Hampshire, committed the
violations by failing to follow contracts it had with, among
others, the Defense Department, Commerce Department, Interior
Department, Environmental Protection Agency, the Library of
Congress and the General Services Administration, the Justice
Department said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company agreed in its equipment contracts to obtain
service support from Oracle America Inc.’s Sun Microsystems and
failed to do so, according to the government. Red River also
said it would provide  Panasonic Corp (6752) .-branded memory for
computers and substituted another product without informing its
federal customers, the Justice Department said.  Anna Wehberg, a spokeswoman for the company, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
