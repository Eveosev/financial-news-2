Is  Gary Locke , the first ethnically Chinese U.S. ambassador to China, a traitor to his Chinese heritage? China’s editorialists, bloggers and microbloggers have debated this question in various forms, and within various forums, since President  Barack Obama   nominated Locke  in March 2011. But the discussion has reached a new intensity with Locke’s recent  arrival in Beijing , producing a remarkable degree of public introspection on attitudes toward the Chinese race, and Chinese self-identity. Locke is a third-generation American of Chinese heritage, but in the eyes of many Chinese, he is a returning son. The Chinese media and public follow so-called “overseas Chinese” -- politicians like Locke, intellectuals like  Amy Chua , artists like architect  I.M. Pei  and musicians like  Yo Yo Ma  -- with passion. The Chinese media, both proud and insecure, use their accomplishments as benchmarks for measuring  China ’s standing in the world. The successes of these overseas Chinese are claimed as Chinese successes. In October 1997, the Chinese Communist Party granted Locke, who was then the newly-elected governor of Washington State, a  private audience  with then-president  Jiang Zemin . This was a rare and unusual honor for a U.S. governor from a minor (from the Chinese perspective) state. With his new position as the U.S. ambassador to China, many Chinese hope (and believe) that this returning son will remember his origins when considering U.S. interests against competing Chinese ones. The nationalist, state-owned Global Times newspaper  repeated  a commonly held sentiment in China today: “Locke's Chinese origins might gain him some advantages in understanding China's public opinion, which is not necessarily always reserved and mild.” In an unsigned editorial in Southern Metropolis Daily, the editors  agreed  with the Global Times: “ Gary Locke  has a natural cultural advantage in the problem of sharing values between China and the U.S. The two countries could take this opportunity.” But equally common is a harsh counterpoint to this optimistic point-of-view: Locke is an (American) wolf in (Chinese) sheep’s clothing who will overcompensate for his ethnic background by coming down harder on China than, perhaps, even a Caucasian U.S. ambassador. And, because of his Chinese face, he can accomplish his nefarious goals more efficiently. The prestigious, highly influential and government-owned Guangming Daily  wrote : China has 55 officially-recognized  minority ethnicities , but 92 percent of the Chinese public claims a Han Chinese background. Such homogenized racial identity isn’t unusual in  East Asia ; Korea and  Japan  are even less diversified. What is unusual in China, however, is the degree to which majority racial attitudes are discussed and dissected in private homes and, when the occasion arises, in the Chinese media. Race relations in American politics often provide inspiration for such talk. For instance, President Obama’s candidacy and election  stirred much public soul-searching  on whether or not a Chinese minority could ever ascend to the top of the Chinese Communist Party. (The most common answer: "No.") But Locke’s new position as U.S. ambassador to China strikes a deeper chord with the Chinese than Obama's presidency. It has forced a tradition-bound East Asian society to question the global reach of its homogenized self-image. On August 16, Wu Xianghong, a business columnist with the Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolitan Daily -- China’s most important independent newspaper -- published a remarkable essay. In it, Wu  identified  a peculiar type of Chinese racism: This kind of racialist thinking influences Chinese perceptions of Locke. For example, a popular pejorative is to refer to a Chinese person who has adopted Western values as a "banana": white on the inside and yellow on the outside. Wu suggested that some media representatives have recently contended that: “he who is a 'banana man' will be even more anti-China than a full blooded American.” Wu further explained that some Chinese, “expect Gary Locke to be more familiar with Chinese people and to be better than any other American ambassador.” Of this, he expresses contempt: The racialist approach to Locke is not pervasive in China. On the popular microblogs, some netizens say that Locke is first and foremost an American. A user of the Sina Weibo microblog,  Nico ever , tweeted: Still, for all of the talk about Locke's affinities and opportunities, he will likely remain a charged figure for the Chinese to measure themselves against. Late last week, a Chinese-American businessman  photographed Locke  wearing a backpack while buying his own coffee at a Starbucks in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Chinese microbloggers, bloggers and editorialists jumped at the chance to contrast Locke’s no-frills independence while traveling with the grandiose entourages that accompany even the lowliest Chinese officials. Liu Runhua, director of the Shenzhen Civil Affairs Bureau,  tweeted  on Sina Weibo: However, not every commentator on the photo was as admiring. Some suggested that Locke’s entourage-free travel reflected the U.S. government’s financial problems. And, perhaps more damaging, some suggested that Locke’s no-frills persona is fake, and even calculated. “The performance of Gary Locke is both a result of his personal quality and a type of PR,”  wrote  Dou Hanzhang, a former journalist with the state-owned  Xinhua  news service on Sina Weibo. Soon though, the discussion will likely return from the semiotics of Locke's backpack to the larger question of Chinese identity and achievement. An Puruo (the pen name of Walter Huang, a well-known U.S.-based Chinese investor and writer) used the story of Locke’s immigrant grandparents in America to reflect upon the difficulties of China's migrant workers today -- especially their struggles to provide their children with a strong education. In  Shanghai , for example, migrant children must attend specially designated migrant schools; they do not have access to the city’s superior, resident-only educational system. An’s  reflections  are poignant, and pointed: If the discussion over Locke’s American ambassadorship is any indication, China’s netizens are thinking about him as a symbol of equality obtained, and equality denied. His Chinese race certainly plays a role in generating this attention, but it is quickly yielding far more interesting narratives. In contemporary China, at least, that qualifies as "post-racial."
