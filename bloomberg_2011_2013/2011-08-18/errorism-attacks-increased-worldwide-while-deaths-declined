The number of worldwide terrorism
attacks rose to 11,604 in 2010, up by more than 5 percent from
the 10,969 the previous year, according to an annual State
Department report released today.  While the number of attacks increased, the number of deaths
dropped by almost 14 percent to 13,186, the report said. The
number of deaths has been dropping steadily since 2007, when
22,719 people died from terrorist attacks.  Still, terrorism last year claimed 49,901 victims who were
killed, injured or kidnapped, it said.  In  Afghanistan , terrorist attacks jumped by 55.6 percent
last year to 3,307, compared with 2,125 in 2009. In Iraq,
attacks rose to 2,688 from 2,458, the report said.  Those statistics, compiled by the National Counterterrorism
Center, are part of the annual country-by-country report on
terrorism released by the State Department.  More than 75 percent of the world’s terrorist attacks and
deaths took place in  South Asia  and the Near East, the report
said. Those regions together accounted for 8,960 attacks and
9,960 deaths.  Offering a “strategic assessment” of the terrorist threat
worldwide, the report said al-Qaeda remained “the preeminent
terrorist threat to the United States in 2010.”  While the “core” al-Qaeda group, based in  Pakistan , has
become weaker, its affiliates have grown stronger, the report
said. Those affiliates include al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, responsible for the attempted Christmas day airplane
bombing in 2009 on a flight that originated in Amsterdam and was
approaching Detroit.  World Cub Bombings  Similarly, al-Shabaab, a militant group in East Africa,
also gained strength in 2010, when it conducted its first major
attack outside of Somalia. It claimed responsibility for the
twin suicide bombings that killed 76 people in  Uganda  during the
 World Cup .  “Al-Shabaab’s widening scope of operations, safe haven in
Somalia and ability to attract Western militants, made it a
continuing threat to U.S. interests in the region,” the report
said.  In what the report described as a “troubling trend,”
English-speaking militants increasingly used online venues such
as chat rooms and video-sharing platforms. It cited the case of
five Pakistani Americans contacted by a Taliban recruiter
through YouTube who encourage one another to travel to Pakistan
to train for warfare against the U.S.  Other groups, the report said, have grown weaker. Al-Qaeda
in  Iraq  “continued to be politically marginalized as its
constituency dwindled further,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
