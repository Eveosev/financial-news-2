OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia â€™s
largest mining company, fell the most in a week after copper
dropped as estimates showed inventories of the metal in China
may have rebounded.  The shares retreated 3 percent to 6,504 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their biggest fall since Aug. 8.  Copper futures for December delivery slid 6.6 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.987 a pound on the Comex in  New York . Inventories
may have gained by about 100,000 tons since June to 400,000
tons, according to estimates from traders and analysts in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
