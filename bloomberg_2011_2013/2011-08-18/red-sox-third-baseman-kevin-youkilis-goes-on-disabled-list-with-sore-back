Kevin Youkilis  was placed on the 15-
day disabled list with a sore back, another blow to a Boston Red
Sox offense that has 18 hits in the past four games.  The three-time Major League Baseball All-Star has hit .181
with four home runs, eight runs batted in and 15 strikeouts in
his last 20 games, dating back to July 23. Manager Terry Francona announced the move yesterday, according to team
spokeswoman Leah Tobin.  The team is also without seven-time All-Star  David Ortiz ,
who is expected to miss a week with bursitis in his right heel,
according to the team website.  The Red Sox had five runs and nine hits while going 1-2 in
a series against the  Tampa Bay Rays , and four runs and nine hits
in a 4-3 win over the Kansas City Royals last night. Boston,
which hasnâ€™t won the American League East since 2007, is 75-48,
a half-game behind the  New York Yankees .  Third baseman Youkilis, who helped Boston win World Series
titles in 2004 and 2007, has hit .291 with 129 home runs in
eight seasons. His .266 batting average and .380 on-base
percentage this year are his lowest since he played 72 games as
a rookie in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
