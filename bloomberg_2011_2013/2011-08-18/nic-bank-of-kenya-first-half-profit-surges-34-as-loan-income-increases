NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , a Kenyan lender, said
first-half profit jumped 34 percent as earnings from loans
increased.  Net income climbed to 1.1 billion shillings ($11.8 million)
in the six months through June, from 818 million shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based bank said in a statement e-
mailed by the city’s stock exchange today. Net interest income,
the money banks earn from interest charges on loans, grew 33
percent to 1.93 billion shillings, it said.  Shares in NIC Bank rose for the second day, climbing 3.1
percent to 33.75 shillings as of 11:22 a.m. in Nairobi.  “The results are appealing in that they indicate an all-
rounded improvement in performance,” Nairobi-based Dyer & Blair
Investment Bank Ltd. said today in an e-mailed note to clients.
“We, however, expect a tougher second half for the banking
sector resulting from a tightening liquidity environment.”  Kenya ’s central bank raised its overnight lending rate to
17.89 percent today from 15.68 percent yesterday, according to
figures published on its website.  The bank, based in Nairobi, began imposing a penalty on
borrowing at its overnight discount window on Aug. 15 to tighten
its monetary policy. The bank previously applied its key lending
rate, currently 6.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
