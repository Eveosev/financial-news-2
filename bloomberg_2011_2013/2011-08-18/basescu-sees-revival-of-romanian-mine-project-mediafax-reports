Romanian President Traian Basescu
urged the government to hold new talks on the “division of
benefits” to revive the stalled Rosia Montana gold mine
project, newswire Mediafax reported.  Romania ’s government, which has a minority stake in the
gold mine controlled by  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU) , would benefit
from the project as the price of gold has increased over the
past five years, the news service quoted Basescu as saying today
in the southeastern town of Sulina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
