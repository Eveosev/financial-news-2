(Corrects size of  S&P 500 ’s four-week drop in fifth
paragraph.)  U.S. stock futures slid, indicating
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend its largest four-week
losing streak since 2009, and oil sank on speculation the global
economy is stalling. The yen and Swiss franc weakened on concern
Japan and Switzerland will weaken their currencies.  S&P 500 Index futures expiring in September declined 0.5
percent as of 8:08 a.m. in Tokyo. Nikkei 225 Stock Average
futures slipped 0.2 percent in Chicago. Crude lost 0.7 percent
in  New York . Gold increased 0.6 percent, a sixth day of gains,
and silver climbed 1.8 percent. The yen slid 0.4 percent to
76.85 per dollar after rallying last week to a post-World War II
record and the franc lost 0.3 percent against the U.S. currency.  The four-week rout has wiped out more than $8 trillion in
global equity values and dragged the MSCI All-Country World
Index down 19 percent from its May 2 high. Central bankers from
around the world will meet in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, this week
amid record-low yields on U.S. Treasuries that show traders
expect Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to signal the
central bank will begin a third-round of asset purchases to
boost the faltering economic recovery.  “A lot of the traders and investors will wait to see what
comes out of the Fed meeting in Wyoming this weekend,” Don
Williams, chief investment officer at Platypus Asset Management
Ltd. in Sydney, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“We’ve had three very violent weeks so it’s more likely that
we’ll get a consolidation week this week.”  The S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,123.53 on Aug. 19,
completing a four-week, 16 percent losing streak. A closing
level of 1,090.88 would bring the index to a 20 percent decline
since April 29, meeting the common definition of a  bear market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
