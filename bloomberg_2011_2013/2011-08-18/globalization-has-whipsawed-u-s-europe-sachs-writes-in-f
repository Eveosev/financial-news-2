Both the U.S. and European economies
are being “whipsawed” by globalization, and the failure of
governments to cope with that lies behind the collapse of market
confidence in the euro area and America, said Jeffrey Sachs, who
heads the Earth Institute at  Columbia University .  Writing in the Financial Times, Sachs said employment in
the U.S. and Europe in the early years of the century was held
up only by housing construction, fueled by low  interest rates 
and reckless deregulation.  Jobs for low-skilled workers in manufacturing, and
investment in industry, have been lost to Asian competition,
while proving a bonanza for the super-rich, who have been able
to invest in highly profitable projects in emerging economies,
he said.  The poor are hurt twice, first by global market forces,
then by the ability of the rich to park money at low taxes in
hideaways round the world, Sachs wrote.  An improved fiscal policy would expand investment in human
and infrastructure capital; cut wasteful spending on misguided
military adventures such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen; and
balance budgets in the medium-term, partly through tax increases
on high personal incomes and international corporate profits
that are shielded by loopholes and overseas  tax havens , Sachs
concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
