Spending by non-residents in  Greece 
increased 12.6 percent in the first half of the year from a year
earlier as the number of tourist arrivals increased.  The number of non-resident visits rose 13.9 percent between
January and June, compared with the first six months of 2010,
the Bank of Greece said in a  statement  posted on its website
today.  The improvement in the  tourism industry  helped narrow the
country’s current account deficit, which decreased 258 million
euros ($371 million) to 1.58 billion euros in the first half,
according to the statement.  Tourism accounts for about 16 percent of Greece’s gross
domestic product, according to the London-based  World Travel and
Tourism Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
