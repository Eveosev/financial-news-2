JA Solar Holdings Co., the world’s
largest maker of solar power cells, led industry shares lower
today after reporting a second-quarter loss that was wider than
analysts expected.  JA Solar’s American depositary receipts declined as much as
47 cents, or 12 percent, to $3.38 and the Shanghai-based company
was down 15 cents to $3.70 at 11:03 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. Jiangsu, China-based Suntech Power Holdings Co. fell as
much as 9 percent to $5.56 a share. The Standard & Poore’s 500
Index was down 4.2 percent today.  JA Solar reported a second-quarter loss of $35.4 million,
or 22 cents a share, compared with net income of $28.9 million,
or 18 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. Analysts had expected a loss of about 19.5 cents, the
average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our gross margin and bottom line have been impacted by
worse-than-anticipated market conditions and inventory
provisions,” JA Solar Chief Executive Officer Peng Fang said in
the statement. Policy changes in Germany and  Italy  that reduced
incentives for solar caused a “market disruption” that reduced
sales and profitability.  “You have to be concerned about solar markets on a macro
basis with the overcapacity that’s pushing down prices and
increasing difficulties with financing,” said Paul Clegg, an
analyst at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. “This selloff is
about de-risking portfolios.”  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., a China-based maker of
solar panels, fell as much as 10 percent to $5.61 a share and
Hanwha SolarOne Co. slipped as much as 11 percent to $3.96 a
share. The Bloomberg Global Leaders Solar Index of 37
manufacturers was down 5.6 percent to 75.55, extending a 24
percent rout this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
