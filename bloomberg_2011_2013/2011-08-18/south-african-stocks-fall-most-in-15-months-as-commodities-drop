South Africa ’s stock gauge fell to
the lowest in a week as concern about global growth pushed
commodity prices lower.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index slumped 3 percent to
29,288.86 at 5 p.m. in Johannesburg. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, slumped 4.9 percent. Anglo
American Plc, which makes up 9 percent of the South African
market, fell 4 percent, the most in more than a week, as copper
led a decline in commodity markets on concern that slower
economic growth will weaken demand for raw materials.  Morgan Stanley revised its growth forecast for this year to
3.9 percent, down from a previous forecast of 4.2 percent,
citing an “insufficient” policy response to  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis, weakened confidence and the prospect of fiscal
tightening. Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
unexpectedly contracted in August by the most in more than two
years as orders plunged and factories shed workers.  “The markets are selling off, we’re at the lows of the day
and they are selling off on low volumes so it doesn’t seem as if
there is much conviction in it,” Doug Blatch, head of equity
trading at Investec Asset Management, said by phone from  Cape
Town .  To contact the reporter on this story:
