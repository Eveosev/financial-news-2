The following is the text
of  Canada 's wholesale trade report for June from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales rose 0.2% in June to $47.8 billion
following a 2.0% advance in May. In June, four of the
seven subsectors, representing about half of the total
wholesale sales, posted gains.  After removing the effect of price changes, wholesale
sales in volume terms declined 0.5% in June. This
primarily reflected higher prices for the imported
products sold by wholesalers. This was partly attributable
to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the
American dollar during the month.  In June, higher sales in the agricultural supplies and
the metal service centres industries were partially offset
by lower sales in several other industries.  Sales of agricultural supplies continue to increase  In dollar terms, the miscellaneous subsector (+3.5%)
registered the highest increase in June. This increase
reflects higher sales in the agricultural supplies
industry (+15.1%). Wholesalers in this industry have been
benefiting from strong global demand and increasing prices
of fertilizer.  On the strength of the metal service centres industry
(+6.9%), the building material and supplies subsector rose
2.1% in June following two consecutive declines.  Other subsectors that reported growth were farm
products (+6.3%) and food, beverages and tobacco products
(+0.2%).  The largest decline in June occurred in the machinery,
equipment and supplies subsector (-1.9%). Almost all of
the industries in this subsector reported lower sales.  The personal and household goods subsector fell 1.7%.
Sales in this subsector have been relatively flat since
the beginning of 2010.  The motor vehicle and parts subsector declined 0.5%,
mainly reflecting a 2.0% decrease in the new motor vehicle
parts and accessories industry.  Sales up in most provinces  Wholesale sales were up in eight provinces in June.  Wholesalers in  Alberta  contributed the most to the
increase in dollar terms, followed by wholesalers in
Saskatchewan.  In Alberta, sales increased 3.0% to $5.9 billion in
June. This increase was mainly the result of higher sales
in the building material and supplies and the
miscellaneous subsectors.  Both Saskatchewan and Manitoba showed gains of 3.6% in
June, reflecting higher sales in the agricultural supplies
industry.  Declines were observed in Ontario (-0.9%) and British
Columbia (-1.9%).  Inventories up slightly  Inventories increased 0.1% in June to $56.1 billion.
Increases were reported by wholesalers in 15 of the 25
industries, led by pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies
(+1.0%), new motor vehicle parts and accessories (+1.2%),
and metal service centres (+1.3%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio remained unchanged at 1.18
in June.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time
in months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to
remain at their current level.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
current dollars, unless otherwise noted.  Wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by
deflating current dollar values using import and industry
product price indexes. Since many of the goods sold by
wholesalers are imported, fluctuations in the value of the
Canadian dollar can have an important influence on the
prices of goods bought and sold by wholesalers.  The wholesale sales series in chained (2002) dollars is
a chained Fisher volume index with 2002 as the reference
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
