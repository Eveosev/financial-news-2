Taiwan ’s Cabinet proposed to widen
the central government budget deficit to NT$210 billion ($7.25
billion) next year from a projected NT$142.6 billion in 2011.  Under the plan, revenue in 2012 is expected to rise by 5.1
percent to NT$1.73 trillion, with spending climbing 8.4 percent
to NT$1.94 trillion, the Cabinet’s  Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics  said in a statement today. The Cabinet
will submit the budget proposal to parliament by the end of
August for approval, it said.  The central government’s revenue this year is forecast to
reach NT$1.65 trillion, with spending of NT$1.79 trillion,
resulting in a deficit of NT$142.6 billion, the statement said.  Taiwan’s economy grew at a 4.88 percent pace in the second
quarter from a year earlier, according to preliminary data from
the statistics bureau. That’s the slowest pace since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
