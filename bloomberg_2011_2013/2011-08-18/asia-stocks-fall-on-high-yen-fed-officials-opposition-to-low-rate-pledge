Asian stocks fell for the first time
in four days after two Federal Reserve officials questioned the
amount of stimulus being applied to the U.S.  economy and as the
yen rose toward a post-World War II high.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 83 percent of
sales overseas, lost 2.6 percent in Tokyo as the yen’s advance
threatened the earnings outlook for  Japan ’s exporters.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, dropped
2.4 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothing exporter, declined
2.3 percent in Hong Kong. HSBC Holdings Plc,  Europe ’s largest
lender by market value, slipped 2 percent after the Wall Street
Journal reported U.S. regulators are stepping up scrutiny of
European banks operating in the country.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.7 percent to 123.21 as
of 7:51 p.m. in Tokyo. More than two stocks dropped for each
that advanced on the gauge, which gained 2.8 percent in the past
three days as higher earnings by Asian companies offset concern
over Europe’s debt crisis and a U.S. economic recovery that may
be weakening.  “The fear is that if you remove all stimulatory measures,
the  U.S. economy  may sink,” said Jason Teh, who helps manage
about $3 billion at Investors Mutual Ltd. in Sydney. “The U.S.
economy is so important for global growth, and so talk about
whether there’s going to be more stimulus or less stimulus will
have an impact on the perception of stock-market investors.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.3 percent and
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index dropped 1.3 percent.  Korea Outlook Cut  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  sank 1.7 percent, extending
losses after Morgan Stanley said the nation’s economy may grow
less than previously forecast because of a “correction” in
domestic consumption.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 2.1
percent today. In  New York , the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent
yesterday, erasing earlier gain after Dell Inc. forecast weaker
sales.  Honda fell 2.6 percent to 2,486 yen in Tokyo and Sony lost
2.4 percent to 1,646 yen. Esprit declined 2.3 percent to
HK$21.30 in Hong Kong.  Technology stocks were the second-biggest drag on the Asia-
Pacific gauge today as Samsung Electronics Co., which gets a
fifth of its sales from “America,” slumped 5.7 percent to
709,000 won in Seoul.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , which gets 30 percent
of its revenue in North America, fell 6.1 percent to 58,400 won.  LG Display Co., which receives more than 90 percent of its
revenue from overseas, retreated 8.5 percent to 19,350 won after
Shinhan Investment Corp. lowered its share-price estimate by 19
percent, predicting the company’s operating loss will widen in
the third quarter.  ‘Inappropriate Policy’  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-largest
computer-memory chipmaker, plunged 12 percent to 17,200 won.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s pledge last week
to keep  interest rates  near zero until mid-2013 was
“inappropriate policy at an inappropriate time,”  Charles Plosser , president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg radio interview.  Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said the central bank
shouldn’t enact policy to protect stock investors. Both
officials dissented from the Fed’s Aug. 9 statement.  ‘Sentiment Worsening’  “People are trying to identify what measures will be taken
while sentiment is worsening globally, so the market will lack
direction,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600
million in  Tokyo  at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Concerns persist that the yen may strengthen further.”  Japan’s exporters fell as the yen appreciated to 76.66 yen
today and touched 76.41 after the stock market closed yesterday
in Tokyo, approaching its post-World War II high of 76.25 yen
reached on March 17. A stronger yen hurts exporters because it
cuts the value of overseas sales.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 5.1 percent by the S&P
500 and 13.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.5 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12 times for the S&P 500 and 9.8 times
for the Stoxx 600.  HSBC, which gets about 20 percent of revenue from North
America, lost 2 percent to HK$68.05. The Federal Reserve Bank of
New York has been holding talks with Europe’s largest lenders
operating in the U.S. on concern that the region’s sovereign
debt crisis may lead to funding problems.  Commodity Stocks  Commodity stocks dropped as copper futures fell in New York
and crude oil for September delivery dropped as much as 0.6
percent today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company and
Australia’s largest oil producer, lost 1.8 percent to A$39.10 in
Sydney and rival Rio Tinto Group declined 1.5 percent to
A$73.34.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil
and gas producer, slid 2.4 percent to A$36.87 and Japanese oil
explorer Inpex Corp. sank 2.3 percent to 498,500 yen in Tokyo.  Esso Malaysia Bhd., an oil refiner and retailer, tumbled 19
percent to 4.03 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur  after Manila-based San
Miguel Corp. agreed to buy Exxon Mobil Corp.’s controlling stake
at a discount. The largest Philippine food and beverage company
said yesterday it will acquire Exxon’s entire 65 percent stake
in Esso Malaysia Bhd. for about $206 million, or 3.50 ringgit
per share.  San Miguel, which is also buying two other Exxon units in
Malaysia for a combined $403 million, gained 2.4 percent to 128
pesos.  “I was surprised by the low price,” said Ang Kok Heng,
who oversees $292 million as chief investment officer at Phillip
Capital Management Sdn. “It’s just above its net asset value.”  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., the most valuable
exchange company, climbed 3.6 percent to HK$147.60, after
earlier having its biggest intraday advance since June 2009. The
company said it’s in venture talks with  China ’s two stock
exchanges a day after Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  unveiled plans to
boost cross-border investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
