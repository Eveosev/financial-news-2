Solar Trust of America, the
developer of the world’s largest solar-power plant, will switch
technologies to photovoltaic equipment from concentrated solar
for the first 500-megawatt phase of the facility near Blythe,
 California , the company said today in an e-mailed statement. The
change was largely motivated by “improved market conditions”
for photovoltaic devices, which have plunged in price per
kilowatt-hour in recent years, Solar Trust said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
