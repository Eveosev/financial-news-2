LDK Solar Co., a Chinese maker of
polysilicon and solar cells, fell 16 percent in late trading
after the company cut its forecast and said it would write down
as much as $60 million in inventory.  The company’s shares fell $1.07 to $5.50 at 5:17 p.m.,
after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.  LDK Solar expects to report revenue of $480 million to $500
million in the second quarter, down from an earlier forecast of
$710 million to $760 million, the Xinyu-based company said today
in a statement. Revenue for the year will be in the range of
$2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, down from $3.5 billion to $3.7
billion.  “The significant drop in market price for wafers and
modules during the second quarter” drove down gross margins to
between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent in the second quarter and
prompted LDK to write down between $55 million and $60 million
in inventory, according to the statement.  Panel shipments are expected to be in a range of 75
megawatts to 80 megawatts, down from an earlier forecast of 200
megawatts to 220 megawatts. Shipments for the year will be
between 600 megawatts and 700 megawatts, compared with 750
megawatts to 800 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
