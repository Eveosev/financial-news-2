The yen rallied to its strongest
level against the dollar since World War II as investors sought
refuge from a slowing global recovery.  “The global slowdown led by that in the U.S. and the
European sovereign-debt crisis have been weighing on global
stock markets and contributing to yen strength,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in
Greenwich, Connecticut. “It’s not an independently strong yen.
There are so many factors.  The yen touched 75.95 per dollar, the strongest postwar
level, before trading at 76.18 at 10:26 a.m. in  New York ,
compared with 76.58 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
