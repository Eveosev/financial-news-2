The  Bank of Canada  bought C$665
million ($672 million) of securities for one day, the third such
transaction since last week.  The central bank announced the purchase, aimed to keep
overnight lending rates close to its current target of 1
percent, on its  website  today from Ottawa. Today’s so-called
special purchase and resale agreement follows ones worth C$375
million on Aug. 11 and C$305 million on Aug. 10.  Before this month, the bank hadn’t made a SPRA transaction
since Dec. 1, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
