Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
second worst-performing currency in the last month, climbed for
a second day against the dollar as foreign investors bought the
local currency to participate in a sale of three-year bonds.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.4 percent to 2,775 per dollar at 12:46 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Uganda sold 95 billion shillings ($34 million) of 10.25
percent bonds due 2014 yesterday, the central bank said. The
yield climbed to 15.776 percent, the highest since November
2008, compared with 11.617 percent at the last sale on March 3.
Borrowing costs are rising as a surge in food and fuel prices
pushed inflation to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in
July from 15.7 percent in June.  “Yesterday’s sale of the bond attracted some dollar
inflows and resulted in some gains,” Ahmed Kalule, the head of
 currency trading  at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by phone
from Kampala. “Otherwise there remains a deficiency of the
dollar of the dollar which might result in the shilling
weakening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
