A storm system that intensified
southwest of  Jamaica  may become a tropical depression tonight,
while Hurricane Greg strengthened off  Mexico ’s Baja California
as it moved westward away from land, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said.  The Caribbean showers, 200 miles (320 kilometers) from
Jamaica, are moving west toward Central America at 15 miles per
hour and have an 80 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next 48 hours, the center said in a  statement .
Coastal towns in Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize and Mexico’s
eastern Yucatan Peninsula may be affected.  Hurricane Greg, bearing 80 mph winds, is 340 miles south of
the tip of Baja California, the Miami-based center  said  earlier.
The hurricane, rated Category 1 on the five-step  Saffir-Simpson
scale , is moving west-northwest at 21 mph and may strengthen
further without endangering land, before weakening tomorrow.  Tropical Storm  Fernanda  in the Pacific is 1,115 miles south
of  Hawaii , moving west with 65 mph winds, the NHC said.  A wave of showers, about 850 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands, has a 10 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone,
the center said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
