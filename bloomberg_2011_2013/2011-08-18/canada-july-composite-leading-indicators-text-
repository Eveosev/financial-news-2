Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index rose 0.2% in July after a
0.1% gain in June. In July, 6 of the 10 components
advanced, 1 more than the previous month. In particular,
household demand was firm, reflecting the steady gains in
the trend of employment. These gains were partly offset by
declines in the stock market.  Furniture and appliance sales rose 1.2%, their largest
monthly advance of the recovery. Spending on other durable
goods rebounded 0.1%, as auto sales remained slow. The
growth of services employment was driven by gains in
personal services.  The manufacturing sector showed some improvement in new
orders, which recovered 3.4% after a dip the month before.
However, the average workweek declined again, while the
ratio of shipments to inventories fell due to the first
drop in shipments since November 2010 and higher stocks.  The Toronto stock market trended down by 1.7%, its
largest monthly decline since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
