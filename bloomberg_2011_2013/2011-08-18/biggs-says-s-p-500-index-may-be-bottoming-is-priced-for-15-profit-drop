The selloff in U.S. stocks may be
close to ending with valuations so low they could withstand a 15
percent decline in profits, said  Barton Biggs , the hedge fund
manager who said this month he was selling shares.  “It’s very possible, in the grand scheme of things, that
what we’re seeing is the classic retest of the lows of 10 days
ago,” Biggs said on Bloomberg Television today. “We may be in
the process of making an important bottom.”  Equities around the world plunged today, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index falling 4.5 percent to 1,140.65 as of 4 p.m.
in New York. The level is within 1.9 percent of the one-year low
of 1,119.46 reached Aug. 8 and down 16 percent from the 2011
high of 1,363.61 on April 29.  The tumble in stocks shows that investors expect a slowing
economy to spur analysts to lower earnings estimates, he said.
Earnings at S&P 500 companies are forecast to climb 17 percent
to $99.08 a share in 2011 and 14 percent to $112.90 in 2012,
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The index is trading at
12.4 times profits in the last 12 months, 24 percent below its
five-decade average.  “If analysts and investors really believed the S&P
earnings estimates, the market wouldn’t be selling where it
is,” said Biggs, whose equity purchases prior to the March 2009
market bottom sent his Traxis Partners LP hedge fund to a 39
percent gain that year. “The market is already priced for a 10
or 15 percent decline in earnings.”  Fund Performance  Biggs runs the Traxis Global Equity Macro Fund, which
produced a 2.2 percent profit, net of fees, for investors in
2011 through the end of July, according to Adam Jaffe, the
company’s chief operating officer. That compared with the 3.3
percent gain for the MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in
45 nations, including reinvested dividends.  Equity prices will prove too high should the economy fall
into a recession, he said, a possibility the U.S. Federal
Reserve should act to prevent with something similar to the
purchase of Treasury bonds it began in 2010.  “We do need something more out of the Fed at this point,
but are we going to get it? I don’t know,” he said. “I’d like
to see the Fed do something drastic, maybe buy a different asset
than Treasuries.”  Biggs, who called stocks a “strong buy” on Aug. 3, said
five days later he had cut risk in Traxis. Biggs, the former
chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, said he wanted to
“get out of the way” of the slide that had wiped out almost $2
trillion from U.S. equities over two weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
