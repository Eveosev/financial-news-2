BP Plc (BP/)  and other oil producers in
the  Gulf of Mexico  were asked to investigate a sheen in the
Green Canyon area spotted by the U.S. Coast Guard last week, the
London-based company said.  BP inspected two abandoned well-heads and found cloudy
water near one of them, the company said today in a statement.
That may be caused by naturally occurring shallow water flow
that’s kicking up silt, it said.  BP fell 3.2 percent to 400 pence in  London  trading at the
4:30 p.m. close, the biggest one-day decline in two weeks. The
U.K.’s benchmark FTSE 100 Index slumped 4.5 percent.  The inspection comes 16 months after a blowout at BP’s
Macondo well in the Gulf killed 11 people and led to the worst
offshore  oil spill  in U.S. history. The company has taken a $41
billion charge for the disaster.  At Green Canyon, BP has taken samples from around the well
site, it said, adding it doesn’t believe the cloudy water was
caused by oil or gas, or that it’s contributing to the sheen.
The company doesn’t have any operations near the sheen, it said.  BP will confirm the sample contents and report back to the
U.S. Bureau of Ocean Management, Regulation and Enforcement, it
said. The  agency  wasn’t immediately able to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
