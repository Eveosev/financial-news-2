Gap Inc. (GPS) , the largest U.S. apparel
chain, reported a 19 percent decline in second-quarter profit as
price increases failed to keep up with higher costs to make
clothes.  Net income fell to $189 million, or 35 cents a share, from
$234 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected 34
cents, the average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Glenn Murphy said in May that
expenses per unit would rise 20 percent in the second half,
outweighing price increases. Retailers are charging more for
apparel because of surging cotton prices and increased pay for
workers in  China .  Murphy, who described the quarter as “difficult,” has
shaken up the Gap North America brand to focus on young
consumers after previously targeting a wider audience.  Same-store sales declined 2 percent compared with an
increase of 1 percent a year earlier, Gap said. Total sales rose
2.1 percent to $3.39 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
