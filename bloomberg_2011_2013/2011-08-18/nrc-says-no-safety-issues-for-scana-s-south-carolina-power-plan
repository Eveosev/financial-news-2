The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
staff found no safety issues to prevent issuing a license for
 Scana Corp. (SCG)  to build reactors using a Toshiba Corp. design at a
South Carolina power plant.  The full commission will evaluate the staff report later
this year to determine if it should approve a construction and
operating license for the reactors, the NRC said in a statement.
Scana proposes to build the reactor using the AP1000 by
Toshiba’s Westinghouse Electric Co. unit,  Staff found “no safety aspects that would preclude
issuing” licenses for the proposed Virgil C. Summer units 2 and
3, which are to be built near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, the
NRC said.  On Aug. 9, the NRC staff issued a similar report on
 Southern Co. (SO) ’s plan for a plant under construction in  Georgia 
that also will use the AP1000 design.  To contact the reporter on this story:
