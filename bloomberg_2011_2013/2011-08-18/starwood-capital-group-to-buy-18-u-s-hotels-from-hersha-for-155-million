An affiliate of  Barry Sternlicht â€™s
Starwood Capital Group LLC agreed to purchase 18 hotels in the
eastern U.S. from  Hersha Hospitality Trust (HT)  for $155 million.  Hersha is selling the hotels, which include the Residence
Inn and Hampton Inn brands, to reduce debt and to focus on major
metropolitan markets, the Philadelphia-based real estate
investment trust said today in a statement. The transaction is
expected to be completed before the end of the year.  The company estimates net proceeds of $54 million from the
sale. The hotels are in seven states, including Connecticut,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, according to a regulatory filing.  Sternlicht started Starwood Capital, an investment firm
based in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
