India ’s rupee fell to a five-month
low on speculation international investors will increase sales
of local assets on signs the region’s economies are weakening.  Morgan Stanley cut its growth forecast for India to 7.2
percent for the year ending March from 7.7 percent earlier,
citing a less favorable global environment, according to a
research note released today.  Japan ’s exports fell faster in
July and  Malaysia ’s economy expanded the least since 2009 last
quarter, separate reports showed this week. India’s Sensitive
Index of local shares lost 2.2 percent as exchange data showed
foreigners cut holdings by $1.3 billion this month.  “The economic climate has caused concerns about inflows
into India,” said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency trader in
Mumbai at state-owned  Corporation Bank . “The drop in the stock
market is affecting the rupee.”  The rupee declined 0.7 percent to 45.7475 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That is the biggest drop since Feb. 24. It fell to 45.75
earlier, the weakest level since March 17.  Offshore forwards indicate India’s currency will trade at
46.09 to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations
for a rate of 45.82 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts
are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
