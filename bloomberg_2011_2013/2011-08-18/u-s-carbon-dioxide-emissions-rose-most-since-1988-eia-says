U.S. emissions of carbon-dioxide
related to energy consumption surged 3.9 percent last year, the
largest increase in 22 years, the U.S. Energy Departmentâ€™s
Energy Information Administration said in a report today.  U.S. utilities burned more coal and manufacturing recovered
from a recession, contributing to an increase in emissions of
213 million metric tons, the agency said.  Total emissions were 6 percent below 2005 levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
