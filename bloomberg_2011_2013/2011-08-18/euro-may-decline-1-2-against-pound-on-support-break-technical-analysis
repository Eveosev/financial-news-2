The euro may weaken 1.2 percent
against the pound to as low as 86.12 pence should it break below
a key area of support, according to Commerzbank AG, citing
trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency failed to strengthen above the 55-
day moving average at 88.36 pence earlier this week, meaning it
is now poised to decline to a number of support levels including
a two-month low set Aug. 5, said  Axel Rudolph , a senior
technical analyst at Commerzbank in  London .  “Failure at the August low at 86.44 pence will trigger
further losses to 86.12, the May low and the 55-week moving
average,” Rudolph wrote in a report e-mailed to clients today.
“Risk remains on the downside.”  The euro was little changed at 87.14 pence at 12:11 p.m. in
London. The common currency fell to 87 pence yesterday, the
weakest level since Aug. 9, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has depreciated 0.5 percent this week.  Rudolph said the euro is poised to extend declines over the
next three weeks. Looking at the next three months, technical
analysts are starting to focus on a four-year uptrend line
currently at 85.56 pence, he wrote.  A support level on a chart is where technical analysts
expect orders to buy a currency and its related instruments. The
stronger the support, the more selling is needed to drop below
that level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
