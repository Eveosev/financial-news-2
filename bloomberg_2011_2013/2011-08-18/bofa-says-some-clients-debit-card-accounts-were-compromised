Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, sent some customers new  debit cards  this
week after accounts may have been compromised at a merchant.  Customers are given new account numbers as a precaution if
fraud monitoring detects potential security breaches, said Betty Riess, a spokeswoman for the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
company. Bank of America’s actions were in response to an
“isolated” incident, said Riess, who declined to comment on
how many accounts were affected.  Banks’ costs tied to debit and credit-card fraud are rising
as electronic forms of payment replace cash and checks.
Financial firms are spending “tens of billions of dollars in
data protection,” Leigh Williams, the president of BITS, the
technology policy division of the Washington-based Financial
Services Roundtable, told lawmakers in June.  “This would’ve been a compromise at a third-party merchant
location, it had nothing to do with a security breach of Bank of
America’s system,” Riess said in an interview. “If we believe
that a customer’s card may have been compromised, we’ll notify
the customer and block and re-issue the card.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
