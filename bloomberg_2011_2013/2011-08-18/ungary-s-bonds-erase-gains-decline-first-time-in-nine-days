Hungary’s bonds declined for the
first time in nine days, reversing earlier gains.  The government notes maturing in November 2017 weakened,
lifting the yield 11 basis points, or 0.11 basis point, to 7.13
percent, after falling as much as 24 basis points earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
