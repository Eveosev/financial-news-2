The October Brent crude oil contract
on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange settled at a
record premium of $24.48 a barrel to October futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The spread exceeded the previous record of $23.79 a barrel
based on settlement prices Aug. 10. The differential peaked at
$25.54 in intraday trading on Aug. 11.  Supply disruptions in the North Sea, Nigeria and Libya
bolstered demand and prices for Brent crude. The gap also gained
as ample supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
the New York contract, weighed on U.S. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
