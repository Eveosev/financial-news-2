Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
largest Swiss bank, named Christoph Brunner to succeed Hanspeter Kurzmeyer as head of private clients in  Switzerland , according
to a memorandum sent to staff.  Rolf Boegli will take Brunner’s current position as chief
operating officer for private banking, the Zurich-based bank
said in the memo. Arthur Vayloyan will become head of private
banking for Switzerland, with Nicole Pauli succeeding him at the
bank’s investment services and products unit, the memo said.  The appointments take effect on Sept. 1, Credit Suisse
said. The new positions held by Brunner and Vayloyan will be
represented on the private banking management committee, a
leadership team of about 10 people.  “We are appointing colleagues who have an outstanding
track record,” Hans-Ulrich Meister, who became chief executive
officer of private banking on Aug. 1, wrote in the memo. “The
challenges we are facing include subdued economic growth in
large parts of the world, the strong Swiss franc, the low
interest-rate environment and compliance costs -- all of which
will continue to put pressure on our margins.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
