More migrants left  New Zealand  than
arrived for a fifth straight month in July after an earthquake
in the nation’s second-biggest city prompted people to move to
Australia and elsewhere.  Permanent migrant departures exceeded arrivals by 220 last
month, extending the longest outflow of residents since 2001,
 Statistics New Zealand  said today in Wellington. In the year
ended July 31, arrivals outpaced departures by 2,867, the lowest
level since the 12 months ended October 2001.  Slowing immigration may weigh on consumption and housing
demand, curbing growth this year as the economy recovers from
the magnitude-6.3 quake that killed more than 180 people,
wrecked houses and closed businesses in Christchurch Feb. 22.
Home-building approvals fell 26 percent in the six months ended
June 30 from a year earlier.  Christchurch residents departing permanently for overseas
rose to 4,200 in the March-July period from 2,500 in the same
period last year, the statistics agency said.  Many of those who depart go without migration restrictions
to  Australia , a country with five times New Zealand’s population
of 4.4 million people that is little more than three hours away
by aircraft and offers higher average wages.  The exodus of New Zealand citizens to Australia rose 48
percent to 41,462 persons in the year ended July 31 from 27,940
in the year through July 2010. Net migration to Australia, a
measure of departures less arrivals, was the highest for any
July month since 1978, the agency said.  Short-term visitor arrivals fell 3.7 percent from July last
year to 176,804 persons, today’s report showed. Arrivals in the
year ended July 31 declined 0.5 percent.  About 1,200 visitors in July said they came for the Rugby
 World Cup , which the nation hosts in September and October, the
agency said. About 95,000 foreign fans are forecast to attend
the tournament, bolstering the  tourism industry , which makes up
about 9 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
