Gold demand fell 17 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier as investment slipped, while
Asian buying and concerns about the global economy will drive
consumption this year, the  World Gold Council  said.  Global demand dropped to 919.8 metric tons from the
“remarkably strong” 1,107 tons a year earlier, when  Europe ’s
debt crisis boosted gold’s appeal, the London-based industry
group said today in a report. In value terms, consumption
climbed 4.6 percent to $44.5 billion, the second-highest amount
ever, as prices rallied. Buying in China and India, the world’s
two biggest gold consumers, rose at least 25 percent.  Debt woes in Europe and the U.S. and concerns about slowing
economies pushed bullion to a record $1,814.95 an ounce on Aug.
11. Holdings in exchange-traded products touched a record last
week, and central banks are adding to their reserves for the
first time in a generation as gold heads for its 11th straight
year of gains, the longest winning streak since at least 1920.  “India and  China  were very strong, and it shows you that
you don’t necessarily have to have a strong investment quarter
to see a strong gold market,” Marcus Grubb, managing director
of investment at the producer-funded council, said in an
interview from London yesterday. “You’re seeing household
wealth and economic growth remain very strong in both countries.
You’re going to see demand for gold as a result of the slowdown
in the economy” elsewhere, he said.  Higher Average  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,784.80 an ounce by
4:30 p.m. yesterday in London. Prices averaged $1,509.22 in the
quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier and 8.8 percent
higher than the first quarter. Demand in 2010’s second quarter
was the strongest since the third quarter of 2008 and the
second-highest since at least 2005, council data show.  Investment slid 37 percent to 359.4 tons in the latest
quarter. While bar and coin purchases rose 8.9 percent to 307.7
tons, growth in ETP holdings slowed. Assets gained 38.5 tons in
the period, compared with 276.1 tons a year earlier, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors currently own 2,188 tons
in the products, more than all but four central banks. Assets
reached a record 2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  Jewelry consumption climbed 6.2 percent to 442.5 tons in
the quarter, the council said. Usage in  India  rose 17 percent to
139.8 tons, and the country and China accounted for 55 percent
of global purchases. Total gold demand gained 38 percent in
India and 25 percent in China.  Jewelry Demand  “You’re not seeing recycling coming into the market, even
with a high gold price, and you’re tending not to see demand
drop substantially in jewelry when the price goes up,” Grubb
said. Consumers are more accustomed to higher prices, he said.  India’s bar and coin purchases totaled 108.5 tons in the
quarter, compared with China’s 53 tons. China’s demand for those
assets had overtaken India’s in the first quarter.  Central-bank and government-institution purchases rose
almost fivefold to 69.4 tons in the quarter, taking the first-
half total to 192.3 tons, the council said. Central banks will
remain net buyers this year, it said.  Total supply fell 4.5 percent to 1,058.7 tons in the
quarter from a year earlier as scrapping slipped 3.4 percent to
429.3 tons, the council said. Mine output rose 7.5 percent to
708.8 tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
