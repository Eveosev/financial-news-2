Hong Kong ’s unemployment rate fell
to the lowest level in four months even as analysts said that
the economy is sinking into a recession.  The jobless rate for the three months ending July was 3.4
percent, the government said on its website today. That was less
than the median 3.5 percent estimate of 12 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. For the period through June, the level
was 3.5 percent.  Morgan Stanley and Daiwa Capital Markets say gross domestic
product will contract this quarter after already shrinking in
the previous three months. A decline in stocks and weaker global
demand may hurt confidence and exports.  “The job market seemingly holds up well and renders
support to the economy, as it has not yet reflected the
worsening external situation,” Kevin Lai, an economist at
Daiwa, said before today’s report. He said the jobless rate may
rise to 4 percent by the end of this year.  Gross domestic product slid 0.5 percent in the three months
ended June from the previous quarter, as merchandise exports
dropped 11 percent, the government said on Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
