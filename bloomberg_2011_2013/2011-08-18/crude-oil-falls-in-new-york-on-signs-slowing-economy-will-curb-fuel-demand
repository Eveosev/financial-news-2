Oil dropped from a two-day high in
 New York  on signs that faltering economic growth in the U.S.,
the world’s largest consumer of crude, is causing supplies to
accumulate.  Futures declined as much as 1.8 percent before reports that
may show U.S. jobless claims increased last week and
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region slowed this month.
Crude supplies rose 4.23 million barrels in the week ended Aug.
12, an Energy Department report showed yesterday. They were
forecast to drop 500,000 barrels.  “With all this uncertainty in the markets, the debt crisis
in  Europe  and a bad outlook for the  U.S. economy , oil could see
another leg to the downside next week,” said Gerrit Zambo,
trader at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich, who predicts prices
may drop towards $100 a barrel and then stabilize. “Consumers
see levels close to $100 as a buying opportunity.”  Crude for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  slipped as much as $1.57 to $86.01 a barrel and was at
$86.11 at 10:50 a.m. London time. The contract yesterday rose 93
cents to $87.58, the highest since Aug. 15, and has gained 14
percent in the past year.  Brent for October settlement was at $109.37 a barrel, down
$1.23, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday advanced $1.13, or 1 percent, to $110.60. The
price has risen 43 percent in the past year.  U.S. Inventories  U.S. crude inventories rose to 354 million last week,
according to the Energy Department report. The nation’s
Strategic Petroleum Reserve is releasing stockpiles in
coordination with the Paris-based  International Energy Agency .  The Energy Department has delivered 20.4 million barrels of
oil from emergency reserves since July 17, according to its
website. The government sold 30.64 million barrels to companies
in cooperation with the IEA.  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate, fell 893,000 barrels to
33.7 million, the lowest since November, the report showed.
Gasoline inventories dropped 3.51 million barrels to 210
million. They were forecast to decline 1.18 million barrels,
according to the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles typically
shrink in summer amid the May-to-September peak driving season.  September oil in New York was 16 cents cheaper than the
October contract. That’s the narrowest discount since April in
the front-month price to the subsequent month, or contango. A
contango often signals an excess of immediately-available
supplies or declining demand and, for U.S. futures, is typically
driven by inventory levels at the Cushing storage hub.  U.S. Unemployment  Refinery use dropped to 89.1 percent of capacity from 90
percent, the Energy Department said. U.S. refineries boost
distillate-fuel output during the second half of the year,
making diesel for farm machinery and heating oil for winter use
in the Northern Hemisphere.  U.S. initial jobless claims climbed by 5,000 to 400,000 in
the week ended Aug. 13, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey before a report today. Continuing claims
may have increased by 12,000 to 3.7 million.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell to 2 this month from 3.2 in July, according to the
median forecast of economists in a separate survey.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  this week rejected an expansion of the 440
billion-euro ($634 billion) rescue fund and rebuffed calls for
joint euro borrowing to end the debt crisis, saying greater
economic integration was needed first.  “Continuing concerns over the health of the U.S. and
European economies will cap gains, which will be modest until
the end of the year,” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at
Purvin & Gertz Inc. in  Singapore . “Crude oil will fluctuate
between $80 and $100 in the short term.”  Oil in New York also fell after settling below technical
resistance at $87.59 a barrel for a second day yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of prices in the past year. A failure to
breach chart resistance usually means prices will extend a drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
