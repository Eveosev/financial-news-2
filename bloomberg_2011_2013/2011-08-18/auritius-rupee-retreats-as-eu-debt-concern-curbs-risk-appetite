Mauritius’s rupee depreciated
against the dollar as concern European leaders are struggling to
solve a debt crisis in the region, the island’s biggest trading
partner, curbed demand for riskier assets.  The currency weakened as much as 0.7 percent, the most
since Aug. 16 and was trading 0.5 percent down to 28.15 per
dollar at 12:05 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the rupee declined
by 0.6 percent to 40.6544.  A July 21 accord to bolster the European Union’s rescue
fund failed to calm markets. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  rejected an expansion of the
440 billion-euro ($632.6 million) rescue fund on Aug. 16 and
rebuffed calls for a common euro-area bond, saying greater
economic integration was needed first.  “It will take European leaders a significant amount of
time to be able to bring real solutions to solve the current
debt crisis”, analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank, the
country’s largest lender by market value, said in an e-mailed
research note today.  Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million people, is a
net importer of fuel and food, with 67 percent of imports paid
for in dollars, according to Bank of Mauritius data.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.2379 to 27.4067
rupees, while the selling price was 28.7029 per dollar, versus
28.7065 on Aug. 16, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  Mauritius’s stocks measure declined for a second day, with
the 38-member SEMDEX index retreating 0.2 percent to 1,944.72 by
the 1:30 p.m. close, led by Mauritius Commercial Bank and  State
Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the country’s largest lenders by market
value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
