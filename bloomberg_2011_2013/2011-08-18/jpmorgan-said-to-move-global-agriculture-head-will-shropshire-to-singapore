JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  transferred
Will Shropshire, global head of agricultural commodities, from
London to  Singapore  this month to increase its focus on  Asia ,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Shropshire will also have an Asia-Pacific role overseeing
commodity structuring and sales, said the people, who declined
to be identified as the information isnâ€™t public. Last year, the
bank moved Ray Eyles from London to Singapore to become chief
executive for Asia-Pacific commodities.  After 10 years at JPMorgan, Shropshire joined Standard
Chartered Plc in Singapore in 2004 and became global head of
commodity derivatives. He returned to JPMorgan in 2006 and moved
to London in 2009 where he spent two years as global head of
agricultural commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
