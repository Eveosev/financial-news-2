Hong Kong stocks dropped, with the
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  falling the most in more than a week, after two
Federal Reserve officials questioned the amount of stimulus
being applied to the world’s biggest economy.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of Ryobi power tools and
Hoover vacuum cleaners, slid 1.3 percent on speculation
shipments to the U.S. may fall on signs the recovery is slowing.
Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sank 1.3 percent.  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest lender by market value, fell 2 percent
after the Wall Street Journal reported U.S. regulators are
stepping up scrutiny of European banks operating in the country.  “Markets have been quite volatile given prevailing
concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing  U.S. economy ,”
said Hong Kong-based Michiya Tomita, who helps oversee about $65
billion for Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. “The U.S. still
needs government stimulus as it will take time before the
economy fully recovers.”  The Hang Seng Index fell 1.3 percent to 20,016.27, its
biggest drop since Aug. 9. About four stocks fell for each that
rose on the 46-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong declined 2
percent to 10,718.46.  Techtronic sank 1.3 percent to HK$7.50, while Li & Fung
retreated 1.3 percent to HK$13.34.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a
global fashion retailer, dropped 2.3 percent to HK$21.30.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s pledge last week
to keep  interest rates  near zero until mid-2013 was
“inappropriate policy at an inappropriate time,”  Charles Plosser , president of the Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg radio interview. Dallas Fed President
 Richard Fisher  said the central bank shouldn’t enact policy to
protect stock investors. Both officials dissented from the Fed’s
Aug. 9 statement.  HSBC slid 2 percent to HK$68.05, and Standard Chartered Plc,
the U.K.’s second-biggest bank by market capitalization,
declined 1.4 percent to HK$177.50.  The Hang Seng Index has tumbled 13 percent this year, as
the U.S. and European economies showed signs of slowing, raising
concern global growth will slow. Shares on the gauge traded at
10.7 times estimated earnings, compared with 12 times for the
U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Among stocks that rose,  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.,
the world’s largest bourse operator by market value, climbed 3.6
percent to HK$147.60 after saying it will enter into talks to
form a joint venture with stock exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen. It earlier rose as much as 7 percent.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 1.1 percent to 19,934.
The HSI Volatility Index rose 3 percent to 30.60, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 8.8 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
