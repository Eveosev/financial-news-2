South Korea  plans to buy 10 billion
cubic meters of Russian natural gas a year, Interfax reported,
citing Lee Jong-kook, economy minister at the country’s embassy
in Moscow.  South Korea hasn’t had direct talks with the North on plans
to build a natural gas pipeline from  Russia , and the cost of the
project isn’t known, the Moscow-based news agency said, citing
the minister.  The natural gas will be cheaper than shipping liquefied
natural gas, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
