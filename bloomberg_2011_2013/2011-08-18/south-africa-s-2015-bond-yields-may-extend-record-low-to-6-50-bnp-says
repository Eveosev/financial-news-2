South Africa ’s four-year bonds are
set to extend gains, sending the yield as low as 6.5 percent, as
signs of slowing economic growth reduce pressure on the central
bank to raise  interest rates , BNP Paribas SA said.  The 13.5 percent notes due 2015, known as the R157, rose
for a fourth day, climbing 12 cents to 123.515 rand by 10:20
a.m. in Johannesburg, driving the yield down three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.766 percent. The yield fell as
low as 6.739 percent earlier, the lowest on record.  South African bonds have rallied on expectations that the
central bank will delay an interest-rate increase for as long as
12 months to support what it described as a “fragile” recovery
in  Africa ’s biggest economy. Retail sales grew 2.2 percent in
June, after almost stalling the month before, Statistics South
Africa reported yesterday.  “The retail-sales data were poor,” BNP Paribas analysts
led by London-based Paul Mortimer-Lee wrote in an e-mailed
research note. “We think it’s only a matter of time before the
market starts pricing in a higher probability of rate cuts,
which is why the  bond market  is well in demand. The next target
for R157s is 6.50 percent.”  Growth is still below the average in the first quarter, and
may not be enough to persuade the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank to
lift its key repo rate from a 30-year low.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its benchmark rate unchanged at
5.5 percent this year, after lowering it three times in 2010,
even as inflation climbed to a 15-month high of 5 percent in
July.  Standard Bank Group Ltd., Rand Merchant Bank and Nedbank
Group Ltd. have pushed out the likely date for a rate increase,
and money-market traders have pared bets for an advance in the
next 12 months. forward-rate agreements show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
