OAO Gazprom Neft, a Russian oil
producer, dropped the most in two weeks as crude slid in  New
York  on bets by investors that fuel demand will falter as global
economic growth slows.  The companyâ€™s shares slipped 4.1 percent to 124.11 rubles
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, their biggest slide since Aug.
3.  Crude for September delivery dropped 5.8 percent, to $82.54
a barrel in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
