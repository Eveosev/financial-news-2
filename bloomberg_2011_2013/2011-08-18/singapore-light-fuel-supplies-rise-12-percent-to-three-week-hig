Light-distillate inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center,
increased 12 percent to the highest in three weeks, according to
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate rose 1.04 million barrels to 9.97 million in the week
to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Supplies of middle distillates including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene fell 607,000 barrels, or 4.1 percent, to 14.23
million, according to the ministry’s data.  Residual-fuel stockpiles in onshore tanks gained 266,000
barrels, or 1.4 percent, from the previous week to 19.86
million, a three-week high. This category includes  fuel oil  and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
