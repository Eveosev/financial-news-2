Gasoline in  New York  weakened before
a seasonal grade change on the East Coast next month and as
European stockpiles of the fuel increased for the first time in
five weeks.  Gas stations in the U.S. Northeast sell fuel with a lower
Reid vapor pressure in summer to meet emissions regulations. The
higher RVP fuel sold in winter is typically less expensive,
since it can be blended from cheaper components.  “Summer grade gas is only good until Sept. 15, so people
don’t want to have any extra barrels,”  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in New York
declined 3.38 cents to a premium of 5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:11 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
13.08 cents a gallon.  Gasoline inventories in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe’s oil-trading hub, increased 4.7
percent to 580,000 tons, according to PJK International BV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
