Carl Icahn  and the Tropicana Las
Vegas hotel and casino settled a trademark lawsuit over the
right to the name Tropicana with each allowed to use it
depending on the location.  The accord between the owner of the hotel and several Icahn
companies needs approval by the  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Delaware, according to an Aug. 15 filing in that court. The
action arose out of the hotel’s Chapter 11 case.  Icahn, the billionaire investor whose companies include
Tropicana Entertainment Inc., operates the Tropicana Casino &
Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Under the terms of the
settlement,  Tropicana Las Vegas  will have rights to the name in
Las Vegas within 50 miles of the casino. Icahn will have rights
in  New Jersey  and other areas.  Tropicana Entertainment LLC, the Las Vegas hotel operator,
filed for Chapter 11 creditor protection in May 2008. Two plans
of reorganization were filed and approved by the bankruptcy
court. Each group filing a plan claimed trademark rights.  Ramada of Nevada is listed along with Tropicana Las Vegas
as a defendant in the suit.  The lawsuit is Icahn Agency Services LLC v. Tropicana Las
Vegas Inc., 10-ap-52489, and the bankruptcy case is In re:
Tropicana Entertainment LLC, 08-10856, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
