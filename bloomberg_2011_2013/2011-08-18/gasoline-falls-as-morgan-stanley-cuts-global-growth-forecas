Gasoline fell in  New York  after
Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for global growth this year and
U.S. jobless claims and consumer prices rose.  Futures sank 3 percent as the bank reduced its growth
estimate to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent, saying the U.S. and
Europe are “dangerously close to recession.” The cost of
living in the U.S. rose in July by the most in four months and
jobless claims climbed last week to a one-month high.  “There’s concern about the economy freezing up and also a
lot more concern about the European banks all of a sudden,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago .  Gasoline for September delivery fell 8.71 cents to settle
at $2.7832 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have dropped 20 percent since reaching $3.4648 on April 29, the
highest level since July 2008.  Morgan Stanley cited an “insufficient” policy response to
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence and the
prospect of fiscal tightening.  Crude oil for September delivery on the exchange fell
$5.20, or 5.9 percent, to $82.38 a barrel. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities slid 3.6 percent as of 3:23 p.m. in
New York.  Equities Drop  Futures also sank as equities declined and the dollar
strengthened. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 5.1
percent as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. The dollar gained 0.8
percent against the euro, reducing the investment appeal of
commodities.  “We’re experiencing reality instead of all the hope and
mirrors,” said Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc.
in New York and a trader at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
“It’s a bad picture in Europe, a bad picture here and the
confidence in the market is very low.”  Consumer confidence  in the U.S. economic outlook slumped in
August to the lowest level since the recession, raising the risk
that spending will dry up.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index’s monthly expectations
gauge dropped to minus 34, the weakest since March 2009, from
minus 22 in July. The weekly measure of current conditions was
minus 48.3 for the period ended Aug. 14 compared with minus
49.1, which was the worst reading since mid-May.  “Why should the consumers have confidence about anything
at all?” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the
Energy Management Institute in New York. “We’re in a recession.
It might not be official but we’re in a recession and  Europe  is
in a recession.”  Jobless Claims Rise  Jobless claims climbed by 9,000 to 408,000 in the week
ended Aug. 13, the highest in a month, Labor Department figures
showed today.  The consumer-price index increased 0.5 percent from June,
more than twice the 0.2 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from the Labor Department
showed. The so-called core gauge, which excludes volatile food
and fuel costs, rose 0.2 percent.  Heating oil for September delivery lost 8.68 cents, or 2.9
percent, to settle at $2.8748 a gallon on the exchange. The
front-month front contract is down 7.2 percent this month.  Preliminary volume in electronic trading for gasoline was
130,881 contracts as of 3:13 p.m. in New York, 11 percent above
the daily average of the past three months. Heating oil volume
was 110,082, 3.4 percent below the average.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $3.585 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It was
the first increase in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
