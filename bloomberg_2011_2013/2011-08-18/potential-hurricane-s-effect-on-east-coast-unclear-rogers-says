Computer models are conflicted
whether a potential hurricane next week would mean cooler or
warmer air along the U.S. East Coast, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  An area of disturbed weather in the Atlantic Ocean 850
miles west of the Cape Verde Islands has a 10 percent chance of
becoming a tropical system in the next two days, according to
the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Computer models predict it
may develop into a hurricane and threaten the U.S.  “As the models show some increased agreement on a
Southeast hurricane threat late next week, the models are
struggling to handle the interaction into the main Eastern U.S.
pattern,” Rogers said today in a note to clients. It “could
amplify cooling or it could act as a big humid warm front.”  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs.  Rogers’ 6- to 10-day forecast covering Aug. 23 to Aug. 27
calls for the U.S. Northeast to have seasonable weather while
most of the rest of the country is warmer. The highest
concentration of heat will be over  Oklahoma  and in the  Rocky
Mountains  and U.S. Southwest.  In the 11- to 15-day forecast for Aug. 28 to Sept. 1, the
heat is expected to retreat some with the most intense
concentrations focusing over northern Texas and  Idaho , according
to Rogers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
