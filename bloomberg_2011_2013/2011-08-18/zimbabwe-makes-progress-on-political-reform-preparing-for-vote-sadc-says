Zimbabwe  has made some progress in
implementing political reforms and preparing for elections, the
 Southern African Development Community  said.  The regional group plans to appoint officials to assess the
implementation of Zimbabwe’s political agreement that put in
place its power-sharing government, Tomaz Salomao, SADC’s
executive secretary, said in a speech today in Luanda,  Angola ’s
capital. SADC, which groups 15 southern African nations, held a
heads-of-state summit in the city.  SADC in June said Zimbabwe needs to have a new constitution
and guarantees on a free press before it can hold elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
