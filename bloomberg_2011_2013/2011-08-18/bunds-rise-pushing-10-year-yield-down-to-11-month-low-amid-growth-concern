German government bund yields fell
to an 11-month low as stock markets declined, boosting demand
for the safest assets.  Ten-year German bonds advanced for a fourth day before
euro-region construction data.  Europe â€™s Stoxx 600 index fell 1.3
percent, while U.S. equity futures slid before a government
report that economists said will show the cost of living in the
U.S. barely rose in July.  Ten-year bund yields fell four basis points to 2.17
percent at 8:10 a.m. in London, the lowest since Sept. 1. The
3.25 percent security due in July 2021 gained 0.33, or 3.30
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,440) face amount, to 109.53. Yields on
30-year bonds dropped three basis points to 3.06 percent, while
two-year notes yielded two basis points less at 0.69 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors a 5.1 percent
return this year, compared with 7.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have
gained 5.7 percent, while Italian debt earned 1.3 percent.
Portuguese securities lost 15 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
