WideMed (WDMD)  Ltd. jumped the most in more
than 11 months after the provider of bio-medical signal
diagnostics and treatment said it received European approval for
its Morpheus Ox system.  The shares climbed 18 percent to 0.685 shekel at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the biggest gain since Sept. 15.  WideMed will start marketing the system in  Europe  and the
Far East in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
