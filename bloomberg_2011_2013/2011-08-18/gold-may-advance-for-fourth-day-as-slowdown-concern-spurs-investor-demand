Gold futures surged to a record
$1,829.70 an ounce on demand for an investment haven as mounting
concern that the global economy is faltering triggered a plunge
in equities.  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index tumbled as much as 5
percent after manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
unexpectedly contracted in August by the most in two years as
orders plunged and factories shed workers. Europe’s debt crisis
may freeze interbank markets and cut off funding, said  Lars Frisell , the chief economist at Sweden’s financial regulator.  “There is further decay in the European situation,”
Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc., said in a
telephone interview from  St. Paul , Minnesota. “The nervousness
in the equity markets is pushing people toward gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery jumped $28.20, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $1,822 at 1:45 p.m., on the Comex in  New
York , closing at an all-time high for the third straight day.
The price has advanced 28 percent in 2011, after posting gains
in the previous 10 years.  “If gold continues to climb at this rate for the next few
days, we may touch $2,000 by the end of this month,” Smith
said.  At the end of July, gold settled at $1,631.20.  Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for global growth this
year, citing an “insufficient” response to Europe’s debt
crisis and the prospect of fiscal tightening.  ‘Inflationary Pressures’  “A developed world with slower growth, a large fiscal
deficit and near zero rates over the next few years,
inflationary pressures in emerging economies, and larger
political and economic uncertainty bodes well” for gold, Roxana Mohammadian-Molina, an analyst in London at  Barclays Capital ,
said in a report.  Holdings of the metal in exchange-traded products rose 10.8
tons yesterday, the most since Aug. 8, to 2,198.7 tons, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record 2,216.8 tons
last week as Standard & Poor’s cut the credit rating of the U.S.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  ordered the country’s
central bank to repatriate $11 billion of  gold reserves  held in
developed nations’ institutions.  Venezuela’s move “suggests a lack of comfort with holding
gold abroad,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London, said
in a report. “This is another central bank that wants gold to
play a greater role in its international reserves.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 33.8 cents, or
0.8 percent to $40.716 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has
gained 32 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
September delivery fell $18.90, or 2.4 percent, to $757 an
ounce, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Aug.
4.  Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $6.90, or
0.4 percent, to $1,847.70 an ounce. That marked the ninth
straight gain, the longest rally since October 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
