Government agencies in  Ghana  cannot
account for 2.7 billion cedis ($1.8 billion) of public funds for
2008 and 2009, the Ghanaian Times reported, citing a report by
Auditor-General Richard Quartey.  The missing money, due to irregularities, lapses and errors
in financial management, includes 2.5 billion cedis in salary
over-payment, the Accra-based  newspaper  said, citing the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
