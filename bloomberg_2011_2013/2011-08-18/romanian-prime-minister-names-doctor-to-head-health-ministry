Laszlo Ritli, a doctor  backed by 
 Romania â€™s junior governing coalition member, pledged to
streamline health-care spending to meet the terms of
international loan agreements after he was appointed by Prime
Minister Emil Boc to head the Health Ministry.  Ritli, 63, replaces Attila Cseke, 38, who resigned on Aug.
4, saying his ministry received insufficient funds in a budget
revision. Ritli, who was sworn in late yesterday by President
Traian Basescu, took over his post today and told reporters
today in Bucharest that he plans to rein in hospital costs, the
biggest in the health-care system, to help the country cut its
 budget deficit  to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product this
year, the target agreed with the  International Monetary Fund  and
the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
