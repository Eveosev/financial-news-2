Crude oil’s recent price declines
were caused by financial markets, not supply and demand issues,
Qatar’s oil minister, Mohammed Saleh al Sada, said today in
Doha.  “In view of the fact that oil is a strategic commodity, we
are watching what is happening in global markets,” he said.  Brent crude oil for October settlement fell $3.55, or 3.2
percent, to $106.99 a barrel today on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Crude oil for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell $5.20 to settle at $82.38 a barrel The futures
have decreased 9.8 percent this year.  Qatar, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, pumped 810,000 barrels of oil in July, according to
Bloomberg News estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
