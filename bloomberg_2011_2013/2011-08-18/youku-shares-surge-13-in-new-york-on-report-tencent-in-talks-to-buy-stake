Youku.com Inc. (YOKU) , China’s largest
video website, had their biggest gain in a week in New York
trading after a Chinese website reported that  Tencent Holdings
Ltd. (700)  may be in talks to buy a stake in the company.  Youku climbed 13 percent, the biggest advance since Aug.
11, to $27.01 in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
Tencent gained 0.1 percent to HK$180.00 at the 4 p.m. close of
trading in Hong Kong today.  Youku is “in talks with industry players all the time for
strategic moves or partnerships,” Jean Shao, a company
spokeswoman, said by telephone today. She declined to comment on
whether there were talks with Tencent, as did Jane Yip, a
spokeswoman for Shenzhen-based Tencent.  Chinese language website Phoenix Tech yesterday  reported 
Tencent was in talks to buy a stake in Beijing-based Youku and
for Youku to manage Tencent’s online video business. The report
cited “reliable sources” it didn’t identify.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
