Assets in funds generated and
distributed in  Switzerland  fell 4.6 percent to 619.9 billion
Swiss francs ($781.6 billion) in July, according to the  Swiss
Funds Association .  The drop from the previous month was the result of market
declines and a stronger franc, the Basel, Switzerland-based
association said today in an e-mailed statement, citing
 information  from Swiss Funds Data AG and Lipper Inc. Net inflows
in July were about 545 million francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
