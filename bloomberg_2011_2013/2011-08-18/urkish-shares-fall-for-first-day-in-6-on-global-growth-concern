Turkish stocks slumped for the first
time in six days as appetite for riskier emerging-market assets
fell on poor U.S. data and renewed concern European banks might
lack sufficient capital.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  dropped 4.2 percent to
51,945.95 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. Of the 100 shares
on the index, 99 fell.  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , the country’s
biggest phone company, was the sole exception, rising 1.1
percent to 7.46 liras. The drop today makes Turkey’s index the
worst performer worldwide in the past month after gauges in
Cyprus and Ukraine in dollar terms.  Financial companies led losses in stocks after Lars
Frisell, chief economist at Sweden’s financial regulator, said
it won’t take much for interbank lending to freeze and the Wall
Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators were scrutinizing
the American operations of  Europe ’s largest lenders to assess
their vulnerability. U.S. stocks extended losses after consumer
prices in the world’s biggest economy climbed more than
economists’ expectations in July.  “The problems we have been talking about all along are not
solved, so why should we go up?” Mine Yoruk, a trader at Erste
Securities in Istanbul, said by instant message. “We merely
track the movements of the internationals and mainly the DAX
throughout the day.”  Germany’s benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  plunged as much as 7 percent
today, the most on a closing basis since 2008. The MSCI All-
Country World Index fell 4.1 percent.  The Istanbul measure’s correlation with Germany’s stocks
gauge has spiked to 75 percent from 25 percent at the end of
July.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s largest lender by
market capitalization, led declines on the index, falling 36
kurus, or 5.8 percent, to 5.88 liras, the lowest since February
2010.  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  dropped 5.9 percent to 5.4
liras while its bank,  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , retreated 3.8 percent to 6.02
liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
