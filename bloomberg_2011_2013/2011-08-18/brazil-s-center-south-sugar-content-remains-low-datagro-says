Sugar content in cane crops  Brazil ’s
Center South, the world’s largest producing region, remains low,
industry researcher Datagro Ltd. said.  Sugar-cane crops in the region “continue to fall below
expectation,” Datagro said in an e-mailed statement.  Brazil’s Center South will produce 31.85 million tons of
sugar this year, down from 33.5 million tons last year, Datagro
said Aug. 9. Sugar yields were hurt by a drought last year and
frost in June and August, it said.  Brazil is the world’s largest sugar producer and exporter.
Latin America’s largest economy accounts for about 54 percent of
global shipments, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
