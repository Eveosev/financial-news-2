People who missed out on tickets for
the  London  2012 Olympic Games will not be given priority for
tickets being offered for general admittance to the event park,
the Games’ organizers said.  “It will be on a first come, first served basis,” said
London Organizing Committee spokesman Adrian Bassett in an
interview today. “I don’t think there are any special plans to
have these tickets made available to those who missed out.”  The committee, known as Locog, has been criticized by U.K.
consumer groups for the handling of the sale of 8.8 million
Olympic tickets. Only 700,000 people were successful in a first-
round public ballot, with 1.2 million sport fans missing out.  General admittance tickets will go on sale next year with
more available for the first week of the Games to avoid crowd
congestion during the second week when more venues are in use,
Bassett said. He declined to say how many tickets will be
allocated or how much they will cost.  The 560-acre (227-hectare) Olympic Park in east London will
host swimming, cycling, handball and basketball, and also house
the press and broadcast centers as well as the Olympic stadium.
The Games of the 30th Olympiad begin on July 27, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
