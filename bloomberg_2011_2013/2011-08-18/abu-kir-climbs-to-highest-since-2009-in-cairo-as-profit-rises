Abou Kir Fertilizers & Chemical
Industries Co.  climbed to the highest level in almost two years
after annual profit at  Egypt â€™s biggest publicly traded producer
of fertilizers rose 15 percent.  The shares of the Alexandria, Egypt-based company advanced
1.4 percent to 242.5 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30 p.m. close in
Cairo, the highest level since November 2009. That gave the
company a market value of 12.2 billion pounds ($2 billion). The
benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 0.4 percent.  Net income for the fiscal year that ended June 30 was 1.35
billion pounds compared with 1.17 billion pounds a year-earlier,
the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
