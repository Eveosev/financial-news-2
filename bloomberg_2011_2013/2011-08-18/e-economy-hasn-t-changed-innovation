Over the last couple of weeks in Singapore I've wandered the halls of the regional and global headquarters of three pretty big companies with more than $150 billion in combined revenues. I figured the calamitous economic news out of the United States and Europe coupled with riots in England would result in corporate cube dwellers walking around in a daze.  Instead, I saw three calm companies. People were going about their jobs, apparently unaffected by today's turbulence. It just felt . . . different then the feeling I got walking the halls of companies in late 2008, when the feeling of dread was palpable. Yes, the market has gone down and up — markets do that. Yes, U.S. debt was downgraded — but that shouldn't have much of an effect on companies (unless interest rates reverse their current trend downward). Sure, there's been turbulence — but there always is.  We live now in a  condition  of constant change brought on by more interconnected markets and rapidly advancing technologies. (In  The Silver Lining  I dubbed today's times the "Great Disruption," in which shocks are normal and hard-won competitive advantage disappears quickly.) So, if I were asked what corporate innovators should do, my answers would be about the same today as they would have been a month ago.  People should have been doing these things already, but recent events might provide a handy excuse to make much needed changes.
