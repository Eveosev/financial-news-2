The  European Central Bank  may cut
interest rates next year amid a “dire” economic outlook,
Morgan Stanley economists said after reducing their euro-area
growth forecasts.  “Slower growth, falling capacity utilization and rising
unemployment will likely put a dampener on underlying inflation
in the euro area,” economists including Elga Bartsch wrote in a
research note to clients. A “benign inflation outlook would
allow the ECB to reverse the course of its monetary action and
start to cut interest rates in early 2012 when inflation falls
meaningfully below 2 percent.”  At the same time, “the possibility of the ECB raising
rates once more in October cannot be completely dismissed yet,”
they said. President  Jean-Claude Trichet  has indicated the bank
is still in tightening mode and stressed that  interest rates  can
change independently from liquidity measures, the economists
wrote.  Morgan Stanley predicted the ECB will lower its benchmark
rate -- currently at 1.5 percent -- to 1 percent by the end of
2012. The economists cut their euro-area growth forecasts to 1.7
percent for this year and 0.5 percent for next year from 2
percent and 1.2 percent respectively.  “While not our base case at this stage, we see a material
risk of outright recession,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
