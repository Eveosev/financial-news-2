Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132) , part owned by
 Carlsberg A/S (CARLB) , rose the most in almost three months in Shanghai
trading after profit growth accelerated and it said it’ll
continue investing to develop a hepatitis B vaccine.  The beer maker rose by the  10 percent  daily limit to 20.92
 yuan , the highest one-day percentage gain since May 29. China’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped  0.4 percent  to the
lowest level since March 2009.  Chongqing Brewery gained 3.9 percent on Aug. 17 after
reporting an 11.6 percent increase in first-half profit the
night before. That compared with a gain of 6.8 percent in the
first quarter and a 57.6 percent drop for 2011. The beermaker,
based in the western municipality of Chongqing, also said it
plans to invest an additional 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) on
a hepatitis B vaccine project started in 1998.  The shares fell 6.4 percent on May 31 after the company
announced it was halting development of the vaccine. Chongqing
Brewery generated more than 90 percent of revenue from beer and
less than 1 percent from medicines last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
