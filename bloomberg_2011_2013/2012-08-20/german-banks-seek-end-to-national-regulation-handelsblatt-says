Germany ’s BDB association of private
commercial banks proposes shifting regulation of the industry to
the  European Central Bank , Handelsblatt reported, citing an
unpublished position paper drafted by the group.  The proposal would end political influence over regulation,
the Dusseldorf-based newspaper reported in an article e-mailed
before publication. Germany’s Bafin financial-market regulator
and the Bundesbank, the German central bank, would give up
powers of their own and carry out oversight on the ECB’s behalf,
Handelsblatt cited the BDB paper as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
