Greece ’s economic changes are too
slow and the government must consider next month whether the
country should stay in the euro area, Michael Meister, a senior
lawmaker in German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s governing party,
was quoted as saying by the  Rheinische Post .  Meister, the  Christian Democratic Union ’s deputy
parliamentary leader, said the Greek government must ask itself
in mid-September whether it has majority support in parliament
and among the people for the required painful overhaul,
according to the newspaper, which cited an interview. Meister
said a Greek exit would be regrettable, Rheinische reported.  Reports so far indicate that the speed of reform in Greece
isn’t sufficient, with privatization lagging in particular,
Meister was quoted as saying.  Any proposal for a third international bailout for Greece
wouldn’t get majority backing in Merkel’s governing coalition,
he was quoted as saying in the comments e-mailed to other media
in advance of publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
