European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said Germany’s Bundesbank isn’t
isolated because of its opposition to bond purchases,
Frankfurter Rundschau reported, citing an interview.  “Nobody should try to create the impression that the
Bundesbank or its president are isolated,” Asmussen was quoted
as saying. Asked if the Bundesbank’s concerns are justified,
Asmussen said the ECB acts within its mandate to guarantee  price
stability . “A currency can only be stabile if there are no
doubts about its survival. We’re working on that in the ECB.”  He said the ECB’s new bond-purchase program will be
“better conceived” than the previous one because it will act
in unison with  Europe ’s bailout funds, the newspaper said.  “The mistake with  Italy  last summer, when the ECB bought
bonds and the time wasn’t been used for necessary adjustments,
mustn’t be repeated,” he said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
