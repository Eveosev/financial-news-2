Thailand ’s baht touched a two-week
low before data that economists predict will show exports
dropped for a second month in July.  Government bonds  were steady.  Overseas sales, which account for about two-thirds of
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, fell 3.1 percent from a
year earlier, compared with a revised decline of 4.2 percent the
previous month, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey before a government report on Aug. 21 or Aug. 22.
Thailand may say today that gross domestic product increased 3.1
percent in the second quarter, faster than the 0.3 percent
expansion in the previous three months, a separate survey shows.  “Declining exports may hurt the economy later this year,”
said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Second-quarter growth should be quite
solid due to the recovery process from last year’s floods. The
uncertain export outlook weighs on the baht.”  The baht was unchanged at 31.52 per dollar as of 8:33 a.m.
in Bangkok after touching 31.62 earlier, the weakest level since
Aug. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was little changed at 4.51 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was 3.18
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
