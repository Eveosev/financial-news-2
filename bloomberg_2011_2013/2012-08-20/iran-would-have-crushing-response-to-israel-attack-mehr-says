Iran ’s military is at the highest
level of alert and will respond to any attack by Israel with a
“crushing response,” the state-run Mehr News agency reported,
citing Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi.  His remarks came after Tel Aviv-based Haaretz newspaper
said on Aug. 10 that Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are considering bombing Iran’s
nuclear facilities before U.S. elections on Nov. 6.  “There are intense disputes among the Zionist regime’s
officials, and such statements are worthless,” Mehr cited
Vahidi as saying. “The Zionists are even afraid of their own
shadow, so they try to cover up their despair with making noise
and waging psychological war.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
