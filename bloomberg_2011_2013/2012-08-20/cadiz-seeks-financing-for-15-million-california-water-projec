Cadiz Inc. (CDZI) , a Los Angeles-based
water-management company, is seeking about $15 million in
financing for a water transportation and storage project.  The project will deliver an average of 50,000 acre-feet of
water annually throughout Southern California, the company said
in a statement today.  The Santa Margarita Water District, which approved the plan
last month, will pay as much as $500 an acre-foot of water, and
Cadiz is in negotiations with other potential customers,
according to the statement.  The project also includes “the ability to store water in
periods of excess supply for use in future dry years,”
President Scott Slater said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
