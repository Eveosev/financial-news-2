Spain  may raise income tax again and
cut expenditure on pensions in order to meet its budget deficit
target and avert a bailout,  El Pais  reported, citing
unidentified people in the government.  Government tax revenue, needed to reduce Spainâ€™s deficit to
6.3 percent of gross domestic product by year end, has fallen
despite increases in value added tax and personal income tax
earlier this year, El Pais said.  If the decline continues the government will raise income
tax again and break an electoral pledge not to reduce pensions,
the newspaper said, adding that Budget Minister Cristobal
Montoro will present the latest data on tax collections in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
