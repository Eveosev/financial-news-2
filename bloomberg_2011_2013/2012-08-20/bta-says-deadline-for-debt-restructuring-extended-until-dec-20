BTA Bank (BTAS) , Kazakhstan’s third-largest
by assets, said an Almaty court prolonged the deadline for its
restructuring by three months until Dec. 20 as talks continue on
its second debt overhaul in as many years.  “This deadline has been extended due to ongoing
negotiations between the bank and its creditors,” the Almaty-
based lender said in a statement e-mailed today. BTA was seeking
an agreement on its restructuring by September, according to a
March 22 presentation published on its  website .  The restructuring proceedings that started in the
Specialized Financial Court in Almaty have been recognized in
the U.S. as a “foreign main proceeding” by order of the  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  for the Southern District of  New York  under
Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on Aug. 16, according to
the statement.  State-run BTA widened its net loss for the year to 1.37
trillion tenge ($9.2 billion) as of July 1 from a 711 billion-
tenge loss in April, according to the central bank’s financial
oversight committee. The lender’s liabilities of 2.66 trillion
tenge exceeded assets by 1.21 trillion tenge in June, the
regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
