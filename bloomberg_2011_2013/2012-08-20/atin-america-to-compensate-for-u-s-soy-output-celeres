Latin America  will make up for lower
soybean production in the U.S. during the 2012-13 crop season,
researcher Celeres said.  Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia and Paraguay will
account for 55.4 percent of the worldâ€™s soybean production for
the next crop season and 59.4 percent of the oilseed exports,
Celeres said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
