Romania ’s government will send
updated voter lists on the July 29 presidential impeachment
referendum to the Constitutional Court today, Prime Minister
Victor Ponta said.  The cabinet has collected data from local administrations
to determine the number of eligible voters in the country, Ponta
told reporters in Bucharest today. He didn’t mention whether the
updated lists include a different number of voters than the 18.3
million people who were on the lists at the July 29 referendum.  The nine-judge panel will meet tomorrow to debate whether
the vote to oust President Traian Basescu was valid or not,
depending on the turnout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
