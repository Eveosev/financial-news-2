The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest level in more than a year,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 33 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at
8:20 a.m. in  London , from minus 35 on Aug. 17. The swap is at
the cheapest level since July 25, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 38 basis points below Euribor
from minus 39 on Aug. 17, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The three-month euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia, 
swap was little changed at 7.5 basis points. The European
Banking Federation’s overnight benchmark of unsecured lending
deals was set at 0.112 percent on Aug. 17, from 0.111 percent
the day before.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 327 billion euros ($404 billion) on
Aug. 17 from 322 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
