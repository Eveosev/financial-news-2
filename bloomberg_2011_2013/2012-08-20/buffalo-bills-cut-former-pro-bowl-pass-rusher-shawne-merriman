Shawne Merriman, the three-time Pro
Bowl pass rusher who has battled Achilles tendon injuries in
recent years, was  released  from the  Buffalo Bills , the team said
on its website.  He signed a two-year, $10.5 million contract last season
that included a $5 million guarantee, according to ESPN analyst
 Andrew Brandt . Merriman was scheduled to make $4 million this
year, according to the National Football League Players
Association.  Merriman, 28, who registered 39.5 sacks during his Pro Bowl
years with  San Diego  from 2005-2007, had surgery to repair a
frayed Achilles tendon last year.  Through two preseason games, Merriman has made three
tackles and hit the quarterback once, according to the Buffalo
Bills Web site.  Buffalo signed Merriman off waivers in the middle of the
2010 season. He injured his Achilles tendon 15 minutes into his
first practice and was placed on injured reserve.  In 2011, he had nine tackles and a sack in five games
before another Achilles injury, and he was placed on injured
reserve again.  Merriman, who was drafted with the 12th pick of the first
round in 2005 by the Chargers from the  University of Maryland ,
has 43.5 career sacks. He was suspended for four games in 2006
for failing a steroids test. At the time, his agent said
Merriman unknowingly ingested the banned anabolic steroid
Nandralone in a supplement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
