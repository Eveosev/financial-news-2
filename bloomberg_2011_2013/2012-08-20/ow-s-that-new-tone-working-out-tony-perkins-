On Thursday, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins made a  plea for civility  between groups that stand on opposite sides of policy questions. Perkins said that Floyd Corkins, who shot a security guard at FRC's offices, "was given a license to shoot an unarmed man by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center that have been reckless in labeling organizations 'hate groups' because they disagree with them on public policy." The  very next day , FRC's Executive Vice President, Lt. Gen. William Boykin (ret.), went on  Glenn Beck TV  and inside less than a minute managed to call the SPLC "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, Marxist," and also "dangerous" and "evil." I guess calling people hateful might incite violence, but calling them evil anti-Semites won't. I learn something new from the Family Research Council every day.
