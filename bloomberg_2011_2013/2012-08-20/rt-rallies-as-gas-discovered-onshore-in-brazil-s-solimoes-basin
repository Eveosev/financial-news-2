HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a
Brazilian oil and gas exploration and production company, was
poised for the biggest gain in two weeks after saying it
discovered hydrocarbons in a Solimoes Basin field.  Shares rose 6.5 percent to 4.28 reais at 3:58 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . A close at that level would be the steepest advance since
Aug. 6. The benchmark Bovespa index added 0.5 percent.  HRT discovered gas in an onshore well, according to a
regulatory filing today. Together with three other finds, the
discovery represents an “important advance in HRT’s objective
to monetize the natural gas of the Solimoes Basin,” the company
said in the statement.  “Good news for the company, but what the market is really
waiting for is an oil discovery,” Marcelo Varejao, an analyst
at brokerage Socopa Corretora, wrote in a note to clients dated
today.  HRT lost 65 percent this year through Aug. 17, while the
Bovespa rose 4.1 percent in that same period.  The  oil company  has drilled at least two dry holes in the
Solimoes Basin in the Amazon since it started exploring last
year, according to information on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
