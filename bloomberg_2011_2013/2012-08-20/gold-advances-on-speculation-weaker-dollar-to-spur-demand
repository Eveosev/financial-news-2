Platinum advanced to the highest
level in six weeks on concerns violence in  South Africa , the
biggest producer, will curb supply. Gold rose for a fourth day
after holdings in the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by
bullion increased the most since November.  Platinum added as much as 0.3 percent to $1,479.12 an ounce,
the most expensive since July 5, before trading at $1,478.62 at
1:54 p.m. in Singapore. Gold rose as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,619.95 an ounce. December-delivery bullion was little changed
at $1,621 on the Comex in  New York .  Police shot dead 34 striking workers and injured 78 others
on Aug. 16 after six days of violence between rival unions at
 Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s platinum mine in the North West province. The
company has asked 3,000 employees to return to work, it said.
Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust rose 0.9 percent to 1,274.74
metric tons on Aug. 17, the biggest gain since Nov. 17,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s been a reaction to the violence we’ve seen at
Lonmin,” said  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets
in Sydney, referring to platinum. “You remove that supply for
any period of time and it will impact the pricing.”  The Federal Reserve releases minutes this week of its most
recent meeting. In  Europe , the ECB may set limits on yields of
euro-area sovereign debt by pledging unlimited bond purchases,
Germany’s Spiegel magazine reported. The policy will be decided
at the September governing council meeting, Spiegel said.  U.S. home sales and orders for durable goods probably
climbed in July, signaling the economy may be strengthening.
China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said last week less inflation allows
more room to adjust monetary policy.  “There’s a feeling that governments around the world at
some stage are going to do something about further monetary
easing,” said  Gavin Wendt , founder and senior resource analyst
at Mine Life Pty in Sydney, referring to gold.  Palladium dropped as much as 0.7 percent to $604 an ounce
and traded at $605.20. Prices earlier rose 0.2 percent to
$609.50, the costliest in almost two months. Spot silver rose
0.5 percent to $28.2225 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
