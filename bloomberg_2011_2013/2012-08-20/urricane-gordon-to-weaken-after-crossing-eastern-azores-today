Hurricane Gordon, the seventh named
storm of the Atlantic season, passed through the Eastern Azores
islands and is forecast to weaken to a post-tropical cyclone,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  The hurricane was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of
the Azores’ Santa Maria Island and is traveling east-northeast
at 15 miles per hour, the Miami-based center said in its 5 a.m.
Eastern time  advisory . The Azores are west of  Portugal .  “Gradual weakening is forecast over the next couple of
days and Gordon is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone
east of the Azores by Tuesday,” the center said. The system is
expected to make a turn toward the east in the next couple of
days and will move away from the Atlantic islands later today.  Gordon is a Category 1 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson
scale and has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, down from 85
mph at 5 p.m yesterday. Hurricane-force winds extend as much as
35 miles outward from the storm’s center, the advisory showed.  A  hurricane warning  is in effect for the Eastern Azores
with Gordon expected to produce as much as 6 inches (15 cm) of
rainfall over the Central and Eastern Azores, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
