Ethanol production in the U.S. has
fallen enough to drain a stockpile glut of the biofuel,  CME
Group Inc. (CME)  said.  Output has declined 15 percent to 819,000 barrels a day
from a record 963,000 barrels on Dec. 30, Energy Department data
show, and that’s been enough to help soak up the surplus, CME
said in a report today. Inventories have slipped 19 percent to
18.4 million barrels from a record on March 16.  “Production has dropped by enough to allow inventories to
fall to more reasonable levels from the record high seen in
March,” the owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said.  The decline in production and stockpiles, combined with
surging gasoline prices, has buoyed the market, CME said.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 0.6 cent to
$2.596 a gallon at 9:57 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 18 percent this year.  Based on September contracts for corn and ethanol,
producers were losing 26.2 cents on every gallon as of last
week, the exchange said.  Including  dried distillers grains , a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, distillers stand to
pocket about 11.9 cents a gallon, CME estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
