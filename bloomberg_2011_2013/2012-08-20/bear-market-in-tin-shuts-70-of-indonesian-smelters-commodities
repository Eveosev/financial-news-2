Indonesia  idled about 70 percent of
tin-smelting capacity in its biggest producing region amid a
three-month  bear market , curbing the world’s biggest exports and
setting the stage for a global shortage.  Producers in Bangka-Belitung province closed about 24 of 28
smelters, the Indonesian Tin Mining Association estimates.
Demand will exceed supply by 7,000 metric tons next year, equal
to about 60 percent of global  stockpiles  tracked by the  London 
Metal Exchange, Barclays Plc estimates. Futures will average
$22,000 a ton in the fourth quarter, 17 percent more than the
price of $18,740 today, according to the median of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Tin tumbled as much as 32 percent this year on concern that
slowdowns from the U.S. to  China  to  Europe  will cut demand for
the metal used in everything from cans to televisions and smart
phones. Smelters in Indonesia, representing about 40 percent of
global exports, started shutting down this month. That may help
reduce the nation’s output by as much as 14 percent in 2012,
according to  St. Albans , England-based ITRI Ltd. The research
group also expects a supply deficit in 2013.  “Most smelters have closed,” said Hidayat Arsani, the
president of the Indonesian Tin Mining Association. “The price
just cannot cover the cost. Ideally, the price should be around
$21,000 or $22,000 a ton. If this continues, we can’t work
anymore.”  Nickel Slumped  Metal for delivery in three months, the LME’s benchmark
contract, fell 18 percent in the past year. Of the bourse’s six
main industrial metals, only nickel and aluminum slumped more.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities gained 4.3
percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index of  equities 
advanced 13 percent. Treasuries returned 3.3 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows.  Indonesian smelters also curbed production at the end of
last year as prices fell as much as 44 percent in eight months.
LME-monitored  inventories  declined 43 percent in the fourth
quarter, the most since 2004. Futures rallied 19 percent in the
first three months of this year before retreating once more.  LME stockpiles are shrinking again, reaching 11,630 tons
today, 50 percent less than a year ago. Canceled warrants, or
orders to remove metal from warehouses, jumped to 6,350 tons on
Aug. 14, the most since 1997, suggesting users are soaking up
inventory, bourse data show. Barclays and Morgan Stanley
estimate the market is in a third year of deficit.  Largest Producer  Any rebound would boost profit for  PT Timah, (TINS)  the world’s
third-largest producer. Shares of the Pangkalpinang, Bangka
Belitung-based company slumped 40 percent in the past year in
Jakarta trading and will rally 17 percent to 1,521.25 rupiah in
the next 12 months, according to the average of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Slowing growth remains the biggest risk to tin, a market
valued at $9.3 billion last year based on consumption. China,
which represents about 47 percent of demand, expanded at the
slowest pace in three years in the second quarter, and export
growth in July collapsed to 1 percent from 11.3 percent in June.
The 17-nation euro area contracted 0.2 percent in the second
quarter after stagnating in the first three months.  “We’re very pessimistic about consumption,” said Sun Si,
an analyst at Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., which
has researched industrial metals for two decades. “Macro-
economic  risks  remain, and while we expect an improvement from
the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, it may
not be significant.”  Historical Volatility  Forecasting tin prices may be harder than for other
industrial metals because the volume is lower and price swings
are common. The LME handled 157,296 tin futures and options last
month, compared with 5.1 million for aluminum and 3.1 million
for copper. Its 100-day historical volatility is at 26.4
percent, making it the second most-volatile after nickel, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  While a Bloomberg survey of 15 traders and analysts in June
2011 predicted a gain of about 15 percent to $30,000 by the end
of the year, futures declined 27 percent. A separate survey in
January anticipated a 20 percent gain to $26,000 this year.
Prices advanced to $25,880 the next month, then retreated.  Exports from Indonesia dropped 6.4 percent to 55,613 tons
in the first seven months of this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Companies in Bangka-Belitung produced
about 80,000 tons last year, out of a national total of 105,000
tons, according to data from the government and ITRI, which is
predicting a contraction of as much as 15,000 tons in 2012.  Global Stockpiles  Next year’s predicted shortage may cut the ratio of global
stockpiles to consumption to a record low of 1.7 weeks, from 2.6
weeks in 2012 and more than seven weeks in 2009, Barclays
estimates. The bank expects world output to gain 0.3 percent to
354,000 tons in 2013, from growth of 0.6 percent in 2012.  Global  mine  supply fell 6 percent in the first five months
and a second-half recovery is unlikely unless prices rally,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Chinese output fell 4
percent to 82,471 tons in the first seven months, according to
government data. Exports also may be disrupted by the
nationalization of  Glencore International Plc’s (GLEN)  Colquiri tin and
zinc operations in  Bolivia  and violence in the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo, according to Barclays.  PT DS Jaya Abadi, one of the Indonesian smelters that
curbed output, sent its 150 workers on leave until September,
according to Sukito Gunawan, a director of the company. The
producer in Pangkalpinang will review its options again that
month, he said.  Breaking Up  Small-scale miners in Bangka-Belitung, who supply smelters
with ore, have also stopped work. Ari Saputra, 22, said that his
boss ordered a halt to mining at Batu Belubang beach more than a
month ago, and he now earns a living breaking up the bamboo
rafts used for dredging ore. The crews extract ore offshore and
from riverbeds.  Speculation that policy makers in China and the U.S. will
take more measures to support growth may lift prices, according
to  David Wilson , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  said Aug. 1 it will pump in fresh
stimulus if needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.
China reduced  interest rates  twice this year, and has cut banks’
reserve requirements three times since November.  Net Income  PT Timah will report an 8 percent gain in net income to
968.14 billion rupiah ($101.8 million) this year before profit
drops 12 percent to 852.8 billion rupiah in 2013, the mean of as
many as 12 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg shows.
President Director Sukrisno said in an interview in Jakarta on
Aug. 3 that Timah will slow tin sales to the  spot market  this
year and expand stockpiles.  “We are surviving,” said Gunawan, the director at DS Jaya
Abadi, who estimates monthly output this year averaged 300 tons
out of capacity of 800 tons. “Some say that $17,700 is already
the bottom and it will rebound again but it will depend on the
European economy. If there’s no concrete action, and meanwhile
China is reducing  consumption,  it may stay as it is.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
