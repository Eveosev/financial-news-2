Russia’s central bank will increase
benchmark  interest rates  as inflation nears the upper limit of
its target range, according to Citigroup Inc.  “As inflation is crawling up to the upper bound of the
Russian central bank’s target range of 5-6 percent, the
regulator may hike rates,” analysts led by  David Lubin  said in
an e-mailed report today. Bank Rossii will increase deposit and
repo auction rates at its “next meetings,” the analysts said.  “Weak” data in July will not rule out rate increases, the
analysts said. While Russian retail sales grew at the slowest
pace in 18 months in July, that “is not likely to worry” the
central bank, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
