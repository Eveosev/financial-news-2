Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  surged in late
trading after posting second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates as sales gained at all of its main brands.  The  shares  climbed 17 percent to $36.45 at 5:53 p.m. in New
York. The Philadelphia-based retailer had gained 13 percent this
year through the close of regular trading today.  Urban Outfitters rehired co-founder  Richard Hayne  as chief
executive officer in January to turn the chain around after
increased discounts caused profit to shrink to a four-year low
in its last fiscal year. The company also appointed new heads of
its namesake and Anthropologie brands as it works to improve
merchandise and generate a majority of its sales online.  The brands built on successful merchandise introduced
earlier this year, including “colored denim, other bottoms and
dresses, and executed in these categories with excellent
results,” Hayne said on a conference call with analysts after
the report. Direct-to-consumer sales also drove profit, with an
about 30 percent increase in traffic from last year on the
company’s web and mobile sites, he said.  Net income rose 8.1 percent to $61.3 million, or 42 cents a
share, from $56.7 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today. Analysts’ average  estimate 
was 33 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Online Sales  Second-quarter net sales climbed 11 percent to $676.3
million, driven by the namesake, Anthropologie and Free People
brands, the company said. Analysts were projecting revenue of
$672.6 million. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 22 percent to
$137.7 million in the quarter, according to the statement.  Urban Outfitters increased its web-exclusive offerings by
75 percent from last year, which helped boost sales, Hayne said
on today’s call. The company increased dress styles available
online by 50 percent this year from 750 across all its brands
last year, Hayne said.  The namesake brand accounted for 46 percent of net sales in
the quarter with $310.7 million, a 14 percent gain from a year
earlier. Sales at Free People, the smallest of the three brands,
jumped 26 percent to $73.8 million, while those at Anthropologie
increased 3.4 percent to $281.8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
