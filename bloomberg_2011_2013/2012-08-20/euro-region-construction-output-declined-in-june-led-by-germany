Euro-area  construction output  fell
for a third month in June, as declining production in  Germany 
and the Netherlands offset gains in France and Spain.  Construction in the 17-nation euro area dropped 0.5 percent
from May, when it fell a revised 0.2 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. From a year
earlier, construction  output  declined 2.8 percent.  In Germany,  Europe ’s biggest economy, output slipped 2
percent from May, when it gained 2.6 percent, today’s report
showed. Dutch production fell 1.4 percent. France and Spain
reported gains of 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.  In the 27-nation EU, output declined 1.7 percent from May,
when it rose 1.2 percent. Ireland and Greece are not required to
provide monthly data on construction output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
