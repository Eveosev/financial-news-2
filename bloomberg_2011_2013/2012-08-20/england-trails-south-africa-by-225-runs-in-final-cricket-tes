South Africa  needs just three more
wickets in the final Test to clinch a 2-0 series win over
England and take the No. 1 ranking from their hosts.  England, on 221-7, trails by 124 runs at tea on the last
day at Lordâ€™s in London. Only a home victory would stop the
visitors taking over as the top-rated team in the International
Cricket Council Test rankings.  England, set 346 to win, started the day at 16-2 after
Vernon Philander dismissed Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss
yesterday  Today he got  Ian Bell  out for 4, and  James Taylor  was run
out for 4 to leave the hosts on 120-4 at lunch. Jonny Bairstow
then went for 54, Jonathan Trott got 63, and Stuart Broad was
caught by  Hashim Amla  for 37. Matt Prior has 35 and Graeme Swann
is on 12.  South Africa has scored 309 and 351, England replying with
315. The Proteas won the first Test by an innings and 12 runs,
with the second rain-affected game drawn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
