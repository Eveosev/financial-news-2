Taiwan ’s export orders fell more
than economists forecast in July, the fifth straight decline, as
a faltering global recovery hurt demand for its goods.  Orders, an indicator of shipments in the next one to three
months, dropped 4.4 percent from a year earlier after a 2.62
percent decline reported earlier for June, a Ministry of
Economic Affairs report in Taipei showed today. The median
esimtate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was for a
2.98 percent fall.  The island cut its growth forecast for the year to 1.66
percent from an earlier estimate of 2.08 percent last week,
after the economy shrank more than initially estimated last
quarter. It said exports would contract 1.72 percent this year,
after  China , its biggest market, expanded at the slowest pace in
three years in the second quarter.  “The outlook for Taiwan’s orders and sales will be
increasingly difficult and challenging.,” Raymond Yeung, a Hong
Kong-based economist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ) , said before the report. “The risk of another quarterly
contraction is rising,” and the slowdown in China will continue
to be a major drag for Taiwan, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
