Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , the Turkish bank
bought by Russiaâ€™s OAO Sberbank, is seeking one-year loans to
refinance credit maturing in October, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Denizbank plans to pay an all-in cost of 135 basis points
more than benchmark lending rates for the new borrowing in euros
and dollars, including an interest margin of 75 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Istanbul-based lender is seeking to replace $646
million of term loans signed last year, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
