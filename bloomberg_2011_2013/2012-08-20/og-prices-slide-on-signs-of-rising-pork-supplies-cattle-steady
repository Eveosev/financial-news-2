Hogs fell for the first time in
three sessions on signs of rising U.S. pork supplies as
producers sent more animals to slaughter because of higher feed
costs amid the widespread drought. Cattle were little changed.  Meatpackers processed 2.166 million hogs in the week ended
Aug. 18, up 6.6 percent from the previous week, according to the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture . Carcass  weights  averaged 202.72
pounds (92 kilograms) on Aug. 16, up 2 percent from a year
earlier, USDA data show. Futures dropped 5.1 percent this month
through Aug. 17.  “We are really going to challenge this hog market with
huge production,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial
Services, said in a telephone interview from Chicago. “Sow
slaughter is on the increase, and average hog weights are heavy
and starting to move higher.”  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.4 percent to
75.875 cents a pound at 11:01 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are down 9.6 percent this year through Aug. 17.  More than half of the Midwest in is “severe”  drought  as
of the week ending Aug. 13, according to the U.S. Drought
Monitor. The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock
feed, surged 60 percent from June 15 through Aug. 17.  Cattle futures for October delivery added 0.1 percent to
$1.254 a pound on the CME. Prices are up 3.1 percent in 2012
through Aug. 17.  Wholesale beef rose 4.4 percent last week to $1.9303 a
pound, the highest since July 5, government data show. Grocers
are increasing meat purchases before the Labor Day holiday on
Sept. 3, when consumers often grill outdoors, said Dick Quiter,
an account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in  Chicago .  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement gained 0.4
