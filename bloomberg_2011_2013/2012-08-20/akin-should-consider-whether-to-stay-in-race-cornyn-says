Republican Todd Akin should
“carefully consider” whether he should stay in the Missouri
Senate race, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman
 John Cornyn  said.  Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said in a statement today that
Akin’s assertion yesterday that “legitimate rape” rarely
results in pregnancy was “wrong, offensive, and indefensible.”
Akin is a Missouri congressman running to oust one-term U.S.
Senator  Claire McCaskill , a Democrat.  “I recognize that this is a difficult time for him, but
over the next 24 hours, Congressman Akin should carefully
consider what is best for him, his family, the  Republican Party ,
and the values that he cares about and has fought for throughout
his career in public service,” Cornyn said.  Under Missouri law, Akin would have until 5 p.m. tomorrow
to withdraw without his name appearing on the ballot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
