Henry Wyndham, the chairman of  Sotheby’s (BID)  Europe, was accidentally shot in the face during a grouse shoot in Scotland, the  Daily Telegraph  reported. His eyesight was spared because he was wearing thick spectacles, it said.  Wyndham, 58, was taken to the hospital by helicopter ambulance and was released after being treated for 52 pellet wounds, the paper said. The Telegraph cited his sister-in-law, whom it did not identify by name.  “Henry Wyndham sustained an accident on the grouse moor and is currently on track for a full and rapid recovery,” Sotheby’s said in an e-mailed statement today.  The shoot took place on an estate hired by  Louis Bacon , the founder of hedge fund Moore Capital Management LLC, the Mail on Sunday reported. Moore officials couldn’t immediately comment when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  Wyndham joined Sotheby’s in 1994, according to the  auctioneer’s website . Prior to that, he was a principal in the St James’ Art Group, which he co-founded in 1987 following a career at Christie’s, it says. He was educated at Eton.  Muse highlights include  Scott Reyburn  on art,  John Mariani  on wine and  Hephzibah Anderson  on books.
