Australia  will maintain a fixed
price for its tax on  carbon emissions  until 2015 under the law
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  pushed through Parliament last
year, the government said.  “We’ve got a fixed price under the Emissions Trading
Scheme until July 1, 2015,” Mark Dreyfus, Gillard’s
parliamentary secretary for climate change, said in an interview
in Canberra today. “The Australian government has been
consulting with business over the design of the floor price and
is continuing discussions.”  The levy is set at A$23 ($24) a metric ton for the year
that started July 1 and will rise at a fixed-rate of 2.5 percent
a year in real terms until 2015, according to the government.
Dreyfus declined to identify the businesses or lawmakers with
which the government’s in discussion or give the nature of the
talks or when they may be complete.  Gillard’s carbon price is the government’s main tool for
reducing the country’s reliance on coal and meeting its target
for a 5 percent cut in greenhouse-gases from 2000 levels by
2020. The levy will be fixed until 2015, when the nation will
introduce a cap-and-trade system with a floor price of A$15 that
lets companies buy and sell a fixed number of emissions permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
