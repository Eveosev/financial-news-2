The  condition  of U.S. corn crops was
unchanged last week, and soybeans improved as cooler weather
eased plant stress from the worst drought in half a century.  About 23 percent of the corn in the week ended yesterday
was rated good or excellent for a third straight week, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . The agency
gave 31 percent of soybeans the top ratings, up from 30 percent.
July was the hottest month on record in the U.S., excluding
Alaska and  Hawaii , National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration data show.  “The weather has stabilized and maybe benefited a few
areas” in the main soybean-growing region, Jamey Kohake, the
branch manager at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,  Kansas ,
said in a telephone interview before the data was released.
“The reports are pretty much done. Now, people are going to
start focusing on the harvest.”  Corn futures for December delivery advanced 2 percent to
settle at $8.2375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $8.25, the highest for a most-active
contract since the rally to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. The grain
has jumped 63 percent since mid-June because of the drought.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.3 percent to
$16.835 a bushel. The price has gained 28 percent since June 15.  Soybean-meal futures for December delivery jumped 2.6
percent to $512.80 per 2,000 pounds. Earlier, the livestock feed
reached a record $513.50.  Poor Ratings  The USDA data showed 51 percent of the corn crop was poor
or very poor, unchanged from a week earlier, and 38 percent of
soybeans got the lowest ratings, compared with 37 percent.  Corn farmers have harvested 4 percent of the crop, up from
1 percent a year earlier.  Rice farmers have gathered 18 percent of the crop, up from
14 percent a year earlier. The top ratings went to 70 percent of
the grain, down from 73 percent a week earlier.  The USDA data showed that 79 percent of the spring-wheat
crop was harvested, compared with 25 percent a year earlier.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
