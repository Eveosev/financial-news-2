The euro erased its advance against
the dollar and declined versus the yen after  Germany ’s
Bundesbank said government bond purchases “entail significant
stability risks.”  Europe ’s shared currency weakened 0.1 percent to $1.2318 at
11:08 a.m. London time, after rising as much as 0.3 percent
earlier. It depreciated 0.2 percent to 97.92 yen, after
advancing as much as 0.2 percent.  “Government bond purchases by the Eurosystem are to be
seen critically and entail significant stability risks,” the
Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report today.
The new program “could be unlimited” and decisions about
potentially far greater sharing of solvency risks should be
taken by governments, not by central banks, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
