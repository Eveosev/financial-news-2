Facebook Inc. (FB)   director   Peter Thiel  sold most of his stake in the operator of the world’s largest social-networking website, bringing his proceeds to more than $1 billion, after restrictions on insider sales ended.  Thiel, one of Facebook’s earliest investors, sold about 20.1 million shares in the company on Aug. 16 and Aug. 17, raising $395.8 million, according to a  filing  yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Thiel, a venture capitalist and hedge-fund manager, had already generated $640.1 million in sales during the initial public offering.  With an investment of $500,000 in 2004, Thiel is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Facebook’s gain before going public. Later backers haven’t fared as well, with the stock losing almost half its value since the IPO amid signs that the company’s growth is slowing and concerns that more insiders will exit their stakes. The sales disclosed yesterday were tied to a plan adopted on May 18, Facebook’s first day of trading.  +RELATED:  Groupon Venture Backers Sell Stakes, Exit “As of last May, he had basically handed over discretion about these sales,” said Stephen Diamond,  associate professor  of law at Santa Clara University.  Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for Thiel, and Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment.  Dustin Moskovitz, who founded Facebook with  Mark Zuckerberg  and others at  Harvard University , sold 450,000 shares for $8.83 million after the lock-up expired, leaving him with 7.05 million Class A shares, according to a filing. Moskovitz also holds 126.2 million Class B shares.  Accel Distribution  Facebook last week unlocked 271.1 million shares, the first of five insider-sale restrictions scheduled during the company’s first year as a public company. Another 1.44 billion shares will be freed up through November.  Shares of  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook fell 4.3 percent to $19.16 at the close in  New York .  Another Facebook investor,  Accel Partners , distributed more than 50 million shares to investors in the venture capital firm’s funds on Aug. 16, according to another  filing  yesterday.  Thiel’s sale, at prices from $19.27 to $20.69 a share, represents most of the 27.9 million shares the investor held after the IPO. He still holds more than 5 million shares, and the proceeds don’t reflect underwriter or broker fees.  Thiel freed up extra shares for sale when he converted more than 9 million shares to Class A from Class B, according to a document filed Aug. 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  As a co-founder of PayPal Inc., he served as chief executive officer until the company was bought by  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  for $1.5 billion in 2002. Thiel, who’s also a member of the so- called “PayPal Mafia,” used his fortune to start hedge fund Clarium Capital Management LLC and to invest in startups.  One of those startups was Facebook, a social-networking service devoted to college campuses at the time of the investment in 2004. Thiel also participated in a $25 million funding round in 2006 when the company was valued at $500 million.  -- Editors: Reed Stevenson, Ben Livesey  To contact the reporters on this story: Brian Womack in  San Francisco  at   bwomack1@bloomberg.net ; Ari Levy in San Francisco at   alevy5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at   tgiles5@bloomberg.net
