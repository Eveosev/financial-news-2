ConocoPhillips (COP)  has shipped a third
cargo of liquefied natural gas to Japan from the only U.S. LNG
plant permitted to sell domestically produced fuel to the Asian
country.  The cargo from Nikiski on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula is
scheduled to arrive Aug. 26 at the western Japanese port of
Himeji on LNG Gemini, a tanker that can carry 126,750 cubic
meters, according to ship-tracking data on Bloomberg.  ConocoPhillips has loaded its third cargo of the year from
Nikiski, Natalie Lowman, a spokeswoman for the company’s Alaskan
unit, said in an Aug. 18 e-mail. It planned to ship as many as
five LNG cargoes to Japan this year, Lowman said in an e-mail in
June. She didn’t name the buyers, citing confidentiality
agreements.  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) , which has bought two previous
shipments of Alaskan LNG this year, and  Osaka Gas Co. (9532)  have
terminals for receiving the fuel at Himeji. Kazushige Akita, a
Kansai Electric spokesman, declined to say whether the Aug. 26
cargo was bought by his company. Osaka Gas didn’t buy the
shipment, according to Nozomi Itagoshi, a spokeswoman for the
company.  ConocoPhillips’ license allows it to sell U.S.-produced gas
to countries with which the nation has no free trade agreement.
The  Department of Energy  awarded a similar authorization last
year to  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) , which plans a terminal in Sabine
Pass,  Louisiana .  To contact the reporter on this story:
