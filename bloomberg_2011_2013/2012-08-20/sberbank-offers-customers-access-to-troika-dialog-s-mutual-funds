OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, is beginning to offer clients mutual funds and venture
capital funds managed by Troika Dialog, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  The bank, which held 47 percent of the nation’s deposits at
the end of last year, acquired the Troika Dialog brokerage group
in January. Troika’s asset-management unit, which has about $2.5
billion in assets, is also being integrated into state-
controlled Sberbank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
