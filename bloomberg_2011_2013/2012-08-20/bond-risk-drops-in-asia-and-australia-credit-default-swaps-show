     Aug. 20 (Bloomberg) --The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment declined in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  dropped 2 basis points to 153
at 10:54 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  prices
show. The gauge is on course for the lowest closing level since
April 6, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 147.5 as of 8:52
a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The index is set for the lowest close since Aug. 10, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 186
basis points as of 9:48 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark has traded between 184 and 207 basis points
this month, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
