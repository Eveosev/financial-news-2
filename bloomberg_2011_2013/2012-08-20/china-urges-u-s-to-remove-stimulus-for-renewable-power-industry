China  asked the U.S. to remove some
of its stimulus measures for the renewable-energy industry,
saying they’re against World Trade Organization rules.  Six state stimulus programs have violated the WTO’s anti-
subsidy rules and hampered Chinese renewable-energy exports to
the U.S., China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a  statement  on
its website. The U.S. must offer “fair treatment,” the
ministry said.  A trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies has
deepened after the U.S. Commerce Department said in May it will
impose duties on Chinese solar cells. It set preliminary tariffs
of as much as 250 percent on imports after companies including
the local unit of  SolarWorld AG (SWV)  said Chinese rivals were selling
products at a loss in the U.S.  China started an investigation into U.S. stimulus measures
in states including Washington, Massachusetts, Ohio and
 California  in November. The original complaint was filed by the
 China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and
Electronic Products  and the New Energy Chamber of Commerce in
the All-China Federation of Industry & Commerce.  The Asian country is also investigating whether U.S.
exporters sold solar-grade polysilicon below cost with
subsidies.  The U.S. Commerce Department’s public affairs unit didn’t
respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
