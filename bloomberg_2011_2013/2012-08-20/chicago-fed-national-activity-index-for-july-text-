Following is the text of
the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index from
the  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago .  The index’s three-month moving average, CFNAI-MA3, decreased
slightly from -0.18 in June to -0.21 in July--its fifth consecutive
reading below zero. July’s CFNAI-MA3 suggests that growth in national
economic activity was below its historical trend. The economic growth
reflected in this level of the CFNAI-MA3 suggests subdued inflationary
pressure from economic activity over the coming year.  The CFNAI Diffusion Index also moved lower in July, ticking down
to -0.05 from -0.02 in June. Forty-nine of the 85 individual indicators
made positive contributions to the CFNAI in July, while 36 made negative
contributions. Fifty-six indicators improved from June to July, while 28
indicators deteriorated and one was unchanged. Of the indicators that
improved, 15 made negative contributions.  The contribution from production-related indicators to the CFNAI
increased to +0.12 in July from +0.01 in June. Total industrial
production rose 0.6 percent in July after increasing 0.1 percent in
June, and production of durable  consumer goods  rose 1.5 percent
in July after edging up 0.1 percent in the previous month.  The contribution from the consumption and housing category to
the CFNAI also increased in July, moving up to -0.22 from -0.28
in June. Housing starts decreased slightly to 746,000 annualized
units in July from 754,000 in June, but housing permits rose to
812,000 annualized units from 760,000 over the same period.
The contribution from the sales, orders, and inventories category
to the CFNAI was also higher in July, increasing to -0.01 from
-0.09 in June.  The contribution from employment-related indicators to the CFNAI
decreased in July, moving down to -0.03 from +0.02 in June.
Civilian employment decreased by 0.1 percent in July after increasing
by a similar amount in June, and the  unemployment rate 
inched up to 8.3 percent in July after holding steady in June.  The CFNAI was constructed using data available as of August 17,
2012. At that time, July data for 51 of the 85 indicators had been
published. For all missing data, estimates were used in constructing
the index. The June monthly index was revised to -0.34 from
an initial estimate of -0.15. Revisions to the monthly index can be
attributed to two main factors: revisions in previously published
data and differences between the estimates of previously unavailable
data and subsequently published data. The revision to the
June monthly index was due primarily to the former.  SOURCE: Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago
