Copper inventories in Asian
warehouses approved by the  London  Metal Exchange surpassed those
held in the U.S. for the first time since 2008.  Copper stockpiles held in South Korea,  Singapore  and
 Malaysia  rose 450 metric tons to 110,225 tons, while inventories
in the U.S., the only LME-approved location in the Americas,
dropped 775 tons to 109,625 tons, exchange data showed today.
The last time there was more copper in Asian warehouses than in
the U.S. storage points was on Nov. 11, 2008.  Asia is now the biggest location for copper inventories.
The LME-monitored warehouses in South Korea are the closest to
China, the world’s biggest buyer of the commodity. About 39
percent of global demand for the metal in 2011 came from  China 
and the U.S. accounted for 9.2 percent, according to Morgan
Stanley.  “From a point of view of industrial logic you would place
your stocks ideally as close to your major consumer as
possible” in case there is an upturn in demand from the user,
Duncan Hobbs, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, said
by phone today. “Without knowing who exactly holds the stocks,
it’s difficult to say for sure whether the metal is being placed
out of the way for tactical reasons or whether it’s being
positioned in anticipation of meeting consumer demand.”  Stockpiles in Asia almost tripled this year and U.S
inventories are down 62 percent.  South Korea  accounts for 75
percent of Asian stockpiles while the city of  St. Louis  holds
most copper in the U.S., LME data shows. Overall copper
inventories slipped 0.2 percent to 234,150 tons after a sixth
weekly drop in seven last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
