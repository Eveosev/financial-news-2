The cost of cocoa butter relative to
the price of beans rose in  Europe  last week, according to three
traders with direct knowledge of the sales.  The butter, which accounts for as much as 20 percent of the
weight of a chocolate bar, trades at a ratio to cocoa futures on
the NYSE Liffe exchange in London. The ratio was 1.46 to 1.52
last week, said the traders, who declined to be identified
because they arenâ€™t authorized to speak to the media. It was
1.35 to 1.4 the week before.  The butter ratio in Europe has been climbing since at least
June 1 as processors used up stockpiles rather than grind more
beans, according to data from  Commodities Risk Analysis LC ,
a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based research company. Grinders
started buying butter from stockpiles after prices fell for
cocoa powder, another by-product of bean processing.  Cocoa processing in Europe fell 18 percent in the second
quarter, according to the European Cocoa Association in
Brussels. In  North America , grindings dropped 9.8 percent in the
same period, according to the  National Confectioners Association 
in  Washington .  Cocoa for December delivery gained 0.4 percent at 1,637
pounds ($2,569) a ton at 12:05 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
