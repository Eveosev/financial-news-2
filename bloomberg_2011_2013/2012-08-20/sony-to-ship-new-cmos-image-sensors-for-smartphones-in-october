Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s largest exporter
of consumer electronics, plans to start shipping new sensors in
October that produce sharper images than current ones as it
seeks to win more orders from smartphone makers.  The complementary metal-oxide semiconductors, or CMOS, are
also smaller, Sony said in a statement today. The company, which
currently makes imaging modules at a plant in Kumamoto, Japan,
will also start making them in Guangzhou,  China , this month to
boost capacity, it said.  The maker of Cyber-shot cameras is spending 80 billion yen
($1 billion) to boost production capacity for CMOS chips to
60,000 wafers a month from 45,000, it said in June. Tokyo-based
Sony aims to win more orders from makers of smartphones with
built-in cameras and boost its global market share for the image
sensors to 30 percent by March 2014 from 14 percent as of March
this year, Sony said today.  Sony will speed up a move into health equipment by using
the edge its image sensors have over rivals, Chief Executive
Officer  Kazuo Hirai  said earlier this year. The medical business
has the potential to be one of the company’s main sources of
profit, according to Hirai.  Sony shares rose 0.5 percent to 949 yen as of 2:15 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, trimming their loss this year to 31 percent.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
