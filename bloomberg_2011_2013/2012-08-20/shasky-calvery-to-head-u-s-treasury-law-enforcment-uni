The U.S. Treasury Department has
selected Jennifer Shasky Calvery as the new director of its
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which maintains financial
transactions data and analyzes information for  law-enforcement 
purposes.  The department said Shasky Calvery is expected to begin her
new job in September and will replace outgoing director Jim
Freis, who has led the network, known as FinCEN, for more than
five years. The director of FinCEN is appointed by the
department’s secretary and reports to the undersecretary for
terrorism and financial intelligence.  Shasky Calvery joins FinCEN from the  Justice Department ,
where she has served since 2010 as chief of the asset forfeiture
and money laundering section.  “Her proven record of leadership and strong working
relationships with Treasury, law enforcement and the federal
bank regulatory agencies will be enormous assets to us as we
work together to chart a course for FinCEN’s future,”  David
Cohen , the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence, said in a news release.  To contact the reporters on this story:
