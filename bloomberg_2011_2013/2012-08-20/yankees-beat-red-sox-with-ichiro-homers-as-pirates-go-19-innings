Ichiro Suzuki hit a pair of solo
home runs and Hiroki Kuroda allowed one run over eight innings
as the  New York Yankees  beat the Boston Red Sox 4-1 in the
finale of a three-game series between the division rivals.  The Yankees won two of three games against the Red Sox to
improve their American League-leading record to 72-49.  New York 
has won eight of 12 games against Boston this season.  Derek Jeter  had three hits and scored the Yankees’ first
two runs last night at Yankee Stadium, while Ichiro hit homers
in the fourth and sixth innings to push the home team’s lead to
4-0. Kuroda, who picked up his 12th win, limited the Red Sox to
four hits and tossed 6 1/3 shutout innings before allowing a
seventh-inning homer to  Adrian Gonzalez .  Yankees reliever  Rafael Soriano  got the last three outs for
his 31st save of the Major League Baseball season.  New York begins a six-game road trip today in Chicago,
facing the White Sox. After three games in Chicago, the Yankees
play the Cleveland Indians. The Red Sox (59-63) open a seven-
game home stint tomorrow with the first of three games against
the Los Angeles Angels before playing four straight nights
against the Kansas City Royals.  Pittsburgh and  St. Louis  played 19 innings yesterday, with
the Pirates winning 6-3 on a home run by Pedro Alvarez. The
victory puts the Pirates (67-54) two games ahead of the
Cardinals (65-56) for the last of two wild-card playoff berths
in the National League.  Giants Lose  The  San Francisco Giants  are 66-55 after losing to the San
Diego Padres 7-1 yesterday. The Giants are a half-game behind
the first-place  Los Angeles Dodgers  (67-55) in the NL West after
the Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 5-0.  The Braves (70-51) remain five games behind the NL-East
leading Washington Nationals, who beat the New York Mets 5-2 to
lift their record to 75-46.  The Chicago White Sox (65-55) remain 1 1/2 games ahead of
Detroit (64-57) in the AL Central, as the White Sox lost to the
Royals 5-2 and the Tigers fell to the Baltimore Orioles 7-5.  The Orioles (66-55) remain in position for the last of the
AL’s two wild card spots, a half-game ahead of the Oakland
Athletics, who beat the Indians 7-0 yesterday. The Tampa Bay
Rays currently hold the other wild card berth and are one game
ahead of Baltimore for second place in the AL East after beating
the  Los Angeles Angels  8-3 to complete a four-game series sweep.  To contact the reporter on this story:
