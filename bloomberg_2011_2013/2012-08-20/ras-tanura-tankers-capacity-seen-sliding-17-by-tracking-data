The capacity of  oil tankers  calling
at  Saudi Arabia ’s Ras Tanura, the world’s biggest crude-export
facility, slid 17 percent in the week to Aug. 11, according to
signals from the vessels.  Crude oil carriers with a total of 6.89 million deadweight
tons in transportation capacity, or 7.22 million barrels a day
assuming a conversion factor of 7.33 barrels a ton, called at
the facility during the period, according to the transmissions
captured by  IHS Inc. (IHS)  That compares with 8.35 million tons in the
preceding week.  Tankers shipping oil from the  Persian Gulf  can load at more
than one port, meaning not all the vessels listed below
necessarily collected all their cargoes at Ras Tanura.  The  Ras Tanura  complex, including Ras al-Ju’aymah, is the
largest global crude terminal, according to the website of Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco .  The first table below lists the destination countries of
tankers calling at Ras Tanura in the latest week as of about
10:30 a.m. London time today. The second table shows the
deadweight tonnage and carrying capacity in barrels of tankers
that called each week this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
