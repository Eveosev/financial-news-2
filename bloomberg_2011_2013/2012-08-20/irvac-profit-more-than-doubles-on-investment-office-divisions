Mirvac Group (MGR) , Australia’s third-
biggest diversified property trust by assets, said full-year
profit more than doubled after high occupancies boosted income
at its office division and the value of investment properties
rose.  Net income  rose to A$416.1 million ($436 million) in the 12
months ended June 30, from A$182.3 million a year earlier, the
Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange today. The forecast was for a profit of A$362.5 million,
according to the average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Since 2008, we have been unwavering in our focus to
simplify the group’s operations,” Managing Director Nick Collishaw said in the statement. The result “highlights the
progress that has been made.”  Mirvac  shares  fell 1.6 percent to A$1.3475 as of 12:43 p.m.
in Sydney, paring this year’s gain to 14 percent,  compared  with
an 8.1 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  The group said last week that Collishaw will step down on
Oct. 31 and will be replaced by Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz. It earlier
appointed Greg Dyer as finance director, replacing Justin Mitchell, who will leave the company on Oct. 1.  Mirvac, which raised A$300 million from the sale of its
hotels division in May, will sell about A$200 million of assets
that don’t meet its forecasts or strategy every year, Collishaw
said in a telephone interview.  The company, which tested interest for the 50 percent it
holds in the Travelodge Fund -- co-owned by Insurance  Australia 
Group Ltd.’s NRMA unit and managed by Toga Hotels -- is now
“comfortable sitting on the returns” from the fund, Andrew Butler, Mirvac’s chief executive officer for investments, said
in the interview. He declined to say if Mirvac had received an
offer from NRMA for the stake.  Mirvac will pay a dividend of 8.4 Australian cents for the
year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
