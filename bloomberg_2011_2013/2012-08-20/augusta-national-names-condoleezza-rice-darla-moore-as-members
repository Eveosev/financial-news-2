Augusta National Golf Club has
admitted former U.S. Secretary of State  Condoleezza Rice  and
Darla Moore, a partner at private investment firm Rainwater Inc.
as its first female members.  “We are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates for
membership at Augusta National,’’ Chairman of Augusta National
and the Masters Tournament Billy Payne said in an e-mailed
statement. “Consideration with regard to any candidate is
deliberate, held in strict confidence and always takes place
over an extended period of time. The process for Condoleezza and
Darla was no different.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
