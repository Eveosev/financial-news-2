Nicole Wong , an analyst at CLSA 
Asia-Pacific Markets in  Hong Kong , talks about China's real 
estate market and developers' stocks.  China’s new-home prices rose in the largest number of 
cities in 14 months in July after interest-rate cuts and 
incentives for first-time buyers, complicating the government’s
efforts to stimulate economic growth while curbing property 
speculation. Wong speaks with Zeb Eckert on Bloomberg 
Television's "On the Move Asia." (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 04:07
