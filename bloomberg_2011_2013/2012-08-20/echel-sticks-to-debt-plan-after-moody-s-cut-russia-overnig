OAO Mechel (MTL) ,  Russia ’s biggest coking
coal producer, will proceed with a plan to extend debt
maturities after Moody’s Investors Service lowered its credit
rating, Chief Financial Officer Stanislav Ploschenko said.  Mechel is looking to push out maturities without causing a
surge in its borrowing costs and would scrap the plan if it
becomes too expensive amid “tight” international  capital
markets , Ploschenko said. He declined to comment on Moody’s move
on Aug. 17 to downgrade Mechel one level to B2, or five levels
below investment grade.  “We will not sacrifice the economics just to get a longer
tenor,” Ploschenko said in an e-mailed message from Moscow on
Aug. 17. “We aim to extend the maturity, which may probably
entail certain refinancing, including in foreign currency.”  The coal producer’s shares fell 1.7 percent to 209.70
rubles by 1:44 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest intraday price since
Aug. 3. The stock was the worst performer on the  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies
listed in the U.S. last week, plunging 7.5 percent. The
benchmark index fell 0.4 percent to 94.60 on Aug. 17 and was
little changed from a week ago. The  RTS stock-index futures 
gained 0.7 percent to 142,150 on Aug. 17.  Mechel, Russia’s biggest producer of coking coal, has to
repay about $1.4 billion in bonds and loans by the end of the
year and $1.9 billion in 2013, according to a June 20
 presentation . The company said in June 20 that first-quarter
profit fell 29 percent as coal prices dropped and mines were
halted for safety checks.  ‘Optimal Combination’  Mechel’s ruble bonds due in June 2013 fell, raising the
yield 42 basis points to 13.41 percent, the highest since July
6. The yield on  Mechel (MTLR) ’s bond puttable in 2015 jumped 38 basis
points to 13.91 percent.  “We’ll look for the optimal combination of tenor and
interest rate,” Ploschenko said. “We will try to avoid short-
term debt for its cheapness anyway, as it is not advisable in
the market with volatile liquidity.”  Mechel’s $2 billion syndicated loan, which the company
started to repay in June 2011, has shrunk to “slightly more
than $1.5 billion due to monthly amortization,” Ploschenko
said.  The company, which also produces steel and pig iron, nickel
and chrome, will spend $593 million to repay the first tranche
of the loan this year and next, Mechel’s press service said by
e-mail on Aug. 17. It will spend $1.2 billion to repay the
second tranche of the loan in 2012 through 2015, it said.  “All issues regarding covenants on the syndicated loan
have been settled,” Ploschenko said, declining to comment
further. “The payments are made regularly and on schedule.”  ‘Major Investor Concern’  Moody’s Investors Service cut Mechel’s  credit rating  from
B1 with a stable outlook, citing declining coal and steel prices
as well as the company’s refinancing risk. The rating company
also cited risks associated with the potential consolidation of
Estar Group, which owns seven small  steel mills , according to
the statement.  “Mechel’s debt is a major investor concern,” Denis Gabrielik, an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp., said by phone
from Moscow on Aug. 17. “The very possible consolidation with
Estar is their second-biggest concern. If that happens, Mechel’s
target price would be reduced.”  Mechel’s ADRs traded at a 1.4 percent discount to the
company’s Moscow-listed shares on Aug. 17, the most since Aug.
2. One ADR represents one ordinary share.  Russia ETF Falls  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded fund
that holds Russian shares, fell 0.5 percent to $27.89, trimming
the weekly decline to 0.1 percent. The RTS Volatility Index,
which measures expected swings in  stock futures , rose 2 percent
to 30.24.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  jumped 15 percent last week, its biggest
weekly gain since listing in  New York  in April 2010, after
Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s Altimo increased its stake
in VimpelCom. The stock gained 7.8 percent to $10.80 on Aug. 17,
the highest since Apr. 9.  Oil for September delivery climbed for a fifth day on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , increasing as much as 52 cents to
$96.53 a barrel, after gaining 0.4 percent to $96.01 a barrel on
Aug. 17, the highest settlement since May 11. The contract
expires tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
