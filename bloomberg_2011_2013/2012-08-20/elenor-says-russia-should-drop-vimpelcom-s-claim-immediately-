Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic countries’
biggest phone operator, said Russian regulators should drop
“immediately” their lawsuit against the company and should
allow  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  to pay 2011 dividends.  Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service, known as FAS, is disputing
the Nordic company’s right to raise its stake after it bought
11.3 percent of VimpelCom from Weather Investments II in
February. A Moscow court banned Amsterdam-based VimpelCom’s
Russian unit from paying dividends on 2011 profits because of
the shareholders’ dispute.  “We believe the lawsuit should be dropped and injunctions
withdrawn immediately,”  Dag Melgaard , an Oslo-based spokesman
for Telenor, said by e-mail today.  Altimo’s Vice President Evgeny Dumalkin said via e-mail his
company is preparing to issue a statement on Telenor’s claim
later today. FAS spokeswoman Darya Silkova declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News by phone outside of normal
business hours in Moscow.  Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo, which had
initiated proceedings against Telenor, said on April 15 it
raised its stake in VimpelCom to 40.5 percent of the voting
rights by purchasing 305 million shares from Egyptian
billionaire Naquib Sawiris’s Weather Investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
