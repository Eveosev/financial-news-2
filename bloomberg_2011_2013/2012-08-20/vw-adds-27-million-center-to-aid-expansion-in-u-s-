Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
carmaker, opened a $27 million technical center in California
today to expand its engineering capabilities in the region as
part of a push to accelerate U.S. sales.  The 64,000-square-foot (5,946-square-meter) Test Center
California in Oxnard, 62 miles (100 kilometers) north of Los
Angeles, initially will be staffed by 50 engineers and
technicians, VW said today in a statement. An additional 250
engineers from Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW’s Audi, Bentley,
Bugatti and Lamborghini brands will also use the test center,
said Darryll Harrison, a Volkswagen spokesman.  “The expansion of our global R&D footprint in the U.S.
reinforces our ongoing commitment to this market and will help
to position us as a high quality brand here and abroad,” David Geanacopoulos, executive vice president for Volkswagen’s U.S.
unit, said in the statement.  The Oxnard facility is part of what VW says is a $4 billion
program to boost its market share in the U.S., where it trails
Asian competitors including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Honda Motor Co. (7267) 
and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  VW-brand sales are up 34 percent this year
through July, following the 2011 opening of a $1 billion auto-
assembly plant in Tennessee and addition of a new Passat sedan.
VW wants to become the world’s largest automaker by 2018.  VW’s Test Center California has laboratories for emissions
testing and parts analysis, a workshop with more than 16 in-
ground lifts, and a dealer service and training center, the
company said. It will also do research on electric-vehicle
systems and bio-diesel, Harrison said in a phone interview.  Volkswagen also has a facility in  Auburn Hills ,  Michigan ,
that includes a technical-support staff and a test track as well
as a proving ground in  Arizona . The carmaker’s U.S. unit is
based in Herndon, Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
