Homicides in  Mexico  increased last
year at the slowest pace since 2007, showing that the nation may
be stemming the rise in violence spurred by the war against drug
cartels and organized crime.  Murders rose 5.6 percent to 27,199, according to
 preliminary data  released today by the nation’s statistics
agency, known as Inegi. The number includes deaths from the drug
conflict as well as other slayings. The increase compares with
homicides that soared 30 percent in 2010, 41 percent in 2009 and
58 percent in 2008, after falling 15 percent in 2007.  “It’s a positive development that the time of dramatic
increases seems to be over,” Michael Werz, a senior fellow on
the national security team at the Center for American Progress
in  Washington , said in a phone interview. “One thing is the
numbers, but the other is the perception of fear. The fear is
still very strong and very widespread.”  Slayings linked to drug cartels have soared since President
 Felipe Calderon  sent troops to fight crime groups when he took
office in December 2006. The fight against organized crime has
led to more than 47,000 deaths in the past five years, according
to the attorney general’s office, with drug gangs using
beheadings and Internet videos of executions to intimidate
rivals, the public and police.  Murder Rate  Mexico had 24 homicides per 100,000 people in 2011, up from
23 per 100,000 inhabitants a year earlier. That compares with
91.6 killings per 100,000 residents in Honduras, 69.2 in El
Salvador, 38.5 in  Guatemala  and 25 in the Dominican Republican,
according to data compiled by the  United Nations . The U.S. had
4.2 murders per 100,000 people in 2010, the most recent year
included in UN data.  Chihuahua, a northern state bordering  Texas  and the home of
 Ciudad Juarez , the most violent city in the drug war, was
Mexico’s deadliest region in 2011, with 4,502 homicides, or 131
per 100,000 people. Still, that reflects a 30 percent drop in
killings from a peak in 2010.  Enrique Pena Nieto, winner of the July 1 presidential
election, has said he’ll change tactics in the drug war,
reducing violence by focusing on the worst crimes such as murder
and kidnapping and eventually returning the army to the
barracks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
