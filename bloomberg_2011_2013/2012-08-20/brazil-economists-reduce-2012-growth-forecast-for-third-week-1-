Analysts covering  Brazil ’s economy
cut their 2012 growth forecast for the third straight week, even
after recent signs that the economy may be picking up speed.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand by 1.75
percent, according to the median estimate in a central bank
survey of about 100 analysts published today, down from last
week’s estimate of 1.81 percent. The economists have reduced
their growth estimates in 13 out of 15 weeks since May 7, and
have held their estimates steady in the other two.  Since last August, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration has cut the benchmark Selic rate to a record low
8 percent, pressured commercial banks to increase lending and
cut taxes on  consumer goods  to fuel growth in the world’s
second-largest emerging market. Recent economic indicators
signal that the measures may be taking effect.  Retail sales in June rose the most since January on higher
furniture and appliances sales. Brazil’s seasonally adjusted
economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic product,
rose 0.75 percent in June, the fastest pace since March 2011.
Last week,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  raised its growth forecast for
the second quarter to 0.4 percent from 0.2 percent.  Inflation as measured by the IPCA index quickened in July
to 5.2 percent, as adverse weather in Brazil and the U.S. drove
up food prices. Price increases will slow to the central bank’s
inflation target of 4.5 percent by year-end, central bank
President Alexandre Tombini said on Aug. 17.  Economists in the survey boosted their 2012 inflation
forecast for the sixth straight week to 5.15 percent from 5.11
percent last week.  The central bank forecasts growth of 2.5 percent this year,
down from 2.7 percent last year and 7.5 percent in 2010. The
economy will be growing at a 4 percent annual pace by year-end
and will enter 2013 at “cruising speed,” Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  told reporters on Aug 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
