An Iranian crude oil-tanker signaled
it’s sailing for  Singapore  after calling at Kharg Island, the
Persian Gulf country’s biggest export facility, ship-tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Leadership, a very large crude carrier controlled by
Tehran-based National Iranian Tanker Co., can go as low as 22.5
meters when filled with a 2 million barrel cargo. The vessel
signaled for Singapore on Aug. 15 with a draft of 22 meters,
according to data from  IHS Inc. (IHS) , an Englewood, Colorado-based
research company. It had a draft of 11.3 meters on Aug. 14 and
the depth change suggests cargo was loaded.  At least 16 tankers calling at Iranian oil terminals
unloaded or delivered cargoes in India, China, or Japan this
month, or are signaling they’ll arrive at Asian destinations in
August, according to the tracking data.  Europe  banned insurance cover of risks including oil spills
for Iranian cargoes from July 1 while the U.S. imposed financial
and trade sanctions on Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
