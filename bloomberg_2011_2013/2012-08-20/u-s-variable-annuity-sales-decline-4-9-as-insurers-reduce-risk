U.S. variable annuity sales fell 4.9
percent in the second quarter as insurers cut benefits to reduce
the companiesâ€™ risk from the equity-linked retirement products.  Sales were $38.6 billion in the three months ended June 30,
compared with $40.6 billion a year earlier, trade group Limra
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
