Corn demand for ethanol may be 10
percent lower than the U.S. government estimates because
declining oil prices are curbing demand for the biofuel while
the U.S. may reduce its blend requirements, Capital Economics
Ltd. said.  Corn prices may slide to $6.75 a bushel as demand declines,
the London-based researcher said today in an e-mailed report.
The grain rallied to a record $8.49 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade on Aug. 10 after severe drought spurred the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  to cut its outlook for domestic
production. The USDA estimates that 4.5 billion bushels of corn
will be used to make ethanol in the 2012-13 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
