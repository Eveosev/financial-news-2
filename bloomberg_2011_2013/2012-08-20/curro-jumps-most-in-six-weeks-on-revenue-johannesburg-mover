Curro Holdings Ltd. (COH) , which owns and
operates private schools in  South Africa , rose the most in six
weeks after the company doubled first-half revenue as it bought
more schools and grew enrollment.  The shares advanced 12 percent to 18.20 rand, the biggest
intraday gain since July 9. It traded at 17.75 rand by 1:34 p.m.
in Johannesburg, extending its surge this year to 73 percent.  Revenue increased to 161 million rand ($19.4 million) in
the six months through June 30, the company said in a statement
today. Its loss per share dropped to 1.8 cents from 9.5 cents a
year earlier. Pupils attending Curro’s schools and colleges
catapulted 125 percent as it spent 408 million rand expanding
the number of campuses it operates around the country to 22.  “You have to look at the growth in revenue and learners
for an indication of what’s going to happen in the future,”
Byron Lotter, a portfolio manager at Vestact Asset Management in
Johannesburg, said by phone. “You would expect from this number
that in the next reporting period they will make a profit if
they carry on this way, but they are trading under cautionary so
they could be making another purchase at some stage.”  Curro said the 476 million rand raised in a rights offer
last month will be used to make more acquisitions in the private
school market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
