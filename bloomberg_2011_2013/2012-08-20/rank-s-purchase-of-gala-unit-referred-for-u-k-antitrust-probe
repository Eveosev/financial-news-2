Rank Group Plc (RNK) ’s proposal to buy the
casino unit of Gala Coral Group Ltd. for 205 million pounds
($322 million) was referred by a U.K. regulator for a full
antitrust review.  The deal may “substantially reduce competition in the
casino sector” and should be investigated by the U.K.
Competition Commission, Britain’s  Office of Fair Trading , which
conducts initial merger reviews, said in a statement today.  “The OFT is concerned that the merger would reduce
competition both at a national level and in nine local areas,”
the watchdog said. “A reduction in competition in the casino
sector could result in a worse deal for consumers.”  Rank offered to buy 23 casinos in the U.K. and three non-
operating licenses, the Maidenhead, U.K.-based gambling and
bingo group said in May. The company said it would finance the
purchase with new three-year bank facilities totaling 175
million pounds, as well as existing loans.  Marc Cohen, a Rank spokesman, declined to comment when
reached by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
