Diesel fell in  Chicago  for the sixth
straight day as lower agricultural demand hasn’t supported a
jump in prices following refinery outages last month.  The worst U.S. drought in 56 years has reduced crop yields
in millions of acres of U.S. cropland and pasture, hurting
demand for Chicago diesel.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel in the Chicago spot market sank
2.87 cents to 8.38 cents a gallon over heating oil futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:14 p.m.  New York 
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “From a supply side perspective there are some things to
keep it propped up, but the demand is just not there,” Steve
Mosby, vice president of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC in
Kansas City, Missouri, said in a telephone interview.  It’s the smallest premium since July 23, when  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Whiting refinery in Indiana, the largest in the Midwest, shut
its coker following a fire. The gap rose to 20 cents a gallon on
Aug. 2 and 3, which is tied with June 7 for the year-to-date
high.  The unit started Aug. 9, and diesel’s premium in Chicago
has fallen every day since Aug. 10.  “I’ve been loading diesel fast and furious the last two
weeks, trying to get everything I own in a truck,” Mosby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
