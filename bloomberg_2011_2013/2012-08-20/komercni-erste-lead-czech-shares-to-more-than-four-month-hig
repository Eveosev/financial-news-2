Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  led Czech shares
down from a four-month high as the Bundesbank’s opposition to
the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program raised concern
policymakers will fail to stem the region’s debt crisis.  Erste of  Austria  slumped 3.2 percent, the most this month,
to 398 koruna at the close in Prague.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , Societe
Generale SA’s Czech unit, slid 0.9 percent. The  PX (PX)  equity index,
in which the two lenders have a 39 percent weighting, retreated
1 percent, after earlier touching the highest since April 4.  Stocks fell globally and Spanish bonds pared gains after
the German central bank said that the ECB’s plan will pose
“significant stability risks” for the euro area, highlighting
the rift among policy makers over ways to end the debt crisis.
The region is the biggest buyer of Czech exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
