Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s ruling party has accepted a proposal from
billionaire opposition leader Bidzina Ivanishvili to hold
televised debates before October’s parliamentary elections.  Prime Minister Vano Merabishvili and parliament speaker
Davit Bakradze will represent the president’s National Movement,
Chiora Taktakishvili, a spokeswoman for the ruling party, said
today by phone from Tbilisi, the capital.  Ivanishvili wants Saakashvili to participate in the
debates, Maya Panjikidze, the billionaire’s spokeswoman, said by
phone. The president won’t do so as the elections are
parliamentary, according to Taktakishvili.  Forty-three percent of likely voters would back
Saakashvili’s party, according to a poll of 1,503 people carried
out in June and July by the International Republican Institute.
Ivanishvili’s party had 24 percent backing, according to the
survey, which had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
