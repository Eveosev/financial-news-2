Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp. (322) , the maker of “Master Kong”-branded instant noodles and
beverages, reported a 24 percent increase in first-half profit
on falling raw material costs. The stock rose.  Net income rose to $284.4 million in the six months ended
in June from $229 million a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. That beat the $275.8
million average of five  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue climbed 9.5 percent to $4.53 billion.  Tingyi is using its 57 percent of the Chinese instant
noodle market to capture rising consumer demand for premium
foods with higher profit margins, according to analysts at BOCOM
International Holdings Co. Ltd. The foodmaker announced last
November a tie-up with  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  under which a Tingyi unit
 became  the franchise bottler of its drinks in  China .  “Riding on its massive distribution complex, extensive
food and beverage collection and expansive capacity, Tingyi
should continue to shine,” said Summer Wang, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at BOCOM, ahead of the earnings announcement.  Tingyi shares rose as much as 4.2 percent to HK$20.70
before trading at HK$20.50 at 1:08 p.m. local time. The
benchmark  Hang Seng  index dropped 0.8 percent.  Beverage Alliance  The beverage alliance is designed to boost PepsiCo’s market
share in China where the Purchase, New York-based company was
the fourth-largest soft-drink maker with 4.9 percent share last
year. Coca-Cola and Tingyi led the China soft drink market with
15.8 percent and 13.1 percent share in 2011, respectively, data
from London-based researcher Euromonitor International show.  Under the deal, PepsiCo will transfer equity interests in
its bottling operations in China to Tingyi beverage subsidiary
Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. In exchange PepsiCo will
receive a 5 percent stake in Tingyi-Asahi, with an option to
increase that to 20 percent by October 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
