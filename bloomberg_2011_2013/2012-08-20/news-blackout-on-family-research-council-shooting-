Family Research Council President Tony Perkins  told   Fox News  that a shooting last week at his group's Washington headquarters has mostly been ignored by non-Fox media. I'm no fan of the FRC's dehumanization crusade against gays, but Perkins has a point. If news reports are accurate, the shooter walked into the FRC building lobby, told a security guard, “I don’t like your politics,” and shot him in the arm. That's a more explicitly political shooting than either the Aurora movie theater or Gabby Giffords  shootings  -- albeit without the mass casualties. If the politics were different, if a right-winger had shot a lobby guard downstairs from the Human Rights Campaign or from the National Abortion Rights Action League, would the coverage be different?
