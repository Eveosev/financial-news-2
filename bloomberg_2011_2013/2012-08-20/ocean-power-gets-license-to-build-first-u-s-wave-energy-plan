Ocean Power Technologies Inc. (OPTT) 
received permission to build the first commercial wave-power
plant in the U.S.  The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  issued a 35-year
license for the company’s planned 1.5-megawatt power project
about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) off the coast of Reedsport,
 Oregon , Ocean Power said today in a statement.  The approval validates the Pennington, New Jersey-based
company’s technology to convert the motion of the sea into
electricity and may lead to additional commercial marine-energy
projects, said Chief Executive Officer Charles Dunleavy.  “The 35-year term of the license demonstrates the
commercial potential of wave power, and this will support
initiatives to secure financing for the project,” he said in
the statement.  The project comprises 10 of the company’s PowerBuoys
tethered to the sea bottom which generate power as waves and
tides move them up and down. It will generate enough power for
about 1,000 homes, according to Ocean Power.  Ocean Power shares rose 6.4 percent to $2.51 at the close
in  New York .  The first PowerBuoy, which received funding from the U.S.
Energy Department, is expected to be installed this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
