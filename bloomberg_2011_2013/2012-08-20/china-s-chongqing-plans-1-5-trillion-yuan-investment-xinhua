China ’s southwestern municipality of
Chongqing plans to boost industrial investment to 1.5 trillion
 yuan  ($235.9 billion) in the five years through 2015, the
official Xinhua News Agency said today, citing the local
government.  The investment will help Chongqing expand its total
industrial output beyond 3 trillion yuan, the report said.  China’s industrial-output growth unexpectedly slowed in
July to a three-year low while investment and retail sales
missed estimates, raising pressure on Premier Wen Jiabao to step
up efforts to support expansion. Chongqing’s industrial
investment plan will focus on building seven “big manufacturing
industries,” including electronic information, automotive,
equipment and parts manufacturing, oil refining, material and
energy industries, according to Xinhua.  The electronic information manufacturing industry, which
includes  notebook computers , will receive 300 billion yuan in
investment, while the car-manufacturing industry will receive
200 billion yuan, Xinhua said.  The equipment manufacturing sector will get an investment
boost of 250 billion yuan, and Chongqing’s oil and ethylene
refining sector will receive 150 billion yuan, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
