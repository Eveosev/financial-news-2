President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
campaign ended July with less money than it had at the beginning
of the month, according to U.S. Federal Election Commission
reports filed today.  After spending about $59 million in July, the campaign had
$88 million left in the bank. Presumptive Republican
presidential nominee  Mitt Romney  hasn’t yet filed his FEC
reports reflecting his July fundraising. He has until midnight
to do so. Romney’s campaign raised more than the president in
May and June, and both campaigns have said he also did so in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
