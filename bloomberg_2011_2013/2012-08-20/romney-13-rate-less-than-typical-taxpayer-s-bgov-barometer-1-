Mitt Romney  says he paid a tax rate
of at least 13 percent over the past decade, meaning the
millionaire Republican presidential candidate probably paid a
lower rate than the average U.S. household.  The BGOV Barometer shows the typical household paid a 17.4
percent federal tax rate in 2009, according to the nonpartisan
 Congressional Budget Office . That includes all federal levies,
such as the Social Security payroll tax, while Romney’s 13
percent only includes income taxes.  Once other federal taxes are included, Romney’s effective
rate is unlikely to top the U.S. average, said Edward Kleinbard,
a tax law professor at the University of  Southern California .  The main reason for Romney’s low relative tax rate is that
he derives so much of his income from investments, which are
taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, Kleinbard said. The
top income tax rate is 35 percent while  capital gains  are taxed
at 15 percent.  “It is surprising to me that we countenance a tax system
in which a private-equity specialist with $20 million in income
pays about the same tax rate as an average working family,”
Kleinbard said.  Andrea Saul, a Romney spokeswoman, didn’t respond to a
request for comment.  Romney’s Taxes  Under pressure from Democrats to release more information
about his personal finances, Romney said Aug. 16 that he has
reviewed his tax returns “and over the past 10 years I never
paid less than 13 percent.”  “Every year, I’ve paid at least 13 percent, and if you
add, in addition, the amount that goes to charity, why, the
number gets well above 20 percent,” he told reporters in a
question-and-answer session in Greer,  South Carolina .  Romney has released his 2010 tax return, which shows he
paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent on more than $21
million in income. He has said he will release his 2011 return
when it is completed, while rejecting calls from Democrats and
some Republicans that he release returns for additional years.  Romney’s financial disclosure statements have estimated his
wealth to be as much as $250 million.  President  Barack Obama  paid 20.5 percent in federal taxes
on $789,674 in adjusted gross income for 2011, he reported
earlier this year. U.S. Representative  Paul Ryan  of  Wisconsin ,
Romney’s choice for vice president, on Aug. 17 released
information showing he paid a 20 percent effective tax rate on
adjusted gross income of $323,416 for 2011.  Wide Variance  Tax rates vary widely because of the progressivity of the
U.S. tax system, Congressional Budget Office data shows. In
2009, the bottom 20 percent of taxpayers had an average 1
percent rate, largely because they didn’t earn enough to pay
income taxes though they paid payroll levies. The next quintile
paid 6.8 percent, according to a July report.  The middle quintile, which earned an average of about
$64,000, paid 11.1 percent. The next cohort paid 15.1 percent.
The highest quintile, with average income of about $224,000,
paid 23.2 percent and the top 1 percent, who earned an average
$1.2 million, paid 28.9 percent.  Many people overestimate how much they pay in taxes because
they confuse marginal rates with the percentage of their income
paid in taxes, said George Yin, a former staff director of the
congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The highest marginal
rate, for example, applies only to annual income topping about
$400,000, while income below that is taxed at lower rates. The
effective tax rate is the total share of income paid in taxes.  “That’s a very common mistake,” said Yin, now a law
professor at the  University of Virginia . “People tend to focus
a little too much on the marginal rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
