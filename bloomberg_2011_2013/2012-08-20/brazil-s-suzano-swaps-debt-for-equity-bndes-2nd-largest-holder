Suzano Papel e Celulose SA ,  Brazil ’s
second-largest pulpmaker, increased its number of shares
outstanding by 43 percent by converting bonds into equity,
making Brazil’s development bank its second-largest holder.  Suzano converted 1.2 billion reais ($600 million) in bonds
into 332.9 million shares, bringing its total shares outstanding
to 1.11 billion.  BNDES, Brazil’s development bank, held about 45 percent of
the convertible bonds and the swap takes its stake to about 18
percent of equity from 6.5 percent, according to data on
Suzano’s website. BNDES converted the bonds at 4 reais a share,
the data show.  Suzano is struggling to lower leverage after debt reached a
10-year high in the second quarter as the company pushes ahead
with expansion plans amid a slump in pulp demand. Suzano’s  net
debt  rose to 6.85 billion reais in the second quarter from a
year ago, and was 5.7 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.  Had BNDES waited until the end of the year to make the
conversion, it would have been at 17.39 reais a share, giving
the bank a lesser total stake of 7.6 percent in Suzano.  To contact the reporters on this story:
