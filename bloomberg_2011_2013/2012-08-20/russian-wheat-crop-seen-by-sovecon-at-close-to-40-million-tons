The Russian wheat output estimate
was cut to 39 million to 41 million metric tons due to drought,
according to Moscow-based researcher SovEcon.  That’s down from an earlier forecast for 40.5 million to
42.5 million tons, Andrei Sizov Jr., the consultancy’s managing
director, said in Moscow by phone today. The grain crop estimate
was revised to 71 million to 72.5 million tons from 70 million
to 74 million tons earlier this month, he said.  As the grain harvest continues in the Ural and Siberian
areas, it appears less likely that Russia will reap as much as
the 41.5 million tons of wheat it did in 2010, when it had the
worst drought in at least half a century, SovEcon said in a
 report  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
