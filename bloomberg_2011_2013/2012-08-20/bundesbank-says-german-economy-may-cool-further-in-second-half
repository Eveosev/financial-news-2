German economic growth may slow
further in the second half of the year as the sovereign debt
crisis takes its toll, the Bundesbank said.  “The prevailing uncertainty in the euro area could have a
more negative impact on economic activity in  Germany  in the
second half of the year,” the Bundesbank said in its monthly
report published today in Frankfurt. “However, as long as
demand for German products from non euro-area countries remains
essentially intact, a reversal of the cyclical trend in Germany
is highly unlikely.”  Growth in  Europe ’s largest economy slowed to 0.3 percent in
the second quarter from 0.5 percent in the first as demand from
euro-area trading partners waned. At the same time, companies
are tapping faster-growing markets outside Europe and
unemployment at a two-decade low is bolstering domestic
spending.  “In addition to ongoing strong construction activity, the
outlook for private consumption remains favorable,” the
Bundesbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
