Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
called for more transparent licensing procedures for coal
deposits as producers seek to upgrade and expand.  There are “lots of questions to the corresponding
government bodies” about the licensing process, Putin said
today at a meeting with coal miners in Moscow. “Much needs to
be done so this work can be carried out on a modern, decent
level, without any corruption schemes.”  The licensing process should be simpler and transparent so
companies could more easily expand their activities at deposits
where they are already working, Putin said, noting the success
of OAO Mechel, the country’s largest coking coal producer, in
developing the Elga deposit.  Russia will not leave its miners without support as the
global economic crisis damps demand, Putin said, meeting with
coal-industry workers.  Shares in  Mechel (MTLR) , which also produces steel, fell 2.1
percent to 209 rubles by 5:45 p.m. in Moscow, its lowest
intraday price since Aug. 3. OAO Novolipetsk Steel dropped 2.4
percent and the 30-stock Micex Index declined 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
