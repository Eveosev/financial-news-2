Corn futures rose to the highest in
more than a week and soybeans rallied on speculation that the
worst U.S. drought since 1956 will cause more crop damage than
the government forecast. Wheat also rallied.  Production of corn in the U.S., the world’s largest grower
and exporter, may be less than the 273.8 million metric tons
forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on Aug. 10, and
soybean output may slip below the 73.3 million tons predicted by
the agency, said Jamey Kohake, a broker at Paragon Investments.
Participants in the annual Professional Farmers of America tour
began a seven-state tour of Midwest fields today.  “There’s speculation about lower yields,” Kohake said by
telephone from Silver Lake,  Kansas . “The corn harvest yields
are pretty pathetic.”  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 2 percent to
settle at $8.2375 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching $8.25, the highest for a most-active
contract since rallying to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. The price
has jumped 63 percent since mid-June because of the drought.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.3 percent to
$16.835 a bushel in  Chicago . The price has gained 28 percent
since June 15. Soybean meal, used to feed livestock, jumped 2.6
percent to $512.80 per 2,000 pounds, after reaching a record
$513.50 today.  Wheat futures for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$9.0275 a bushel on the CBOT. The price had increased for four
straight sessions.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
