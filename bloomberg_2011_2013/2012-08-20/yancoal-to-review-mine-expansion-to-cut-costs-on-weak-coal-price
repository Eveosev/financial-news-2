Yancoal Australia Ltd. (YAL) , the third-
biggest standalone coal producer in Australia, is reviewing
expansion plans at its seven mines to help cut costs as
commodity prices decline.  “Expansion plans across all mines will be reviewed and
ranked to ensure that the appropriate capital expenditure
discipline is maintained,” the Sydney-based company said today
in a presentation sent to Australia’s stock exchange.  Coal prices fell during the first half as an economic
slowdown crimped demand. Metallurgical coal, used to make steel,
may remain weak in the current half, Yancoal said.  Coal production may be higher than last year, it said, as
new mines began output. Yancoal, controlled by China’s fourth-
largest coal producer  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171) , reported thermal
coal sales of 1.9 million metric tons during the June quarter,
29 percent higher than last year, and coking coal sales of 2.1
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
