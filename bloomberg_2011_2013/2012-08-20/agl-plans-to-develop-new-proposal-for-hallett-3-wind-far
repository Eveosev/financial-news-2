AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) , developer of the
A$1 billion ($1.05 billion) Macarthur wind farm in the
Australian state of Victoria, plans to devise a new proposal for
the Hallett 3 wind farm site to use larger and more efficient
 wind turbines .  The company decided not to proceed with the project as
previously approved because wind turbine technology has
improved, AGL said in a  statement  posted on its website today.  The 33-turbine wind farm proposal is located in mid-north
South Australia. Timing of the submission for a new application
will depend on the companyâ€™s other development options, AGL
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
