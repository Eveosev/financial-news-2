Corn gained on speculation rain in
the U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter, will fail
to improve yields after the worst drought in a half-century
scorched crops. Soybeans rose to a one-week high.  Ten percent of the U.S. corn crop already reached  maturity 
by Aug. 12, the final stage before harvest, and only 23 percent
of fields were in good or excellent  condition , the worst rating
for the date since 1988, the Department of Agriculture said Aug.
13. The USDA will update its weekly crop progress report today.
Parts of Illinois and Indiana had 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) of
 rain  in the past seven days,  National Weather Service  data show.  “Recent rains across the U.S. Midwest has helped temper
production fears, however the yield losses from drought earlier
in the season are largely locked in,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in a note
today. Drought affects 87 percent of U.S. corn crops, the
National Climatic Data Center said Aug. 16.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to $8.1325 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 12:56 p.m.  London  time.
Earlier today, the grain touched $8.1825, the highest price
since Aug. 10, when the USDA slashed its production outlook for
U.S. crops, sending prices as high as a record $8.49 a bushel.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$16.585 a bushel, after earlier today touching $16.635, also the
highest price since Aug. 10.  Corn output will drop to a six-year low of 10.78 billion
bushels this year while soybean production may total 2.692
billion bushels, the least since 2007, according to the USDA.  Thunderstorms may bring  rain  to parts of Iowa and  Illinois 
today, with additional showers from storms starting Aug. 23,
according to the National Weather Service. Those are the two
largest U.S. corn and soybean growing states.  Russian Harvest  December-delivery wheat fell 0.1 percent to $8.9325 a
bushel in Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat
gained 0.2 percent to 263.25 euros ($323.93) a metric ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Russia , the world’s third-biggest wheat exporter last
season, may reap a smaller harvest than the 41.5 million tons
gathered in 2010, when a severe drought spurred the country to
halt grain exports for 10 months, Moscow-based researcher
SovEcon said today in a report.  To contact the reporter for this story:
