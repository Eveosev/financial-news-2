Dry weather this week in  Brazil â€™s
corn and sugar-cane regions will aid the harvest, the weather
consultant Somar Meteorologia said today.  Sugar-cane productivity is rising because of the lack of
rain, Somar said in a report sent by e-mail. The corn harvest
for the winter crop has reached 85 percent, Somar said in a
separate e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
