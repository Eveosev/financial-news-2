Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s co-Chief
Executive Officer Anshu Jain joined the board of directors of
the  Institute of International Finance , which represents more
than 450 financial companies.  Jain’s appointment to the Washington-based organization’s
board was announced in an e-mailed statement from the IIF today.  Josef Ackermann , 64, was Deutsche Bank’s CEO before handing
over control to Jain, 49, and Juergen Fitschen, 63, at the end
of May. Ackermann also served as chairman of the IIF before
ceding the post to HSBC Holdings Plc Chairman Douglas Flint in
June.  The IIF, founded 29 years ago, played a key role in helping
to negotiate a restructuring of Greece’s debt this year as
Charles Dallara, IIF’s managing director, led negotiations on
behalf of bondholders. Dallara said in June he intends to
resign.  Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, is Germany’s biggest
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
