(Corrects full name of Apollo in second paragraph.)  CVC Capital Partners Ltd.’s planned
sale of printing-ink maker Flint Group has stalled after
potential buyout firms including Bain Capital Partners LLC
withdrew from the process, three people close to the talks said.  Bain,  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and  Carlyle Group LP (CG) 
backed out at the second-round stage, said two of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. CVC also received interest from an Asian company, though
the potential for a transaction remains unclear, the people
said.  CVC’s attempt to exit coincided with an economic slowdown
in  Europe , which forced Luxembourg-based Flint to shelve an
initial public offering in 2010. CVC built the asset from two
European ink companies bought in 2004 and merged with Flint Ink
Corp. in the U.S. a year later to form the enlarged group. The
company makes inks and plates for packaging and print media.  Flint had sales of 2.2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) last
year. Deutsche Bank AG and  Greenhill & Co. (GHL)  are advising CVC on
the sale. Altana AG, which last year purchased water-based
specialty printing ink maker Color Chemie Group, hasn’t pursued
the asset, one of the people said.  Spokesmen for CVC, Apollo, Bain declined to comment, and a
spokeswoman for Carlyle wasn’t available to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
