The  Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders
Index (BEUHBLD)  climbed to the highest in four years, led by  Bovis (BVS)  Homes
Group Plc. The U.K. homebuilder doubled its dividend and said
profits would rise further in the second half, even as a report
showed asking prices for homes fell in August.  The index gained as much as 0.9 percent to 134.4, the
highest since September 2008. Bovis has added about 15 percent
this year, the smallest increase among the seven companies in
the index, which is up 35 percent. Bovis advanced as much as 3.7
percent to 511 pence today, the highest since March 27.  Net income doubled to 11.9 million pounds ($15 million) in
the first half on higher revenue and improved margins, the
Longfield, England-based company said in a statement today.
Second-half profit will increase “significantly,” assuming
market conditions are stable, Bovis Chief Executive Officer
David Ritchie said in the statement.  U.K. home sellers cut asking prices by a record in August
after the  London   Olympic Games  and an uncertain economic outlook
distracted potential buyers, Rightmove Plc said today. Average
asking prices in England and  Wales  fell 2.4 percent to 236,260
pounds from July, when values declined 1.7 percent, the operator
of Britain’s biggest property website said.  Bovis reported an average sales price of 164,400 pounds for
the first half, up from 163,400 pounds a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
