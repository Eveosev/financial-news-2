The U.S. and  South Korea  began
annual military exercises today, two days after North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un praised the army unit responsible for killing
four South Koreans in 2010.  A total of 33,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and
other bases will participate in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian
drills that run until Aug. 31, the  United Nations  Combined
Forces Command said in an e-mailed statement. North Korea was
informed of the training’s “non-provocative nature,” according
to the statement, which didn’t give South Korean troop numbers.  North Korea routinely vows retaliation against the drills,
saying they provoke conflict in the region. North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un toured military units on western border islands and
told them to prepare for “sacred war” should “even a single
shell” hit the country’s territory, the official Korean Central
News Agency said Aug. 18.  The islands Kim toured included the one closest to South
Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island, which  North Korea  shelled in November
2010, killing two South Korean soldiers and two civilians.  South Korea will simultaneously hold an annual four-day
exercise starting today to rehearse government contingency plans
for national emergencies. About 410,000 bureaucrats in  3,500
public offices will participate, according to the Ministry of
Public Administration and Security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
