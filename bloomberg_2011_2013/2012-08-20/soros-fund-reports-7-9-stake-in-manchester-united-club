Fund Management LLC bought 7.9 percent of the Class A shares in
Manchester United, the English soccer club that had an initial
public offering this month.  The New York-based family office for Soros disclosed the
stake in the 134-year-old team in a regulatory filing today.
Manchester United, which has won a record 19 championships,
raised $233.3 million in its U.S. offering on Aug. 9. The shares
have tumbled 6.7 percent since the IPO.  The IPO price gave the Glazer family’s team an enterprise
value of $2.9 billion, about $1 billion more than the value of
Spain’s Real Madrid, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Forbes. The Glazer family bought the team in 2005 and has 99
percent of the  voting rights . The company is using the proceeds
of the stock sale to pay down debt.  Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking a comment.  Everton today defeated Manchester United 1-0 to complete
the first round of games in the English Premier League soccer
season. It’s the fourth time in 21 attempts that Everton has
beaten United in the Premier League at Goodison Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
