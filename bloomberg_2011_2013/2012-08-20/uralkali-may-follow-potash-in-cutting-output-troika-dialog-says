OAO Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
potash producer by volume, may cut third-quarter output because
of weaker demand, Troika Dialog said.  “The strength in agricultural commodities has not yet
filtered through to a firmer supply demand balance in potash,
and there are indications the underlying market remains pretty
soft,”  Mikhail Stiskin , an analyst at Troika Dilaog, wrote in a
report today. Indian demand has been hurt by a revised subsidy
system, while  China ’s buyers are also “in no hurry to sign up
for new shipments,” he said.  Potash Corp. (POT)  of Saskatchewan Inc. said last week it will
shut down the Lanigan mine for a month. The closure will remove
275,000 metric tons of potash from the market, according to
Troika estimates.  “It is becoming increasingly obvious that Uralkali may not
be able to maintain its production volumes at the level of the
second quarter when it produced 2.9 million tons operating at
full capacity,” Stiskin said.  Uralkali declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
