Serbia ’s current-account deficit
widened in the first six months of the year as investors
withdrew funds.  The shortfall in the current account grew 45 percent to
1.89 billion euros ($2.33 billion), or 14 percent of gross
domestic product, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said
on its website today. The gap in the first quarter was 16.8
percent of GDP.  The balance of payments showed negative direct investment
for a sixth consecutive month, with a cumulative outflow of 138
million euros, the bank said.  The central bank is forecasting a full-year current account
deficit of 3.1 billion euros, or 10.7 percent of GDP, compared
with a previous estimate of 8.6 percent of GDP, Branko Hinic,
the bank’s head of monetary analysis, said on Aug. 15.  The current account deficit was expanding because of
capital outflows, low levels of investment from outside Serbia
and weaker exports, Hinic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
