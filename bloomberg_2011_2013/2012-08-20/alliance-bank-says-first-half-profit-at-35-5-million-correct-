AO Alliance Bank, the first Kazakh
lender to default in the 2009 financial slump, said it returned
to profit in the first half as it bought back debt and increased
its loan portfolio.  Net income for the period reached 5.31 billion tenge ($35.5
million) compared with a loss of 4.36 billion tenge in the first
six months of last year, the Almaty-based lender said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna is
discussing a merger of Alliance Bank and  Temirbank (TEBN) , both of
which issued new bonds and offered shares and cash to creditors
in 2010 after writing off and extending payments on some of
their debt. The fund holds the government’s 67 percent of
Alliance and 79.9 percent of Temirbank after the banks were
brought under state control in 2009.  Alliance Bank had a net gain on the repurchase of bonds of
3.06 billion tenge after buying back 16.4 billion tenge of bonds
with a carrying value of 19.5 billion tenge of bonds in the
first half, the bank said in the report on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
