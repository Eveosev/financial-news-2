Aetna Inc. (AET) , the third-biggest U.S.
health plan, agreed to buy  Coventry Health Care Inc. (CVH)  for $7.3
billion including debt, the Wall Street Journal reported today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Aetna will pay $42.08 a share for Coventry, the newspaper
reported. That represents a 20 percent premium over Coventry’s
closing price of $34.94 on Aug. 17, which gave the Bethesda,
Maryland-based company a market value of $4.68 billion. Aetna’s
purchase will be a mix of 65 percent cash, and 35 percent stock,
and an announcement is due later today, the WSJ said.  The Hartford, Connecticut-based health insurer would join
competitors  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  and  Cigna Corp. (CI)  in making
acquisitions amid President  Barack Obama ’s health-care overhaul.
WellPoint said last month it would buy Medicaid insurer
 Amerigroup Corp. (AGP)  for $4.9 billion, and Cigna bought Medicare
specialist Healthspring Inc. for $3.8 billion in January. Aetna
Chief Financial Officer Joseph Zubretsky said in an interview
last month that he was open to an acquisition of any size as
long as it’s a “strategic fit.”  Aetna declined 0.3 percent to $38.04 at the close in New
York on Aug. 17, giving the company a market value of $12.7
billion. The company’s shares have declined 9.8 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
