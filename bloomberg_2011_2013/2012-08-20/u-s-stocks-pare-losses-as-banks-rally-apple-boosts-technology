U.S. stocks pared losses as banks
recovered from earlier declines and a rally in Apple Inc. lifted
technology shares.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent to
1,417.36 at 2:34 p.m. New York time, after dropping as much as
0.4 percent earlier. The U.S. equity benchmark on Aug. 17 came
within one point of a four-year high set in April.  Equities fell earlier amid investor concern that European
leaders will fail to quell the region’s debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
