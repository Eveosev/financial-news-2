GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) ,  Germany ’s third-
largest residential landlord by market value, reported a second-
quarter profit after rental income increased and it sold
properties.  Net income was 16.3 million euros ($20 million), or 34
cents a share, compared with a restated loss of 4.4 million
euros, or 11 cents, a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today. GSW, based in Berlin, said it will post 2012
funds from operations excluding divestments of 61 million euros
to 64 million euros, compared with an earlier forecast of 59
million euros to 63 million euros.  The company only operates in Berlin and is benefiting from
rising demand for homes in Germany’s capital. Apartment rents
have gained about 8 percent in the past year and 26 percent in
five years, according to Berlin-based online broker
ImmobilienScout24.  Net rental income rose to 39.2 million euros in the second
quarter from 34.8 million euros a year earlier. Income from
property sales increased to 2.7 million euros from 1.3 million
euros a year earlier.  Funds from operations excluding divestments, a measure of a
company’s ability to generate cash, climbed 12 percent to 32.6
million euros in the first half.  Cerberus Capital  GSW, which has 53,000 apartments valued at about 2.9
billion euros, was owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP and
funds managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. until an initial
public offering in April 2011.  The company said in May it plans to increase the number of
homes it owns by as many as 7,000, or 13 percent. Joerg Schwagenscheidt, GSW’s chief operating officer, said on a
conference call today that he’s “optimistic” talks will lead
to an acquisition.  GSW fell 1.1 percent to 30.39 euros at 2:18 p.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The shares have gained about 39 percent this
year, while the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT’s  index of German real estate
companies  has advanced 27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
