Peru ’s sol held near a 15-year high
as exporters bought the currency to pay local income tax before
a monthly deadline.  The currency climbed almost 0.1 percent to 2.6115 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close of trading, from 2.6130 on Aug. 17,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. It has gained 3.2
percent this year.  “The flow of dollars for the payment of taxes should start
to dry up now,” said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru. The currency will likely trade between
2.61 and 2.615 this week, with the central bank buying dollars
in the  spot market  to prevent bigger swings, Diaz said.  The central bank last bought dollars Aug. 16 as the sol
gained. It touched 2.611 the next day, the strongest level since
1997,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show. The central
bank didn’t purchase any dollars today.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 4.62
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
