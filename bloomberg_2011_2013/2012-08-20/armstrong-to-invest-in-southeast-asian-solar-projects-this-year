Armstrong Asset Management  expects
to start investing in small-scale clean energy projects in
 Southeast Asia  by the end of the year.  “We are looking at Malaysian and Thai solar projects and
Indonesian mini-hydro,” said Andrew Affleck, a managing partner
at Armstrong in  Singapore . The fund expects to complete two
deals by the end of 2012, investing as much as $24 million.  Malaysia  and  Thailand  are among nations offering favorable
project returns because of “generous” subsidies for renewable
energy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a February report.
Typically, every megawatt of renewables requires $2 million to
$2.5 million of investment to bring into operation, Affleck said
in a phone interview last week.  “In Malaysia, we are working on a portfolio where over the
next 18 months we would develop around 20 megawatts,” Affleck
said. “In Thailand, we’re looking at multiple projects that
over the next 24 months would generate in aggregate 100
megawatts of solar power.”  A gross return in excess of 20 percent is anticipated on
the portfolio, according to the  fund manager . It is planned they
will be sold when they’ve built up enough scale to attract
interest from trade buyers, such as utilities and insurance
companies.  Armstrong said Aug. 10 that it had obtained $65 million in
the first funding round. By July 2013, it expects to have
reached its $150 million target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
