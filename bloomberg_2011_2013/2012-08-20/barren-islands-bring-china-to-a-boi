On Sunday morning, thousands of people in at least six major Chinese cities took to the streets to engage in  anti-Japanese protests  that became, in some cases,  riots . The official target of the protests was  Japan 's claim to a chain of islands in the  East China Sea  to which China also alleges ownership. The less official, but no less important, target was the Chinese Communist Party -- and its ability to serve as a steward of China’s national interests. With many Chinese voicing doubts about whether the Party is capable of protecting the disputed islands, China’s foreign policy is facing a crisis of legitimacy. The  chain of uninhabited islands  90 miles northeast of  Taiwan  has been the center of sovereignty disputes for decades. Known in China as the Diaoyu and in Japan as the Senkaku, the eight islands are subject both to historical claims and to a contemporary thirst for large oil and gas reserves presumed to be beneath the land. Tensions have been rising for years, and in  April  escalated after  Tokyo ’s far-right governor announced that the municipality was  seeking to buy  some of the chain from a private investor (plans later confirmed by Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ). Early this month, the situation built to a crisis with news that a group of Japanese politicians planned to land on one of the islands on Aug. 19 to commemorate a World War II-era shipwreck that happened there. The planned landing infuriated Chinese activists in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the mainland, more than a dozen of whom decided to respond with their own landing last week. On Wednesday, seven  came ashore  on one of the islands (the others remained on a boat) and planted  Chinese and Taiwanese flags  on the empty rocks. Shortly after, Japanese authorities arrested the group, paraded them in handcuffs before the news media and then deported them. In China, the images were viewed as a humiliation and ratcheted up the tensions even further. China’s microbloggers paid much attention to the fact that this audacious stunt was launched from  Hong Kong , by Hong Kong citizens, and not by mainlanders with the support of the  People’s Liberation Army . The simple but awkward explanation floating around China’s microblogs is that mainland China's repressive political controls prevent Chinese citizens from individually, and collectively, pursuing the national interest. In contrast, Hong Kong’s open society ensures a responsive public sector and citizens capable of pursuing the public’s interest. On Thursday,  Zhao Chu , a Shanghai-based military affairs expert with 197,000 followers on Sina Weibo, China’s most popular microblog,  tweeted  one of the more eloquent versions of this sentiment: Also on Thursday,  Lei Yi , a well-known contemporary historian in Beijing, echoed Zhao’s sentiment and took it a step further with a Sina Weibo  tweet  that directly tied the ability to defend Chinese sovereignty to a more liberated national condition: Of those rights, few are more sensitive than the right to roam the Internet as one pleases, without government interference. As many commentators in  China  have noted in the wake of the Diaoyu landing, Hong Kong netizens have that right, including the ability to use foreign social networking sites such as Facebook. Take, for example, this Sina Weibo  tweet  from a Chinese netizen abroad: For years, China has publicly promoted its  legal and historical claim  to the islands against alleged Japanese encroachment. But in the eyes and ears of China’s energized masses, these niceties don’t seem to have accomplished much. On Saturday, Wu Bin, a well-known freelance columnist in Guangzhou, used the Ten Cent microblog to  express his displeasure  at what he (correctly) believed would be a diplomatic Chinese government response to increasing news about the landing the Japanese had planned: Previously, there was little evidence that popular sentiment was influencing Chinese policy. But late last week, amid rumors of impending protests, policymakers at the highest levels clearly felt the need to make some preemptive attempts at calming the situation. Of these responses, none was more remarkable than the one published in the Global Times newspaper, a state-owned offshoot of People’s Daily, the official Communist Party mouthpiece and a longtime voice of aggressive nationalism. The  unsigned Saturday editorial  suggests that somebody at a high level is beginning to see the benefits of moderating the saber-rattling, and keeping the PLA out of the tensions for the foreseeable future: As telling as the Global Times editorial was, the starkest indication of the government’s heightened attention to populist agitation was increased controls on online discussion of the Diaoyu crisis. For example, news that the group of Japanese politicians was scheduled to land on one of the islands was widely disseminated on Chinese microblogs, but the comment sections associated with those news-related tweets were shut down in  several notable cases . This is a rare occurrence that tends to be implemented only during  the most politically sensitive events . It was a telling restriction, indicating just how nervous the authorities were about stirring up populist anger amidst rumors that protests were being organized for the weekend. But there was little they could do: By 9 a.m. Sunday, the protests were well underway, and by mid-afternoon, several had veered out of control.
