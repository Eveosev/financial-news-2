Martin Fridson  has departed  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP) ’s investment manager as its global credit strategist.  Fridson left BNP Paribas Investment Partners Aug. 15, he
said in a telephone interview today. Cesaltine Gregorio, a New
York-based spokeswoman for France’s largest bank, confirmed the
departure and declined to comment further.  The credit strategist is reviving his FridsonVision debt-
research brand and will announce a distribution of content
through another organization, he said in the interview. Fridson
led Merrill Lynch & Co.’s high-yield strategy group until he
left in 2003 to form FridsonVision LLC. At Merrill, he was the
top-ranked high-yield analyst for nine straight years in
Institutional Investor magazine’s annual poll.  BNP hired Fridson in 2010 after absorbing Fridson
Investment Advisors, a joint venture between the strategist and
the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
