Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. (042660)  won a 2.22 trillion won ($1.96 billion) order to
build five fixed platforms as rising demand for energy products
helps South Korean shipyards weather a slowdown in vessel orders.  The units will be delivered to a customer in  Africa  by
April 2016, the Seoul-based shipbuilder said in a filing today.
It didn’t elaborate.  The company’s shares rose the most since Aug. 9 in Seoul
trading after the order, which followed the shipbuilder’s first
contract for a floating liquefied natural gas plant in June. In
total, Daewoo expects to boost orders for offshore equipment 34
percent this year to $8.5 billion, it said in April.  The shipbuilder closed up 1.8 percent at 27,650 won.
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the world’s biggest shipbuilder,
climbed 2.2 percent.  Daewoo had booked a total of $5.85 billion of new orders
this year as of the end of June, according to a  statement  on its
website. Offshore accounted for 70 percent of orders in the
period, compared with 44 percent for the whole of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
