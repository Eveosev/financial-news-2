Taiwan ’s dollar touched a two-week
low on concern the island’s economic growth is losing momentum.
 Government bonds  were steady before an auction tomorrow.  The currency retreated for a fourth day as official data
showed  export orders  slumped 4.4 percent in July, more than the
2.98 percent decline forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The
statistics bureau cut its 2012 economic growth forecast to 1.66
percent from 2.08 percent on Aug. 17 after a government report
showed gross domestic product fell 0.18 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, following a 0.16 percent decrease
in the previous three months.  “There aren’t any fundamentals supporting an appreciation
of the  Taiwan dollar ,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan. “It should continue to
weaken.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed at NT$30.030 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$30.025 on Aug. 17, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. That’s the weakest level since Aug. 3. The
currency will reach NT$32 within a month, Tong predicted. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was unchanged at 3.40 percent.  Government bonds were steady before the Ministry of Finance
sells NT$30 billion ($999 million) of 30-year debt tomorrow. The
yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 was 1.181
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
money-market rate  was little changed at 0.386 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
