Treasury 10-year yields traded at
almost a three-month high as investor demand for safety ebbed
amid speculation the  European Central Bank  may make progress
curbing the euro bloc’s debt crisis.  The yields rose to their highest level of the day after
 Germany ’s  Der Spiegel  magazine reported the ECB is considering
putting a cap on area bond yields to contain the region’s fiscal
turmoil. U.S. bond yields erased gains after the ECB said it
hasn’t discussed a plan to target yields of euro-bloc members.
The ECB meets Sept. 6. The  Federal Reserve  bought $4.47 billion
of Treasuries today as part of a program to support the economy.  “We’re very focused on  Europe ,” said  Jim Vogel , head of
agency-debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee .
“European speculation on what the ECB may announce at the Sept.
6 meeting is the story right now. It’s all about sentiment.”  U.S. 10-year note  yields  dropped less than one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.81 percent at 5:40 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They climbed
earlier to 1.857 percent after touching 1.859 percent on Aug.
16, the highest since May 11. The 1.625 percent securities
maturing in August 2022 rose 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 98 11/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields fell one basis point to 2.92
percent after rising earlier to 2.98 percent.  Ten-year note yields have increased 43 basis points, or
0.43 percentage point, since falling to a record 1.379 percent
on July 25. They will end the year at 1.65 percent, according to
the median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  August Loss  Investors in Treasuries have lost 1.5 percent in August,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The last
time they fell as much in a full month was December 2010.  The term premium, a model created by economists at the Fed
that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and
inflation, was negative 0.739 percent today, after touching
0.705 percent on Aug. 16, the least expensive since May. The
premium was negative 1.02 percent on July 24, the most costly
ever. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  The ECB may decide at its next meeting to set yield limits
on the debt of European countries, Der Spiegel reported
yesterday, without saying where it got the information. A plan
to set a target on bond yields would involve the bank using its
power to print money, the German news magazine said.  Treasuries erased losses after the bank said the matter
hasn’t been discussed by policy makers. German bunds pared
losses, with 10-year yields trading at 1.51 percent, up one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, after rising to as high
as 1.58 percent. Spanish 10-year bonds pared a rise, with their
yields trimming a drop to 6.28 percent after earlier touching a
six-week low of 6.16 percent.  ‘Absolutely Misleading’  A spokesman for the ECB said in an e-mail it’s “absolutely
misleading to report on decisions” that haven’t been made and
individual views that haven’t been discussed by its governing
council.  “As far as recent statements by government officials are
concerned, it is also wrong to speculate on the shape of future
ECB interventions,” the spokesman said. “ Monetary policy  is
independent and undertaken strictly within the ECB mandate.”  Germany’s Bundesbank stepped up its criticism of the ECB’s
plan to embark on potentially “unlimited” government bond
buying. The purchases “entail significant stability risks,”
the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report.  Demand for safety also declined earlier before U.S. reports
this week that may show the recovery of the world’s biggest
economy is gaining momentum.  U.S. Data  Existing home sales  rose 3.2 percent in July from June,
when they dropped 5.4 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey
before the National Association of Realtors’ report on Aug. 22.
Sales of  new homes , due the next day from the Commerce
Department, rose 4.3 percent, a separate survey showed. Durable-
goods orders increased 2.5 percent in July, another survey said
Commerce Department data will show on Aug. 24.  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents traders’
expectations for the rate of inflation over the life of the
securities and is known as the break-even rate, was 2.25
percentage points, little changed from Aug. 17. It touched 2.34
percentage points on Aug. 9, the highest since April.  The U.S. central bank bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and
Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of a stimulus
strategy called quantitative easing.  The Fed is now swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its
holdings with those due in six to 30 years to put downward
pressure on long-term borrowing costs. It purchased $4.47
billion of Treasuries today due from August 2018 to August 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
