Pump prices are at a record high for
this time of year in the U.S. after refinery breakdowns
tightened supply.  The $3.72-a-gallon average price of regular gasoline at
U.S. retail stations is the highest for this day, and prices
will likely continue breaking daily records for at least several
more weeks, AAA said.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, has
averaged about $3.72 for the past four days, according to data
from the nation’s largest motoring organization. It’s the first
time since April 23 that a national average in 2012 was the
highest ever for the day,  Michael Green , a spokesman for AAA in
 Washington , said in an e-mail.  Prices reached a year-to-date high of $3.936 on April 4,
before sliding 61 cents to $3.326 on July 1. Since then refinery
shutdowns and stronger Brent crude oil boosted prices 39.4 cents
to the highest level since May 16, AAA data show.  Fuel prices gained after an Aug. 6 fire brought down the
only crude unit at Chevron’s Richmond refinery near  San
Francisco , Northern California’s largest. BP Plc idled a coker
at its 420,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Whiting,  Indiana , from
July 23 to Aug. 9 after a fire. Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia plant
shut a fluid catalytic cracker from July 23 to Aug. 6 for
repairs.  “There is some good news for drivers despite record-high
 gas prices ,” Green said. “The national average price of gas
has remained flat in recent days as refinery issues have
stabilized in the Midwest and West Coast.”  The second-highest average for this day was on Aug. 20,
2008, when prices averaged $3.717 a gallon, AAA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
