China’s stocks  fell to the lowest
level this month on concern the government will hold off from
easing monetary policy after real-estate prices rose in the
largest number of cities in 14 months.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. led declines
for the nation’s property developers. The Financial News, run by
the People’s Bank of  China , said in a commentary the central
bank has no plan to cut lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios in
the short term.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech
Co. (600111)  fell to the lowest in two weeks after profit declined and
the China Securities Journal reported the government is studying
a resource tax on rare earths.  “A rebound in property prices is bad for the economy as
the government will refrain from conducting further policy
easing,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities
Co. in Shanghai. “Investor sentiment is bad and the market will
test new lows.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.4 percent to 2,106.96
at the close, the lowest level since July 31. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
declined 0.5 percent to 2,301.79. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong lost
0.4 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 0.6 percent on
Aug. 17.  The Shanghai Composite lost 2.5 percent last week, adding
to a 14 percent slump from this year’s high on March 2, amid
speculation the economic slowdown is worsening and the central
bank is reluctant to cut  interest rates  or reserve-requirement
ratios on inflation concerns. The gauge is  valued  at 9.5 times
estimated profit, compared with the 17.4 average since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 2006.  Policy Outlook  The Chinese stock market’s losses reflect disappointment
there haven’t been reserve-ratio cuts, Timothy Riddell, head of
global markets research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television today from  Hong Kong .  Policy makers cut interest rates in June and July after two
reductions in banks’ reserve-requirement ratios this year as the
economy expanded at the slowest pace since 2009.  The resumption of 14-day reverse repurchase operations last
week suggests there won’t be a reserve-ratio cut, the Financial
News said on Aug. 18. A reduction may increase the risk of
investment overheating and raise inflation expectations, the
paper said.  Property Curbs  A measure of  property stocks  in the Shanghai Composite slid
1.3 percent, the most among five industry groups. Vanke, the
nation’s biggest listed property developer, lost 1.3 percent to
8.50 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second largest, retreated 3
percent to 10.02  yuan .  China Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) ,
the third biggest, fell 1.6 percent to 20.20 yuan.  China’s prices of new homes rose in the largest number of
cities in 14 months in July. Prices climbed from a month earlier
in 49 of the 70 cities tracked by the government, the National
Bureau of Statistics said over the weekend. That was the most
since May last year and compared with 25 cities in June.  “Rising property prices are constraining aggressive policy
action from the central bank,” said Zhang Zhiwei, China
economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “The government will
introduce more policies to contain a property bubble,”
including the extension of a property tax to more cities, he
said.  China may expand a property tax trial and raise the
“threshold” for home pre-sales if housing prices rebound too
fast, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
unidentified people.  Earnings Decline  China’s big four banks made about 70 billion yuan ($11
billion) of new loans in the first half of August, about 20
billion yuan more than the first half of July, the Shanghai
Securities News reported today. August total new bank lending
may be about 600 billion yuan, it said.  Baotou Rare-Earth, China’s biggest producer of rare earth,
slid 1.7 percent to 37 yuan after it said first-half profit
dropped 21 percent from a year earlier.  Xiamen Tungsten Co. (600549) ,
which has rare-earth operations, fell 0.7 percent to 42.93 yuan.  The government is studying a price-based resource tax on
rare earths and may raise the levy on the mineral, the China
Securities Journal reported over the weekend, citing an
unidentified person. Resource taxes account for about 20 percent
of rare earth exploration costs, it said.  China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. (601601) , the fourth-largest
insurer, dropped 3.5 percent to 19.33 yuan after it reported
first-half net income fell 55 percent from a year earlier.  Fear Index  Yuan Longping High-tech Agriculture Co. led agricultural
stocks higher after the company said first-half profit rose 49
percent from a year earlier. The stock gained 4.1 percent to
21.66 yuan, its biggest advance since July 23.  Gansu Dunhuang Seed Co. (600354)  surged by the 10 percent daily
limit to 8.25 yuan. Shandong Denghai Seeds Co. advanced 5.4
percent to 21.28 yuan.  Thirty-day  volatility  on the Shanghai Composite was at 12
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.4. About 4.6
billion shares changed hands in the gauge today, 42 percent
lower than this year’s average.  Options traders are charging the  biggest premium  since
March to protect against losses in Chinese companies on signs
that a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy is worse
than economists estimated.  The AlphaShares Chinese Volatility Index, derived from
options on companies listed in Hong Kong, traded at a premium of
as much as 41 percent over the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index last week, the biggest gap since March 29. The
spread compares with a 10 percent discount a year ago.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
