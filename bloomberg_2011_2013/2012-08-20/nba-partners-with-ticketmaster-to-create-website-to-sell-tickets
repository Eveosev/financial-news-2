The  National Basketball Association 
is partnering with Ticketmaster to create a website to buy and
sell game tickets.  Tickets will be available from primary sellers as well as
fans reselling their tickets, the NBA said in an e-mailed news
release. Tickets are guaranteed to be authentic, the league
said. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  “The NBA is determined to provide their fans a safe,
convenient place to buy and sell game tickets, and we are
delighted to be delivering this revolutionary solution,” Nathan Hubbard, the chief executive officer of Ticketmaster, said in
the statement.  Ticketmaster is a unit of Beverly Hills,  California-based
Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the world’s biggest concert
promoter and ticket seller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
