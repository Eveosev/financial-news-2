Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
apologized following a report that the central bank altered the
image of a woman’s face proposed for a new C$100 bill after
people at a focus group complained the person looked Asian.  “Efforts by the bank note designers to avoid depicting a
specific individual resulted in an image that appears to
represent only one ethnic group,” Carney said in a  statement 
posted on the Ottawa-based central bank’s website today.  “That was not the Bank’s intention and I apologize to
those who were offended -- the Bank’s handling of this issue did
not meet the standards Canadians justifiably expect of us,”
Carney said in the statement. “We will be reviewing our design
process in light of these events. Our bank notes belong to all
Canadians, and the work we do at the Bank is for all
Canadians.”  The  Canadian Press  reported Aug. 17 that  the image  used --
showing a woman looking into a microscope -- is different than
the one shown to a focus group reviewing the design of the new
bank note. The central bank changed the image after people
complained about the person’s ethnicity, Canadian Press said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
