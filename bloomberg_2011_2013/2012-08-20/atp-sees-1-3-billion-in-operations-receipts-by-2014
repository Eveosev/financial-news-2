ATP Oil & Gas Corp. (ATPG) , the  Gulf of
Mexico  oil producer that filed for bankruptcy last week,
projected gross receipts from operations of $1.3 billion by
February 2014.  Net revenue for the 18-month period is estimated to reach
$613 million, ATP said today in a regulatory  filing . The company
sought Chapter 11 protection in Houston on Aug. 17, blaming the
2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster that led to a Gulf of Mexico
drilling moratorium. ATP said it has a commitment for $617.6
million in financing from existing lenders to support operations
while it restructures.  ATP bonds rose the most in more than two weeks and were the
most actively traded high-yield corporate securities by dealers
today, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  ATP’s $1.5 billion of 11.875 percent notes due May 2015
rose 2.3 cents to 31.7 cents on the dollar to yield 70 percent
as of 3:14 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace. That’s the
biggest increase since Aug. 3.  ATP shares were at 30 cents at 4 p.m. in New York in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, after reaching a 52-week low today of 20
cents. The year’s high in August 2011 was $14.48. The company
listed $3.6 billion in assets and $3.5 billion in debt, in
papers filed in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court .  Loan Payments  ATP received $372 million of its bankruptcy loan this
month, and expects to pay $167.5 million to lenders over 18
months, according to today’s filing. Net operating  cash flow  by
February 2014 is projected at $210 million and  capital spending 
at a total of $224 million.  ATP said in the filing that it doesn’t usually publish
projections and they shouldn’t be relied on, because actual
results depended on factors outside its control, including
possible operational and regulatory setbacks. The company plans
to start publishing monthly operating reports in  bankruptcy
court  in Houston in September, according to the filing.  During the past three years, ATP  lost  the equivalent of
$1.1 million a day as equipment failures and unforeseen
geological hurdles in the Gulf of Mexico frustrated efforts to
lift crude output. The specter of lower production spooked
investors because it meant a reduction in cash flow needed to
make debt payments.  ATP, based in Houston, said in a statement Aug. 17 that the
“primary reason” for the bankruptcy began with the explosion
at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Deepwater Horizon and the government moratorium that
halted drilling while safety rules were reviewed.  The bankruptcy case is In re ATP Oil & Gas Corp., 12-36187,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
