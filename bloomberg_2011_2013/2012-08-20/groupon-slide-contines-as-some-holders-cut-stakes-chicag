Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  declined as much 5.3
percent, extending a slump that pushed shares to a record low
last week, after reports that some of the daily-deal website’s
largest investors had trimmed their stakes.  The  shares  fell as low as $4.50, and were down 3.2 percent
to $4.60 at 9:34 a.m. in  New York . Groupon retreated 5 percent
to $4.75 at the close on Aug. 17 on speculation that billings 
could decline, widening the plunge since the IPO to 76 percent.  At least four Groupon investors who had stakes before the
company’s November initial public offering, including venture
backer  Marc Andreessen , have sold shares since then, the Wall
Street Journal reported. Fidelity Management & Research trimmed
its stake by 6.2 million shares to 13.2 million in the quarter
ended in June, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Maverick
Capital reduced its holdings by 4.35 million shares to 1.98
million over that period, the data show. Kinnevik Investment AB
said in June that it divested its direct holding in Groupon of
8.34 million shares.  The Chicago-based company makes money by selling discounts
-- known as Groupons -- from businesses such as restaurants and
nail salons. It then splits the revenue with the businesses.
Groupon earlier this month reported second-quarter revenue that
missed estimates as economic weakness in  Europe  curbed online
coupon sales.  One of Groupon’s largest investors, T Rowe Price Associates
Inc., added 21.4 million shares to its stake, for a total of
75.1 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Morgan
Stanley (MS) , one of the lead underwriters for Groupon’s IPO, added
8.19 million shares, for a total of 15.7 million, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
