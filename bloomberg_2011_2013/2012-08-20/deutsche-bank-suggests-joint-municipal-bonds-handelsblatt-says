Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is suggesting that
German municipal governments issue joint debt, Handelsblatt
reported, citing a study by Germanyâ€™s biggest lender.  While banks provide 95 percent of the financing for German
cities and towns, Deutsche Bank says creating a municipal
financing agency offers an alternative as new rules make lending
less attractive for banks, the Dusseldorf-based newspaper said
in an article e-mailed before publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
