Russia’s poultry output rose 22
percent to 285,000 metric tons in July compared with a year
earlier, the state statistics service said.  Meat from cattle climbed 11 percent to 107,000 tons in July
and pork production increased 16 percent to 76,300 tons, the
service, known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement today.
The figures include byproducts.  Russia’s production of cattle and poultry in so-called live
weight, which includes meat, bones and byproducts, increased 8.8
percent to 5.8 million tons in January through July compared
with a year earlier, the state statistics service said.  Cattle and poultry output was 800,000 tons in July, up 9.8
percent from a year earlier, the service said.  Cattle numbers increased 1.2 percent to 21.4 million head
by the end of July compared with a year earlier, the service
said. That number included 9.1 million cows, which is 2.2
percent more than a year earlier. The hog count rose 4.5 percent
to 19.6 million, while sheep and goats increased 6.9 percent to
27.3 million, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
