Western Canada Select, a heavy oil
blend from  Alberta , surged to the smallest discount to West
 Texas  Intermediate in more than eight months as producers gained
access to new markets by pipeline and rail.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  is shipping both heavy and
light oil on its Seaway pipeline that moves crude from Cushing,
 Oklahoma , to Texas, Jim Teague, the company’s chief operating
officer, said during a  conference call  Aug. 1. Torq
Transloading, a Calgary-based company that loads oil onto trains
in Alberta and Saskatchewan, said Aug. 9 that shipments started
from a new terminal near Bromhead, Saskatchewan.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed by $3.50
to $11 a barrel at 2:20 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest discount for the
grade since Dec. 1.  Syncrude’s premium to the U.S. benchmark was unchanged at
$8.50 a barrel.  Bakken oil from  North Dakota  traded at a $1 discount to
WTI. The differential was unchanged today.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, most grades strengthened. Light
Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 5 cents to $16.55.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 20 cents to $16.60 over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  increased 20 cents to $12.85. Mars Blend
increased 10 cents to $12.75 a barrel over WTI. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium widened 50 cents to $11.75.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased 10 cents to
a premium of $15.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
