Republican Todd Akin said he won’t
drop out of the Missouri Senate race even as he apologized to
those who’d been “hurt” by his assertion yesterday that
“legitimate rape” rarely leads to pregnancy.  “This was a very, very serious error,” Akin said today in
an interview with former Arkansas Governor  Mike Huckabee  on the
former Republican presidential candidate’s radio show. “I feel
just as strongly as ever that my background and ability will be
a big asset in replacing  Claire McCaskill .”  Several Republican lawmakers have called for Akin, 65, to
leave the Senate race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
