Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s
lead narrowed in the latest poll from Caracas-based Datanalisis
seven weeks ahead of October’s national election, according to
Jefferies Group Inc.  Chavez had 46.8 percent support compared with 34.2 percent
for opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, showing
that his lead narrowed to 12.5 points from 15.3 percentage
points in June,  Siobhan Morden , head of Latin American fixed-
income strategy at Jefferies in  New York  wrote today in a note
to clients. The poll showed that 18.8 percent of those surveyed
were undecided, according to the note.  The poll of 1,288 people interviewed between July 16 and
Aug. 9 had a margin of error of 2.73 percentage points,
according to a person who received the poll and declined to be
identified because the survey is private. Luis Vicente Leon,
President of Datanalisis, declined to comment on the poll and
said that the next public poll will be presented in Caracas on
Sept. 25.  Surveys have varied widely in the run-up to the Oct. 7
election where Chavez is seeking to extend his 13-year-rule
through 2019. Consultores 21, a Caracas-based polling company,
said in June that the two candidates are locked in a technical
tie, while Hinterlaces said Aug. 16 that Chavez leads Capriles
by 18 percentage points.  Construction Boom  Chavez, 58, increased  government spending  34 percent in the
first half of 2012 from a year ago and is promoting social
programs for the elderly and children in extreme poverty. The
surge in spending and a 17.6 percent expansion in the
 construction industry  in the second quarter helped the economy
 grow 5.4 percent  from a year earlier.  Capriles, a 40-year-old former governor of Miranda state,
has visited more than 150 towns across the country as he tries
to close the gap on Chavez.  Venezuelan assets may see some “positive upside” on the
closing gap in the opinion poll “as markets assign a higher
probability to regime change,” Jefferies’ Morden said.  The yield on the benchmark 9.25 percent bonds due in 2027
fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.09 percent
at 10:17 a.m. in Caracas, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.13 cents to 86.68 cents on
the dollar.  Venezuelan bonds have returned 24.4 percent this year, the
second-highest in  emerging markets  after  Ivory Coast , according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBIG index. Government securities and
bonds sold by state-oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  have
rallied as investors look to higher-yielding assets amid near
zero  interest rates  in the U.S. and Europe and on the back of
high  oil prices .  Venezuela  depends on oil for 95 percent of export revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
