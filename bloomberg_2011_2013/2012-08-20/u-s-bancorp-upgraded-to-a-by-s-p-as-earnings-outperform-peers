U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the nation’s fifth-
largest lender by deposits, was upgraded one level by  Standard &
Poor’s , which said the bank has outperformed competitors in the
wake of 2008’s credit crisis.  The lender was raised to A+ from A, S&P said today in a
statement. The Minneapolis-based bank had its short-term issuer
rating affirmed at A-1, and its outlook is stable, according to
the statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Davis  boosted quarterly
profit  every period  since the fourth quarter of 2009, except for
the first three months of this year. Davis, 54, who hasn’t
posted a loss in the six years he’s run the company, has
referred to his traditional banking strategy of taking deposits
and making loans as “boring.”  “The upgrade reflects USB’s sustained outperformance
versus peers over the last four years, which the stability in
its revenue and earnings during and after the financial crisis
demonstrate,” S&P said in the statement. With housing prices
nearing a bottom, “we believe that USB’s outperformance
compared with peers will continue.”  U.S. Bancorp  fell  0.4 percent to close at $33.23 in New
York. The shares have advanced 23 percent this year, compared
with a 20 percent gain in the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
