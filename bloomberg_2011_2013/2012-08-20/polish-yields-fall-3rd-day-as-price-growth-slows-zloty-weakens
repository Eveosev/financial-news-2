Polish bond yields fell for a third
day as growth in producer prices slowed, giving the central bank
leeway to cut  interest rates .  Five-year zloty note yields slid two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.48 percent by 5:04 p.m. in Warsaw, the
lowest since Aug. 8. The zloty weakened less than 0.1 percent to
4.0704 against the euro, depreciating for a second day.  Polish producer prices increased at an annual pace of 3.7
percent in July, compared with 4.4 percent a month earlier, the
statistics office said today. Job growth at companies with more
than nine workers slowed to zero, a 27-month low, and wages grew
less than expected, according to Aug. 17 reports from the
statistical office.  “Recent macroeconomic data were supportive for the dovish
wing of Polish Monetary Policy Council,” Janusz Dancewicz, the
chief economist at DZ Bank Polska SA, wrote in a weekly report
to clients today.  Three-month forward-rate agreements are trading 29 basis
points below Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate, signaling investors’
expectation the central bank will cut the main rate by the end
of this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
