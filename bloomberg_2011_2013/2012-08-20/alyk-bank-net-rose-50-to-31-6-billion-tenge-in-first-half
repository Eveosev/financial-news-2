AO Halyk Savings Bank (HSBK) , the lender
controlled by Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s daughter
and son-in-law, said first-half profit climbed 50 percent from a
year earlier because of lower impairment charges and an increase
in fees and commissions.  Net income was 31.6 billion tenge ($212 million) compared
with 21.1 billion tenge in the first six months of last year,
Halyk Bank said today in a statement. The lender’s second-
quarter net income advanced 41 percent from a year earlier to
14.8 billion tenge, Halyk said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
