Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, said Anne Doss will head its personal and small-
business insurance division starting in January as the bank
builds its unit that helps clients buy policies and manage risk.  Doss succeeds Neal Aton, 55, who will remain at the bank’s
insurance division to lead key initiatives, according to a
statement today from the San Francisco-based company. Doss, 55,
has been heading the national practices and special risk group
at the insurance operation.  Wells Fargo is seeking to expand its insurance brokerage
business, the fifth-largest in the world, using relationships it
has with retail and business customers in banking. The personal
and small-business group helps arrange auto, home, renters, life
and property-liability policies.  Doss will “partner more closely with the company’s
business and retail banking groups to provide our customers with
improved access to the insurance products they need,” Laura Schupbach, head of Wells Fargo Insurance, said in the statement.  Doss was previously president of insurance services at
Wachovia Corp., the lender that Wells Fargo agreed in 2008 to
buy during the credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
