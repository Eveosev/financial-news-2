Brazilian lawmaker and former
national soccer team striker Romario Da Souza Faria has gathered
more than the required support in Congress to request hearings
into the country’s soccer federation only 18 months before the
country hosts the World Cup.  Romario, who played for Barcelona FC and won the 1994 World
Cup with Brazil, personally canvassed lawmakers yesterday to
gather 188 signatures, more than the two-thirds needed, the ex-
player said on his Facebook Inc. internet profile.  The request for a special congressional committee to
investigate the federation comes after its vice president, Marco
Polo Del Nero, was taken in for police questioning last month as
part of a nationwide probe into alleged financial crimes and
extortion.  Romario in March praised the resignation of  Ricardo Teixeira  as head of the federation. Teixeira, a former son-in-
law of  Joao Havelange , the ex-head of soccer’s world governing
body FIFA, resigned after the British Broadcasting Corp. named
him as a beneficiary of bribes paid by FIFA’s bankrupt former
marketing partner ISL. Teixeira has denied the allegations.  Five-time World Cup winner Brazil has been criticized by
FIFA for delays in the refurbishment of stadiums and the
construction of other infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup.
FIFA general-secretary  Jerome Valcke  said in March that the
country needed a “kick up the ass” to be ready in time for the
event. He later apologized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
