Sabesp,  Latin America ’s largest water
company, and Foz do Brasil SA inaugurated a 364 million-real
($175 million) plant in Sao Paulo state that transforms treated
sewage into water for industrial use.  The Aquapolo Ambiental facility built at  Cia. de Saneamento
Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo ’s sewage treatment plant in the
ABC region is the biggest water-recycling plant in Brazil of its
type.  About 65 percent of the water will be used by Sao Paulo-
based petrochemical producer  Braskem SA. (BRKM5)  A pipeline will carry
the water 17 kilometers (10.6 miles) to a petrochemical
production hub in Maua. The plant can produce 1,000 liters (264
gallons) of water a second, the companies said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
