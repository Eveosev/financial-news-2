H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, reported a fiscal second-quarter loss that was smaller
than analysts estimated as expenses declined.  The net loss was $101 million, or 37 cents a share,
compared with $123 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the
Kansas City, Missouri-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, the net loss was 37 cents, compared with
the 41-cent loss estimated by six analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  Expenses fell 9.9 percent to $302.3 million from the year-
earlier period, and the company said it’s on pace to generate as
much as $100 million of pretax earnings from cost cutting plans
in fiscal 2013. H&R Block said in October it may drop its
designation as a savings and loan after the  Federal Reserve 
proposed rules requiring such firms to keep additional capital,
according to a statement at the time.  The second-quarter results “reflect savings from our cost
reduction initiatives and a strong tax season in  Australia ,”
Chief Executive Officer Bill Cobb, 56, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
