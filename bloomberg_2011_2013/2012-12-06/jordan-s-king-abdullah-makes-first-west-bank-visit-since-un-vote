Jordan’s King Abdullah flew to the
West Bank by helicopter to become the first international leader
to visit the territory since the  United Nations  General Assembly
recognized Palestine as a non-member state.  Abdullah met with Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  after being greeted by a color guard and military band
when he landed today in the courtyard of the government
headquarters in Ramallah, known as the Muqata.  The king wanted to be “the first one to visit Ramallah to
congratulate President Abbas and the Palestinian people for the
strategic decision at the United Nations,” Jordanian Foreign
Minister Nasser Judeh said at a news conference. He criticized
Israeli plans to build homes in the E-1 area between Jerusalem
and the West Bank, which has sparked wide international
condemnation, and called for the renewal of peace negotiations.  Israel captured the  West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Abbas failed to win
acceptance as a full member of the UN last year because of
opposition from the U.S., which has veto power in the  Security
Council . The General Assembly voted Nov. 30 to upgrade
Palestine’s observer status by a vote of 138-9, with 41
abstentions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
