World soccer player of the year
Lionel Messi trained in the gym today after suffering a knee
injury in Barcelona’s 0-0 draw against Benfica last night in the
 Champions League .  The Argentinian was inside while others who played in the
match did recovery training, according to a statement on the
Spanish club’s website. Doctors will assess his injury and see
if he can recover in time for the team’s match against Betis.  Messi, whose 84 goals this calendar year leave him one
short of Gerd Muller’s record, came on in the second half. He
sustained a bone contusion on his left knee after colliding with
Benfica goalkeeper Artur and was carried from the field.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
