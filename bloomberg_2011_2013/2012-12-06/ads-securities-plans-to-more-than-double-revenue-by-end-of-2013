ADS Securities LLC, the biggest
foreign-exchange trader in the  United Arab Emirates , plans to
start offering investment-banking services and more than double
foreign exchange trading volume to $12 billion by the end of
2013.  “Our volume on forex ranges between $4 billion to $5
billion per day,” Philippe Ghanem, managing director of ADS
Securities, said in an interview in Abu Dhabi yesterday. “With
the new technology, we’re expecting to double that by the fourth
quarter of next year.”  The firm is seeking customers seeking to trade between the
closing of markets in Europe and the opening of markets in Asia,
Mahmood Ebraheem Al Mahmood, Chairman of ADS Securities, said in
an interview. About half its clients are in  Africa  and the
 Middle East , he said.  ADS will hire 50 people in the next 12 months, Mahmood
said. The firm employs 140 people, 120 of whom are in  Abu Dhabi 
and 20 in Singapore, he said.  ADS is ready to trade equities and expects to be able to
underwrite products next year, Mahmood said.  “We see the market here as being under-served,” Mahmood
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
