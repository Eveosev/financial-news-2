National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-largest bank, said profit climbed for the ninth
straight quarter on an increase in  consumer banking . The lender
increased its quarterly dividend by 5 percent.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 rose 20 percent to
C$351 million ($354.1 million), or C$1.97 a share, from C$292
million, or C$1.62, a year ago, the Montreal-based lender said
today in a statement.  National Bank said personal and commercial banking profit
increased 7 percent to C$168 million because of higher revenue
from lending and credit cards. Wealth management earnings fell
10 percent to C$45 million, and the bank’s Financial Markets
business, which includes  investment banking , rose 57 percent to
C$124 million.  The lender increased its quarterly dividend to 83 cents a
share, meeting expectations, according to  Bloomberg Dividend
Projections. (NA)   Excluding one-time items, National Bank earned 1.93 a
share, matching the average  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The bank set aside C$46 million for loan-loss provisions,
down 8 percent from a year-earlier.  (National Bank will hold a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Montreal
