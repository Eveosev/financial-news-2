Eastern Water Resources Development
and Management Pcl (EASTW) , Thailand’s biggest private water provider,
lost two more directors due to resignations, the company said.  That brings to three the number of directors to step down
from the Bangkok-based water company that’s controlled by state-
owned Provincial Waterworks Authority since the death of its
chairman, Charnchai Soontharamut, on Dec. 2.  Eastern Water shares have more than doubled this year,
rising 115 percent in Bangkok trading, benefiting from an
increase in industrial activity in eastern Rayong province,
where  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Ford Motor Co. have plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
