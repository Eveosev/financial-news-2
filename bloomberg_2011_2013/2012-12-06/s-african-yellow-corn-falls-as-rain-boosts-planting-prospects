South African yellow corn fell to the
lowest in two weeks after it rained in the main growing regions
of the country. More rain is expected over the weekend, boosting
prospects for next season’s plantings.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
closed 1 percent lower at 2,325 rand ($266) a metric ton in
Johannesburg, the lowest since Nov. 21.  Lichtenburg in North West Province has a 95 percent chance
of rain today, 86 percent tomorrow and a range of between 54 and
64 percent for Dec. 8 and 9, the  South African Weather Service 
said on its website.  “The new season’s maize is looking good as planting is
boosted by the good rain,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at
Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.
“More rain is expected this weekend.”  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer corn,
where it is known as maize. Meal made from the white variety is
one of the country’s staple foods, while yellow corn is mainly
used as  animal feed .  White corn for delivery in March rose 0.2 percent to 2,465
rand a ton,, while wheat for delivery in the same month declined
0.1 percent to 3,748 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
