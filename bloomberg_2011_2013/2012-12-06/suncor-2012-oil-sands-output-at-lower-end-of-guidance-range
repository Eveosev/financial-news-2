Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  said 2012 Alberta
oil sands production is expected to fall into the lower part of
its guidance range after unplanned maintenance last month
curtailed output.  Oil sands production, which includes upgraded sweet and
sour synthetic crude and non-upgraded bitumen, will be at the
lower end of the average 325,000 to 340,000 barrels a day of
output projected Oct. 31 for this year, the company said in a
statement.  November output averaged 312,000 barrels a day. The
company’s base oil sands plant was producing more than 380,000
barrels a day at the end of last month after maintenance issues
were resolved, the company said.  The volumes don’t include Suncor’s production share from
the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture.  Suncor’s Firebag complex, an in-situ steam-assisted gravity
drainage operation, was producing about 130,000 barrels a day at
the end of November, the statement showed.  Total production is expected to be within the projected
range of 540,000 to 580,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
