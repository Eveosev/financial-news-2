Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s
biggest investment bank, is delaying by one week the planned
$1.2 billion initial public offering of its Mexico real estate
investment trust.  Macquarie Mexico Real Estate Management SA now plans to
sell shares on Dec. 13 after previously setting a Dec. 6 date in
a prospectus, according to an investor presentation filed with
the Mexican stock exchange. The REIT is seeking to raise about
$1 billion in the deal, plus an overallotment option for
underwriters to boost that amount by another 15 percent, making
it the industry’s biggest ever IPO in Mexico.  Mexico’s securities and banking commission, known as the
CNBV for its initials in Spanish, asked bankers for additional
time to review the offering paperwork, and the deal was pushed
back a full week because Dec. 12 is a market holiday, according
to two people with direct knowledge of the transaction who asked
not to be named because the discussions with the regulator are
private.  Paula Chirhart, a New York-based spokeswoman with Macquarie
Group, declined to comment on the delay. Aurelio Bueno, a  Mexico 
City-based press official with the CNBV, also declined to
comment on the date change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
