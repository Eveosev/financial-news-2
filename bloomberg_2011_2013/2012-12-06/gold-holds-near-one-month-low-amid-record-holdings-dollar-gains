Gold rebounded from a four-week low
after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi left the door
open for further interest-rate cuts to bolster the economy,
enhancing the metal’s appeal as an alternative investment.  Weakness will persist into next year, Draghi said today at
a press conference after policy makers kept the benchmark rate
at a record low of 0.75 percent. The ECB forecasts the economy
will shrink 0.5 percent this year, more than the 0.4 percent
contraction predicted in September. Gold fell 1.6 percent in the
past two days.  “The possibility of an interest-rate cut is certainly
supportive for gold,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Some of the
liquidation we’ve seen may also have run its course, and people
are buying against the lows.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,701.80 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Yesterday, the metal touched $1,686, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 6.  Yesterday, holdings in exchange-traded products backed by
gold climbed to a  record  for the 14th straight session, the
latest data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Today, Morgan Stanley affirmed its call for gold as a top
commodity pick for 2013 on demand from central banks and
investors buying. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday that
the metal will probably peak in 2013 and decline the following
year as U.S. economic growth accelerates.  Silver futures for March delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
$33.114 an ounce on the Comex.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery gained 1 percent to $1,600.70 an ounce, the
biggest increase since Nov. 23.  Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 1.4 percent to
$697.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
