The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index
of 24  raw materials  fell 1.2 percent to settle at 635.69 at 3:55
p.m. New York time, led by energy.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  declined 0.8
percent to 1,579.6.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell to the lowest in three weeks after the
European Central Bank cut its euro-area growth forecasts and
U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach an agreement on a budget plan.  ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank projects the
economy will contract 0.5 percent this year, worse than the
September forecast of a 0.4 drop. More than $600 billion of new
taxes and spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, will come
into force at the beginning of 2013 unless U.S. politicians
agree on a  federal budget .  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures for
January delivery dropped 1.8 percent to $86.26 a barrel, the

$107.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA sold a cargo of North Sea
Forties for the third straight day. There were no bids or offers

its January official selling price for Arab Light blend from the
Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir, according to two persons with
knowledge of the matter.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil slid to a four-month low as Draghi said the
area’s economic weakness will persist into the second half of
2013, and U.S. budget talks stalled.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for January delivery
dropped 1.6 percent to $2.9432 a gallon, the lowest settlement
since Aug. 6.  Gasoline futures for January delivery declined 1.6 percent

speculation that mild weather will reduce demand for heating
fuels.  On the Nymex, gas futures for January delivery fell 0.9
percent to $3.666 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for same-day delivery declined as imports from

p.m. London time. Month-ahead gas slid 1.6 percent to 69.15
pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $11.10 per million Btu.  BASE METALS  Copper declined the most in four weeks amid concern that
persistent economic weakness in Europe will undercut demand for
the metal.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for March delivery
fell 1.1 percent to $3.6445 a pound, the biggest drop for a
most-active contract since Nov. 7.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.9 percent to $8,000 a ton ($3.63 a pound).
Zinc, aluminum, lead and nickel also declined. Tin rose.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rebounded from a four-week low after Draghi left the
door open for further interest-rate cuts to bolster the European
economy, enhancing the metal’s appeal as an alternative
investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for February delivery rose 0.5
percent to $1,701.80 an ounce. Yesterday, the metal touched

orders.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for
February settlement slid 1.4 percent to 84.45 cents a pound
after touching 84.35 cents, the lowest since Nov. 12.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.4 percent to
