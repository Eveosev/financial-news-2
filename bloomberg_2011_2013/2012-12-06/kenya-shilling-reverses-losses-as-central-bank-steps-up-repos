Kenya’s shilling gained, reversing
earlier loses, as the  central bank  stepped up its removal of
money from the financial system.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
0.2 percent to 85.80 a dollar, reversing an earlier decline to
86.07.  “The shilling continues to receive a lot of support from
the central bank action of mopping up excess money from the
system,” Julius Kiriinya, a trader at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 5.5 billion shillings
($63 million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, a bank
official who asked not to be identified in line with policy,
said by phone. Yesterday, the bank accepted 3.65 billion
shillings. The repos are sold by the regulator to withdraw  money
supply  from banks and support the shilling.  The currency declined earlier after the  World Bank  said it
expects the central bank to cut its benchmark  interest rate  to
support growth. Kenya has “room to stimulate growth through
loosening monetary policy more,” the Washington-based lender
said in a report yesterday.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 2,695 a
dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling traded unchanged at 1,602 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
