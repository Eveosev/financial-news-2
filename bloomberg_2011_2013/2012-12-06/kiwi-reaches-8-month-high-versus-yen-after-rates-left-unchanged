The New Zealand dollar rose to an
eight-month high against the yen after the nation’s central bank
kept interest rates unchanged and said growth will quicken.  The so-called kiwi advanced for a fourth day versus the
U.S. currency after Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler left
the benchmark rate at 2.5 percent and said the outlook for New
Zealand is stronger.  Australia ’s dollar strengthened to the
strongest since March against the yen after data showed the
nation unexpectedly added jobs last month.  “The statement from the RBNZ is less dovish than the market
had anticipated, and that’s why we see a stronger New Zealand
dollar,” said Yuki Sakasai, a foreign-exchange strategist in New
York at Barclays Plc. “The market saw the slight possibility of
a rate cut next year.”  New Zealand’s dollar touched 68.74 yen, the strongest since
March 19, before trading at 68.52 as of 5 p.m. in New York. It
rose 0.5 percent to 83.27 U.S. cents.  Australia’s dollar climbed 0.2 percent to 86.40 yen after
reaching 86.58 yen, a level unseen since March 27. The currency
rose 0.3 percent to at $1.0486.  New Zealand’s central bank decision was forecast by all 16
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The number of people  employed  in Australia increased by
13,900 in November, the statistics bureau said today, while
economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast the number would
be unchanged. The  unemployment rate  fell to 5.2 percent from 5.4
percent in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
