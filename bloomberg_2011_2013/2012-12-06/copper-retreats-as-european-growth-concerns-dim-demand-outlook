Copper futures dropped the most in
four weeks amid concern that persistent economic weakness in
Europe will undercut demand for the metal.  A report today showed the euro-area’s economy shrank in the
third quarter, slipping 0.1 percent from the previous three
months and confirming data from last month showing the currency
union fell into a recession. The  European Central Bank  cut its
forecast for 2013 to a contraction of 0.3 percent, rather than
expected growth of 0.5 percent.  “The commentary out of the ECB is weighing on the
market,” Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading Corp.
in Medford,  Oregon , said in a telephone interview. “The
problems in Europe aren’t going away.”  Copper futures for March delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$3.6445 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest drop since Nov. 7.  Inventories monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange
increased 1.8 percent to 253,575 metric tons on deliveries in
Rotterdam, daily exchange figures showed. Orders to withdraw the
metal declined to a three-month low.  “We probably won’t be in a solid economic zone in Europe
for at least a couple more years,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months dropped 0.9
percent to $8,000 a ton ($3.63 a pound).  Zinc, aluminum, lead and nickel also were lower in London.
