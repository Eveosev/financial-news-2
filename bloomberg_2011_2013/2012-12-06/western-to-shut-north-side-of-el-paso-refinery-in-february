Western Refining Inc. (WNR)  plans to shut a
portion of its El Paso refinery in Texas starting in February
for planned work.  Maintenance at the north side of the plant is expected to
last several weeks and the section will run at reduced rates,
 Gary Hanson , a Tempe, Arizona-based spokesman for the company,
said in an telephone interview.  The south side will continue to operate during the
turnaround, Hanson said.  The two plants are operated as a single refinery and have a
combined capacity of 128,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
