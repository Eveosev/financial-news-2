Angola ’s PSVM oil project, operated
by BP Plc, has started operations, according to the country’s
oil minister.  “PSVM, on Block 31, has already begun producing.”
Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos, Angola’s minister of
petroleum, said today in Luanda. “We can consider the start of
this production a positive sign”  The PSVM project, an abbreviation for the Plutao, Saturno,
Venus and Marte fields, is the latest addition to Angola’s
growing oil supply. Two cargoes of Saturno crude are scheduled
to be exported in January, according to loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg.  Angola’s crude output  has averaged 1.75 million barrels a
day so far this year, making the OPEC member nation Africa’s
second-largest producer, after  Nigeria , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
