Verbio Vereinigte BioEnergie AG said
its domestic plants are running as normal after the
German biofuels producer shelved plans to invest in Eastern
Europe.  The facilities, which supply  biodiesel  and bioethanol to
 oil companies , are operating at about 80 percent of capacity,
spokeswoman Isabel Rossberger said today by phone from Leipzig,
 Germany . Verbio will no longer proceed with plans to build
production facilities in Serbia, Hungary and Germany, she said.  Verbio decided against the investment because of
competition from Indonesian and Argentinian imports as well as
regulatory uncertainty in the European Union, according to a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
