(Corrects Coutts & Co. assets under management in final

and losses after the benchmark index closed at a 16-month high
yesterday and U.S. economic data topped estimates. AIA Group
Ltd. fell after a major shareholder sold its entire stake.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., gained 1.9 percent.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a
state-owned developer, rose 3.6 percent, extending gains from
yesterday on the government’s pledge to maintain growth and

from China,” said Jackson Wong, vice president of Hong Kong-
based Tanrich Securities Co. “Investors tend to be a little
cautious when we hit new highs. Hong Kong is on the positive
side if A-shares continue to climb back and funds still flow in.
U.S. economic data is pretty good. With China’s new leadership,
a new set of policies would push consumption and
infrastructure.”  Hang Seng Surge  Hong Kong’s benchmark index surged 22 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 to yesterday, its highest close since
August 2012. Shares rose as central banks from China, U.S.,
Europe and  Japan  added stimulus and economic reports showed
signs of recovery. The measure  traded  at 11.6 times average

debate in about a week if Republicans move.  U.S. orders for equipment such as computers and electrical
gear climbed in October, indicating U.S. manufacturing is
stabilizing heading into the looming fiscal cliff, $600 billion
of automatic spending cuts and tax increases if a budget deal
isn’t reached.  Service industries  in the U.S. unexpectedly grew
at a faster pace in November.  Li & Fung  Li & Fung rose 1.9 percent to HK$12.92.  Man Wah Holdings

at Coutts & Co., which had 29.5 billion pounds ($47.4 billion)
in assets under management at the end of September, said in a
Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong. “We’re seeing a mini bull-
market on our screens at the moment. We do need consistency to
global growth and that will be he challenge in the first
quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
