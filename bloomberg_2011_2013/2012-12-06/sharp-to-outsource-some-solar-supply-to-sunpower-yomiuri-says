Sharp Corp. (6753)  will outsource some
production of residential solar panels to  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  of the
U.S., the Yomiuri newspaper said today without citing anyone.  Sharp, which also makes solar panels, signed a contract to
sell SunPower’s modules under its own brand as part of its
restructuring plans, the newspaper said. Sharp spokeswoman
 Miyuki Nakayama  wasn’t immediately available for comment.  SunPower said Dec. 4 that it extended a supply agreement
with  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  for residential solar panels through 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
