Canada ’s banking  regulator  will
release its final Basel III capital adequacy rules next week
with some minor changes from guidelines released earlier this
year, a spokeswoman said.  The final guidelines include “a few minor tweaks from the
draft as a result of comments received during the consultation
period and developments in other jurisdictions,” said Leonie
Roux, communications officer at the Office of the Superintendent
of Financial Institutions.  Some nations are struggling to meet a Jan. 1, 2013,
deadline for starting to apply the revised Basel rules, which
were drawn up by global regulators to prevent a repeat of the
financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.  While declining to comment on the changes, Roux said that
OSFI has told banks they should “plan to hold enough capital”
to meet standards stipulated by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision by the beginning of 2013 even though countries have
until 2019 to fully apply the Basel III rules.  “This is prudent given the current environment; Canadian
banks are currently well positioned to meet or exceed this
expectation,” Roux said.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , Canada’s fifth-largest
bank, said today in a quarterly earnings report its estimated
common equity Tier 1 ratio is 9 percent, compared with the 7
percent minimum requirement proposed by the Basel Committee and
OSFI.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the nation’s second-largest lender
which also reported quarterly  results  today, said its estimated
Tier 1 ratio is 8.2 percent, exceeding “the new 7 percent
requirement on a fully-phased in basis.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
