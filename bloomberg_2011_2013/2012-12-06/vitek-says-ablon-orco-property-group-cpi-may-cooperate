Czech billionaire Radovan Vitek said
Czech Property Investments AS and eastern Europe’s real-estate
developers  Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA and  Ablon Group (ABL)  Ltd, in which
Vitek holds stakes, may cooperate in the future.  “For the future, there’s a possibility that CPI, Ablon,
and Orco will cooperate on acquisitions, development and
property management,” Vitek said yesterday in a statement.  CPI announced yesterday that it will purchase a 30 percent
stake in Ablon and may possibly acquire the remaining stake in
the Hungarian developer later on.  CPI already controls 30 percent stake in Orco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
