Georgian lawmakers approved a draft
law granting 215 people political prisoner or exile status,
allowing them to seek retrial after being jailed under the last
administration, led by U.S. ally Mikheil Saakashvili’s party.  Seventy-seven deputies in the 150-seat parliament in
Kutaisi, the Black Sea nation’s second-largest city, voted in
favor of the resolution, while 14 were against, according to
parliament’s press office.  “This resolution doesn’t mean that they will be released
immediately, there will be a long process on their cases since
some of them committed crimes and political substance was added
later,” Tina Khidasheli, a member of the ruling coalition, said
by phone after the vote.  Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition
coalition won Oct. 1 parliamentary elections, defeating
Saakashvili’s United National Movement and ending its nine-year
rule. Ivanishvili promised to raise  living standards , improve
relations with  Russia  and to restore justice.  The resolution was drafted by Parliament’s Committee for
 Human Rights  and contains a list people arrested and convicted
for various criminal charges under the previous government.
Deputies must now develop the legal framework for processing
retrials, Khidasheli said.  Including on the list those convicted of spying for Russia
is a “shameful” decision, UNM member Chiora Taktakishvili said
by phone today.  Some people on the list were arrested during or after
street protests in May 2011 and charged with an attempt “to
stage armed provocations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
