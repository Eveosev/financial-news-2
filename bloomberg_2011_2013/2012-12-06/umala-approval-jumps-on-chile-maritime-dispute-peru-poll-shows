Peruvian President  Ollanta Humala ’s
approval rating climbed the most in nine months amid optimism
the country will win a maritime border dispute with  Chile , a
poll showed this week.  Humala’s rating rose to 50 percent from 44 percent the
month earlier, according to a poll by Datum Internacional for
Lima-based newspaper  Gestion .  Peru, the world’s biggest producer of fishmeal, is
contesting Chile’s control of 66,680 square kilometers (25,745
square miles) of rich fishing waters off the two Andean
neighbors’ Pacific coast. Peru, which in 2009 filed a claim with
the International Court of Justice in The Hague, presented its
case on Dec. 3-4, and Chile follows today and tomorrow. Datum’s
poll shows 67 percent of those questioned expect Peru to win.  Datum questioned 1,217 people nationwide from Nov. 30
through Dec. 4. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus
2.9 percentage points.  The two countries have a history of animosity going back to
before the five-year War of the Pacific that ended in 1884, when
Chile invaded  Lima  and stripped Peru and its ally Bolivia of
mineral-rich territories that later helped make Chile the
world’s biggest copper producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
