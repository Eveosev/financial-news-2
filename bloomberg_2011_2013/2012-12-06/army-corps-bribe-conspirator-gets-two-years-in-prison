The brother of an ex- Army Corps  of
Engineers official at the center of a $20 million bribery and
false-billing scheme involving federal contracts was sentenced
to two years in prison after admitting he hid kickback payments.  Nazim Khan was sentenced today in federal court in
Washington after pleading guilty in June to one count of
conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen
property. Khan, who agreed to forfeit more than $83,000, was
ordered by U.S. District Judge  Emmet Sullivan  to pay about
$200,000 in restitution.  Nazim Khan is the brother of Kerry Khan, a former program
manager at the Army Corps who prosecutors called “the
ringleader of largest bribery and bid-steering scheme in the
history of federal contracting.” Nazim Khan is one of 12 people
who have pleaded guilty in the ongoing probe.  Kerry Khan, formerly of Alexandria,  Virginia , pleaded
guilty on May 17 to taking bribes and conspiring to launder
money. The scheme took advantage of a five-year technology
contract with the Army Corps under the so-called TIGER program,
according to an indictment unsealed on Oct. 4.  Kerry Khan is scheduled to be sentenced next year.  The case is U.S. v. Khan, 12-00098, U.S. District Court,
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story: Tom Schoenberg in
