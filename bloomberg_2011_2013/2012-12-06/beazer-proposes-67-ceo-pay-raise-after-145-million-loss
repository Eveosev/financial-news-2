(Corrects story published Dec. 5 to show the executives
held office for three months in the 2011 fiscal year.)  Compensation for the chief executive
officer of  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  would rise 67 percent under a
proposal by the company’s board.  Allan Merrill, 46, the Atlanta-based homebuilder’s
president and CEO, would receive pay of $2.94 million for the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30, according to a proxy  statement  filed
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s
up from total compensation of $1.76 million in fiscal 2011, when
he was in the CEO position for about three and a half months.
The company reported a $145.3 million loss for fiscal 2012,
compared with $204.9 million a year earlier. It has had losses
each year since 2007, totaling $2.08 billion.  “During fiscal year 2012, the company delivered
significantly improved operating results, meeting or exceeding
virtually all of the operational goals it set out to achieve at
the beginning of the year,” according to a discussion of
executive compensation included in the filing.  Homebuilders are recovering from a six-year slump amid
record low  interest rates , rising  consumer confidence  and a
shrinking pool of existing homes listed  for sale . Beazer’s
orders increased 25 percent to 4,901 homes in fiscal 2012, sales
rose 36 percent to 4,428 houses and homebuilding revenue climbed
40 percent to $996.1 million, the company said Nov. 12.  U.S.  construction spending  in October increased 1.4 percent
from the previous month to $872.1 billion, and spending on new-
home construction rose 3 percent to $294.2 billion, its highest
level since November 2008, the Commerce Department reported this
week. U.S. home prices jumped 6.3 percent in October from a year
earlier, the biggest increase since June 2006, data provider
CoreLogic Inc. said yesterday.  CFO Increase  Beazer’s board proposed raising the compensation for Chief
Financial Officer Robert Salomon 95 percent to $1.32 million,
and 26 percent to $1.32 million for Kenneth Khoury, the
company’s general counsel and chief administrative officer.
Salomon took office when Merrill became CEO in June 2011, while
Khoury assumed the added role of chief administrative officer.  Carey Phelps, a Beazer spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone message and e-mail seeking comment.  Beazer shareholders get to participate in a non-binding
“Say on Pay” vote when the company holds its annual meeting in
Atlanta on Feb. 1. The last compensation package won 95 percent
of the vote after a majority of shareholders voted against a
proposal in 2011, according to the filing.  Merrill succeeded  Ian McCarthy , who was replaced after an
accounting scandal spurred an SEC investigation that led
McCarthy to return $6.5 million in compensation. Merrill joined
Beazer in 2007 as CFO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
