Spain and  Portugal  will again lead a
drop in volumes of decorative paint sales in southern  Europe 
next year as construction and renovation work continues to
slump,  Wendel’s (MF)  Materis Paints predicted.  Volumes may decline 18 percent in the two countries in
2013, following a 50 percent drop from 2008 to 2012, Europe’s
third-largest maker of decorative paint said in a presentation
today. Volumes in  France  and  Italy , the two largest markets for
Materis, will probably drop 8 percent and 12 percent,
respectively, the company predicted.  “Next year will be rather bad for our industry,”
Bertrand Dumazy, the head of the paint division, said at an
investor day in Paris. “We expect a rebound in 2014-2015.”  Materis Paints will reduce its headcount by 5 percent next
year after reducing staff by 7 percent this year as
profitability was hurt by falling demand and rising raw material
prices.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the world’s largest paintmaker, wrote
down the value of its decorative paint business in October by
2.5 billion euros ($3.24 billion) after a prolonged attempt to
turn around the unit failed to counter falling demand in Europe.  Revenue at Materis Paints may fall by about 4 percent in
2012 after sales of 816 million euros in 2011, Dumazy said.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
management fees dropped to 8.3 percent of sales in 2011 from
10.1 percent in 2010. The business is a unit of Materis SA,
which is 76 percent owned by French investment firm Wendel.  The price of titanium dioxide, a paint ingredient, peaked
at about 3,000 euros per ton six months ago, and is now 2,300
euros to 2,400 euros because of the global slowdown, Dumazy
said. The price may rebound in the second half of 2013 but is
unlikely to reach 3,000 euros, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
