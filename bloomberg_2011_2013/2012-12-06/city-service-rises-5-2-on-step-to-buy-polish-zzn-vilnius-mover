City Service AB (CTS1L) , the biggest Baltic
building maintenance company, rose the most since March after
saying it planned to complete the purchase of a Polish company
by year-end to start expanding into central  Europe .  The shares rose 5.2 percent in Vilnius to 1.82 euros, a 12-
week high, valuing the company at 57.5 million euros ($75
million). Volume of 42,603 shares was eight times the three-
month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Agreement this week with employees of Zespol Zarzadcow
Nieruchomosci Wam Sp zoo about social benefits opened the way to
completing privatization of the Polish facility manager in a
privatization deal, City Service said today on in a statement on
the Nasdaq OMX Vilnius exchange.  That would give it 3.4 percent of  Poland ’s residential
facility management market and create opportunities for further
expansion in central Europe, City Service said. It already
operates in Lithuania, Latvia, Russia and Ukraine.  “We treat the news as positive,” investment bank Finasta
in Vilnius said in a note to clients today. “The price City
Service will pay for ZZN is relatively high, but at the same
time it has proved many times that it is able to reorganize
poorly working companies and transfer its own know-how.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
