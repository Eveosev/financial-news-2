GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  declined the most in four
years in Paris trading after  Europe ’s largest utility by market
value forecast lower earnings next year and weakness in 2014.  GDF dropped as much as 16 percent, the most since October
2008. Recurring net income will slide to 3.1 billion euros ($4
billion) to 3.5 billion euros from an estimated 3.7 billion to
4.2 billion this year,  France ’s former gas monopoly said in a
statement. Profit will be “in the same range” in 2014, it
said. GDF will cut investments, while maintaining dividends.  “The operational trend is much worse than the market
perceived,” JPMorgan Cazenove analysts including Vincent de Blic said in a note. The outlook is “very disappointing.”  GDF fell 12 percent to 15.175 euros by 2:16 p.m. in Paris.  The utility, which issued the estimates before an investor
day in Paris today, said the weakening outlook results from a
“demand crisis” in Europe, slowing economic growth and a boom
in U.S. gas production. GDF follows EON SE,  Germany ’s largest
utility, in saying it won’t meet earnings goals for next year.  GDF plans to cut its share of profit from Europe as the
economic crisis in the region slows demand. The utility is
seeking to double sales of liquefied natural gas to  emerging
markets  by 2020 in a push into faster-growing economies.  The company is navigating “significant power overcapacity
in Europe” against a backdrop of policies to boost renewable
generation, Chief Financial Officer Isabelle Kocher said.  European demand for natural gas is down 14 percent since
2010 and power by 25 percent, according to a presentation by the
utility. The crisis will turn around in 2015, it said.  Financial Targets  “We are very confident for a rebound,” Chief Executive
Officer Gerard Mestrallet said, declining to give figures.  Financial targets for 2013 are based on estimated earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 13
billion to 14 billion euros, the Paris-based company said. That
compares with an Ebitda outlook of 17 billion euros this year.  The utility, which had debt of 45.9 billion euros at the
end of September, didn’t repeat a forecast from earlier this
year for recurring net income to reach 5 billion euros in 2015.
Yesterday’s statement only said it expects a “rebound.”  GDF plans to cut debt by a third to about 30 billion euros
by the end of 2014 and spending by about 20 percent to 7 billion
to 8 billion euros a year in 2013 and 2014. It earlier forecast
2013 spending at the lower end of a 9 billion to 11 billion-euro
range and 10 billion to 11 billion euros of investment in 2012.  Cost cuts will affect the company’s “gross profit and loss
contribution” by 3.5 billion euros in 2015. Asset sales will be
11 billion euros in 2013 and 2014, up from a typical 3 billion
euros. GDF will stick with a policy of at least maintaining its
dividend in 2013 and 2014, while it’s prepared to cut spending
further as shareholder payments take priority, Mestrallet said.  Its Ebitda and debt will partly fall as an investor accord
over its 34 percent-held  Suez Environnement (SEV)  ends, allowing it to
alter how it consolidates the company from July. The Ebitda will
drop 2.5 billion euros and debt 7.5 billion euros as a result.  To contact the reporter on this story:
