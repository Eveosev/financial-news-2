IRPC Pcl (IRPC) , an oil refiner and
petrochemical maker based in  Thailand , is seeking to buy from
600,000 to 1 million barrels of low-sulfur, or sweet, crude for
delivery during early February, according to two people who
participate in the market.  The shipment is to the company’s 215,000 barrel-a-day plant
in Rayong province, the people said, asking not to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media. The tender
closes at noon today in Bangkok.  To contact the reporter on this story:
