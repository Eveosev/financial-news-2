The pound stayed little changed after
the Bank of England left its bond-buying program and key
interest rate on hold.  Sterling was little changed at 81.10 pence per euro at
12:01 p.m. London time and was at $1.6104.  The London-based central bank left the asset purchase
target at 375 billion pounds and the benchmark interest rate at
a record-low 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
