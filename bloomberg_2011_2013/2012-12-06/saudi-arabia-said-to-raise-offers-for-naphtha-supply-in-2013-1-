Saudi Arabian Oil Co. offered naphtha
supplies in the first half of 2013 at premiums that are as much
as $7 a metric ton more than those in the second half of 2012,
said three people with knowledge of discussions with buyers.  The company known as  Saudi Aramco  yesterday offered A-310
naphtha at a premium of $36 a metric ton to its benchmark
formula, the people said, asking not to be identified because
the discussions are confidential. Rabigh and Jeddah grades were
at premiums of $32 a ton, while Al-Jubail was offered at $33 and
A-180 grade at $30, they said.  Nobody answered a telephone call and two e-mails to the
companyâ€™s media relations department in Dhahran.  For the second half of 2012, Saudi Aramco set premiums for
A-310 at $33 a ton, Al-Jubail at $29 and A-180 grade at $31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rabigh and Jeddah
grades were sold at $25 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
