Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , the firm
that agreed to buy  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , agreed to pay Chairman
Ian Cumming and President Joseph Steinberg each $9.02 million in
bonuses tied to performance in 2009 and 2010.  The funds were awarded by the compensation committee on
Dec. 3, New York-based Leucadia said today in a regulatory
filing.  Steinberg and Cumming, who have run the company since the
1970s, arranged for leadership transition with the deal to buy
Jefferies.  Richard Handler , who leads the New York-based
investment bank, will take over as Leucadia chief executive
officer, replacing Cumming, the firm said last month. Steinberg
will become chairman. Leucadia said Steinberg and Cumming had
been paid less than their maximum bonus for 2009 and 2010.  Leucadia retained “full discretion to consider all
relevant and appropriate facts when determining whether to award
some or all of the remaining bonus,” the company said in the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
