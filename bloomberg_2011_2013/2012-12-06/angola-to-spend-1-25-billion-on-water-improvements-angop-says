Angola will spend at least 120
billion kwanza ($1.25 billion) next year to improve water
supplies and distribution networks in seven of the southwest
African countryâ€™s 18 provinces, the state-run news agency Angop
reported, citing Lucrecio Costa, the national water director.   The projects in Huila, Huambo, Bie, Kwanza Norte, Malanje,
Moxico and Lunda Sul will be funded through a World Bank loan,
Costa said. The work includes water treatment plants, home
piping and help to start water companies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
