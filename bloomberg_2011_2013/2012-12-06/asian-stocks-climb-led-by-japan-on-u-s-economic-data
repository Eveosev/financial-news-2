Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its highest close in eight months,
after data on U.S. services and factory orders beat estimates.  Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker that counts  North
America  as its biggest market, gained 1.6 percent in  Tokyo .
 Largan Precision Co. (3008) , a supplier of camera lenses for Apple
Inc.’s iPhone, jumped 7 percent in Taipei after reporting sales
more than doubled last month. SC Global Developments Ltd. surged
50 percent in Singapore after Chief Executive Officer Simon
Cheong offered to buy the rest of the property developer.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 0.4 percent to 125.7 as
of 7:32 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its highest close since April
3. About three shares rose for every two that fell on the gauge.
The measure advanced last month amid signs of recovery in the
world’s two largest economies and optimism U.S. lawmakers will
agree on a budget deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  “The economic data looks OK and that’s been supporting the
share market,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of strategy
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion
under management. “Markets will have to see a resolution of the
U.S. fiscal cliff for the rally to continue.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  increased 0.8 percent
after the yen traded near a seven-month low, boosting the
outlook for Japanese exporters. South Korea’s Kospi Index added
0.1 percent. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index gained 1.3
percent.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost 0.1 percent, while a gauge
of Chinese companies listed in the city rose 0.3 percent after a
jump of 2.9 percent yesterday. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
slipped 0.1 percent after yesterday surging by the most in three
months.  Australian Unemployment  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.2 percent, paring
losses of as much as 0.3 percent, as the nation’s unemployment
rate unexpectedly dropped in November. The joblessness fell to
5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in October, the statistics bureau
said in Sydney today. That compares with the median estimate of
5.5 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.2 percent yesterday as a few dozen
Republicans joined a bipartisan call to break the impasse over
taxes for the highest-earning Americans, signing a letter
calling for exploration of “all options.”  President  Barack Obama  told a business group that lawmakers
probably could solve the debate in about a week if Republicans
move. A budget compromise would help avert the fiscal cliff,
which could result in more than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts taking effect next month.  U.S. Manufacturing  U.S. orders for equipment such as computers and electrical
gear climbed in October by the most in eight months, indicating
U.S. manufacturing is stabilizing heading into the looming
fiscal cliff.  Service industries  in the U.S. unexpectedly grew
at a faster pace in November.  Exporters advanced. Honda climbed 1.6 percent to 2,747 yen
in Tokyo. Sony Corp., the market of Bravia televisions and
PlayStation game consoles, jumped 3.4 percent to 816 yen.  Li &
Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 1.9 percent to HK$12.92 in  Hong Kong .  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, advanced 2.6
percent to 3,000 yen in Tokyo after the Wall Street Journal
reported the company plans to triple China sales.  Sharp Rallies  Sharp Corp. (6753) , Japan’s biggest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, surged 9.9 percent to 199 yen, the most since Sept. 4.
The company will outsource production of residential solar
panels to SunPower Corp. of the U.S., the Yomiuri newspaper said
today without citing anyone.  Largan Precision climbed 7 percent to NT$856 in Taipei.
Sales in November increased to NT$2.8 billion ($96.2 million)
from NT$1.2 billion, the company said yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 15 percent through
yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added
stimulus to spur economic growth. The benchmark index traded at
14.1 times estimated earnings, compared with 13.6 times for the
 S&P 500 Index  and 12.5 times for the Stoxx Europe 600.  Raw material producers advanced after the  London Metals
Exchange Index (LMEX)  of base metals, including copper and aluminum,
rose 0.4 percent yesterday. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
largest mining company, added 1 percent to A$59.92 in Sydney.
United Co. Rusal, the largest aluminum producer, climbed 2.1
percent to HK$4.84 in Hong Kong.  Vehicle Recall  SC Global surged 50 percent to S$1.805, headed for the
highest close since April 2010. Cheong, who already owns 55
percent of the company, offered to buy the rest of the company
at S$1.80 apiece and take it private. The bid values the
developer at S$745 million ($611 million).  Among stocks that fell, Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. sank
3.9 percent to HK$3.67 in Hong Kong after the Chinese carmaker
recalled some vehicle models in Australia after engines were
found to contain asbestos fibre.  LG Electronics Inc. slid 1.5 percent to 74,000 won in  Seoul 
after South Korea’s second-largest electronics maker was fined
by the European Union over price-fixing deals on now-obsolete
