Crude options volatility rose after
oil fell when European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
the regionâ€™s slump will linger until the second half of 2013.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.71 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:15 p.m., up from 26.73 yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil slid $1.62, or 1.8 percent, to
$86.26 a barrel at 2:19 p.m. on the Nymex.  The ECB cut its growth and inflation forecasts and Draghi
left the door open for further interest rate reductions, saying
that ECB policy makers considered a rate cut today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $100 calls, which slipped 5 cents to 27 cents a barrel
on volume of 6,576 lots at 2:20 p.m. January $85 puts were the
second-most active, with 3,737 lots exchanged as they gained 40
cents to 97 cents.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 57
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 51 percent of
the 100,191 contracts traded.  February $105 calls were the most active options yesterday
with 6,068 contracts changing hands. They fell 3 cents to 14
cents a barrel. January $85 puts rose 4 cents to 57 cents on
4,533 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,796 contracts. Next were January $60 puts, at 34,922 lots,
and January $110 calls, with 31,406.  To contact the reporter on this story:
