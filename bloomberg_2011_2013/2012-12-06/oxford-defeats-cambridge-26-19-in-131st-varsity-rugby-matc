Oxford University rallied to defeat
Cambridge University 26-19 in rugby union’s 131st  Varsity Match ,
giving the Dark Blues their third straight win in the annual
game.  Sam Egerton, Jamie Harris and Charlie Marr had second-half
tries as Oxford scored the final 20 points to erase a 19-6
deficit at Twickenham Stadium in  London .  Marr also kicked five points, and Cassian Bramham-Law
booted a pair of penalties, as the Dark Blues overcame losing
captain  John Carter  to a first-half injury.  “Absolute grit from the boys,” Egerton, who was named Man
of the Match, told  Sky Sports . “It’s about those 23 boys, we
just pulled together.”  Andy Murdoch scored a try for Cambridge and Rob Stephen
kicked 14 points. The Light Blues lead the series 61 to 56, with
14 draws.  Stephen booted three penalties in the opening 17 minutes to
give Cambridge a 9-0 lead. After Bramham-Law kicked a pair of
penalties for Oxford, Murdoch went over and Stephen converted to
give Cambridge a 16-6 halftime lead.  The Light Blues increased their advantage to 19-6 three
minutes after the restart on Stephen’s fourth penalty. Egerton
then started the Oxford comeback by spinning away from a
defender to touch down in the 51st minute, though Bramham-Law
missed his conversion.  Harris went over 10 minutes later to draw Oxford within
three points. The Dark Blues then took a 23-19 lead in the 68th
minute when Egerton offloaded the ball to Marr, who went over
next to the post and converted the try.  Marr then closed the scoring and clinched the victory with
a penalty in the 78th minute.  “At halftime, I think most people thought we were out of
it,” Oxford coach James Wade said. “The effort and worth the
boys put in in that second half, it was pretty incredible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
