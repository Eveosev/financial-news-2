Japanese stock futures were little
changed as investors awaited monthly U.S. payrolls data that may
give evidence about the strength of the economic recovery.  American Depositary Receipts  of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest bank by market value, gained
0.4 percent as Morgan Stanley advised buying the shares. ADRs of
 Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , which gets about a quarter of its sales in the
U.S., slid 0.7 percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring this
month closed at 9,540 in Chicago yesterday, the same level at
which they closed in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-
market at 9,530 in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 0.4 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid
less than 0.1 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than
0.1 percent today. The gaueg gained 0.3 yesterday as Apple Inc.
rebounded from its biggest drop in four years and investors
weighed prospects for a budget deal in Washington.  Jobless claims decreased by 25,000 to 370,000 in the week
ended Dec. 1, Labor Department figures showed. The median
forecast of 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
drop to 380,000.  Data today from the department of labor is expected to show
U.S. payrolls rose by 85,000 workers last month, the smallest
gain since June, according to the median forecast of economists.  The  European Central Bank  cut its growth forecast and
central bank President  Mario Draghi  said the euro area won’t
start to shake off its slump until the second half of 2013,
leaving the door open to further interest-rate reductions. The
ECB now forecasts the economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year,
more than the 0.4 percent contraction it predicted in September.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 15 percent through
yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added
stimulus to spur economic growth. The benchmark index traded at
14.2 times estimated earnings, compared with 13.6 times for the
 S&P 500 Index  and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. gained 0.1 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
