Egypt  plans to expand the use of
natural gas as a transport fuel to reduce its reliance on
imports, according to Oil Minister Osama Kamal.  About 30,000 vehicles will shift to gas in the current
financial year, saving the government 300 million Egyptian
pounds ($49 million) in subsidies, Kamal said today at a press
conference in Cairo.  Most of the country’s retail stations will have gas in the
next two years, Local Development Minister Ahmed Zaki Abdeen
said at the conference.  The nation’s gas output rose to 61.3 billion cubic meters
last year, compared with 25.2 billion a decade earlier,
according to BP Plc’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
