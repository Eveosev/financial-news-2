Hungary ’s budget deficit widened to
691.7 billion forint ($3.2 billion), or 120 percent of the
annual target, in the first 11 months of the year, the  Economy
Ministry  said.  The budget booked a deficit of 33.6 billion forint in
November, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hungary, which targets a budget deficit of 2.7 percent of
economic output this year, submitted amendments to Parliament on
854 billion forint of previously announced savings to be
included in the 2013 budget, Economy Ministry deputy state
secretary Peter Beno Banai told reporters today in Budapest.
Hungary wants to keep the deficit below 3 percent of output this
year and next year to exit the European Union’s excessive-
deficit procedure and prevent a cut in EU funding, aid
negotiator Mihaly Varga said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
