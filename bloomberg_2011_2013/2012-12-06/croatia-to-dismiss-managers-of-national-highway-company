The  Croatian government  is expected
to dismiss the four-member management board of Hrvatske
Autoceste d.o.o.,  Jutarnji List  reported, citing Transport
Minister Sinisa Hajdas Doncic.  The managers will be dismissed at the government’s session
today as they have not worked on restructuring the company,
Hajdas Doncic said, according to Jutarnji.  Croatia  on Dec. 4 picked a group led by Austria’s  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS)  to advise in a search for an operator of the
country’s new highway system. The government owes banks an
estimated 3.7 billion euros ($4.8 billion) for financing road
construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
