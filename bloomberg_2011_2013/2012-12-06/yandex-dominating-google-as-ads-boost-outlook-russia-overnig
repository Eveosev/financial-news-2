Yandex NV (YNDX)  is rebounding from the
smallest premium versus  Google Inc. (GOOG)  since  Russia ’s most-used
search engine began trading in 2011 on prospects its  domination 
over the U.S. company will spur record sales this quarter.  Shares of Yandex surged 5 percent to $21.98 in New York
yesterday, the steepest one-day jump since Aug. 16 and the
biggest advance on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. The rally lifted
Yandex to 26 times estimated earnings, up from a valuation of
24.8 on Dec. 4. That was the smallest premium on record compared
with the 17.3 multiple for  Mountain View , California-based
Google. Futures on Russia’s RTS Index dropped 0.3 percent to
146,310 in  New York .  Yandex, which got  90 percent  of revenue from text-based
advertising in the last quarter, has  averaged  a 60.4 percent
share of the Russian Web search market since September, compared
with 26.5 percent for Google, the world’s largest search engine.
Yandex will post fourth-quarter revenue of 8.9 billion rubles
($288 million), according to the median of three estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Yandex is a unique company, it’s a very rare example of a
local company winning a competition against Google,” Konstantin Chernyshev, the head of research at UralSib Capital Corp. who
has a buy rating on the shares, said by phone yesterday from
Moscow. “Since Yandex has the biggest market share, it gets the
most of the money spent on online advertising in Russia.”  Russian online advertising will rise by an average 22
percent a year between 2013 and 2016, UralSib Financial says.  Net Income  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies
traded in the U.S. climbed 0.4 percent to 94.95 yesterday, a
one-month high. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest
dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, added 0.2 percent to
$28.44, the highest level since Oct. 22. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in futures, rose 2.1
percent to 21.38 points.  Futures expiring in December on the ruble showed the
currency weakening 0.2 percent to 31.004 per dollar after the
ruble slid 0.3 percent to 30.90 against the dollar yesterday.  Yandex’s  net income  is expected to increase to a record
$267.3 million this year from $196.8 million in 2011, according
to the mean estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue is expected to increase to $933 million in 2012 and $1.2
billion in 2013, according to the mean estimate of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gross domestic product in Russia, the world’s largest
energy exporter will, expand 3.5 percent in 2013 after advancing
3.6 percent in 2012, according to the median estimate of 35
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Oil Retreats  Oil, which together with natural gas made up a half of
Russia’s  federal budget  revenue in 2011, fell to the lowest
level in three weeks in New York after the  European Central Bank 
cut its euro-area growth forecasts and as U.S. lawmakers
struggled to reach agreement on a budget plan.  Crude for January delivery slumped 1.8 percent to $86.26 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest

year. Brent oil for January settlement declined 1.6 percent to
$107.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Urals crude , the country’s main export blend, fell 1.6
percent to $105.44 a barrel yesterday, the lowest level since
July 31.  OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY) , the oil arm of Russia’s natural gas
exporter, slipped 0.6 percent to $22.96. The ADR was the biggest
decliner on the Bloomberg-Russia gauge yesterday. The company’s
 shares  in Moscow added less than 0.1 percent to 142.85 rubles,
or $4.62. Five Moscow-traded shares equal one ADR.  The 30-stock benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.2 percent to

earnings , compared with a multiple of 15.9 for the main index in
 India (SENSEX) , 16.5 for Brazil and  China’s (SHCOMP)  9.8.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
