MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, posted the  biggest drop  in the 81-company Standard &
Poor’s 500 Financials Index after Barclays Plc downgraded the
firm, citing interest rates and lower expectations for buybacks.  MetLife fell 1.7 percent to $32.76 at 10:28 a.m. in New
York. The insurer has gained 5.1 percent this year, compared
with the 21 percent advance of the financials benchmark.  Interest rates  near record lows will pressure earnings of
life insurers, which invest in bonds and other assets to back
obligations to policyholders, analysts led by  Jay Gelb  at
Barclays wrote in a research note today. They  cut MetLife  to the
equivalent of hold from buy, and lowered their outlook on the
U.S. life insurance industry to neutral from positive.  “We see no end in sight to persistent low interest rates,
which should result in growing pressure on life insurers’
earnings,” the analysts wrote.  MetLife shares may climb to $37, compared with a previous
price target of $42, the Barclays analysts wrote. Oversight from
the Federal Reserve may prevent New York-based MetLife from
repurchasing shares next year, the analysts said.  Prudential
Financial Inc. (PRU)  and  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  may also be
“restrained” in buybacks in 2013 by U.S. oversight, according
to the report.  Prudential, the No. 2 U.S. life insurer, fell 36 cents to
$52.25. AIG, the insurer that counts the U.S. as its largest
shareholder, lost 1.2 percent to $33.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
