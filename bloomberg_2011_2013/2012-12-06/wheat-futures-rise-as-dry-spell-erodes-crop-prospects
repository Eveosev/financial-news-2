Wheat prices gained for a second
straight day on speculation that dry weather may curb production
in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Rainfall and snow will miss winter-wheat areas in the Great
Plains, forecaster Commodity Weather Group said in a report
today. Little or no rain has fallen during the past 30 days in
parts of  Oklahoma , Texas and  Kansas , the biggest U.S. grower of
winter wheat, National Weather Service data show.  “They’re dry as far as the eye can see,”  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in Des
Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “That by itself is
going to offer some underlying support for wheat.”  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for March
delivery gained 0.2 percent to settle at $8.62 a bushel at 2
p.m. For the year, prices still are up 32 percent after the
worst U.S. drought in 56 years.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
