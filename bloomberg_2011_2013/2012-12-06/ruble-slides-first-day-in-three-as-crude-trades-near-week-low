The ruble snapped two days of gains
and bond yields rose as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
traded near the lowest level in a week.  The ruble slid 0.3 percent to 30.90 against the dollar and
rose 0.3 percent versus the euro to 40.17 by the close in
Moscow. The currency was little changed versus the central
bank’s euro-dollar target basket. An index of five-year
government bond yields rose nine basis points to 6.5632 percent.  Crude in New York lost 1.4 percent to $86.65 a barrel after
the European Central Bank cut its euro-area growth forecasts and
as U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach agreement on a budget plan.
Oil and natural gas account for about 50 percent of Russian
government revenue.  “The U.S. fiscal cliff is at the peak of everyone’s
interest right now,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by e-mail.  A few dozen Republicans joined a bipartisan push to break
an impasse between U.S. President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker
John Boehner over taxes for the highest-earning Americans,
signing a letter calling for openness to “all options.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.3672 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose one basis point to 193,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
