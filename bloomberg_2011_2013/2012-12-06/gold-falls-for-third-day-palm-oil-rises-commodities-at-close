longest winning streak in 15 months, on concern that  China ’s
economic recovery may be slower than expected and as data may
confirm a recession in  Europe .  Metal for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.5
percent to $8,031 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $8,032.75 at 1:57 p.m. in  Shanghai . The contract touched
$8,095.75 yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 19, and gained
4 percent in the five-day advance.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold dropped for a third day to trade near a one-month low
as a stronger dollar damped demand for commodities,
overshadowing the highest ever holdings in exchange-traded
products backed by bullion.  Spot gold slid as much as 0.4 percent to $1,687.15 an
ounce, and was at $1,690.88 at 3:34 p.m. in Singapore. The metal

as the dollar rallied on speculation that U.S. lawmakers will
reach a budget agreement. Holdings in ETPs climbed to 2,627.59
metric tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gold  for February delivery lost 0.2 percent to $1,691.20

almost a month on speculation that output in  South America  will
be less-than-forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
after planting delays. Rice rose.  Soybeans for January delivery climbed as much as 0.8
percent to $14.91 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
highest price for a most-active contract since Nov. 9, and were

0.2 percent to at $8.5875 a bushel.  Rough rice for delivery in January increased 0.1 percent to
$15.57 per 100 pounds, the highest price for the most-active
contract since Aug. 30.  Rubber dropped from the highest level in more than seven
weeks as decreasing crude  oil prices  outweighed optimism that
demand from China, the world’s largest consumer, will increase.  Rubber for delivery in May fell 0.5 percent to end at 263.7
yen a kilogram ($3,199 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange. The most-active contract earlier climbed to 266.2 yen,
the highest price since Oct. 15.  Palm oil  climbed to snap a seven-day losing streak on
