Italian bonds fell, pushing 10-year
 yields  up by the most in four months, as former Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi  threatened to stop supporting the government,
risking the disintegration of the parliamentary coalition.  The nation’s securities dropped for a second day as Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  survived a confidence vote after the head
of Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party in the Senate said his
group wouldn’t put the full weight of its support behind an
economic stimulus bill. German 10-year  yields  dropped to the
lowest in four months after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said there was a “wide discussion” on  interest
rates  before a policy decision today.  “Political risk has clearly increased in Italy today, even
though Monti survived,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “That’s
undermined peripheral bonds, particularly  Italy , and given a
little bit of support to bunds.”  Italian 10-year yields jumped 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 4.58 percent at 4:50 p.m.  London  time,
after climbing as much as 18 basis points, the most since Aug.
2. The 5.5 percent bond due November 2022 fell 1.075, or 10.75
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,297) face amount, to 107.665.  Two-year note  yields  added 12 basis points to 2.04 percent,
after rising to 2.16 percent, the highest level since Nov. 21.  Monti’s Vote  Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party will take a “position
of abstention” regarding the government, according to Maurizio
Gasparri, head of the party in the Senate. The decision by the
PDL came about 12 hours after Berlusconi criticized the
government and said he may run in elections due within months.  Italian 10-year yields climbed to a euro-era record of 7.48
percent in November 2011 as Berlusconi’s government unraveled to
be replaced by an administration of technocrats led by Monti, a
former European Union competition commissioner and economics
professor.  German bunds rose as Draghi’s comments boosted speculation
of interest-rate cuts. The  10-year yield  fell five basis points
to 1.30 percent after reaching 1.29 percent, the lowest since
Aug. 3. Two-year note yields dropped five basis points to minus
0.05 percent, after declining as much as six basis points, the
most since July 30.  A negative yield means investors who hold the security
until it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  The ECB kept its  main refinancing rate  at an all-time low
of 0.75 percent today, in line with the median estimate of 61
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Weak activity is expected to continue into next year,”
Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  after the
decision. The ECB last cut rates in July.  ‘Downbeat Expectations’  “The combination of this comment and very downbeat ECB
projections will obviously keep rate-cut speculation alive,”
said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank
AG in London. The speculation “is feeding through across the
yield curve” and boosting German debt securities.  A report earlier today confirmed the euro-area  economy  was
pushed into a recession for the second time in four years.  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation currency bloc
slipped 0.1 percent in the third quarter from the previous three
months, when it fell 0.2 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today, confirming an
initial estimate published on Nov. 15.  French Yields  French 10-year bond yields dropped to a record as borrowing
costs fell at an auction of securities due between 2018 and
2027.  France  allotted 3.97 billion euros of government debt,
completing its 2012 issuance plan. It sold 900 million euros of
benchmark 15-year bonds at an all-time low average yield of 2.56
percent, down from 2.85 percent on Sept. 6, the previous record.  The French 10-year yield was little changed at 1.99
percent, after falling to 1.986 percent. Austrian 10-year rates
were at 1.73 percent, after slipping to 1.727 percent, the
 lowest  since the euro’s debut in 1999. Belgian 10-year yields
fell to a record 2.12 percent.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets, followed by those of Italy and  Spain , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt gained 4.9 percent and Italy’s bonds made 20 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
