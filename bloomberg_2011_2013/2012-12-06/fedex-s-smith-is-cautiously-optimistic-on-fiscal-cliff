FedEx (FDX)  Corp. Chief Executive Officer
 Fred Smith  said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that Republicans
and Democrats will reach a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff.  Smith, speaking to the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.,
said today “both sides” want to avoid the more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect
early next year.  “The consequences of going over this fiscal cliff are
enormous,” Smith said. “It will result in a significant
reduction in U.S. GDP, in growth and additional unemployment,
and deficits.”  Smith, CEO of the operator of the world’s largest cargo
airline, predicted the  U.S. economy  would grow 2.5 percent in
2013. To expand, the U.S. must reduce dependence on foreign oil,
shrink the trade imbalance and lower taxes on corporations,
Smith said.  “It’s the people that invent, innovate and invest that are
the job creators,” Smith said. “Unless we can restore
incentives in the U.S. to invest, we cannot increase our GDP
growth rate and we cannot put our citizenry back to work.”  President  Barack Obama  and Republicans in Congress are
locked in a dispute over taxes and spending. Obama has offered
$4.4 trillion in deficit reduction over a decade and has vowed
he won’t sign any bill that doesn’t raise taxes on top earners.  Republicans, led by House Speaker  John Boehner , have
countered with a $2.2 trillion package of spending reductions
and revenue increases by limiting deductions and closing
loopholes. Boehner insists he won’t agree to higher tax rates at
any income level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
