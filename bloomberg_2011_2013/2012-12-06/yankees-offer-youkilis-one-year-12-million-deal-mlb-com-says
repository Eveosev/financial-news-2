The New York Yankees offered former
 Boston  Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis a one-year contract
worth $12 million,  MLB.com reports , citing an unidentified
person familiar with the situation.  Youkilis, 33, would help the Yankees offset the loss of
Alex Rodriguez, who will miss the start of the 2013 Major League
Baseball season while recovering from hip surgery and may be out
until July.  Youkilis spent his first 8 1/2 seasons with Boston, the
Yankeesâ€™ top rival in the American League Eastern Division,
before being traded to the Chicago White Sox last season.
Limited by a back injury, he hit a combined .235 with 19 home
runs and 60 runs batted in for the Red Sox and White Sox.  Youkilis, who had a $12.25 million salary last season, is a
three-time All-Star who has hit .283 with 148 homers and 610 RBI
over his nine major-league seasons. He can play first or third
base and finished third in the AL Most Valuable Player voting in
2008, when he hit .312 with 29 homers and 115 RBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
