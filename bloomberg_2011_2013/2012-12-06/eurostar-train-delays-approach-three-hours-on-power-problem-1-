Crossings between the U.K. and  France 
on Eurostar Group Ltd.’s train service are being delayed by as
much as 2 hours and 55 minutes owing to a power-supply
malfunction, according to the company’s Twitter Inc. account.  The delays begin this morning with waits of around 70
minutes, a Eurostar spokeswoman said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
