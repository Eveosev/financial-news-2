PA Resources AB (PAR) , a Swedish oil and
gas exploration company operating in Africa, jumped the most in
more than seven years in  Stockholm  trading after negotiating an
agreement for the Zarat Field in  Tunisia .  PA Resources  rose  as much as 50 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since June 2005 and only the second time it has
 exceeded  45 percent during a day. The shares traded 0.07 krona
higher at 0.27 krona as of 3:01 p.m. in Stockholm, valuing the
company at 153 million kronor ($23.1 million). Volume was almost
seven times the daily three-month average.  The company reached a tentative agreement on a joint deal
which straddles across territories, or a so-called unitization
agreement, it said in a statement today. The pact is with  Sonde
Resources Corp. (SOQ) , the Zarat license holder, and approval by the
Tunisian government is expected in the second quarter next year,
PA Resources said.  “Preliminary results indicate that the gas recycling
option is a viable production option which will allow the
production of oil and condensate in advance of gas blow-down,”
PA Resources said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
