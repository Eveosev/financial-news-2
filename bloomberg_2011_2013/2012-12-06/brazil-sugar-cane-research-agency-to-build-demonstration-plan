Centro de Tecnologia Canavieira, the
Brazilian sugar-cane research agency, will build an 80 million-
real ($38.5 million) plant to demonstrate a method of producing
ethanol from crop residues.  The plant, with the capacity to make 3 million liters
(793,000 gallons) of second-generation biofuel a year, will be
added to an existing cane mill in Sao Manuel next year, Oswaldo
Godoy, manager of projects at Piracicaba, Brazil-based CTC, said
today in a telephone interview.  Sugar-cane companies that use CTC’s technology will be able
to produce 30 percent to 50 percent more ethanol fuel from the
same amount of cane, he said.  “This represents a good business for mills,” he said. The
high quantity of biomass generated in cane fields means
“second-generation ethanol will first become viable in
 Brazil .”  The cost of turning cane juice into ethanol is about 1.10
reais a liter, and CTC’s technology, which uses a cocktail of
enzymes to break down tough materials, will produce fuel at
slightly under that, he said.  CTC expects to receive 300 million reais through 2016 from
development bank Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e
Social and government agency Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos
for various projects including the demonstration plant, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
