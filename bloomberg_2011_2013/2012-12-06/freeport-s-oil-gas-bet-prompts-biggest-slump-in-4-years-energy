Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s
$9 billion bet on Gulf of Mexico oil and gas assets is the
latest example of mining companies’ move into energy that ends
up hurting investors.  The company, the biggest publicly traded copper producer,
slumped 16 percent yesterday, the most in four years, after
saying it agreed to buy  Plains Exploration & Production Co. (PXP)  and
 McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  The stock fell 4.2 percent to $30.81 at
the close today in  New York .  Freeport, which mines in the U.S.,  Indonesia  and  Africa ,
said the deals will help it to keep expanding and that it
couldn’t find a suitable copper acquisition. The move was
criticized by BlackRock Inc., one of Freeport’s largest
investors, and Dan Rohr, an analyst at Morningstar Investment
Service, for failing to create any obvious cost savings.  “In some regards this is a return to an old model that we
had seen with the oil majors decades ago, owning significant
copper assets like Standard Oil did,” Rohr, who’s based in
 Chicago , said in an interview. “The market is telling you that
the whole may be worth less than the sum of the parts.”  BHP Billiton Ltd., the biggest mining company, took
writedowns after spending $20 billion last year on U.S. energy
assets. Vedanta Resources Plc, a London-based metals producer,
has dropped 49 percent since announcing a $8.67 billion
acquisition of Cairn  India  Ltd. in 2010 to gain access to
India’s biggest onshore oil field.  Mining Challenge  Despite that, there has been an increasing number of mining
companies buying energy assets. Including Plains and McMoRan,
there have been 19 of such deals with a combined value of $19.6
billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
There were 13 totaling $20.2 billion in 2011, up from $7.3
billion of transactions in 2010 and just $260 million in 2009,
the data show.  Freeport’s return to energy 18 years after it exited that
business by spinning off McMoRan illustrates the challenge
facing some of the biggest miners. While Freeport’s mines are
still profitable, it’s a matter of contention how the Phoenix-
based company spends that cash. Large, undeveloped deposits are
increasingly scarce and investors have grown unforgiving of
dealmaking missteps and construction delays.  The company posted third-quarter net income of $824 million
on $4.42 billion in sales. Cash and cash equivalents stood at
$3.73 billion on Sept. 30 and the company forecasts copper
output will rise by more than 25 percent over the next three
years. In contrast, McMoRan and Plains both lost money in the
third quarter.  ‘Limited’ Opportunities  Opportunities for investment in copper are “limited”
because mining projects take time to develop and most of the
large deposits are already owned by competitors, Freeport Chief
Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said yesterday on the
company’s conference call.  Freeport said it will pay about $50 a share in cash and
stock for Houston-based Plains, representing a takeover premium
of about 39 percent based on the companies’ Dec. 4 closing share
prices. Holders of McMoRan will get $14.75 in cash and 1.15
units of a royalty trust for each share. McMoRan’s closing price
on Dec. 4 was $8.46.  “It’s been a surprise and disappointment to a number of
investors who liked that focus” on copper,  Dwight Anderson ,
founder and managing partner of hedge fund Ospraie Management
LLC, which holds Freeport and Plains shares, said yesterday on
Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” with  Stephanie Ruhle 
and  Erik Schatzker . “It shows the difficulty in actually being
able to put  cash flow  and capital to work in the space.”  ‘Beggars Belief’  Analysts at Deutsche Bank AG, Macquarie Bank Ltd.,
Citigroup Inc.,  RBC Capital Markets , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and BMO Capital Markets cut their ratings on Freeport shares
after the deals were announced. BMO downgraded Freeport to hold
from buy “on possible diminished shareholder returns, unwanted
diversification and self-inflicted loss of trust,”  Tony Robson ,
co-head of metals and mining, said in a note today.  There are no apparent cost savings to be had from buying
Plains or McMoRan, Morningstar’s Rohr said in an interview. A
mining deal or returning cash to investors would have been
preferable, he said.  “Presuming the market price of Plains was correct, you’d
have to believe that the incremental value creation you get from
mashing these two sets of assets together would exceed the
premium you’re paying to obtain those assets,” Rohr said. “And
that beggars belief.”  Hambro Comments  The strategic justification for the two deals was
questioned by BlackRock Inc., which has an 8 percent stake in
Freeport, according to a February filing. Evy Hambro, manager of
BlackRock’s $12 billion World Mining Fund, said on the
conference call that Freeport investors should be allowed to
vote on the deal. The Freeport stock used as payment isn’t
sufficient to require a vote by shareholders, according to the
mining company.  “Congratulations on making one of the worst
teleconferences I’ve ever heard to justify a deal,” Hambro told
Adkerson. “I haven’t heard anything on this call that in any
way justifies why these companies should be put together.”  Investors have the freedom to diversify their own
portfolios “and don’t need management teams to do it for
them,” Hambro said.  “I hope you’re not going to be jumping to conclusions too
quick and look at the history of why we’ve been successful in
the past,” Jim Bob Moffett, Freeport’s chairman and also
McMoRan’s co-chairman and CEO, said on the call in response to
Hambro’s comments.  Davy Jones  Freeport’s deals come on the heels of a Nov. 26
announcement by McMoRan that it had once again failed to achieve
a flow test that would certify it could produce commercial
quantities of natural gas from its Davy Jones No. 1 ultra-deep
Gulf of  Mexico  well.  The news cleaved a third of the value off of McMoRan’s
shares and opened the possibility that the much-ballyhooed Davy
Jones project, in which the company has sunk almost $1 billion
and on which Moffett has staked his wildcatter’s reputation, is
a dud.  One industry geologist who has studied the near-shore gulf
geological formation tapped by Davy Jones believes the company’s
inability to get a conclusive flow test is indicative that the
well will never produce.  Company Ties  “They are in a bad deep environment” in which
overwhelming pressures and temperatures have squeezed out any
commercial quantities of gas while peculiarities of the deep
shale geology have produced well logging reports that --
erroneously -- show plentiful hydrocarbons are there, said
Donald Timko, an independent Houston-based geological
consultant.  Timko says his research indicates there is no commercial
potential below 17,400 feet (5,300 meters). Davy Jones has been
drilled down to 29,000 feet.  McMoRan has said it hasn’t yet given up on the well and
laid some of Davy Jones’ problems to barite, a compound used to
thicken drilling mud to keep pressure on the bore hold. At that
pressure and temperature, the barite is turning to cement,
clogging a flow test. The company has attempted to unclog it
with solvents while investigating other possible solutions.  Freeport and McMoRan have maintained ties since their
separation. In addition to Moffett they share five other board
members. B.M. Rankin, co-founder of McMoRan with Moffett, serves
as vice chairman of both boards.  Flores Role  Plains CEO James Flores is on the board of McMoRan because
his company owns a 31.5 percent stake. He stands to gain more
than $150 million from the deal, including payment in restricted
shares, according to a Plains regulatory filing from April.  Under the new structure, Moffett will continue as chairman
and Rankin will remain vice chairman. Adkerson will stay as CEO
and also be appointed vice chairman. Flores will be vice
chairman and head the company’s oil and gas operations.  The transactions announced yesterday promise to boost the
value of personal stakes that Freeport’s top executives hold in
McMoRan. For Moffett, stock and options worth about $44 million
on Nov, 4 are now worth about $89 million, according to a
Bloomberg News analysis of his holdings as of Dec. 31.  For Adkerson, McMoRan’s co-chairman, the value of his
McMoRan holdings jumps to $14 million from $4.6 million, the
analysis shows.  Phelps Dodge  Since 2002, Moffett and Adkerson have taken almost all
their compensation for their service at McMoRan in the form of
 stock options . Most of them were underwater before yesterday’s
announcement.  The Bloomberg analysis compares the Dec. 4 closing stock
price to its price yesterday, since McMoRan holders get
interests in a royalty trust in addition to the $14.75 cash
price. It examines their holdings as of Dec. 31 because that is
the last date for which the company has disclosed comprehensive
information.  Freeport’s biggest deal has been its $26 billion takeover
of Phelps Dodge Corp., another U.S. copper miner, in 2007 to
expand beyond its Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia.  The Plains acquisition would rank as the second-largest
purchase of an oil and gas exploration and production company by
a miner, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The McMoRan
deal would be the sixth-biggest.  The Plains and McMoRan deals will reduce Phoenix-based
Freeport’s earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and
amortization from mining to 74 percent of the total next year.  “The change in strategy is something that we will
question,” Ospraie’s Anderson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
