Middle distillates  stockpiles in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed to the highest level in almost 14 months, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles including gasoil and kerosene rose by 1.6
million barrels, or 16 percent, to 11.5 million, in the seven
days ended yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. Supplies gained for a second
week to the most since the week ended Oct. 19, 2011.  Inventories of  fuel oil , low-sulfur waxy residue and
excluding bitumen increased by 477,000 barrels, or 2.1 percent,
to 23 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies of the
 residual fuel  rose a fifth week to the most in five months.  Light-distillates including naphtha, gasoline and reformate
gained 634,000 barrels, or 6.7 percent, to 10.1 million,
according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
