India ’s southern state of  Tamil Nadu 
plans to auction 1 gigawatt of solar power capacity next month,
the state electricity utility said.  Developers may submit bids for projects of 1 megawatt or
more by Jan. 4, according to a  tender document  from the Tamil
Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp. It didn’t place a cap on
the number or size of projects it would award to any one
developer.  Those offering to sell solar power at the lowest rates will
win, the utility said. Winners will sign 20-year power-sale
contracts with Tamil Nadu Generation and have 10 months to build
the plants or face penalties.  Developers will be responsible for laying  power lines  from
their project to the nearest substation at their cost and for
obtaining land for their projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
