World food costs  slipped for a second
month in November as prices for oilseeds and cooking oils as
well as sugar fell to the lowest in two years, the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO fell to 210.9
points from a restated 214.1 in October, the Rome-based agency
wrote in an e-mailed report today. The cost of oils and fats
remained near the lowest since September 2010.  Palm oil futures have dropped 24 percent since the end of
August as reserves increased in Indonesia and Malaysia, the
biggest producers, weighing on oil-crop prices. Use of the oil
is expected to climb to compensate for a shortage of other
vegetable oils, according to Hamburg-based researcher Oil World.  “The main driving factor remains abundant palm oil
production, which, combined with weak world import demand, has
led to further build-ups in inventories,” the FAO wrote in
today’s report. “Except for dairy, international prices of all
the commodity groups included in the index fell in November.”  The global food-import bill may fall 9.7 percent this year
to $1.14 trillion from a record $1.26 trillion in 2011 on lower
costs for freight and reduced spending on vegetables and fruits,
grains and sugar, the FAO forecast last month.  The November index for fats and oils dropped to 200.4
points from 206.4 the previous month, to the lowest level since
September 2010, the FAO reported. Palm oil futures in  Malaysia 
dropped 5.1 percent last month, while Chicago soybeans declined
7.1 percent.  The FAO’s gauge of world grain prices declined to 255.6
points from 259.5. Wheat prices fell as concerns about an
imminent export restriction by Ukraine receded, according to the
FAO.  Sugar Prices  The index of sugar prices dropped to 274.4 points from
288.2 points in October, to the lowest level since August 2010.
The FAO dairy-price index rose to 195 points from 194 in
October, the highest level since March, the data showed. The
index for meat prices dropped to 174.7 points from 176.  World grain production may drop to 2.28 billion metric tons
this year from 2.35 billion tons the previous season, the FAO
wrote in a separate report. The outlook was cut by 2.3 million
tons from a month ago on reduced estimates for the global wheat
harvest.  Grain consumption is forecast to slip to 2.31 billion tons
from 2.32 billion tons, while global grain stocks are predicted
to fall to 494.7 million tons at the end of the 2012-13 season
from 519.5 million tons a year earlier. The outlook for ending
stocks was cut by 2.7 million tons.  Farmers across the world may harvest 659.4 million tons of
wheat in 2012 from 699.4 million tons last year, the FAO said,
cutting its estimate by 1.8 million tons.  The world crop of coarse grains, including corn and barley,
may slip to 1.14 billion tons from 1.17 billion tons a year
earlier, while rice production is expected to increase in
2012-13 to 486.8 million tons from 482.7 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
