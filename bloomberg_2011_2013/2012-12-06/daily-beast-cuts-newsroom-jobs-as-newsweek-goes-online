Newsweek/Daily Beast Co. , the news
company owned by Barry Diller’s  IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , is cutting
editorial jobs today as it turns  Newsweek  from a print magazine
into an online-only publication.  Tina Brown, editor-in-chief and founder of the company,
announced plans in October to cease publication of Newsweek by
Dec. 31 and pare back newsroom staff. Those cuts began today,
Brown said in a memo to employees.  “Employees in the affected positions will be notified
today,” she said in the memo. “Much of this has already
happened on the business side, and today we will be letting
staff on the editorial side know where we will be eliminating
positions. This is a very difficult day, and one that we
approach with enormous regret.”  Affected workers will remain until at least Dec. 31 and
some may stay until mid-January or later, Brown said in the
memo, which didn’t give the number of cuts. Newsweek, which
merged with IAC’s Daily Beast website last year, was on track to
lose more than $22 million this year, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
