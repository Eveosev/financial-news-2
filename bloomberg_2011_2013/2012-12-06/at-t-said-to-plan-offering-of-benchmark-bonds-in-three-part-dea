AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. telephone
company, issued $4 billion of bonds in a three-part offering.  The company sold $1 billion of 0.8 percent, three-year
notes yielding 50 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and equal $1.5 billion portions of 1.4 percent, five-
year bonds paying 80 basis points more than benchmarks and 2.625
percent, 10-year debt with a spread of 105, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt may be rated A2 by Moody’s
Investors Service.  The Dallas-based company last sold new dollar-denominated
debt of at least $500 million in June, issuing $1.15 billion of
1.7 percent notes due June 2017. Those securities traded at
102.2 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 1.19 percent, or 58
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The most indebted U.S. telecommunications firm is
increasing its  capital expenditures  to about $22 billion, its
highest level ever, to add long-term evolution technology, a
network that promises to offer connections three times as fast
as the previous standard for devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone
that use Web browsing and music downloads.  Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managed
the sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
