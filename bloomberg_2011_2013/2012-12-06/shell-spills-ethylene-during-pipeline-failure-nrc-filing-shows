Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  spilled an
unknown amount of ethylene from a 12-inch pipeline in  Iowa ,
Louisiana, after a gasket failure, according to a filing with
the U.S. National Response Center. The release at 5 p.m. local
time yesterday wasn’t secured and a fire crew was en route to
the site, the filing showed.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
