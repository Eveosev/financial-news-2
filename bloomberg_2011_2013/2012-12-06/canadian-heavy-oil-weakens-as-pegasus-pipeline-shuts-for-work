Canadian heavy  oil prices  weakened as
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said it’s conducting planned work on the
Pegasus Southern pipeline that runs from Illinois to Texas.  Concerns that low water levels on the Mississippi River may
limit barge traffic later this month also contributed to the
weakness in Canadian heavy oil. Barges moved 52,300 barrels of
oil a day from the U.S. Midwest to the Gulf Coast in September,
Energy Department  data  show.  Western Canada Select declined $3.60 to a $33-a-barrel
discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate as of 5:21
p.m.  New York  time, according to Net Energy Inc., a Calgary oil
broker. Cold Lake, another Alberta heavy oil grade, declined
$4.60 to $37 under WTI.  Exxon is doing maintenance on the  Pegasus  Southern line
today, Amber Gardner, a company spokeswoman in Houston, said in
an e-mail. A person with knowledge of the work said on Nov. 14
the work would last from Dec. 6 to Dec. 17.  The line can transport 96,000 barrels of oil a day, much of
it from Western Canada, to refineries near Nederland,  Texas .  Mississippi water levels may drop to about 9 feet by Dec.
26, according to Mark Fuchs, a hydrologist with the  National
Weather Service . That’s the level at which officials have said
barge traffic could be restricted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
