J.R. Smith’s 18-foot jump shot at the
buzzer gave the  New York  Knicks a 100-98 win over the Charlotte
Bobcats.  The Knicks improved to 13-4, the best in the National
Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference, with their fourth
straight win.  Trailing 98-92 with three minutes, 31 seconds to play at
Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Knicks
rallied as  Raymond Felton ,  Carmelo Anthony  and Smith scored the
last eight points of the contest.  Anthony scored all but three of his 23 points in the first
half, Tyson Chandler added 18 and grabbed 17 rebounds, and
Felton tallied 17 points for the Knicks.  Anthony left the game with 2:10 to play when he cut his
hand chasing a loose ball into the Knicks’ bench. Coach  Mike Woodson  said Anthony needed five stitches in the middle finger
of his left hand.  “I was hurt, but J.R. made it feel better,” Anthony told
reporters.  Kemba Walker led the Bobcats (7-10) with 25 points and 11
assists followed by reserves Gerald Henderson with 18 points and
Ben Gordon with 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
