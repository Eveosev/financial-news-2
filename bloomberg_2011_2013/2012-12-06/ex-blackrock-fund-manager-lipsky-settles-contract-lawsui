Ex- BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  fund manager
Michael Lipsky settled a lawsuit in which he accused his former
employer of wrongfully withholding information on investment
results of funds he managed.  Lipsky, who resigned from New York-based BlackRock in
December 2010, sued the company in state  Supreme Court  in
Manhattan in July, accusing it of refusing to provide him with
accurate information about the investment results for funds he
managed during his employment.  The two sides agreed to dismiss the lawsuit, according to a
document filed yesterday, and dispute has been settled, Lipskyâ€™s
lawyer,  Joseph A. Piesco , said today in a phone interview. He
declined to disclose terms, saying the accord is confidential.  Brian Beades , a spokesman for BlackRock, declined to
comment on the settlement in an e-mail.  The case is Lipsky v. BlackRock Inc., 652329/2012, New York
State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
