Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Africa’s
largest lender, completed the sale of an 80 percent stake in its
Argentine unit to  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. 
as its reverses its expansion strategy in  emerging markets .  The Johannesburg-based lender expects a 1.6 billion-rand
profit ($180 million) from the deal and will retain a 20 percent
shareholding in the bank, it said in a regulatory filing today.  The bank plans to cut costs at its operations outside of
 South Africa  by $100 million a year and will incur one-off costs
of about $80 million as part of the rationalization.  “Conditions in our international operations remain very
challenging,” the bank said. “We are currently taking action
in respect of all aspects of the cost base in these operations
so as to secure a sustainable reduction in costs.”  Proceeds from the Argentine sale will be used to boost the
bank’s capital reserves and fund growth of its South African
operations, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
