South Sudanese authorities should
investigate the killing of journalist Isaiah Abraham, an
outspoken critic of the government, the New York-based  Committee
to Protect Journalists  and his brother said.  Abraham was shot dead early yesterday after receiving a
death threat by phone a week earlier, said William Chan, his
brother. The callers told Abraham in Arabic that he should
“stop writing or they will get rid of him,” he said by phone
today from Juba, South Sudan’s capital.  The committee, in a statement yesterday, urged the
authorities to investigate the murder and “identify the
motive.” Chan said it was a “planned attack” at Abraham’s
home by attackers who left computers and money.  Abraham, who was also known as Diing Chan Awuol, wrote
opinion articles for media including the Sudan Tribune, a Paris-
based online news site, frequently criticizing the government.
Chan said his brother was a veteran of the two-decade civil war
that led to South  Sudan ’s secession from Sudan in July 2011, and
he was disturbed by the corruption that has tainted the newly
independent country.  “Some people think with corruption it is better to remain
silent, but Isaiah was not one of those people,” Chan said.
“He doesn’t fear; that is the bottom line.”  Police spokesman James Monday and Barnaba Marial Benjamin,
information minister and government spokesman, didn’t answer
calls seeking comment.  “We trust the government will do something,” Chan said.
“If not it will be a big question mark.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
