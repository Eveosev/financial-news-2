Colombian  inflation  unexpectedly
slowed in November to its lowest rate since 2010 on cheaper food
and transport.  Consumer prices rose 2.77 percent from a year earlier, down
from a 3.06 percent annual increase in October, the national
statistics agency said yesterday. The number was lower than the
forecast of all 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median
estimate was for inflation to accelerate to 3.1 percent.  Prices fell 0.14 percent from a month earlier, the biggest
monthly drop in more than two years. The fall was led by a 0.49
percent reduction in food prices. Transport costs fell 0.09
percent.  The central bank cut its  benchmark interest rate  to 4.5
percent at its November meeting after the nationâ€™s biggest
brokerage collapsed and industry contracted for a second month.  Colombia  targets inflation of 3 percent, plus or minus one
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
