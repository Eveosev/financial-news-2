France  has offered to host the United
Nations climate treaty talks in 2015, when envoys aim to craft a
global and binding deal to reduce emissions, French Minister of
Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius said.  The year 2015 is important for the UN global warming talks
because 194 countries agreed last year to negotiate a new
legally-binding emissions reduction deal by then, which would
enter into force by 2020.  “My colleagues and I from now will try to build the trust
with different countries,” over the next three years, Fabius
told reporters today at this year’s round of talks in Doha. “We
have high ambitions for 2015.”  Pascal Canfin, a development minister, said that France has
an aid budget of 6 billion euros ($7.8 billion) over the next
three years, and that half of all future aid will have a
climate-rleated component, a signal that France will pay out 1
billion euros a year over the next three years in climate aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
