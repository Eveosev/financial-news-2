Shoppers Stop Ltd. (SHOP)  rose to the
highest in more than a year, leading gains among retailers after
India’s lower house of parliament voted to endorse a government
decision to allow foreign investment in supermarkets.  Shoppers Stop climbed 1 percent to 469.55 rupees, the
highest since July 2011, after rising as much as 6.9 percent.
 Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the nation’s largest retailer,
gained 0.7 percent to 239.30 rupees, the highest close since
September 2011, while  Trent Ltd. (TRENT)  declined 0.3 percent after
gaining earlier in the day.  Yesterday’s parliamentary vote backs a September decision
by India’s government to allow overseas retailers such as Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. and  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  to own as much as 51 percent of
stores selling more than a single brand. Indian retail companies
stand to gain from the government’s decision as it would
encourage partnerships with international businesses, and may
bring in funding and technology.  Two hundred and fifty-three members of the 545-member lower
house yesterday supported the government’s plan, while 218
members voted against the decision. Two regional parties that
oppose the move chose to walk out of the session rather than
vote with ideological rivals.  The government’s decision does not require parliamentary
approval to become law. The government agreed to a vote to end
protests that had stalled legislative business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
