Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  joined a creditor group in American Airlines’ bankruptcy
case that may provide financing for the carrier’s restructuring.  The committee has expanded to 20 members from 12 since
September, according to a filing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
in New York disclosing its members and their company debt
holdings.  American Airlines’ parent,  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , said in court papers
in August that it would negotiate with the group about potential
financing for its reorganization. It won court approval to pay
fees of the group’s advisers as negotiations proceed.  The group holds claims against American Airlines and AMR,
according to today’s filing. Besides Goldman Sachs and Barclays,
members include  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Credit Suisse Group AG,
Claren Road Asset Management and Marathon Asset Management.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
