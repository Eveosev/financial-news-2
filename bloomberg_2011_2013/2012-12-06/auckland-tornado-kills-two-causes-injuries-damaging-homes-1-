At least two people were killed when
a tornado struck Auckland today, injuring others and causing
widespread damage to property and roads.  As many as 150 homes were damaged by the high-speed winds
that brought down chimneys, wrecked roofs and uprooted trees,
with 250 people sheltering at an emergency center at the nearby
Whenuapai Air Force base, Auckland City Council said in a
statement.  Two people were confirmed dead and officials have “grave
fears” for a third person, a police spokesman said in comments
broadcast by Radio Live. The spokesman wasn’t named and police
didn’t return calls from  Bloomberg News . Earlier press  reports 
indicated three people were dead.  Storms and heavy rain elsewhere in  New Zealand ’s largest
city have affected power supplies, disrupted flights and caused
surface flooding that is blocking several roads, according to
the New Zealand Herald.  Prime Minister John Key, who is the local member of
parliament for the area, issued an e-mailed statement expressing
his condolences to friends and families of the people who died.  To contact the reporters on this story:
