U.S. stock futures fell as the
European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts, citing
“downside risks.”  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.2 percent to
1,405.7 at 8:49 a.m. New York time.  “Weak economic activity is expected to continue into next
year,” ECB President  Mario Draghi  said in Frankfurt today. He
said “a gradual recovery” should start later in 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
