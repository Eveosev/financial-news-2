Serbia  needs fiscal tightening to
ensure macroeconomic stability and it must rely on its own
resources rather than cheap credit for growth, the  European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development  said.  The economy is expected to emerge from recession in 2013
after contracting this year on weak harvest and dwindling export
demand and “the overriding priority for 2013 is restoring
fiscal prudence,” Peter Sanfey, the London-based lender’s lead
economist, told reporters in Belgrade today.  “The pre-crisis growth model is not going to come back,”
Sanfey said. “Serbia is not going to get back to rapid growth
by having massive inflow of cheap capital and cheap credits from
abroad. It will have to rely more on own resources.”  The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic , in office since
July, hopes that its plan for broad fiscal consolidation, seen
by the  International Monetary Fund  as overly ambitious, will
show results as early as next year, boosting investor sentiment
and leading to a balanced budget by 2016.  The government plans to cut the budget gap to 3.6 percent
of gross domestic product next year from 6.7 percent in 2012 and
will rely on export growth for a 2 percent economic expansion.  Investments in energy, especially renewables, still offer
good potential in Serbia and in the region, if the governments
show “less interference in the sector” and help improve
investor confidence, Sanfey said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
