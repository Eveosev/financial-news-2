Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Williams  said the profit margin for processing
bitumen from Canada’s oil sands is “disappearing” as the
company reviews a joint project with partner  Total SA. (FP)   Upgrading, a way to process bitumen into synthetic crude
and diesel fuel, isn’t as attractive as it was a few years ago,
Williams said at the Toronto Board of Trade today.  Williams said Dec. 3 the company has accelerated its review
of the Voyageur project with Total and plans to make a decision
by the end of March. Voyageur would be the third upgrader at
Suncor’s oil-sands site in Fort McMurray, Alberta, and would be
capable of processing 200,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
