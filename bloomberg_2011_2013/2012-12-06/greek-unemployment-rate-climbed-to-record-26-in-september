Greece ’s unemployment rate extended
its record high, climbing to 26 percent in September as the
country heads into a sixth year of recession.  The rate rose from a revised 25.3 percent in August, the
Athens-based Hellenic Statistical Authority said in an e-mailed
statement today. Joblessness is at the highest since the agency
began publishing monthly data in 2004.  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s coalition government last
month approved austerity measures demanded by creditors to
continue receiving aid. Greece has had two bailouts, the first
in May 2010, from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.  The recession and deepening labor slump have been
exacerbated by spending cuts and tax increases imposed to trim a
budget deficit that was more than five times the euro-area limit
in 2009. The economy will shrink as much as 4.5 percent next
year and unemployment is seen at over 26 percent in 2013 and
2014, the Athens-based  Bank of Greece (TELL)  predicted on Dec. 3.  A breakdown of today’s release showed the female jobless
rate was 30 percent, while the rate for Greeks aged 15 to 24 was
56 percent. That’s more than double the youth unemployment rate
of 26 percent in September 2009, before a deficit blowout
sparked the euro-area sovereign debt crisis.  The highest regional jobless rate was in Epirus and Attica,
which includes  Athens  and is the country’s largest region, at 28
percent and 27.6 percent respectively, the statistical authority
said. The lowest rate was in Crete, at 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
