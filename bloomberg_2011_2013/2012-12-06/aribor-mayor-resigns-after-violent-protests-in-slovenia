The mayor of Slovenia’s second
largest city of Maribor will resign after protests against his
tenure turned violent, STA newswire said.  Franc Kangler, suspected of corruption and abuse of power,
will step down on Dec. 31, the newswire reported today, citing
him. His resignation will probably trigger an early vote for the
city administration, according to STA.  Violent protests have gripped Maribor for the past several
weeks. On Dec. 3, 25 policemen and 14 civilians were injured,
local police said. Protests have spread to other cities
including the capital, Ljubljana, where they also turned violent
just ahead of the second round of presidential elections on Dec.
2. Former Prime Minister  Borut Pahor  won the post.  “Police will not tolerate hooligans and others that incite
violence,” Interior Minister Vinko Gorenak told reporters in
Ljubljana after being asked how the force plans to handle future
protests. He urged protesters that gather peacefully to distance
themselves from the violent ones.  Slovenia is grappling with its second recession in three
years as the government of Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  works on
an economic overhaul and savings measures to win back investors’
confidence and boost the export-driven economy’s
competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
