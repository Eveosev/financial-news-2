Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest refiner,
fell the most in more than two weeks as the government prepared
to cut prices on gas and electricity.  The shares fell 3.6 percent to 17,485 forint by the close
in Budapest, the biggest decline since Nov. 20. The benchmark
BUX stock index, in which Mol has the biggest weighting at 33
percent, slid 1.5 percent, the most after  Egypt  among 94 equity
indexes tracked by Bloomberg worldwide.  The Development Ministry will work out plans to lower
utility prices by 10 percent because public utilities should not
be “part of the world of profit,” MTI state news service
reported yesterday, citing spokesman Andras Giro-Szasz. The cuts
are negative for Mol via its gas wholesale and transport units,
Akos Kuti and Gergely Gabler, Budapest-based analysts at broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in a research report today.  “The government will probably fund the price cuts not from
state sources but by forcing it down the throat of energy
suppliers,” the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
