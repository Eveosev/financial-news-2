The European  aerospace industry  will
be the bright spot for  credit quality  next year, while other
industries are prone to deterioration on slower global growth,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Aerospace and defense is the sole area among 29 industries
covered by S&P that has a “positive to stable´´ sector outlook
for the coming six to 12 months, S&P analyst Tobias Mock said in
Frankfurt today, while the outlook for utilities and steel is
the worst.  ‘‘Commercial aviation stands out due to the long cycles in
this industry,´´ Mock said. ‘‘Companies in this area are not
suffering from declining demand due to their large order books,
and because they have not ramped up capacity the same way other
industries have.´´  The default probability of European companies across all
industries rated below investment grade will rise to 6.8 percent
by December 2013, from 6.3 percent in September as Italy and
 Spain  remain in recession and the euro-area economy
will stagnate, S&P said today. S&P rates 950 companies in
 Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
