PPR (PP)  SA, the owner of Gucci and
Balenciaga, has agreed to sell its OneStopPlus large-size
clothing business to private-equity firms Charlesbank Capital
Partners and Webster Capital.  The sale has an enterprise value of $525 million and is
expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year,
Paris-based PPR said yesterday in a statement.  The unit is part of PPRâ€™s Redcats retail division. In 2010,
the company said it would sell Redcats and other retail assets
to focus on its luxury, lifestyle and sports brands. A
challenging debt market made Redcats too expensive to sell in
one piece, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Redcats sold its Avenue stores, another U.S. large-size
business, to an affiliate of Versa Capital Management LLC
earlier this year.  Peter J. Solomon Co. acted as financial adviser on deal,
while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal advice,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
