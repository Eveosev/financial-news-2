BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest coking coal exporter, settled the first-quarter
benchmark contract for the fuel at $165 a metric ton, down 2.9
percent from the fourth-quarter of this year.  The BHP/Mitsubishi Alliance, or BMA, agreed to the lowest
price since contracts shifted to quarterly settlements from
annual pacts in the first quarter of 2010, Doyle Trading
Consultants LLC, a New York-based energy research firm that
specializes in coal, said today.  Companies from Appalachia to Australia have tempered output
in an effort to stem a decline in prices. The  benchmark , set at
$170 for fourth-quarter 2012, is down 50 percent from the record
$330 a metric ton set in the second quarter of 2011 after floods
in Queensland,  Australia , ravaged production.  Ruban Yogarajah, a spokesman for BHP in  London , declined to
comment, citing company policy.  “It is becoming increasingly clear coking coal has
bottomed,” said Ted O’Brien, a New York-based vice president at
Doyle.  Prices for the steelmaking component may rebound to $185 a
metric ton by the fourth quarter of 2013, he said.  “We expect pricing at these levels to induce further
production cuts, but may lead to a faster recovery in 2013,”
Daniel Scott, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in  New York , said
today in a report.  U.S. producers may fetch lower returns than the benchmark
because of lower demand in  Europe  compared to the Pacific
region, O’Brien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
