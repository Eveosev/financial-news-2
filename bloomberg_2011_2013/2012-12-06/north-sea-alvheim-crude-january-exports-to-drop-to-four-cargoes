Exports of North Sea Alvheim crude
for January will be four cargoes of 780,000 barrels each, one
less than this month, according to a loading program obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  A consignment from the December program will load from Jan.
4 to Jan. 6 and is not included in the January program, the plan
showed.  Houston-based  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  operates the field in the
Norwegian North Sea. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
