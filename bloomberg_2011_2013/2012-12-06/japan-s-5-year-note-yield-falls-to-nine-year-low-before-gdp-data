Japan ’s lead bond futures climbed to
a record amid speculation the central bank will increase debt
purchases to bolster growth.  Ten- and five-year securities rose, sending their yields to
nine-year lows, before data next week on third-quarter gross
domestic product.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura yesterday said the bank is ready to increase the
provision of funds as needed. Thirty-year debt gained after
demand at an auction beat the average for the past 10 sales.  “Bonds are being supported amid rising expectations for
additional easing by the BOJ,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief
rates strategist in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the 25
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery climbed as much
as 0.25 to 145.24, the highest level reached by the most
actively traded contract on record dating back to 1985. The
previous high was 145.09 set in June 2003.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 2 1/2 basis
points to 0.685 percent as of 3:20 p.m. in Tokyo, the lowest
since June 2003. The 0.7 percent security due December 2022
added 0.234 yen to 100.140, according to Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.  The five-year yield slid 1 1/2 basis points to 0.15
percent, a level unseen since 2003.  Economy Contracted  The government will release the final reading on third-
quarter GDP on Dec. 10. The world’s third-largest economy
contracted an annualized 3.5 percent in the three months ended
Sept. 30, the Cabinet Office said on Nov. 12.  The BOJ “has been and will always be ready to take
appropriate and decisive action,” Nishimura said in a speech
yesterday. The central bank, scheduled to meet on Dec. 19, aims
for annual inflation of 1 percent and currently buys securities
including  government bonds  through its 66 trillion-yen ($800
billion) program.  The 641 billion-yen auction of 30-year debt today drew bids
valued at 4.08 times the amount on offer, surpassing the 10-sale
average of 3.83. Yields on the securities dropped six basis
points to 1.885 percent, the lowest since Sept. 27. Twenty-year
rates slid as much as four basis points to 1.64 percent,
matching the lowest since Sept. 26.  “There was solid demand at the 30-year sale,” said Takuma Sugawara, a senior JGB strategist at Societe Generale SA,
another primary dealer. “Money is flowing into the  bond market 
on expectations for additional monetary easing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
