Jamie Dimon said  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ’s $6.2 billion loss at its London investment office reflects
a “weakness” and not a culture or leadership problem, Exame
reported, citing an interview with the chief executive officer.  Dimon told Exame,  Brazil ’s biggest business  magazine , that
analysts are still predicting a third straight record year for
earnings at the New York-based bank, even after factoring in the
loss. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, will report
net income of about $20.8 billion for 2012, according to a
Bloomberg  survey  of 12 analysts.  JPMorgan ousted traders and managers and overhauled senior
management amid more than $6.2 billion in losses tied to credit
derivatives in the first nine months of 2012 at the chief
investment office in  London . Fallout included the retirement of
Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, lawsuits from shareholders
and civil and criminal probes by at least three U.S. agencies.  Dimon, 56, also said the U.S. economy could expand as much
as 4 percent next year if Democrats and Republicans agree on
fiscal reforms that increase taxes, cut costs and improve the
business environment, according to Exame. A worsening European
crisis or the development of a new geopolitical problem would
mean slower growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
