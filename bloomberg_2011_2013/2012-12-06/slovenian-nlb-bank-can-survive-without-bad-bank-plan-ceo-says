Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,
Slovenia’s biggest bank, can “survive” if the country fails to
implement the so-called bad bank plan, Chief Executive Officer
Janko Medja said.  “I think the bank can survive in both scenarios but it
mostly depends on how quickly we can clean our balance sheet,”
Medja said in an interview with public broadcaster  TV Slovenija 
late yesterday. “With a bad bank plan we can do that in a
couple of years, on our own it would take much longer.”  NLB, as the Ljubljana-based lender is known, is set to
report a loss for a fourth consecutive year because bad loans
continue to increase, Medja said.  The government’s plan to recapitalize its banks with the
bad bank plan is being threatened, after a trade union called a
referendum. The vote can be stopped by a ruling of the
Constitutional court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
