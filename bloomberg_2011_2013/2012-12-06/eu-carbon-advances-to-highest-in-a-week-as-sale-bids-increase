European Union carbon permits for
December advanced to the highest in a week as bidding in an
auction today was at a higher level than two days ago.  The benchmark futures contract advanced 3.9 percent to
close at 6.39 euros ($8.28) a metric ton on  London â€™s ICE Futures
Europe exchange, the highest since Nov. 29.  A sale by the EU today attracted bids of 11.8 million tons
for the 5.3 million tons being auctioned, according to data from
the website of the European Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig,
 Germany . An auction of the same size two days ago attracted bids
of almost 10 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
