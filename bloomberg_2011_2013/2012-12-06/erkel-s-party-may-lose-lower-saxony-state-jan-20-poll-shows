German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democrats could lose power in Lower Saxony state next
month as an alliance of Social Democrats and Greens may replace
the CDU’s ruling coalition with the Free Democrats, a poll
shows.  Less than six weeks before the Jan. 20 election, voter
support stood at 39 percent for the CDU, 32 percent for the SPD,
13 percent for the Greens and 4 percent each for the FDP, the
Left party and the Pirate party, according to a Forschungsgruppe
Wahlen poll for ZDF public television.  If at least three parties fail to cross the 5 percent
threshold needed to win seats in parliament, the SPD and Greens
would benefit from the distribution of seats among the remaining
parties, ZDF said in an e-mailed statement. Fifty-two percent of
respondents weren’t sure yet which party they plan to vote for
or whether they’ll vote at all, ZDF said.  In the last election in 2008, the CDU garnered 42.5
percent, compared with 30.3 percent for the SPD, 8.2 percent for
the FDP, 8 percent for the Greens and 7.1 percent for the Left
party.  The poll published today showed that 47 percent of voters
favor a coalition of SPD and Greens while a continued alliance
of CDU and FDP has the support of 26 percent of voters. FG
Wahlen interviewed 1,043 people Dec. 3-5 and the margin of error
was high as 3 percentage points, ZDF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
