Snowfall in  Germany  is reducing solar
output as covered panels can’t generate power at a time when
below-freezing temperatures are boosting demand for heating.  There may be peaks of 6 to 8 gigawatts of solar from today
through to Dec. 8 before more cloud and snow on Dec. 10 cuts
output below 4 gigawatts, according to Meteogroup U.K. Ltd.  “Continuation of the cold period across  Europe  through the
next two weeks has high confidence considering the long forecast
period,” Stephen Davenport, head of energy forecasting at
MeteoGroup U.K. said by e-mail from London.  Germany generates about 20 percent of its electricity from
renewables.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  plans to exit nuclear
energy by 2022 and raise the nation’s share of renewable sources
to at least 35 percent of the power mix by the end of this
decade.  The low temperature in  Frankfurt  will fall to minus 10
degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) on Dec. 9 compared with a five-
year average of 5 degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data
on Bloomberg. As much as 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) of snow is
predicted to fall tomorrow in some regions of Germany, according
to the government-owned weather service  Deutscher Wetterdienst .  Wind generation in the country will peak tomorrow at 9 to
10 gigawatts before winds drop on Dec. 8, Davenport said. A peak
of 8 to 10 gigawatts is forecast overnight on Dec. 9, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
