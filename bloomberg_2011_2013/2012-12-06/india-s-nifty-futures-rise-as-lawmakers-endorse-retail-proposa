Indian stocks rose for a third day,
reversing earlier losses, as the leader of the fourth largest
party in the parliament said she would support Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh ’s plan to allow foreign investment in retail.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, added 0.5 percent
to 19,486.80 at the close, holding at a 19-month high. The gauge
slid as much as 1.1 percent before Mayawati, chief of the
Bahujan Samaj Party, said her party will vote in favor of the
retail policy tomorrow. Lawmakers voted to back the plan in the
lower house of parliament yesterday.  State Bank of India  and  ICICI Bank (ICICIBC)  Ltd. climbed 2 percent
each, contributing more than a third of the index’s advance.
 Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of British luxury car brands Jaguar
and Land Rover, rose to the highest level in almost a month.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, advanced to a two-month high.  “The support the government has been getting augurs well
for the passage of other policies too,” K.K. Mital, a  fund
manager  at Globe Capital Market Ltd., said by phone from  New
Delhi . “Investors would feel more confident about reforms.”  The Sensex has gained 0.8 percent this week. It rallied 4.5
percent  last week  as data showing economic expansion slowed last
quarter to match a three-year low stoked speculation the
government will take more steps to boost growth and investment.
Singh in September opened retailing and airline industries to
foreigners, and pared fuel subsidies in a wave of policy making
aimed at reviving growth and averting a credit rating downgrade.  Foreign Funds  The Sensex has risen 26 percent this year, fueled by fund
flows and the policy announcements. Overseas funds  bought  a net
$177 million of stocks yesterday, taking their net purchases in
2012 to $20.5 billion, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked
by Bloomberg, excluding  China , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The retail policy change, which will enable overseas
retailers such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  to own as much as 51
percent of stores selling more than a single brand in India,
didn’t require parliamentary approval to become law. Still,
Singh’s government agreed to a vote to end protests that were
stalling legislative business. With 15 members in the chamber,
votes from Mayawati’s party should push Singh past the number he
needs to win the ballot, said Satish Misra, a political analyst
at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.  Shoppers Stop Ltd. (SHOP) , India’s second largest retailer, rose 1
percent to 469.55 rupees, its highest close since July last
year, and paced gains among peers today. The stock has rallied
9.2 percent this month.  Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the
largest, added 0.7 percent to 239.30 rupees, extending its
advance this month to 14 percent.  Lenders Rally  State Bank  climbed 1.6 percent to 2,307.20 rupees. The

January. ICICI Bank gained 1.4 percent to 1,135.70 rupees, its
highest close in 23 months. Tata Motors advanced 2.2 percent to
280.85 rupees and Reliance added 1.4 percent to 843.90 rupees.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the top copper producer,

level since March 15. Cigarettes-to-hospitality group ITC Ltd.
increased 1.2 percent to a record 301.35 rupees.  Infosys slumped 1.9 percent to 2,338.3 rupees, making it
the biggest drag on the Sensex. Bigger rival  Tata Consultancy
Services (TCS)  lost 1.3 percent to 1,280.7 rupees.  Volumes in the Sensex exceeded the 30-day average by 23

9.06 set on Nov. 26, the data show. The Sensex  trades  at 15.9
times estimated earnings, the highest since February, compared
