Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel was
suspended for three matches and fined 60,000 pounds ($96,000)
for abusing referee Mark Clattenburg after the Blues’ 3-2 home
loss to Manchester United.  The player admitted the charge and told England’s Football
Association that he approached Clattenburg in the match
officials’ locker room after the Oct. 28 game because he thought
the referee had racially abused him, the F.A. said today on its
website.  Chelsea reported the referee’s alleged remark to the F.A.
after the match, and last month Clattenburg was cleared. The
F.A. then charged Mikel with the threatening behavior.  “The Regulatory Commission’s independent chairman
Christopher Quinlan emphasised that the Independent Regulatory
Commission accepted, as did the F.A., that at the time he
threatened the referee the player genuinely believed that the
referee had racially abused him,” the F.A. said today. “But
for that factor the suspension would have been significantly
longer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
