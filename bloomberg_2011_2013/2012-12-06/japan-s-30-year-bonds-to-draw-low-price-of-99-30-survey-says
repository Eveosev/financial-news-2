99.30, according to the average forecast of 15 traders surveyed
by  Bloomberg News .  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.9 percent
bonds ranged from 99.20 to 99.35, according to the survey.  Nine traders said 99.30, three reported 99.20, two said
99.25, and one said 99.35.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
