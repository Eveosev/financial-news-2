The U.K. last week bought the most
U.S. soybeans since July and is on pace for the biggest annual
imports from the North American country in at least five years,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  The U.K. bought 60,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the
week ended Nov. 29, the most since a purchase of 112,000 tons on
July 19, the USDA said today. The U.K. has committed to import
181,777 tons of U.S. soybeans since the marketing season began
Sept. 1. The European country didn’t import any U.S. soybeans
last year, and annual purchases through at least the 2007-08
season haven’t been higher than 75,000 tons, USDA data show.  Soybean prices have climbed 23 percent this year on the
Chicago Board of Trade, reaching a record $17.89 a bushel on
Sept. 4, as drought hurt U.S. crops following dry weather that
reduced supplies available from  South America ’s last harvest.  The U.S. is the world’s largest soybean exporter. Its
biggest  customer  is  China , which purchased 23.5 million tons
from the U.S. last season, about 29 percent of the North
American country’s crop.  Brazil  is the largest supplier of
soybeans to the U.K., customs data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
