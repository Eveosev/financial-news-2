North Korea  may go ahead with a third
nuclear test following a planned rocket launch, the Dong-A Ilbo
newspaper reported, citing an unidentified South Korean
government official.   South Korea is closely monitoring North Koreaâ€™s activities
around the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where no unusual
movement has been seen, according to the Korean-language
newspaper.   North Korea in October completed fixing the site after
flood damage, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
