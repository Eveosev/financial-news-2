Bank of America Corp.  sold $23.8
million of 14-month notes tied to the Standard & Poor’s MidCap
400 Index, the largest offering linked to the benchmark in more
than a year.  The securities, issued Nov. 29, yield three times the gains
of the index up to 14.7 percent with no protection against
losses, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Investors can lose all of their
investment if the index plummets. The bank distributed the notes
for a 2 percent fee.  Matt Card, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to
comment on the offering.  The S&P MidCap 400 Index, which comprises the stocks of 400
U.S. companies with market capitalization of $1 billion to $4.4
billion, gained 14 percent this year to 999.8 as of closing
yesterday. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 12
percent this year to 1,409.3.  Royal Bank of Canada had the biggest previous offering on
Sept. 29 of last year, $24.4 million of 14-month notes that
yielded three times the index’s gains, capped at 26.34 percent
with no loss protection, according to a  prospectus  filed with
the SEC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
