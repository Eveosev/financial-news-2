Thailand ’s government bonds advanced
for the first time in more than a week after foreign funds
pumped money into the nation’s debt as a rally in regional
stocks encouraged risk-taking. The baht was little changed.  International investors  bought  $391 million more sovereign
notes than they sold in the first two days of this week,
according to data from the Thai Bond Market Association. The
MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares gained for a sixth day amid
optimism U.S. lawmakers will reach a deal to avert the so-called
fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases set to take
effect next year.  “Fund inflows from overseas are a major support for Thai
bonds,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust and
fixed-income business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in  Tokyo .
“Stocks have been rising recently, making it easier for
investors to take risks.”  The yield on the 3.125 percent securities due December 2015
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.92
percent as of 3:13 p.m. in Bangkok from Dec. 4, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the first decline since Nov.
27. Financial markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  The baht traded at 30.67 per dollar, compared with 30.68 on
Dec. 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, rose three basis points to 3.94
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
