Boeing Co. (BA)  is poised to retake the
global lead in jetliner deliveries for the first time in a
decade, after delivering almost two dozen more jets through
November than Airbus SAS, its larger rival.  Boeing delivered 51 airliners to customers last month,
according to its monthly  website  update today. That brings the
total this year through November to 537 and compares with
Airbus’s 516 deliveries.  “Boeing will go through a window over the next few years
where they’re going to produce significantly more airplanes than
Airbus, and that really is reflecting the 787 production,”
 Peter Arment , of Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc., said in an
interview. Airbus’s rival to the 787, the A350, “won’t enter
the market really in any material way until the middle of the
decade.”  The 787 was more than three years late when it entered
service last year after Boeing struggled with the plane’s new
composite materials and production system. Boeing has increased
production of the plane this year and has said it’s on track to
reach its goal of building 10 a month by the end of 2013. It’s
also boosting output of its other jets that will give a planned
60 percent surge in production in four years through 2014.  New Deliveries  Boeing delivered five 787s in November, which means it has
now achieved the low end of its target for deliveries of 35 to
42 of the planes this year.  The length of time it’s taking to deliver the new
Dreamliners is dropping, according to Arment and  David Strauss 
with  UBS AG. (UBSN)  Strauss estimates it took nine months on average
for the November 787 deliveries to reach customers after rolling
off the  production line , a narrower window than the 10-month
average delivery time he says it took for the total of 38 jets
so far delivered since September 2011.  Deliveries are important because that’s when Boeing gets
about 40 percent of the purchase price of a jet. Toulouse,
France-based Airbus had surpassed the Chicago-based planemaker
on deliveries every year since 2003.  A change in delivery ranking won’t reflect any big market-
share shift as orders show that the customer base has stayed
relatively stable between the two planemakers, Arment said.  Upgraded Jet  Boeing  won  1,052 net orders through November, minus
cancellations, beating Airbus’s 585. Figures were reversed last
year, when Airbus won a record 1,419 orders compared to Boeing’s
805, after the European company began selling an upgraded
version of its A320 single-aisle jet at the end of 2010. Boeing
didn’t follow suit with improvements on its rival 737 until late
2011, which accounted for most of this year’s purchases.  Boeing has projected it will deliver 585 to 600 aircraft
this year, while Airbus predicted 570. Last year, Airbus
delivered 534 aircraft, more than Boeing’s 477.  “It’s been a year of execution,” Arment said yesterday of
Boeing. “They have hit milestones, and it’s time to keep the
momentum going.”  Boeing’s stock had gained less than 1 percent this year
through yesterday. That compares with a 13 percent gain in
shares of Airbus parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.
Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $73.38 at 12:23 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
