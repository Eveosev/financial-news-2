This year will probably overtake 1998
to become the warmest year on record in the U.S., the  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  said in its monthly
climate report.  The first 11 months of 2012 were the warmest start to any
year in the contiguous 48 states since the U.S. began keeping
records in 1895, NOAA’s  Climatic Data Center  reported today. The
average national temperature for the period was 57.1 degrees
Fahrenheit (13.9 Celsius), 1 degree above the old mark set in
1934 and 3.3 degrees above the average for the 20th century, the
agency said.  For all of 1998, the average temperature was 54.3 degrees.  “It appears virtually certain that 2012 will surpass the
current record as the warmest year for the nation,” the
Asheville, North Carolina-based center said. December
temperatures would have to be lower by 1 degree than the coldest
average for the month on record, in 1983, for the year not to
set a new mark.  The U.S. autumn, which for meteorologists was from
September through November, was the 21st warmest on record. The
period was drier than normal for much of the central U.S. and
Southeast, the agency said.  Only eight of the lower 48 states, along the West Coast and
across the north from  Washington  through  Minnesota , had average
or above-normal rainfall during November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
