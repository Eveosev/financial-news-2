The uniform worn by New York Yankees
pitcher Don Larsen during his 1956 World Series perfect game was
sold at auction for $756,000.  The successful offer, the 22nd bid on the No. 18 uniform,
came from Pete Siegel, the chief executive officer of  New York- 
based memorabilia seller  GottaHaveIt.com , according to a
statement from Steiner Sports, which organized yesterday’s
auction.  The championship ring collection of former college
basketball coach Bob Knight sold for $400,000. Knight led
Indiana University to national titles in 1976, 1981 and 1987.  Both Knight and Larsen placed the items for auction to fund
their grandchildren’s college educations, according to the
statement.  “I’m just delighted and relieved,” Larsen, 83, said in a
statement. “This will sure take care of the college education
of my grandchildren and leave a few dollars for a nice family
vacation.”  The right-hander’s perfect game, a 2-0 win over the
Brooklyn Dodgers, was one of 23 in Major League Baseball history
and the only one during the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
