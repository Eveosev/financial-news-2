The U.S. economy will fall into
“severe recession by the spring” unless Congress lessens the
tax increases and spending cuts set to begin in January, said
 Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.  “We’ve got to nail this down; uncertainty is killing us,”
Zandi told U.S. lawmakers today at a Joint Economic Committee
hearing in Washington.  House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, and
President  Barack Obama  are at a standoff over how to avert the
so-called fiscal cliff, more than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts. Unless Congress acts, taxes on income,
 capital gains , dividends and estates will rise and automatic
federal spending cuts, known as sequestration, will take effect
in January.  If Congress were to “kick the can down the road” by
extending the current tax-and-spending policies, Zandi predicted
the U.S. would lose its Aaa rating because “it would signal
that the political will is lacking to put the nation on a
sustainable fiscal path.”  A deal that raises the federal debt ceiling and “credibly
promises long-term fiscal sustainability,” by contrast, would
“quickly brighten” the  U.S. economy , Zandi said in prepared
testimony for the committee. His testimony said in that case,
real gross domestic product could rise by 2 percent in 2013 and
4 percent in 2014 and 2015.  He predicted the jobless rate will fall below 6 percent by
mid-2016 if a deal is reached.  “If we nail this down, we’ll be off and running,” Zandi
told lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
