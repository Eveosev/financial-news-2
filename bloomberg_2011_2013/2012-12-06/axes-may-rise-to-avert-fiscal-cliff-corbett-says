Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, a
first-term Republican, said federal taxes may rise if lawmakers
in Washington head off automatic spending cuts next month.  “I don’t think they can resolve it without an increase in
some taxes, but they have to counterbalance it with entitlement
reform and with fraud, abuse and waste reform,” Corbett said
today on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” show with
 Stephanie Ruhle  and  Erik Schatzker .  Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican who leads the U.S.
House of Representatives, and President  Barack Obama , a
Democrat, have been unable to strike a bargain on averting the
more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that
has been described as a fiscal cliff for the nation. In
Pennsylvania, federal aid would be reduced by $300 million, the
state’s budget office said yesterday.  “It’s going to have an effect across the board,” Corbett
said during the appearance from Bloomberg News headquarters in
New York.  The cuts would take $33 million from special education,
Corbett said. They would also curb $19 million in aid for women
and infants, reducing the number of recipients by 20,000, he
said. And it would lower the number of meals for older residents
by 1 million, he said.  Corbett has pledged not to raise taxes and has “no
intention of violating” that promise, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
