Gerald Wallace of the Brooklyn Nets
was fined $5,000 by the National Basketball Association for his
second violation of the league’s so-called anti-flopping rule,
this one against Most Valuable Player LeBron James.  The NBA instituted the rule during the offseason, seeking
to cut down on players falling to the court with the intent of
having referees call a foul on an opponent. Fines escalate to
$10,000, $15,000 and $30,000 for additional violations.  Wallace was disciplined for his action during a Dec. 1 loss
to the Miami Heat in which he fell backward onto the court after
James made contact with the Nets’ forward. James put his right
hand on Wallace’s body as he dribbled the ball with his left
hand on a drive to the basket.  The NBA’s rule says the primary factor in determining a
flop is whether a player’s “physical reaction to contact with
another player is inconsistent with what would reasonably be
expected given the force or direction of the contact.” A first
violation of the rule brings a warning.  Wallace is the second player fined under the guidelines,
joining teammate Reggie Evans. Wallace was warned for a flop
against the  New York  Knicks on Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
