U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery declined as imports from  Belgium  climbed to the highest
level in almost three years, offsetting the strongest demand
since February.  Next-day and next-month gas also fell, broker data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Imports from Belgium rose to 49 million cubic
meters a day, the most since January 2010, according to  National
Grid Plc. (NG/)  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. London time tomorrow
will be 363 million cubic meters, grid data show.  Within-day gas  dropped 2.1 percent to 69.4 pence a therm at
4:10 p.m. London time after falling 3 percent, the most since
Nov. 1. Month-ahead gas slid 1.6 percent to 69.15 pence a therm.
That’s equivalent to $11.10 per million British thermal units
and compares with $3.65 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Imports from Belgium were a record 8,600 gigawatt-hours
(800 million cubic meters) in October and November,
Interconnector U.K. Ltd. said Dec. 4. The previous record for
the period was 6,000 gigawatt-hours in 2004.  The  delivery network  will contain 333 million cubic meters
of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, down from 345 million at the start of
today, grid data show.  Inventories at Rough, the U.K.’s largest gas-storage
facility, fell 0.7 percent yesterday to 35,224 gigawatt-hours,
compared with about 39,000 at the same time last year, National
Grid data show. Withdrawal capacity will be restored at 10 p.m.
today, after being reduced by 50 percent since Nov. 28,  Centrica
Plc (CNA)  said.  Flows through the Theddlethorpe receiving terminal in the
east of  England  were at zero for a sixth day, grid data show.
The facility may start early next week, operator  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
said on its website yesterday.  Gas accounted for 35 percent of U.K. power production at
4:05 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 39 percent, nuclear 15
percent and wind 5.2 percent.  Day-ahead electricity  fell 5.4 percent to 51.25 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
