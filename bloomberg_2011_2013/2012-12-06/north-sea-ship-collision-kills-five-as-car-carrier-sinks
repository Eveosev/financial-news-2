Five crew members died and six are
missing after a cargo vessel carrying 1,417  Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. (7211)  cars collided with a container ship in the  North Sea  late
yesterday, the Dutch coast guard said.  The Baltic Ace sank shortly after colliding with container
vessel Corvus J, the coast guard said on its  website . Five
bodies have been recovered and 13 crew members were saved. The
search for the remaining six has stopped and won’t be resumed as
there’s no hope for survivors, the coast guard said.  “The Mitsubishi cars bound for  Russia  have been lost,”
Mitsubishi spokesman Daniel Nacass said by e-mail, adding that
the Tokyo-based carmaker is “deeply sorry for the tragic loss
of lives.”  The Bahamian-flagged Baltic Ace was headed to Kotka,
 Finland , from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, when it collided
about 65 kilometers (40 miles) off the southeastern coast of the
Netherlands with Cyprus-flagged Corvus J, which was on its way
to Antwerp from the Scottish town of Grangemouth, the coast
guard said.  Mitsubishi is assessing the impact of the accident on its
Russian distributor and dealers, and will try to limit the delay
to Russian customers, Nacass said.  Peter Westenberg, a spokesman for the coast guard, declined
to speculate on the cause for the collision, saying police will
investigate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
