Banks sold $85.6 million of notes
tied to the stock price of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in November, the
biggest month for securities tied to the company since December
2010.  The largest offering was $37.6 million of three-year auto-
callable notes sold by  UBS AG (UBSN)  on Nov. 30. The securities yield
10.7 percent a year as long as the share price doesn’t fall
below 75 percent of its initial value of $41.08 with all capital
at risk, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. UBS can call the notes
quarterly starting in March. It distributed the securities for a
2.25 percent fee.  Investors have bought $289.9 million of notes tied to the
largest U.S. bank by assets this year, the most referencing any
bank and 40 percent more than through the end of November 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks sold $111.4
million of notes tied to shares of  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the next
biggest-selling bank used as a reference.  Shares of JPMorgan Chase have gained 24 percent to $41.20
as of closing yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
increased 12 percent this year to 1,409.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
