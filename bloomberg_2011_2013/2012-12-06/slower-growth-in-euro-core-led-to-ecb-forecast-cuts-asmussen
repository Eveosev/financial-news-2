European Central Bank Executive Board
member Joerg Asmussen said slowing growth in Germany and other
“core euro-area countries” led the central bank to cut its
growth forecast.  “Weaker growth prospects in core euro-area countries
including Germany, France and the Netherlands led to the
downward correction of the economic forecasts,” Asmussen said
in a speech in  Frankfurt  today. “All euro  member states  are
called on to implement reforms.”  “Even in Germany, reforms are very much needed,” he said.
“One cannot sit back. If we don’t undertake reforms today, in
5-10 years we will once more be the sick man of Europe.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
