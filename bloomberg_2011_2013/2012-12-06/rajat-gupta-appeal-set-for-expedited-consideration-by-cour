Rajat Gupta’s appeal of his
conviction for passing inside tips to Galleon Group LLC co-
founder Raj Rajaratnam will be heard as soon as April 1,
according to the court that’s considering the case.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  Manhattan  today said it will
expedite Gupta’s appeal, ordering that briefs be filed by March
29 and setting oral arguments for as soon as the first week of
April.  In a hearing Dec. 4, a two-judge panel of the appeals court
ruled that Gupta, 64, a former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
director, can remain free on $10 million bond while it considers
the case. The decision overruled an order by U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff that Gupta surrender to begin serving his two-year
prison sentence on Jan. 8.  Gupta was convicted by a jury in June of one count of
conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud. He was accused
of passing illegal information about New York-based Goldman
Sachs to Rajaratnam, his friend and business partner.  In the order today, U.S. Circuit Judges Jose Cabranes and
Reena Raggi, who allowed Gupta to remain free pending appeal two
days ago, directed that any issues about his release be directed
to them.  U.S. Circuit Judge Susan L. Carney, who was also assigned
to the panel, removed herself from consideration of the case,
according to today’s order, which didn’t provide a reason.  The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 12-4448,  U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
