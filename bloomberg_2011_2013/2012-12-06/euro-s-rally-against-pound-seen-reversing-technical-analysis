The euro’s rally against the pound
during the past month may be set to reverse after the currency
failed to break through a key level of so-called resistance,
Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation shared currency, which reached a six-week
high against the pound yesterday, may fall as much as 0.5
percent after failing to break through its 55-week moving
average of 81.48 pence,  Karen Jones , head of foreign-exchange,
fixed-income and commodities technical analysis in London, wrote
in an e-mailed note. The currency may drop to 80.73 pence, a so-
called near-term support level, she wrote.  The 55-week moving average represents “a pivotal
resistance,” Jones wrote. “We should see a slide back to the
near-term support line.”  The euro was little changed at 81.15 pence at 10:08 a.m.
London time after advancing to 81.48 pence yesterday, the
strongest since Oct. 24. The currency has gained 1.8 percent
against the pound since Nov. 8.  Resistance refers to an area on a price graph where
analysts anticipate orders to sell a security will be clustered.
Support is where buy orders may be grouped. In  technical
analysis , investors study charts of trading patterns and prices
to predict changes in a security, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
