Alan Greenspan, the former Federal
Reserve chairman, said “the Bank of England is in good hands,”
when asked about the transition from the leadership of  Mervyn
King  to Mark Carney.  “The handling of the Bank of Canada was extraordinary. And
I think, in a sense, it’s go be an interesting transition,”
Greenspan said today in a Bloomberg television interview.
“Mervyn King in my judgment has done an excellent job over the
years.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
