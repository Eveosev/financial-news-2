Consumer prices in  Ecuador  rose 0.14
percent in November from a  month  earlier, the country’s
statistics agency reported today.  The increase brought the gain in prices in the past year to
4.77 percent, the National Statistics and Census Institute said
in a report on its website. The inflation rate decreased from
4.94 percent the previous month.  Prices are forecast to gain an average 5.14 percent this
year compared with 4.47 percent in 2011, according to the
Finance Ministry’s 2012 budget. The economy may expand 4.8
percent this year, the central bank said in July, less than the
5.35 percent originally estimated in the 2012 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
