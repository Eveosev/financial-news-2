The Canadian dollar weakened versus
its U.S. counterpart before a report forecast to show the
nation’s unemployment rate held steady at 7.4 percent in
November.  Canada’s currency gained against the euro as the  European
Central Bank  is seen moving closer to cutting  interest rates .
The so-called loonie is headed for a weekly gain against the
greenback as Canadian companies may have added 10,000  jobs  last
month, up from a 1,800 gain in October, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. A separate report
is forecast to show U.S. companies hired fewer workers in
November.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, declined 0.1 percent to 99.23
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 8:15 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian
dollar purchases $1.0078.  Canada’s benchmark  10-year bonds  rose, pushing the yield
down 0.2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.68
percent. The 2.75 percent security maturing in June 2022 rose 15
cents to C$109.37.  Oil, the country’s biggest export, fell 0.3 percent to
$85.98 a barrel in New York. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  were 0.3 percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
