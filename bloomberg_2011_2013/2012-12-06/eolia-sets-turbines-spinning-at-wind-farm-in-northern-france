Theolia SA (TEO) , a French wind-energy
developer, started operating a project in Magremont, northern
France, bringing its installed capacity in the country to 222
megawatts.  The 15-megawatt project comprises six turbines supplied by
German manufacturer  Nordex SE (NDX1) , Aix-en-Provence-based Theolia
said today in a  statement  on its website. It’s also built a
12.5-megawatt wind park in the same region that it operates for
third parties, it said, without identifying them.  France had a share of about 7 percent of Europe’s wind-
energy market at the end of last year, amounting to about 6,800
megawatts, according to the European Wind Energy Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
