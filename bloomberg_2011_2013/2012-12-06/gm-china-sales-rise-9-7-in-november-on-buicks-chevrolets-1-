(Corrects model name in sixth paragraph of story published
yesterday.)  General Motors Co. (GM) , the biggest
foreign automaker in  China , reported November sales in the
country increased 9.7 percent on demand for its Buick and
Chevrolet cars countered a decline in Wuling deliveries.  China sales climbed to 260,018 units in November, led by a
17 percent increase in Buick sales, the Detroit-based automaker
said in a  statement  on its website today. For the first 11
months, deliveries rose 10 percent to 2.59 million units,
exceeding the full-year tally in 2011, it said.  The U.S. automaker has outpaced China’s average industry
growth this year as it opened more dealerships in the country.
GM plans to add a new Cadillac model annually in the country
through 2016 as it seeks to boost sales of the luxury brand in
the world’s largest auto market.  GM had said it plans to invest as much as $7 billion in the
five years to 2015 in China. GM China President Bob Socia said
Nov. 30 the company’s priority next year is to boost Cadillac
sales.  The automaker’s Cadillac deliveries rose 8.4 percent last
month to 3,260 units, led by the SRX sport utility vehicle at
2,082 units.  Sales of GM’s China-only Baojun marque surged 70 percent
from a year earlier to 10,232 units, according to the company.
The automaker sells two models under the brand, the Baojun 630
with a starting price from 62,800  yuan  ($10,080), and the Le Chi
that sells from 39,800 yuan, according to its website.  Deliveries of SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., the venture
that makes Wuling mini-commercial vehicles, slipped 0.5 percent
to 118,536 units last month, the first year-on-year decline in
10 months. Sales at FAW-GM Light Commercial Vehicle Co., the
venture with FAW Group Corp., increased 4.2 percent to 4,837
units.  Average passenger-vehicle prices have fallen every month
this year as dealerships increased discounts and incentives to
reduce inventory, according to data from the National
Development and Reform Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
