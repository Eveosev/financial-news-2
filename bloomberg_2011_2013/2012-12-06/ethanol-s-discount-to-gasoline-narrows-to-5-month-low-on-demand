Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the weakest level in almost five months on increased
demand for the biofuel.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline was 18.79
cents a gallon based on front-month futures, versus 21.08 cents
yesterday, the least since July 18. The spread has averaged 62.2
cents this year and reached 99.8 cents Sept. 28.  “It feels like there’s some buying to do,” said Jim
Damask, a manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based
alternative energy broker. “People are asking for higher prices
and they’re getting it. It seems like they’re filling their
short-term needs and they have more short-term needs.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 1.2 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.409 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The December contract expired yesterday. Prices have climbed 9.4
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago dropped 4 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.40 a gallon and on the West Coast the
additive decreased 4 cents to $2.535, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 4 cents to $2.455 a gallon
and in New York the biofuel decreased 3 cents to $2.50.  Gasoline for January delivery slid 4.09 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $2.5969. The contract covers reformulated
gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Supply Glut  A supply glut in ethanol has encouraged refiners to fulfill
needs on a more immediate basis and not to lock in longer-term
pacts, Damask said.  Stockpiles rose 5.4 percent to 19.3 million barrels in the
week ended Nov. 30 from the previous week, Energy Department
data show.  Corn for March delivery tumbled 6.25 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $7.515 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
31 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
