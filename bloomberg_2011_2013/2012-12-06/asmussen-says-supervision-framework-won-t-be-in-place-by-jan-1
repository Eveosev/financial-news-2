European Central Bank Executive Board
member Joerg Asmussen said the legal framework needed for the
ECB to assume bank supervisory duties won’t be in place by Jan.
1 as lawmakers continue deliberations.  “I don’t think that we are going to get across the
implementation because the European Parliament has to get
involved,” Asmussen said late yesterday at an event in
Brussels. “This year we can’t expect to make any miracles, even
if the ministers happen to agree on the 12th of December, which
I hope.”  European Union finance ministers this week failed to find
common ground on technical arrangements for the ECB to take over
supervising European banks, and added another meeting next week
to push for an agreement before a leaders’ summit on Dec. 13.
ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Nov. 23 it is “essential”
that the legal framework is ready “as soon as possible, ideally
on 1 January.”  Ministers are rushing to establish the ECB as the
continent’s bank supervisor as a prerequisite for countries
including  Spain  to access joint funds directly to recapitalize
their banks. Draghi has said he expects the supervision to be
phased in gradually next year with full implementation by the
beginning of 2014.  “I think we are going to find the legal principles,”
Asmussen said. “And, of course, this is going to happen next
year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
