The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and the  Department of Justice  will share
information to streamline enforcement of fair-lending laws, the
two agencies announced.  “The Department of Justice welcomes the new tools and
resources the CFPB can bring to the fight against lending
discrimination,” Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general
for the department’s civil rights division, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Both the consumer bureau, which was created by the Dodd-
Frank law of 2010, and the department have authority to fight
discrimination in lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act. The act bars discrimination in lending on the basis of
race, religion, national origin and other protected categories.  Under the accord, the two agencies will share information
and take steps to keep it confidential, according to the
statement. They will also notify each other of enforcement work
to avoid unnecessary duplication, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
