The  International Olympic Committee 
(IOC) has stripped four medalists from the 2004 Athens Games of
their medals because of positive doping tests.  The IOC has disqualified shot put gold medalist Yuriy
Bilonog of Ukraine, shot put bronze medal winner Svetlana
Krivelyova of Russia, hammer throw silver medalist Ivan Tsikhan
of Belarus, and discus throw bronze medalist Iryna Yatchenko of
Belarus, it said in an emailed statement.  The athletes were disqualified following re-tests of their
stored drug samples, the IOC said. The IOC, in collaboration
with the  World Anti-Doping Agency , had decided to re-test the
samples “as a result of targeted testing based on intelligence
and new methods,” it said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
