The European Commission will seek to
review merger rules in 2013 in search of changes that could
reduce tax evasion and fraud, according to an action plan
released today.  The Brussels-based commission also will urge nations to
adopt common anti-abuse standards to prevent companies from
using an “artificial arrangement” to avoid taxes. Other
recommendations call for new efforts to identify tax havens and
to urge other nations to meet EU standards.  “Around one trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) is lost to tax
evasion and avoidance every year in the EU,” EU Tax
Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said today. The action plan, which
will be presented to national finance ministers and the European
Parliament, calls for “ways to address legal technicalities and
loopholes which some companies exploit to avoid paying their
fair share.”  Corporations including Starbucks, Amazon.com Inc. and
Google Inc. have come under attack from British lawmakers and
protestors for using complex accounting methods to minimize tax
liabilities in the U.K. while running large operations in the
country.  Starbucks Corp., the world’s biggest coffee-shop operator,
has pledged to build public trust in the U.K. after lawmakers
criticized the firm for not paying any corporation tax for the
last three years. The firm is in talks with the U.K. Treasury
over its tax affairs and will release details of the discussions
this week, Starbucks said on Dec. 2 in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
