Serbian exports probably will expand
by at least 25 percent next year because of growing car and oil
product sales abroad, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said.  The exports may rise to 11 billion euros ($14.37 billion)
from an estimated 8.6 billion euros this year, Dinkic told an
exporter forum in Belgrade today.  Serbia  exported 7.24 billion
euros worldwide in the 10 months through October, or 3.4 percent
more than in the same period last year.  “The next year will be the turning point for the Serbian
economy,” Dinkic said. “Car exports next year will be worth at
least 1.5 billion euros and maybe even 2 billion euros.”  Serbia has been trying to lure industrial investors with
export markets to cut reliance on imports and narrow the
traditionally high trade deficit, which deepens current-account
imbalances. The trade gap widened 7.8 percent through October to
4.87 billion euros. Car exports picked up 69.4 percent on year
in October as  Fiat SpA (F)  expands production in Serbia and sells
cars abroad.  “We have yet to see the impact of Fiat exports on our
trade with European countries,” Serbia’s main export market, as
well as the U.S., Dinkic said. Serbian 10-month exports to the
European Union expanded an annual 3.2 percent, while sales to
North America grew 30.2 percent.  Exports from the Pancevo refinery, upgraded this year to
produce higher quality crude oil products fit for foreign
markets, may add additional 700 million euros to 800 million
euros in export revenue. The Pancevo refinery, one of two in
Serbia, operated by  Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIIS) , which is majority
owned by  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom Neft.  The export expansion will lead the economy 2 percent higher
next year, following an expected 2 percent contraction this
year, with both export growth and economic activity gaining pace
if the government “manages to restart production at the
Smederevo steel mill,” Dinkic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
