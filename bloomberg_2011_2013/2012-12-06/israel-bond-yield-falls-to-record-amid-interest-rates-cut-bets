Israel ’s benchmark bonds gained,
sending the yield to the lowest on record, on bets easing
inflationary pressures will enable the central bank to lower
interest rates to spur economic growth.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due in
January 2022 slumped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.79 percent, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  One-
year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations
for rates over the period, fell for the first time since Nov.
27, dropping six basis points to 1.79 percent.  The Bank of Israel last week kept its benchmark interest
rate at 2 percent after a surprise cut last month to support
growth, which the Central Bureau of Statistics said in October
may slow to 3.5 percent this year from 4.6 percent in 2011.
 Annual inflation  may stay unchanged at 1.8 percent in November,
the lowest since July, according to the  median estimate  of 11
analysts on Bloomberg. The data is set to be released Dec. 14.,
10 days before a central bank meeting to review interest rates.  “Expectations of no inflation in coming months is
increasing the possibility for the central bank to lower
interest rates as growth slows and unemployment rises,” said
Jonathan Katz, a Jerusalem-based economist for HSBC Holdings
Plc. “This environment is positive for longer-term government
bonds.”  The  unemployment rate  for October rose to a seasonally-
adjusted 7 percent from 6.9 percent in the previous month, the
statistics bureau said Nov. 28. The two-year break-even rate,
the yield difference between the inflation-linked bonds and
fixed-rate government debt of similar maturity, shrank four
basis points to 204, implying an average annual inflation rate
of 2.04 percent. The government’s inflation target is between 1
percent to 3 percent.  The shekel weakened for the first time in three days,
declining 0.5 percent to 3.8209 a dollar. The Tel Aviv Bond 40
Index, which measures inflation-linked and fixed-rate corporate
bonds, rose for a second day, gaining 0.3 percent to 280.56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
