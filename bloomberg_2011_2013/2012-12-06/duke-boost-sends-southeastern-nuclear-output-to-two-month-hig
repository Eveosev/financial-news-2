Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  boosted production
at the 1,100-megawatt McGuire 2 reactor in  North Carolina ,
lifting nuclear-power output in the Southeast to the highest
level in almost  two months .  U.S. generation  advanced 0.4 percent to 89,017 megawatts,
or 87 percent of capacity, the 10th consecutive day of gains,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output was 5.7 percent lower than a  year earlier  with
12 of 104 reactors offline.  McGuire 2, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of
 Charlotte , operated at  93 percent of capacity  today, up from 74
percent yesterday. The unit is powering up after a turbine trip
that caused it to slow last week, said Valerie Patterson, a
company spokeswoman based at the plant.  The increase led  production  higher by 0.7 percent to 25,782
megawatts in the Southeast, the highest level since Oct. 7. Five
reactors with a combined capacity of 4,779 megawatts, about 15
percent of the regionâ€™s output, are shut.  Generation in the Northeast gained 0.4 percent to 24,893
megawatts as Constellation Energy Group Inc. returned the Nine
Mile Point 1 reactor to full power near Oswego,  New York . The
621-megawatt unit, which shut Nov. 30 for turbine repairs,
operated at 80 percent of capacity yesterday.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
