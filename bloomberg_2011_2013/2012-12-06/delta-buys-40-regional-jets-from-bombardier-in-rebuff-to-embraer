Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  agreed to buy 40
regional jets from  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  as the world’s second-largest
carrier broadens its replacement of older, inefficient planes.  The firm order for CRJ900 NextGen aircraft has a catalog
value of about $1.85 billion, and options for 30 more would
boost it to $3.29 billion, Bombardier said today. The airline
held talks with both Bombardier and  Brazil ’s Embraer SA for the
order, Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  said in October.  The purchase lets Atlanta-based Delta expand its use of
more fuel-efficient 76-seat regional jets as it sheds versions
that carry only 50 passengers and cost more to operate. It is
Bombardier’s third major aircraft order since June.  “If you’re trying to get rid of old, obsolete Bombardier
planes, maybe you get a better deal by sticking with the same
company for your order,” Fred Lowrance, an Avondale Partners
LLC analyst, said in an interview. “Bombardier is going to help
out in taking Delta’s old CRJ200s back. All else being equal,
I’m sure that was the deciding factor.”  Lowrance, based in Nashville, Tennessee, rates Delta shares
market outperform.  The new regional jets are part of a restructuring of
Delta’s U.S. fleet that also includes orders for 100  Boeing Co. (BA) 
737-900ERs to replace older models and the sublease of 88 Boeing
717s from Southwest Airlines Co. Getting rid of older aircraft
is one element of Delta’s $1 billion cost-cutting program.  Bombardier Orders  NetJets, a unit of  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , agreed to buy as many as 275 Challenger aircraft worth
$7.3 billion from Bombardier in June, and luxury air-charter
company VistaJet Holding SA ordered as many as 142 Global-series
planes with a value of $7.8 billion in November.  Airlines typically negotiate discounts from list prices.  Delta Connection carriers now fly 466 CRJ-series aircraft,
including 286 CRJ200s, 79 CRJ700s and 101 CRJ900s, making it the
world’s largest CRJ fleet, Montreal-based Bombardier said.  “We are delighted,” said Mike Arcamone, president of
Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. “Delta has been a steady
Bombardier CRJ customer and has been a major contributor to the
worldwide success of the CRJ.”  Embraer (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-largest plane maker, declined
3.3 percent to close at 13.10 reais in  Sao Paulo . Bombardier
Class B shares rose 1.5 percent to C$3.33 in Toronto, while
Delta climbed 3.2 percent to $10.02 in  New York .  Free Cocktails  The regional jet purchase was allowed under a new pilot
contract that lets Delta add as many as 70 of the 76-seat planes
as it retires older, cramped 50-seat aircraft. The bigger
regional jets will have dual-class cabins that bring in higher
fares and are prized by business travelers for the extra legroom
and amenities such as free cocktails.  Delta will  begin receiving  the CRJ900s in the last half of
2013 as it phases out 60 CRJ200s. The airline said the change
won’t affect its current capacity. The smaller jets have fallen
out of favor with carriers as jet-fuel prices have lingered
between $2 and $3 a gallon during the past four years.  “The economics and customer features of the Bombardier
CRJ900 made it the right aircraft to add to our Delta Connection
fleet,” Delta President Ed Bastian said in a statement.
“Combined with the removal of 50-seat aircraft, this
opportunity bolsters our ongoing fleet restructuring program.”  Delta ordered 40 CFM34-8C5 engines built by GE Aviation for
the CRJ900s, parent General Electric Co. said in a statement.
The engines have a list value of about $320 million.  The airline had a fleet of 775 planes with an average age
of 15.6 years at the end of 2011, according to a regulatory
filing. That compared with an average of 11 years among a dozen
North American carriers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Delta also had 550 regional jets flown by partners such as
SkyWest Inc. and  Pinnacle Airlines Corp. (PNCLQ)  as of the end of 2011,
four-fifths of them made by Bombardier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
