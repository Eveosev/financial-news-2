France  sold 3.97 billion euros ($5.2
billion) in bonds today, completing its 2012 issuance plan as
borrowing costs fell to a record low.  France sold 900 million euros of benchmark 15-year bonds at
an average yield of 2.56 percent, down from 2.85 percent on
Sept. 6, the previous record. It also auctioned six- and seven-
year securities at lower yields than previously.  The record-low borrowing costs extend a drop that began a
year ago when the  European Central Bank  unveiled its long-term
re-financing operation for banks and was reinforced with the
ECB’s September pledge to buy some  government bonds  if needed.
Investors have also disregarded concerns about the election of
Socialist President  Francois Hollande  in May and the decision by
two rating companies to strip France of its top  credit rating .  “All in all, a very robust auction,” said Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in London. “Although we
suspect France will not be a strong performer amongst the euro
core countries in 2013, we would not be too pessimistic as 2012
was a relatively good year for French debt despite all the
negative news.”  The ECB cut its growth and inflation forecasts for the euro
area today and President  Mario Draghi  said the region won’t
start to shake off its slump until the second half of 2013,
leaving the door ajar for further interest rate reductions.  The  premium  France pays to borrow for 10 years over  Germany 
has dropped to 66 basis points, down from more than 200 points
in November 2011 when French banks’ exposure to other euro
countries fueled concern about the nation’s creditworthiness.  Borrowings Completed  France has completed its plan to sell 178 billion euros in
bonds this year, giving it room to begin raising funds for 2013
and 2014, Agence France Tresor, the debt-management office,
said.  The AFT bought back 17 billion euros in 2013 bonds
maturing in the first nine months of 2012, having already bought
back 4 billion euros in 2011.  Hollande has persistently pledged to shrink the deficit and
is starting to take steps to tackle France’s record trade
deficit and high labor costs, saying last month that he’ll raise
sales taxes to pay for a cut in charges on business. At a 2 1/2
hour press conference on Nov. 13, the Socialist president also
pledged 60 billion euros in spending cuts over five years.  Hollande has asked unions and business leaders to agree on
ways to increase labor flexibility, threatening to decree change
if there is no accord.  France today sold 1.38 billion euros in 2018 bonds at an
average yield of 1.01 percent, below the 1.29 percent it paid on
Oct. 4. It also sold 1.7 billion euros in 2019 debt at 1.27
percent compared with 2.02 percent on July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
