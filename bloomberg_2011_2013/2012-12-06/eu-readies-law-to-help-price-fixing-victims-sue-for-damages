European Union regulators may make
it easier for cartel victims to sue the perpetrators under
proposals to be unveiled in “the coming months,” Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said today.  The proposals will seek to “set up an EU-wide procedure
for these compensation actions,” Almunia told a conference in
Brussels.  Private damages lawsuits are rare in national courts across
 Europe . The European Commission, which yesterday levied record
cartel fines of 1.47 billion euros ($1.9 billion) on producers
of cathode-ray tubes for TVs and computer monitors, has
championed such lawsuits as a way to compensate victims of
illegal monopolies and cartels.  The damages legislation will also include rules on what
documents claimants can obtain from EU regulators to bolster
compensation lawsuits against cartel members, Almunia said.  Cartel victims taking legal action in national courts have
asked for documents “that should have been protected because
otherwise our leniency programs would not work,” Almunia said.  Possible rules on group lawsuits, or collective redress,
“will come later,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
