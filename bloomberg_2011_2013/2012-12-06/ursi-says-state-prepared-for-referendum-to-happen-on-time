Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi said
the referendum on a new constitution will proceed as planned
Dec. 15.  In a televised address, Mursi said he will rescind the
decree granting himself extraordinary powers once the results of
the vote are known.  “The constitutional decree and all its effects will end as
soon as the result of the referendum are announced -- be it a
yes or a no,” he said. “What I wanted by issuing this decree
is to get to the stage of accomplishing the constitution
and the referendum on it to allow this great people to express
their will.”  Mursi said he was calling for a meeting with some
opposition figures on Dec. 8 for a “a comprehensive and
productive dialogue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
