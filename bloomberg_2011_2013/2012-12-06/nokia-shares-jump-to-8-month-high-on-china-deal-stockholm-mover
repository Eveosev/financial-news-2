Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  rose to its highest level
in eight months in Stockholm trading after the Finnish
smartphone maker said a version of its flagship Lumia model
would be carried by China’s largest mobile operator.  Nokia’s shares advanced as much as 11 percent on their
second day of gains since the announcement, lifting the stock to
the highest level since April 19. About 23 million shares
changed hands, nearly 2 1/2 times the three-month daily average.
Finland’s benchmark  OMX Helsinki 25 (H25ETF)  index was closed for a
national holiday.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s biggest mobile-phone
carrier, agreed to take the Lumia 920T as it is compatible with
the country’s homegrown TD-SCDMA technology that powers the
company’s network, the companies said in a statement yesterday.  Espoo, Finland-based Nokia has seen its smartphone market
share plummet in the past five years as customers opted for
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices using  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android.
It’s counting on the success of the Lumia line to help it
rebound from six consecutive quarters of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
