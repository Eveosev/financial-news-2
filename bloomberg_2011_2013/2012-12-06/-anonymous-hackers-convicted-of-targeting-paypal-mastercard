Four hackers from the online group
“Anonymous” were convicted of conspiring to attack the
websites of Visa Inc., PayPal Inc.,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and others.  Christopher Weatherhead was found guilty today and three of
his co-defendants -- Jake Birchall, Ashley Rhodes and  Peter
Gibson  -- pleaded guilty earlier at a London criminal court to
conspiring to impair the operation of computers, the Crown
Prosecution Service said in a  statement  today.  “Weatherhead is a cyber-criminal who waged a sophisticated
and orchestrated campaign of online attacks on the computer
systems of several major companies,” said Russell Tyner, a
lawyer from the prosecutors’ organized crime division.  The four also targeted the British Recorded Music Industry,
Ministry of Sound and the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, prosecutors said. The attacks cost the
companies more than 3.5 million pounds ($5.6 million) in extra
staffing, software and sales losses.  U.K. police have been investigating “hacktivist”
collectives Anonymous and LulzSec for conducting denial-of-
service attacks, which flood  computer networks  with requests for
information until they shut down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
