Nigeria ’s Eurobond yields fell for
the seventh day to a record after central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said the nation’s financial system is not under threat
from the withdrawal of speculative investments.  Borrowing costs on the $500 million dollar debt due January
2021 slid four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.162
percent at 1:18 p.m. in Lagos, the lowest since it was issued in
January 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yields have dropped 213 basis points from a high of 6.29 percent
on Dec. 21, 2011.  Africa ’s biggest oil producer would still have $36 billion
in reserves if speculative investments of about $10 billion left
the country, Sanusi said at a conference yesterday. The nation’s
 foreign-exchange reserves  have increased 35 percent this year to
$44.5 billion as at Nov. 30, according to data on the Central
Bank of Nigeria’s website.  “Strong external reserves boost the confidence of offshore
investors in the nation’s debt,” Sewa Wusu, analyst at Lagos-
based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The central bank has left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at a record 12 percent this year, increased lenders’
reserve requirements and limited access to money auctions to
stop dealers from buying foreign currency using naira purchased
from the bank at a discount.  The naira weakened less than 0.1 percent at 157.18 a dollar
on the  interbank market  in Lagos. The currency has strengthened
3.2 percent this year, the second-best performer in Africa,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022 fell
eight basis points to 12.10 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices on the website of the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.8913 a dollar in Accra, the
capital, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
