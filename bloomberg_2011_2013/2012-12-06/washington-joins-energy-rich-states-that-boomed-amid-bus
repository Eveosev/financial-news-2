Median household incomes have fallen
in more than two-thirds of U.S. counties since 1999, with few
areas emerging unscathed from the lost decade except those where
energy is produced or government contracts awarded.  Figures released today by the Census Bureau highlight the
geographic scope of the worst slump since the Great Depression.
Even in counties where earnings increased, typical households in
most of them made less than the $52,762 national median income
figure, according to data from the census’s  2007-11 American
Community Survey  analyzed by Bloomberg.  “Employment has picked up over the last couple of years;
people are getting jobs,” said Edward Wolff, a New York
University economics professor. “The real issue is the jobs
they’re getting and how much those jobs pay. It’s pretty
dismal.”  It’s not all dismal. Thirty-eight of the 50 counties with
the highest-percentage income growth during the decade were in
the energy-rich states of the Dakotas, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming
and Oklahoma. Slope County, North Dakota, registered a 69.6
percent median  household income  jump to $55,625.  North Dakota was boosted by the largest domestic oil find
since the 1968  Prudhoe Bay  discovery in  Alaska . The state’s
jobless rate has fallen to 3.1 percent, thousands of oilfield
workers are living in temporary camps or motels, and McDonald’s
restaurants resorted to offering $300 signing bonuses to new
employees. Forty-four of  the state ’s 53 counties had increases
in median household incomes since 1999, census figures show.  Capital Wealth  A growing number of high-end enclaves have sprouted around
the nation’s capital, too, courtesy of the $144 billion the
federal government spent in  Virginia ,  Maryland  and the  District
of Columbia  during the 2012 fiscal year, according to the White
House budget office. That includes $88 billion in contracts with
private companies.  Median household incomes in  Falls Church , Virginia, rose
20.8 percent to $120,332 since 1999, the last year that
comparable figures were available. Arlington County incomes
increased 18.9 percent to $99,651. In Loudoun County, a fast-
growing northern Virginia exurb, incomes climbed 12 percent to
$120,096.  Still, nationwide, inflation-adjusted median household fell
5.5 percent since 1999, the Census Bureau said, a result of the
dot-com bust, two recessions, two wars, and then the collapse of
the housing market and  auto industry .  Automotive Fallout  In Livingston County,  Michigan , a Detroit exurb tied to the
automotive industry, inflation-adjusted income fell 20 percent
to $71,694. Inflation-adjusted median household income in
Livingston, a predominantly white county about halfway between
Detroit and Lansing, was $89,642 in 1999, the 24th highest in
the nation at the time, according to the Census Bureau.  Income dropped 8.3 percent to $101,193 in Douglas County,
 Colorado , one of the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. It
plunged 26.6 percent to $21,798 in Noxubee County,  Mississippi ,
already among the poorest places on the map. Even wealthy
Fairfield County, Connecticut, lost 4.9 percent.  Michigan counties accounted for a dozen of the 50 hardest-
hit places for income loss during the decade, according to the
data. Oakland County, adjacent to Livingston, saw a 19.3 percent
drop to $66,456 in median household income. Incomes in Macomb
County fell 21.9 percent to $54,087.  Detroit’s Blues  Households in Wayne County, which includes downtown
Detroit, lost almost as much of their income as their neighbors.
As the city’s population shrank 25 percent during the decade,
households in Wayne County lost 22.8 percent of their incomes,
falling to a median of $41,886.  The state’s fortunes were built largely on the auto
industry, and the bankruptcies of  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
Chrysler Group LLC were responsible for 230,000 lost jobs in
2009 alone, according to a  University of Michigan  study. Since
employment peaked in April 2000, the state has  lost 718,400
jobs .  “The auto industry was doing great, and Michigan was doing
great,” said Donald Grimes, senior research specialist at the
University of Michigan’s Institute for Research on Labor,
Employment, and the Economy. “But our world turned upside-
down.”  The decade’s economic misery wasn’t confined to places
relying on the auto industry. Median household incomes fell 25.6
percent to $33,533 in Rabun County, Georgia, the location for
much of the 1972 film “Deliverance.” The area has seen a
decline in textile manufacturing.  Death Valley  Losses extended West to Esmeralda County, Nevada, where
median household incomes fell 33.3 percent to $29,438. One in 12
people in the county, which includes part of Death Valley
National Park, have suffered from major depression, according to
 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services figures  analyzed by
Bloomberg.  Sun Belt cities weren’t immune. Incomes fell 16.8 percent
in Mecklenburg County,  North Carolina , to $55,994, driven in
part by the decline of the banking and construction industries.
The county includes Charlotte.  Households in Travis County, Texas, which includes Austin,
lost 10.8 percent of income to $55,452, largely because of the
burst of the housing and technology bubbles. In Santa Clara,
 California , home to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , incomes declined 9.9 percent to
$89,064.  “We got hit hard by this recession,” said John Connaughton, a financial economics professor at the University
of North Carolina-Charlotte. “But it gets even better with the
fiscal cliff,” he said, referring to the more than $600 billion
in federal tax increases and automatic spending cuts scheduled
to begin in January. “Just wait three weeks, and we’re going to
really start having fun.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
