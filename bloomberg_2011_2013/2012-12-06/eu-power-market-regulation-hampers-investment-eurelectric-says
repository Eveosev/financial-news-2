Volatile energy regulations may deter
investors from providing an estimated 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) required in the power industry by 2020, according to
European Union energy associations.  The missing investment will put future power generation at
risk, electricity industry group  Eurelectric  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “Changing regulation decreases the attractiveness of
utilities,” said Hans ten Berge, secretary-general of
Eurelectric. “This deters investment and leads to yet more
volatile regulation.”  The EU aims to reduce the impact of climate change by 2020
by setting targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
and increases in energy efficiency and the amount of energy
produced from renewable sources. Inherent tensions between those
goals and changes in their relative importance at the EU and
national levels is increasing risk for investors, according to
Eurelectric.  There is “no interrelation” between the EU emissions
trading system and renewables targets, Eurelectric said.
“Volatile national policies create uncertainty and undermine
the viability of conventional generation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
