Ben Roethlisberger will start at
quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers against the San Diego
Chargers after missing three games with shoulder and rib
injuries.  Roethlisberger suffered a strained throwing shoulder and
dislocated a rib during the Steelers’ Nov. 12 game against the
Kansas City Chiefs. The Steelers (7-5) lost two of three games
during his absence, with Byron Leftwich making one start and
Charlie Batch the next two after Leftwich fractured a rib.  Roethlisberger, 30, practiced today for the second straight
day and Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he’s confident about
Roethlisberger being ready to return.  “The only question we can’t answer is taking a hit,”
Tomlin said, according to the team’s website. “Obviously that
will be answered in the stadium on Sunday.”  Roethlisberger had thrown for 2,287 yards with 17
touchdowns and four interceptions before the injury. He’s the
 sixth-rated quarterback  in the National Football League.  The Steelers are two games behind the first-place Baltimore
Ravens (9-3) in the American Football Conference’s North
Division and in position for one of the AFC’s two wild card
playoff berths with four regular-season games left.  To contact the reporter on this story:
