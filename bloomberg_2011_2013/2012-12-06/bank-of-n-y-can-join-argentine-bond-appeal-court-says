Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
trustee for  Argentina ’s restructured government bonds, may join
the country’s appeal in a case involving its defaulted debt, a
court said.  U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan ruled Nov.
21 that Argentina must pay $1.3 billion claimed by holders of
the defaulted debt into an escrow account by Dec. 15 if it made
about $3 billion in scheduled payments on the restructured debt
this month.  Bank of New York claims Griesa’s orders would force it to
withhold payments it is obligated to make to the holders of
Argentina’s restructured bonds if the country fails to pay
holders of its defaulted debt. The U.S. Court of Appeals in
Manhattan today said in a one-sentence order that the bank may
file briefs as a nonparty in Argentina’s appeal.  The appeals court, which will hear oral arguments in the
case Feb. 27, entered an order last week delaying the effect of
Griesa’s orders while they’re being appealed.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 12-
105, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
