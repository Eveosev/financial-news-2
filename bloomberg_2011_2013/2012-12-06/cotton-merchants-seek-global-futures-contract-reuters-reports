The International Cotton Association
has set up a committee to design specifications for a futures
contract that would rival Intercontinental Exchange Inc.â€™s U.S.
benchmark, Reuters reported, citing unidentified members of the
trade group.  A proposal for the contract may be ready in months,
according to the report. Talks may be focused on starting cotton
trading on a new exchange or expanding the ICE contract to allow
for delivery in locations outside the U.S. Atlanta-based ICE may
already be considering adding international delivery locations
to its U.S. contract, Reuters said, citing unidentified
merchants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
