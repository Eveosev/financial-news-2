The  U.S. Senate  repealed Cold War-era
trade restrictions with Russia by a 92-4 vote today, sending the
measure to President  Barack Obama  who has said he would sign it.
The House approved it last month.  Industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
the National Association of Manufacturers say the measure will
ensure that American businesses will be able to secure lower
tariffs and have stronger legal rights when dealing with Russia,
which joined the  World Trade Organization  in August.  The bill also includes provisions to impose travel and
financial sanctions on human-rights violators in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
