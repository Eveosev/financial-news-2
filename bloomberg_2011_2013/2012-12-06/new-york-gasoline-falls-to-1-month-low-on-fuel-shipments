Gasoline weakened to the lowest level
in more than a month in the  New York  Harbor on speculation more
fuel shipments to the U.S. East Coast will add to supplies and
help depress prices in the region.  Traders and oil companies booked 13 tankers to carry the
motor fuel from  Europe  to the East Coast for the two weeks to
Dec. 19, according to the median estimate of six shipbrokers who
specialize in transporting gasoline. Inventories in the Central
Atlantic, known as PADD 1B, added 1.7 million barrels to 24.5
million last week, the Energy Department reported.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in the New York Harbor retreated 0.38 cent to 1 cent a gallon
over futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:15 p.m.
Thatâ€™s the narrowest gap since Oct. 24 and the  third consecutive 
daily decline. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline held at a
premium of 1.75 cents a gallon.  The 27 ships booked or probably hired over the next two
weeks, called Medium-Range tankers, would be able to carry about
607,000 barrels a day, compared with about 315,000 barrels
normally. Vessels on the trans-Atlantic route are earning
$12,877 daily, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange.
Returns jumped 51 percent in the last week, the data showed.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York advanced 3.37 cents to
8.5 cents over heating oil futures after distillate stockpiles
declined for the first time in three weeks. Supplies of  heating
oil and diesel  dropped by 445,000 barrels to 20.4 million last
week, according to Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
