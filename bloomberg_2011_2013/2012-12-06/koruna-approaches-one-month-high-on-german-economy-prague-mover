The koruna approached its strongest
level in a month against the euro as factory orders from
 Germany , the biggest buyer of Czech exports, increased more than
economists predicted.  The Czech currency appreciated as much as 0.2 percent to
25.160 per euro and traded less than 0.1 percent stronger at
25.197 at 3:52 p.m. in  Prague . The koruna reached 2.148 at the
end of last week, the highest intraday level since Nov. 1.  German factory orders surged almost four times as much as
economists forecast in October, a government report showed
today, a day after a purchasing managers’ index for services in
the biggest European economy unexpectedly rose. Exports account
for about 75 percent of Czech gross domestic product.  “Germany is a key yardstick for all of central  Europe ”
and the PMI data “signaled a turn for the better,” Jan Bures,
a Prague-based currency analyst at CSOB AS in Prague, wrote in a
report today. “But it is too early for buoyant celebrations.”  Czech government bonds were little changed, with the  yield 
on five-year koruna notes rising less than one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 0.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
