Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)  gained the
most in three months after the Canadian yoga-wear retailer
boosted its annual profit and sales forecasts, helped by
strength in its online business and store openings.  The shares  rose  7.3 percent to $73.57 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day gain since Sept. 7. The Vancouver-
based company has gained 58 percent this year.  Lululemon has been pursuing growth overseas, setting up the
groundwork for stores in Hong Kong, London and  Germany , Chief
Executive Officer Christine Day said in an earnings call today.
The 201-store company has more than doubled revenue in its e-
commerce business in the past three quarters to $119 million
from $56 million, while sales at company-owned locations have
jumped 36 percent to $712.1 million, Lululemon said in its
quarterly filing today.  Lululemon “remains one of the key brands that is building
awareness, driving share, and selling product at full price in a
sea of price competition,”  Adrienne Tennant , an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC with a buy rating on the stock,
wrote in a note today. The company “remains an attractive
longer term growth story, and we believe earnings growth is
still above 30 percent annually for the next several years,”
she wrote.  Profit this fiscal year will be as much as $1.83 a share,
up from a previous forecast of a maximum of $1.81 a share,
Lululemon said in a statement today. Analysts’ projected $1.81,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  New Stores  Lululemon has opened 21 stores in the U.S., eight in
Australia and two in  New Zealand  since last year, as well as
five Canadian locations for ivivva athletica, which makes dance-
inspired apparel for young people, according to today’s filing.  Day, who ran  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s Asia-Pacific unit before
joining Lululemon, said the retailer is also looking to boost
its men’s business, which is typically about 12 percent of
sales.  The retailer, which sells yoga pants for $98 to a loyal
customer base, has faced growing competition from stores such as
 Gap Inc. (GPS) ’s Athleta and  VF Corp. (VFC) ’s Lucy. It also faced issues
from color bleeding in some garments earlier this year.  Lululemon reported third-quarter profit of 39 cents a
share, topping analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey for 37
cents each. Sales were $316.5 million in the period, an increase
of 37 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
