The  African Development Bank  will
decide whether to give  Egypt  a $500 million loan based on the
North-African country’s negotiations with the  International
Monetary Fund .  “The board is exploring the possibility of a budget
support loan,” Sibry Tapsoba, the bank’s Egypt representative,
said in a telephone interview today. “No date is confirmed yet.
It can only go ahead if the country concludes its agreement with
the IMF.”  The IMF board is due on Dec. 19 to review a preliminary
agreement it signed with Egypt last month for a $4.8 billion
loan. Loan talks have been prolonged for more than a year amid
political turmoil after the uprising against  Hosni Mubarak .  President Mohamed Mursi said last month the IMF loan is
“necessary.” Government officials have argued it will boost
investor confidence and attract more funds to bridge a widening
budget deficit that the government expects to reach 10.4 percent
of economic output for the fiscal year that ends in June.  Political tensions have risen again since Mursi issued a
decree last month making his decisions immune from judicial
oversight. Five people were killed yesterday in clashes between
pro- and anti-government demonstrators. Foreign Minister Kamel Amr said protests will have no impact on the country’s agreement
with the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
