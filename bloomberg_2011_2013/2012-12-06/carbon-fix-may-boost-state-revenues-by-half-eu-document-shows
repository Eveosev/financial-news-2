European Union government revenue
from carbon permit auctions may increase by an average 51
percent in the three years to 2015 should member states approve
a plan to delay some sales, according to an EU document.  The measure drafted by the European Commission to postpone
selling 900 million allowances until 2019-2020 would boost the
cost of emission permits in the EU market to 10 euros a metric
ton in 2013, compared with a scenario where no volumes are
postponed, according to the document obtained by  Bloomberg News .
 Poland , which opposes the proposed EU strategy, said its own
analysis showed it will cut revenue for some central and east
European countries.  At stake are prices in the world’s biggest cap-and-trade
emissions system after they plunged 76 percent since the
beginning of 2008 as the economic crisis hurt industrial output.
The proposed stopgap measure, known as backloading, would
alleviate oversupply which swelled to almost half of the average
annual pollution limit in the 27-nation EU amid the downturn.  “Backloading is expected to deliver positive fiscal impact
for member states in times of austerity,” Isaac Valero-Ladron,
climate spokesman for the commission, said today by e-mail.
“Fiscal impact is one element considered by member states in
forming positions on back-loading.”  Total Revenue  The price of permits would rise to 11 euros in 2014 and 12
euros in 2015 should backloading enter into force, according to
the note sent by the commission to 27 member states. That would
earn a total 21 billion euros ($27.6 billion), compared with 14
billion euros without backloading. EU carbon permits for
December rose 0.7 percent to 6.19 euros a metric ton at 1:35
p.m. London time.  Total state revenue from auctioning in the 27-nation EU
will rise by 12 percent to 5.1 billion euros in 2013, by 48
percent to 6.8 billion euros in 2014, and 91 percent to 9.3
billion in 2015, assuming that countries approve the delay, the
commission said in the document.  Delaying some sales would boost revenue by 59 percent for
the 19 countries whose power producers won’t get any permits for
free when the next phase of the carbon market starts next month,
according to the EU.  Slower Increase  Six countries in central and eastern  Europe , which won an
exemption in 2008 from the bloc’s requirement that power plants
purchase all their allowances from 2013, would see a slower
increase in revenue. Those countries are  Bulgaria ,  Czech
Republic ,  Estonia ,  Hungary ,  Lithuania  and  Romania . Revenue from
carbon-permit auctioning in two other countries with the
exemption, Poland and Cyprus, would fall should backloading be
implemented, the document showed.  The EU opt-out allows utilities to get for free in 2013
allowances corresponding to 70 percent of their average annual
emissions for the period 2005 to 2007. That number will decrease
gradually each year and in 2020 power plants will have to buy
all their permits at auction or in the market.  The more free permits a country with the exemption
receives, the less backloading increases its revenue from
auctions, the commission said in the document.  “In such cases, it rather increases the implied value of
free allocation,” it said.  A fiscal impact analysis by Poland showed the proposed
measure would cut revenues for countries with opt-out for
auctioning permits to  power plants , according to a government
official. The biggest of the member states who have joined the
EU since 2004 is concerned about the issue and would like to
raise it at the next meeting of ministers, said the official,
who declined to be identified, citing policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
