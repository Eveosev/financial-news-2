Nigerian Treasury yields declined to
the lowest in 14 months after investors bid for more than three
times the total 127.97 billion naira ($814 million) sold.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold 32.488 billion naira of
91-day bills at a yield of 11.95 percent, the Abuja-based
central bank said today in an e-mailed statement, the lowest
since the Sept. 29, 2011 sale. The bank also sold 24.155 billion
naira of 182-day debt at 11.98 percent and 71.326 billion naira
of 364-day bills at 11.98 percent. Bids totaled 391.7 billion
naira, the highest since Sept. 20.  “Local and offshore investors are attracted to the bills
by high yields that are equally positive relative to the
inflation rate,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone.  The regulator held its benchmark interest rate at a record
high of 12 percent to check inflation and stabilize the local
currency, it said Nov. 20. Inflation, which accelerated for the
first time in four months to 11.7 percent in October on
widespread flooding of farms, is still above the bank’s target
of less than 10 percent.  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi lifted a requirement
last year for foreign investors to hold local-currency debt for
at least one year to attract capital. The country’s financial
system has speculative investments valued at about $10 billion,
Governor Lamido Sanusi said at a conference yesterday.  Barclays will add Nigeria to its local-currency government
bond index in March, it said Nov. 6. JPMorgan Chase & Co. added
the West African nation’s bonds to its benchmark emerging-market
index series in October. The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt
due January 2022 fell eight basis points to 12.10 percent,
according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Nigeria also sold 26.447 billion naira of 91-day securities
at a yield of 11.97 percent, 23.152 billion naira of 182-day
debt at 11.98 percent and 42.5 billion naira of 364-day bills at
a 11.98 percent yield to non-competitive bidders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
