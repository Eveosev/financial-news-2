The European Marine Energy Centre,
the U.K.’s testing ground for wave and tidal energy devices in
 Scotland , agreed to help develop a similar site off  Taiwan .  Emec signed a deal with National Taiwan Ocean University,
the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Aquatera Ltd.,
a Scottish environmental services company, the Orkney, northern
Scotland-based center said in a  statement  on its website.  ITRI is developing a wave-energy converter and Taiwan plans
to install 200 megawatts of marine capacity by 2025, according
to the statement. Scotland’s waters are the focus of U.K. marine
energy development and estimated to hold as much as a quarter of
Europe’s tidal resources and a 10th of its wave potential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
