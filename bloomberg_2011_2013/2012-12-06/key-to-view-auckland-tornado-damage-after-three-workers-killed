New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
will today visit parts of Auckland devastated by a tornado that
killed three workmen, injured others and damaged homes in the
nationâ€™s largest city.  Key will be briefed by emergency services staff and meet
representatives of Hawkins Construction, which employed the
three casualties, before viewing the damage in the suburb of
Hobsonville, according to an e-mailed statement. The deaths
occurred at a building site after the tornado struck early
afternoon yesterday, New Zealand Police said in a statement.  As many as 150 homes were damaged by the high-speed winds
that brought down chimneys, wrecked roofs and uprooted trees,
with 250 people sheltering at the nearby Whenuapai Air Force
base, Auckland City Council said in a statement yesterday. Seven
people were treated at a nearby hospital.  Lightning storms and heavy rain elsewhere in the city
disrupted flights and cut power. As many as 1,300 homes were
without electricity late yesterday and 700 had supply restored
by early today,  Vector Ltd. (VCT)  said in a statement. In some areas,
poles and transformers need to be replaced, prolonging the
outage, it said.  Key is also the member of parliament for the area.  To contact the reporters on this story:
