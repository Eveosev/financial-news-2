Eli  Lilly (LLY)  & Co. notified  Canada  it
 plans  to file a trade complaint, claiming court decisions
invalidating one of the company’s patents breach international
obligations.  Companies that produce generic drugs have challenged
Lilly’s patent for Strattera, used for treating attention-
deficit disorder. The Indianapolis-based firm claims recent
decisions by Canadian courts invalidating 17 drug patents over
“utility” requirements have made the country an outlier among
major developed countries.  “All domestic avenues of appeal in Canada have been
exhausted and the only recourse left to Lilly is to seek
arbitration,” the company said in a statement. “Lilly did not
make this decision lightly.”  The Canadian court decision shows the “sharp divergence of
Canadian law from Canada’s international obligations and
internationally accepted standards,” the company said.
Strattera generated $457.5 million in global sales in the first
nine months of the year for Lilly.  Lilly filed a notice that it will seek arbitration under
the terms of the  North American Free Trade Agreement . The
company said it hopes to resolve the dispute “through
consultations and negotiations.”  Last year, Lilly won an appeals court ruling in the U.S.
that overturned a judge’s decision invalidating the Strattera
patent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
