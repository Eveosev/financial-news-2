German  government bonds  were little
changed before European Central Bank policy makers announce the

almost three-week low after a report confirmed the euro area
slipped into a recession in the third quarter. The ECB will keep
its  main refinancing rate  at an all-time low of 0.75 percent,
according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. French 10-year yields fell to a record as the nation
sold 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of securities due between
2018 and 2027.  “From the ECB, we’ll hardly get anything,” said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “We
need to have a sustained improvement in the credit perception of
peripheral markets before we see a sizable shift from bunds,”
he said, referring to region’s most-indebted countries.  The German  10-year yield  was at 1.35 percent at 10:02 a.m.
London time. The rate dropped to 1.33 percent yesterday, the
least since Nov. 19. The price of the 1.5 percent bond due
September 2022 was at 101.33. Two-year notes yielded 0.005
percent.  The central bank will announce the rate decision at 1:45
p.m. in  Frankfurt  before ECB President  Mario Draghi  holds a
press conference 45 minutes later. He will unveil the latest
economic forecasts, including a first projection for 2014.  French Auction  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation single-currency
bloc slipped 0.1 percent from the second quarter, in line with
the median forecast of 40 economists and an initial estimate,
leaving the region back in a recession three years after
emerging from the last one.  France  sold 15-year bonds at an average yield of 2.56
percent, an all-time low. It last sold the securities on Sept. 6
at 2.85 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on French 10-year bonds was one basis point
higher at 2.01 percent, after falling to 1.989 percent, the
least on record. Austrian 10-year rates dropped to 1.727
percent, also a record, before settling at 1.75 percent. The
yield on  Switzerland ’s 10-year bonds dropped to a low of 0.393
percent.  A report today will show German factory orders, adjusted
for seasonal swings and inflation, rose 1 percent in October,

according to the median estimate in another Bloomberg survey.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
