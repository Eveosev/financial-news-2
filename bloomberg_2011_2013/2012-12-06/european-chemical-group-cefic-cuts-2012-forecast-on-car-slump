Cefic, a European chemical
association that represents 29,000 companies, cut its forecast
for 2012 chemical output a second time as a slump in the
automotive and construction industries erode demand.  Chemicals production in  Europe  will shrink 2 percent this
year compared to 2011, the Brussels-based association said in an
e-mailed statement today. In September, Cefic had predicted a
contraction of 1.5 percent and in June it said it expected zero
growth. Cefic also today forecast output expanding 0.5 percent
in 2013.  “The domestic market continues to struggle and overseas
competition remains relentless,” Kurt Bock, president of Cefic
and chief executive officer of  BASF SE (BAS) , said in the statement.
“Policy makers need to continue to work towards putting Europe
on better economic footing to help us move out of this difficult
period.”  Carmaker Daimler AG and voltage-equipment maker Schneider
Electric SA have reduced forecasts as consumers and governments
rein in spending. BASF’s Bock said in September that the
chemical maker’s mid-term profit targets are “challenging.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
