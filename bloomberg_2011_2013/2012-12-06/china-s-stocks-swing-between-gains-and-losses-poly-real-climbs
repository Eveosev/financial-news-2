Chinese stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index failing to extend the biggest one-day rally in
three months, as losses for consumer-staple companies
overshadowed gains for property developers.  Kweichow Moutai Co., the largest maker of baijiu liquor,
slumped for a fifth day, leading a gauge of  consumer-staples 
producers to the steepest retreat among 10 industry groups in
the  CSI 300 Index. (SHSZ300)   Goertek Inc. (002241) , a supplier to Apple Inc.,
dropped 1.8 percent after Apple fell to the most in almost four
years. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second-biggest listed
developer, advanced 1.6 percent after November sales jumped.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,029.24 the close, with two stocks retreating for every one
that gained. It jumped 2.9 percent yesterday as construction
stocks surged after the first meeting by the ruling party under
new leader Xi Jinping signaled increased urban development. The
CSI 300 Index lost 0.2 percent to 2,203.60 today.  “Local investors are more cautious” after yesterday’s
rally, said Xu Shengjun, an analyst at Jianghai Securities Co.
in  Shanghai . “We are not positive on the outlook for stocks. If
there are no concrete reforms by the new leadership, the economy
won’t grow.”  The Shanghai index has fallen 7.7 percent this year, making
it the worst-performing major market in  Asia  amid concern
 China’s economy  will grow at its slowest pace in more than a
decade this year. The measure trades at 11.2 times earnings,
compared with a record low of 10.9 set on Nov. 30, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Growth Outlook  The Chinese government set an economic growth target of 7.5
percent for 2012. Gross domestic product will expand 7.7 percent
this year and accelerate to 8.2 percent in 2013, the Xinhua News
Agency reported yesterday, citing a paper released by the
 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . The economy has reached a
bottom and is stabilizing, the China Securities Journal
reported, citing the head of the State Information Center’s
economic forecasting department, Fan Jianping.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 34 percent
above the 30-day average for this time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at
15.7, compared with this year’s average of 16.9. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  was unchanged today. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  climbed 1.9 percent in  New York .  A gauge of consumer staples in the CSI 300 lost 1.1
percent, the most among 10 industry groups.  Consumer Staples  Kweichow Moutai retreated 1.2 percent to 194 yuan. The
stock dropped on speculation a Hong Kong consumer sent product
samples for testing in the territory, said Liu Wei, an analyst
at Masterlink Securities Corp. Moutai products are “fully in
line” with national standards, said Li Hongfang, spokeswoman
for company.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the second-biggest maker of
the fiery baijou liquor, slid 1.1 percent to 24.76 yuan.  Moutai has fallen 26 percent since reaching a record high
on July 13. Liquor makers have tumbled after the nation’s
quality watchdog found excessive levels of plasticizer in drinks
made by JiuGuiJiu Co.  Goertek retreated 1.8 percent to 38.01  yuan . Apple shares
declined the most in almost four years yesterday on concern that
the company will lose ground in smartphones to Nokia Oyj in
China while giving up market share to Google Inc. in tablets.  Poly Real Estate rose 1.6 percent to 12.27 yuan after
posting a 77 percent gain in sales last month to 8.7 billion
yuan ($1.4 billion). China Vanke Co., which reported this week
that its sales value doubled last month, climbed for a sixth
day, rising 1.4 percent to 9.27 yuan. Gemdale Corp. added 1.4
percent to 5.86 yuan.  Credit Suisse  Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its forecast for Chinese
growth for next year to 8 percent from 7.7 percent, saying that
the new leadership will place a higher priority on structural
changes in areas such as urbanization and corporate tax cuts.  “I doubt we can reach 8 percent economic growth next year
and investors may be more disappointed after the Central
Economic Work Conference,” said Jianghai’s Xu, referring to a
meeting of top leaders possibly later this month that will set
the tone for economic policies in 2013.  Chinese stock investors emptied trading accounts at the
fastest pace in 16 months last week.  The number of Chinese stock accounts containing money
dropped by 205,000 to 55.6 million, the largest decline since
the week ended July 8, 2011, according to regulatory data
compiled by Bloomberg. The number of funded accounts slid to the
lowest level since the week through Nov. 26, 2010, after
reaching a high of 57.28 million in June 2011.  China  is scheduled to release November economic data on
Dec. 9 including inflation and industrial production. A
Bloomberg survey shows that consumer prices quickened to 2.1
percent last month from 1.7 percent in the previous month.
Industrial production may have increased to 9.8 percent,
compared with a 9.6 percent gain in October, the survey showed.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact the reporter on this story:
