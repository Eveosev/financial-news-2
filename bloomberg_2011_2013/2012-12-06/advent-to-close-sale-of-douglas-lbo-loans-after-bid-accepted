Advent International Corp. will next
week close syndication of buyout loans backing its acquisition
of  Douglas Holding AG (DOU) , a German beauty retailer.  Lenders have until Dec. 14 to commit to the 830 million
euros ($1.1 billion) of senior-ranking loans backing the deal,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who asked
not to be named because the terms are private. The debt includes
a 450 million-euro seven-year TLB facility thatâ€™s expected to
price at about 99 cents on the euro, the people said.  Advent  said  Dec. 4 it had received acceptances from
shareholders owning 76 percent of the Hagen, Germany-based
company, more than the 75 percent required for the bid to
succeed.  The senior financing also includes a 200 million-euro term
loan A and a 180 million-euro  credit line , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. There is a 200 million-euro lower-ranking
mezzanine portion, the data show. Banks arranging the senior
debt are  Bayerische Landesbank , Commerzbank AG, Credit Suisse
Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., IKB Deutsche Industriebank
AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., LBBW, Raiffeisen Bank International AG
and UniCredit SpA, Advent said Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
