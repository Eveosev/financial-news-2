Chile ’s peso advanced to a two-week
high after a report showed the nation’s economy grew in October
faster than forecast.  The peso gained for a third day, appreciating 0.5 percent
to 477.10 per dollar at the close in Santiago, the strongest
since Nov. 22. Futures on copper, Chile’s biggest export, fell
0.7 percent after closing yesterday at a six-week high.  “Investment funds are betting heavily on the peso given
the country’s growth outlook,” Francisco Schneider, the head of
 currency trading  at Celfin Capital SA, said by phone from
Santiago. “There’s still space for the peso to continue
appreciating.”  Economic activity grew 6.7 percent in October from a year
earlier, the central bank reported yesterday. The median
forecast of 16 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 6.2
percent expansion.  The currency has also gained as a widening current account
deficit encouraged speculation that the central bank will
increase the target lending rate to cool spending.  To contact the reporters on this story:
