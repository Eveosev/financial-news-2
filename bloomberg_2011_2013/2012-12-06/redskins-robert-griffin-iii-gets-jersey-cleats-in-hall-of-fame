Washington Redskins quarterback
Robert Griffin III has run his way to a place at the Pro
Football Hall of Fame as a National Football League rookie.  Griffin gave his  game-worn jersey  and cleats to a
representative from the Canton, Ohio-based Hall of Fame
yesterday, two days after breaking Cam Newton’s single-season
rookie record for rushing yards by a quarterback. He ran for 72
yards on five carries in the Redskins’ 17-16 win over the  New
York  Giants on Dec. 3, giving him 714 rushing yards on the
season.  Griffin, the second pick in this year’s NFL draft after
winning the Heisman Trophy as college football’s best player,
has helped lead the Redskins to three straight wins and into
playoff contention at 6-6.  “Everyone wants to be in the  Hall of Fame , so we’re in
there,” Griffin III told reporters yesterday. “But I’ve got a
long career, preferably, and this is only the first step. It’s
an honor to have my jersey and my cleats -- when they are very
dirty -- in the Hall of Fame.”  Newton rushed for 706 yards last year, when he also set a
rookie record with 4,051 passing yards.  Michael Vick  holds the
NFL record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a season, with
1,039 in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
