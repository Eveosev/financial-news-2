German 10-year bunds extended an
advance, pushing the yield on the securities to the lowest in
more than three months, after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said policy makers had a “wide discussion” on
 interest rates  before a policy decision today.  The 10-year rate dropped as much as four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.31 percent, the lowest since Aug.
31. It was at 1.315 percent as of 2:01 p.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
