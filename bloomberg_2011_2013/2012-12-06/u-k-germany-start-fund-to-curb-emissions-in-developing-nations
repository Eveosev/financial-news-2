Germany  and the U.K. started a 70
million-euro ($90.8 million) fund to finance projects in
 developing countries  that cut emissions and curb climate change.  The  Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions  facility, or
Nama, will support projects or policies that help reduce
emissions from technologies or industries, Britain’s Department
of Energy and Climate Change said in a  statement  on its website.  The first project to benefit is a Mexican government
program to build sustainable housing, today’s statement shows.
The financing facility will provide grant funding and loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
