University of Wisconsin  Athletic
Director Barry Alvarez will return to the sideline as interim
coach for the  Rose Bowl  in place of Bret Bielema, who left the
school for the University of Arkansas.  Alvarez, 65, spent 16 seasons as the Badgers’ coach,
winning a school-record 118 games and three Big Ten
championships from 1990 through 2005. A 2009 inductee into the
Rose Bowl Hall of Fame, Alvarez in 1999-2000 became the only Big
Ten coach to win the postseason game in consecutive years.  Alvarez, who had an 8-3 record in bowl games at Wisconsin,
has been the school’s athletic director for the past nine years.
The Badgers (8-5) will make their third straight Rose Bowl
appearance on Jan. 1, when they meet  Stanford University  in
Pasadena, California.  Bielema, who had a 68-24 record over seven seasons at
Wisconsin, accepted the Arkansas coaching job two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
