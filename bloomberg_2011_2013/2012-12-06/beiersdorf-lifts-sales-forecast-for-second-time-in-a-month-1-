Beiersdorf AG (BEI)  raised its full-year
sales forecast for the second time in little more than a month
as the maker of Nivea skin cream said revenue at its consumer
business would grow more quickly than anticipated.  Sales will rise “well over” 4 percent this year, the
Hamburg-based company said today, pushing its  shares  to the
highest closing price in at least 16 years. Beiersdorf had been
predicting growth of about 3 percent until Nov. 2, when it
increased the forecast to between 3 percent and 4 percent.  Revenue at the consumer business will also advance by more
than 4 percent, the company said today. Chief Executive Officer
Stefan Heidenreich, said in November he was happy with the
product pipeline for 2013. The company, which also sells the
Eucerin and La Prairie brands, is focusing on six categories:
body, face, sun, men, shower products and deodorants.  “Beiersdorf has faced strong growth in all regions in its
consumer division in the current quarter,” Thomas Maul, an
analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt , wrote in an e-mailed note.
“We expect consensus earnings to be revised upwards.”  Beiersdorf  rose  2 percent to 61.73 euros in Frankfurt
trading, the highest closing price since at least January 1996.
The stock has gained 41 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
