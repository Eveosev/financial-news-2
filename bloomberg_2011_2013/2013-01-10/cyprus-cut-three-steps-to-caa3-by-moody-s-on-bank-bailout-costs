Cyprus’s credit rating was cut three
steps to Caa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, citing the
government’s projected increased debt load from the need to
recapitalize its banking system.  Nonperforming loans at the nation’s three largest banks
rose to 26 percent in September from 19 percent in March, New
York-based Moody’s said today in a statement. Recapitalizing
those institutions may cost of about 10 billion euros ($13.3
billion), Moody’s said.  “As a result of the increased debt burden, we think
there’s a higher likelihood that the Cypriot government may
default outright or press for a distressed exchange,” Sarah Carlson, a senior credit officer at Moody’s in  London , said in a
telephone interview. “It’s important to note that our base-case
scenario does not assume that this will happen in 2013.”  Cyprus’s debt to gross-domestic-product ratio may rise to
150 percent this year, Moody’s said. The rating company’s
negative outlook reflects “uncertainty” around the
finalization of the memorandum of understanding between the
European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary
Fund, known as the troika, with Cyprus.  “It’s fair to say that our base-case assumption is that
this MOU will be finalized, that the funds will be dispersed,
that Cyprus will receive assistance until at least 2016,”
Carlson said. “But there is still this lingering uncertainty
about this whole process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
