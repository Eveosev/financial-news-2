Princeton University faculty members
have asked that the school divest any holdings of gun companies
from its endowment, in the aftermath of the shootings last month
in Newtown,  Connecticut .  It isn’t clear that the Ivy League school’s endowment,
valued at $17 billion as of June 2012, even owns such companies.
Princeton doesn’t discuss specifics of its fund’s portfolio,
Martin Mbugua, a spokesman for the school in Princeton,  New
Jersey , said in an interview.  Princeton received a petition on Jan. 7, Mbugua said. The
Daily Princetonian student newspaper reported on Jan. 6 that
three professors, Simon Morrison, Caryl Emerson and Marie-Helene
Huet co-wrote the petition. The professors didn’t immediately
respond to e-mails and phone messages seeking comment.  Princeton’s policy since 1970 is to consider divestment
requests through the university resources committee, Mbugua
said.  The group met today, and there was no substantive
discussion of the petition, Mbugua said in an e-mail.  It will
be on the agenda for the next committee meeting in February.  The school’s  endowment  was the fourth largest in higher
education in the year ended June 2011, according to a survey by
the National Association of College and University Business
Officers and Commonfund Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
