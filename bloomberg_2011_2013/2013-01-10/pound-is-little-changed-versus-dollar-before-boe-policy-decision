The pound was little changed against
the dollar before Bank of England policy makers announce the
result of their monthly meeting.  Sterling was also little changed versus the euro as the
National Statistician said the U.K. should maintain its current
approach to calculating its  retail price index . The Monetary
Policy Committee will keep the benchmark interest rate at a
 record-low  0.5 percent and the asset-purchase  target  at 375
billion pounds ($601 billion), separate Bloomberg News surveys
show, before the decision is announced at noon in London.  The pound traded at $1.6027 at 7:54 a.m. London time. It
fell to $1.5993 yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 30. Sterling
was at 81.54 pence per euro, after depreciating to 81.63 pence
yesterday, the weakest since Dec. 31.  The statistics office will develop a new inflation index
known as RPIJ to address an issue with the measurement of
clothing prices in the RPI, the Office for National Statistics
said in  London  today.  The pound has fallen 0.6 percent in the past week, the
second-worst performer of 10 developed-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen dropped 1.4
percent, while dollar and the euro were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
