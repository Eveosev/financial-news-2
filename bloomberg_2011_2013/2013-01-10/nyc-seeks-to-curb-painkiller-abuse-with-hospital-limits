New York City  is seeking to curb
abuse of potentially addictive and deadly painkillers such as
Oxycontin and Vicodin with new limits on how widely the drugs
should be prescribed.  Emergency departments at New York’s public hospitals will
only prescribe a three-day supply of opioid painkillers, won’t
refill lost or stolen prescriptions and shouldn’t prescribe
long-acting versions of the drugs, according to voluntary
 guidelines  the city issued today.  The move is aimed at reducing abuse and overdoses, the city
said. The number of emergency room visits in New York related to
painkillers almost tripled in 2010 from 2004 to 143 visits for
every 100,000 people, the city said. The use of painkillers
without a medical need in the U.S. increased 75 percent in 2010
from 2002, the Archives of  Internal Medicine  reported. More than
15,500 people overdosed on the pills and died in 2009, more than
double since 2002, the study found.  “Abuse of prescription painkillers in our city has
increased alarmingly in recent years,” Mayor  Michael R. Bloomberg  said. “We talk about other problems, we talk about
narcotics but this is one of the things growing much more
rapidly.” The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP.  Prescriptions for opioid painkillers filled by  New Yorkers 
increased 22 percent over two years to 2 million in 2010 with
prescriptions for Oxycodone increasing by about 50 percent, the
city said in a May report. About 50 percent of prescriptions
were written by just 14 percent of doctors, nurses and dentists.  Today’s guidelines are part of a report from the Mayor’s
 Task Force  on Prescription Painkiller Abuse and will be used in
all of New York’s public hospitals, such as Bellevue Hospital
Center and Harlem Hospital Center in  Manhattan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
