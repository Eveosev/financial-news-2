Cia. Hering (HGTX3) ,  Brazil ’s third-biggest
apparel retailer by market value, fell to its lowest level in
five months as sales retreated in the fourth quarter.  Hering slumped 9.4 percent to 39.45 reais at 12:49 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest since July
26. The benchmark  Bovespa index  rose 0.2 percent.  Sales at stores open at least a year dropped 0.2 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2012 from a year earlier, Hering said in a
regulatory filing late yesterday.  “The slightly negative sales at same stores are
disappointing,” Juliana Rozenbaum, an analyst at the investment
bank Itau BBA, wrote in a note to clients published yesterday.
“According to management, both same-store sales and sales to
multi-brand stores were below expectations due to a combination
of mild demand and limited product availability, because the
company was unable to increase production enough to meet
Christmas demand.”  Hering’s total sales grew 11 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, according to yesterday’s filing, in which
the company said its performance has improved “but is still
below potential.” Earnings will be released Feb. 21.  Hering gained 29 percent in 2012, compared with the
Bovespa’s 7.4 advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
