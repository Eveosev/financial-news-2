The yen slid to the weakest since
June 2010 versus the dollar after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s government said it will spend 10.3 trillion yen ($116
billion) in new stimulus efforts that may weaken the currency.  The euro climbed after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist
 Thomas Stolper  wrote in a note that the shared currency may rise
to a 14-month high. The yen declined for a ninth week, the
longest losing streak since 1989, on bets the  Bank of Japan (8301)  is
also preparing measures to spur growth.  South Korea ’s won gained
to the strongest level against the dollar since August 2011
after the central bank kept  interest rates  unchanged.  “Abe announced fiscal stimulus in  Japan , which is what
sent the yen lower against the dollar,”  Richard Franulovich , a
senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  New York ,
said in a telephone interview. “We were expecting some sort of
fiscal program, and they basically put some flesh on the bone.”  The yen fell 0.5 percent to 89.18 per dollar at 5 p.m. in
New York and reached 89.45, the weakest level since June 28,
2010. The Japanese currency depreciated 1 percent to 119.01 per
euro and touched 119.35, the least since May 2011. The euro
climbed as much as 0.7 percent to $1.3366, the highest since
April 3, before trading at $1.3343, up 0.5 percent.  The won strengthened 0.5 percent to 1,054.69 per dollar
after the  Bank of Korea  held its seven-day repurchase rate at
2.75 percent.  Net Shorts  Futures traders decreased their bets that the yen will
decline against the  U.S. dollar  for a fourth-straight week,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge
funds  and other large speculators on a decline in the yen
compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was
74,096 on Jan. 8, versus net shorts of 80,517 a week earlier.  Large speculators reversed their wagers that the euro will
advance against the greenback after switching to that position a
week earlier for the first time since August 2011. There were
8,035 net shorts on the euro on Jan. 8, versus net longs of
5,126 a week earlier.  The  Dollar Index  closed at 79.548, the lowest since Dec. 21
on a closing basis, after the  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly
widened in November. The gap swelled 15.8 percent to $48.7
billion, the largest since April, Commerce Department data
showed. A Bloomberg survey forecast a $41.3 billion shortfall.  ‘Eventually Turn’  “We’re betting the  U.S. economy  will eventually turn the
boat,”  Sebastien Galy , senior foreign-exchange strategist at
 Societe Generale  SA in New York, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch Money” with Sara Eisen. “Then
you see yields going higher, the dollar going higher.”  Japan’s government will spend about 3.8 trillion yen on
disaster prevention and reconstruction, and 3.1 trillion yen on
stimulating private investment and other measures, the Cabinet
Office said in a statement.  The Bank of Japan is set to adopt the 2 percent inflation
target advocated by Abe, doubling its existing goal of 1
percent, without setting a deadline for achieving it, according
to people familiar with discussions within the central bank.
They requested anonymity because the talks are private. The BOJ
meets on Jan. 21-22.  “We needed to see further news flow to maintain the
weakness in the yen, and we’ve seen that,” said  Jeremy Stretch ,
head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in London. “The BOJ are signing up to the government’s
policy stance. For now, everyone is getting on to this train,
and the question now is how far the yen can weaken.”  Relative Strength  The Japanese currency’s 14-day relative strength index
versus the greenback was 22 today, its third day below the level
of 30, which some traders see as a signal an asset has weakened
too quickly and may be due to reverse course.  The yen’s 2.1 percent drop this week was the biggest among
10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The dollar lost 0.9 percent, while the euro
rose 1.5 percent.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose 0.3 percent
this week to 118.62 and reached 118.73 today, the highest level
since September 2011.  China, the top destination for exports from South Korea,
Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, said yesterday that imports
gained 6 percent in December, the fastest growth in six months.
Exports climbed 14 percent, the most since May.  Improved Sentiment  “Sentiment toward China has improved,” said  Adam Cole ,
global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada
in London. “That’s helping the Asian currencies.”  South Africa’s rand slid versus the dollar a day after
 Fitch Ratings  cut the nation’s credit rating because of slowing
economic growth, a widening budget deficit and rising
unemployment. It weakened 0.8 percent to 8.72 to the dollar.  Australia’s dollar weakened versus the greenback as its
failure to break through resistance at $1.06 signaled gains in
the currency may have been too rapid. The Aussie fell 0.6
percent to $1.0537 after being unable to exceed $1.0599, the
highest since Sept. 14, for a second straight day. Resistance is
a level on a chart where sell orders may be clustered.  The euro rose for the week versus all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts. Goldman’s Stolper, who’s based in London,
recommended investors should bet the currency will strengthen to
$1.37, the highest level since Nov. 14, 2011.  German  government bonds  fell, pushing yields up, as
investors bought higher-yielding sovereign debt. Ten-year bund
yields reached 1.61 percent, the highest level since Oct. 25.
Italian 10-year yields touched 4.09 percent, the lowest since
November 2010.  ECB Outlook  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
the region’s economy should regain momentum and policy makers
left the main refinancing rate at a record low of 0.75 percent.  “That’s great news, and that’s great news for the euro --
$1.35 is a reasonable level to look for,” Societe Generale’s
Galy said.  The Swiss franc slid to the weakest in more than a year
versus the euro after data showed  consumer prices  extended their
longest slump in at least four decades. The nation’s central
bank imposed a ceiling for the franc of 1.20 versus the euro in
September 2011 to combat the threat of deflation.  The franc lost as much as 0.6 percent to 1.2201 per euro,
the weakest since December 2011, before trading at 1.2188, down
0.5 percent. The Swiss currency was little changed at 91.35
centimes per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
