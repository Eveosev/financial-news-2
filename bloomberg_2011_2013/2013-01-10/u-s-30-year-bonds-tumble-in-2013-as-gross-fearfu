Thirty-year Treasuries fell,
extending a January decline that almost wiped out 2012’s gain,
as signs of strengthening economic growth renewed inflation
concern before the first auction of the securities this year.  Benchmark  10-year notes  fell for first time in five days as
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the euro-area
economy will slowly recover this year and inventories at U.S.
wholesalers rose more than forecast. A report earlier showed
 China ’s exports rose, fueling demand for riskier assets. U.S.
30-year bonds have handed investors a 2.3 percent loss in
January after returning 2.5 percent last year, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes show.  “People are more optimistic,” said Ira Jersey, an
interest-rate strategist in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG,
one of 21 primary dealers obligated to bid at U.S. government-
debt auctions. “The data is not great, but it’s OK. Yields are
a little bit too low. There’s scope for breaking 2.1 percent in
the not too distant future. The auction with this back-up should
go OK.”  Thirty-year  yields  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.08 percent at 11:18 a.m.  New York  time,
based on Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.75 percent security
due November 2042 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount,
to 93 20/32.  The yield on benchmark 10-year notes rose three basis
points to 1.89 percent. The yield last week jumped  20 basis
points , touching 1.97 percent on Jan. 4, the highest since April
26.  Bond Sale  The yield on the 30-year bond is forecast to rise to 3.3
percent by year-end, according to the median estimates of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The 10-year note is
forecast to increase to 2.2 percent.  The 30-year bond scheduled for sale today yielded 3.10
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.92 percent at
the last offering on Dec. 13. The record auction low of 2.58
percent was set in July. Investors  bid  for 2.5 times the amount
of the securities allotted last month.  “We’re pricing in a concession for the long bond
reopening,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We could see a
temporary push higher in yields but ultimately that will prove a
buying opportunity.”  The Treasury sold $32 billion of three-year notes on Jan. 8
and $21 billion of 10-year securities yesterday.  Inflation Outlook  Thirty-year bonds are among the securities most sensitive
to consumer prices because of their long maturity, as inflation
would erode the return on the bonds’ fixed payments for their
duration.  The Fed for the first time in December linked the outlook
for its main interest rate to unemployment and inflation
targets. The central bank said the rate would stay close to zero
“at least as long” as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent
and inflation projections are for no more than 2.5 percent.  The central bank’s preferred  measure  of inflation
expectations, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
was 2.87 percent today, compared with a 2012 average of 2.6
percent. The gauge projects the expected pace of consumer price
increases from 2018 to 2023.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, was 2.53 percentage points. The average over the past
decade was 2.19 percentage points.  ‘Upward Drift’  Treasuries of all maturities have handed investors a 0.5
percent loss this year, the Bank of America data show. The  MSCI
All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks rallied 2.1 percent including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s  exports  increased 14.1 percent in December from a
year earlier, the most since May, government figures showed.
Imports grew 6 percent after being unchanged the previous month.  The 0.6 percent increase in wholesale stockpiles followed a
0.3 percent rise in October that was less than initially
estimated, the Commerce Department said today in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2 percent
gain. Sales jumped 2.3 percent, the most since March 2011, as
auto demand rebounded from a Hurricane Sandy-related drop.  Treasury yields remained higher today as the ECB’s Draghi
said the euro-area economy will slowly recover this year as the
region’s bond markets stabilize after three years of turmoil.  “A gradual recovery should start” later this year as ECB
measures work their way through the economy, Draghi said at a
press conference in  Frankfurt  today after policy makers kept
their benchmark interest rate at 0.75 percent.  The Fed purchased $3.162 billion in Treasury securities
today maturing between February 2020 and November 2022 as part
its monthly purchases of $85 billion of government and mortgage
debt to spur the economy by putting downward pressure on
 interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
