The pound may fall 1.4 percent
versus the dollar after it traded below a so-called support
level, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  The U.K. currency breached $1.6027, the six-month trendline
drawn from the Nov. 15 low at $1.5830, leaving it exposed to
further selling, Karen Jones, the London-based head of foreign-
exchange, fixed-income and commodities technical analysis, said
in a telephone interview, citing third-party data.  “This has left the $1.5951 seven-month uptrend exposed and
failure here will target the November low,” Jones wrote today
in a report e-mailed to clients. She added “$1.5863/38 is also
the location of the 55- and 200-week moving averages and failure
here will be regarded as key.”  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.6053 at noon London
time after falling as much as 0.1 percent to $1.6005.  The British currency would face greater selling pressure if
it closed below the six-month trendline, she said.  Jones recommended selling the pound at $1.6068 and would
close the position at a profit if it fell to $1.5850.  Support refers to an area on a yield graph where analysts
expect sell orders may be grouped.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
