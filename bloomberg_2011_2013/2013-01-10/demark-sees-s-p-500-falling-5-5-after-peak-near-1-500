The two-month rally in U.S. stocks
will end as the advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
toward 1,500 depletes buyers, according to Tom DeMark, the
creator of indicators to show turning points in securities.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities will climb to an
intraday high of 1,492.73 and form a sell signal on a daily
Combo indicator, which is designed to identify market tops and
bottoms, said DeMark, who has spent more than 40 years
developing market-timing indicators. The  S&P 500  will then fall
at least 5.5 percent, he said.  “This high could occur as early as tomorrow,” DeMark
wrote in an e-mail. “1,492.73 is just shy of psychological
1,500 as most traders are predisposed to look at markets in
terms of round numbers and will expect 1,500 to be hit. And just
to confound them, expect market to trade not quite to 1,500.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 8.8 percent from its November low
as the  Federal Reserve  expanded its bond purchase program to
boost the economy and lawmakers passed a bill averting most of
the more than $600 billion of spending cuts and tax increases
known as the fiscal cliff. The index rose 0.8 percent to
1,472.12 at 4 p.m.  New York  time today, reaching the highest
closing level since December 2007.  An advance to 1,492.73 would push the S&P 500 above a four-
year intraday high of 1,474.51 reached Sept. 14 and help the
index complete a “13 countdown” on the Combo chart, according
to DeMark. DeMark’s “countdown” study involves comparing a
security’s closing price to its highest or lowest levels two
days earlier, with cycles of “exhaustion” forming when a
pattern continues 13 times.  ‘Solo Move’  DeMark, an adviser to  Steven A. Cohen ’s SAC Capital
Advisors LP, predicted that the S&P 500’s retreat in 2011 would
stop at 1,076. The index bottomed at 1,074.77 on Oct. 4, 2011.
His Oct. 24 call for the S&P 500 to make a “solo move” and
rally 5 percent to about 1,480 around the presidential elections
didn’t come true.  On Dec. 4, he said the Shanghai Composite Index’s decline
below 1,960 signaled selling has climaxed. The Chinese equity
gauge has jumped 16 percent since.  DeMark provided consulting to hedge funds including  George
Soros ’s Soros Fund Management LLC and  Leon Cooperman ’s Omega
Advisors Inc. Market Studies makes money by charging traders for
access to its indicators. It also sells subscriptions to the
indicators on the Bloomberg Professional service for $500 a
month. Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , takes a
percentage. DeMark has a similar arrangement with Thomson
Reuters Corp. DeMark won’t say how many subscribers he has.  To contact the reporter on this story:
