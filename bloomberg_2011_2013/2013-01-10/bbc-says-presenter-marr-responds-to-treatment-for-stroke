Andrew Marr, a British Broadcasting
Corp. presenter and former editor of The Independent newspaper,
is responding to treatment in the hospital after suffering a
stroke earlier this week.  The Andrew Marr show and  BBC  Radio 4’s “Start the Week”
program will be staffed with guest presenters in Marr’s absence,
the London-based BBC said in a  statement . Marr fell ill on Jan.
8 and was taken to a hospital, where it was determined he had a
stroke, the broadcaster said.  The 53-year-old began his journalism career at The Scotsman
newspaper and helped start The Independent in 1986, eventually
becoming its editor. He joined the BBC as political editor in
2000.  Marr is married with three children and has been a long-
distance runner since he was a schoolboy, according to The
Telegraph newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
