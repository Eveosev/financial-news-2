Coffee exports from  Brazil , the
world’s largest grower of the bean, are expected to rebound from
last year’s 16 percent decline, the country’s association of
coffee exporters said.  Brazil is expected to export as much as 31 million bags of
coffee this year, a 9.5 percent increase compared with the 28.3
million bags recorded in 2012, the association known as Cecafe
said in an e-mailed report today.  Last year’s result was a 16 percent decline from the
previous year. Rain volumes that delayed coffee harvest and
shipping played “a major” part in the reduction of foreign
sales last year, Cecafe said in the report.  Cecafe estimates that coffee export revenue will rise to $7
billion this year, up 11 percent from 2012, because of bigger
export volume and a “moderate rise in coffee prices,”
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
