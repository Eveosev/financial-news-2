Japan  Exchange Group Inc., the
bourse formed this month from the merger of the country’s
biggest venues, signed a memorandum of understanding with
 Turkey ’s bourse that paves the way for Islamic financial
products to be traded in Japan.  The deal would be the 38th tie-up between the country’s
biggest bourses and overseas markets, the Japan Exchange said in
a statement. It also agreed with the National Stock Exchange of
 India  to give Japanese investors access to Indian derivatives
under the terms of a  previous  agreement.  Shares of Japan Exchange accelerated gains after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the outline of the deals earlier today,
closing 4.2 percent higher at 4,090 yen. The bourse was formed
Jan. 1 from the combination of Tokyo Stock Exchange Group Inc.
and Osaka Securities Exchange Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
