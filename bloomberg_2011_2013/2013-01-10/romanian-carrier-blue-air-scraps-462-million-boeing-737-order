Romanian discount carrier Blue Air-
Transport Aerian SA said it scrapped an order for five  Boeing
Co. (BA)  737 jets with a list price of $462 million after sister
company and investor Romstrade encountered financial problems.  The contracts, placed in 2008, were for two 737-800s and
three 737-900ERs for delivery in 2015 and 2016, Blue Air Deputy
General Manager Adrian Ionascu told  Bloomberg News .  “The decision was based on the current financial situation
of Romstrade, part of the same group of companies as Blue Air,
and on Blue Air’s incapacity to pay liabilities stipulated in
the contract with Boeing,” Ionascu said in an e-mail.  A Romanian court in the southern town of Giurgiu declared
road builder Romstrade insolvent last month, according to the
court’s website. Both companies are owned by Nelu Iordache, who
has been detained in a probe into the whereabouts of European
Union funds, Blue Air Marketing Director Mirela Secan said.  Blue Air needs modern planes to reduce fuel burn and help
it contend with Budapest-based discount rival Wizz Air Ltd.,
which has the “scale and ability to compete very aggressively,”
said  John Strickland , director of JLS Consulting in  London .  The carrier’s fleet currently consists of nine Boeing 737-
300s, -400s and -500s, a series that debuted in 1984, compared
with service entry in 1998 for the -800 and 2007 for the -900ER.  Blue Air’s cancellation was reflected in Boeing order data
for December, published last week. The decision won’t impact
flights, which are operating to schedule, Ionascu said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
