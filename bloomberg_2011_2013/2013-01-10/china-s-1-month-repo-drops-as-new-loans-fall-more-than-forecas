China ’s money-market rate dropped
for a seventh day, the longest run of declines since May, after
data showed local-currency loans fell more than economists
forecast last month.  New  lending  was 454.3 billion  yuan  ($73 billion), according
to the People’s Bank of China, compared with the median estimate
of 550 billion yuan in a Bloomberg News survey of 37 analysts
and December 2011’s 640.5 billion yuan. The central bank offered
15 billion yuan of seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements today
at a yield of 3.35 percent and 40 billion yuan of 14-day
contracts at 3.45 percent, it said in a statement on its website.  “The lending data has contributed to the downward trend,”
said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. “The smaller amount of new loans that are
extended, the less cash banks are forced to put aside as
required reserves, which leaves more funds in the interbank
market and pressures money-market rates down.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability in the banking system, fell seven basis points to
2.92 percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  China’s exports rose 14.1 percent in December from a year
earlier, while imports climbed 6 percent, leaving a trade
surplus of $31.6 billion, the customs administration reported
today in Beijing. The pickup in shipments compares with the 5
percent median estimate of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey and a 2.9 percent increase the previous month.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to receive
the seven-day repo rate, rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.38 percent in  Shanghai , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
