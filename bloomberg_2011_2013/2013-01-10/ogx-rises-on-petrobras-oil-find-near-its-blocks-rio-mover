OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA ,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , rose
after Brazil’s state-run oil producer found crude near OGX’s
offshore properties in the Espirito Santo basin.  OGX, as the Rio de Janeiro-based explorer is known, added 5
percent to 5.06 reais at 12:22 p.m. in Sao Paulo after climbing
as much as 6.2 percent, the biggest increase since Jan. 4. It
was the biggest gainer in Brazil’s benchmark index.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the world’s biggest producer in
deep waters, found high-quality oil and natural gas at a well in
Espirito Santo basin that is near four of OGX’s exploration
blocks, Petrobras said after the market closed yesterday.
Petrobras, also based in Rio, found a 200 meter (656 feet) layer
of oil and gas, it said in a filing.  OGX has risen 16 percent this month after the start of
production at its third oil well encouraged investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
