Japan’s ruling  Liberal Democratic
Party  said it may review tax breaks for  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  after
the carrier returned to the stock market with a 663 billion-yen
($7.5 billion) initial public offer.  “Is it OK for a company to give priority to dividends and
be able to pay them while it isn’t paying taxes?,” Takeshi Noda, head of the LDP’s tax panel, told reporters in  Tokyo 
today. “We will continue to study the situation and decide how
we should act.”  Japan Air’s profit got a 35 billion-yen boost from tax
breaks in the year ended in March, according to a transport
ministry paper. The carrier may not have to pay tax for as long
as nine years under existing regulations because of credits
earned against writedowns, including ones made while in
bankruptcy protection, the LDP said in June.  Shares of the carrier  fell  4.1 percent, the most since
Sept. 25, to 3,610 yen at close of Tokyo trading. Japan Air has
dropped 4.7 percent since it sold stock at 3,790 yen apiece in
its September IPO.  Japan Air wasn’t immediately available to comment on the
LDP statement.  Kyodo News  earlier today reported Noda’s
comments.  In November, Japan Air raised its profit  forecast  7.7
percent to 140 billion yen for the current fiscal year as it
aims to lower costs by 20 billion yen. The carrier cut its sales
forecast by 5 billion yen to 1.215 trillion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
