Spanish lenders would benefit from a
reduction in funding costs were the central bank to limit yields
offered on consumer deposits, an analyst at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said.  News organizations including El Confidencial and Expansion
have reported that the  Bank of Spain  may force lenders to set
aside capital if they pay above certain deposit pricing
thresholds. A spokesman for the Bank of  Spain  declined to
comment on the reports when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  A surge in the cost of wholesale funding as the European
financial crisis deepened last year left banks more reliant on
funding from consumer deposits, spurring competition to capture
customers’ savings. The potential cap on yields “is good for
the sector” because it will allow lenders to benefit from more
“normalized” retail funding costs, Sergio Gamez, a London-
based analyst at BoAML said in a report published today.  The rule lowering rates on deposits could potentially lift
estimated 2014 net interest income for  Banco Sabadell SA (SAB) ,
Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, by 244 million euros ($319.7
million), or 12 percent, and  Bankia SA (BKIA) ’s by 254 million euros,
or 10 percent, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
