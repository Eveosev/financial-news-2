A group led by Cerberus Capital
Management LP is close to announcing a deal to buy 5 retail
store brands from  Supervalu Inc. (SVU)  in a transaction valued at $3.2
billion, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Most of that will be financed with debt, said the person,
who asked not to be named because the process is private.
Separately the group is offering $3.50 to $4 a share for up to a
30 percent stake in Supervalu, according to that person.  Representatives at Supervalu and Cerberus didnâ€™t
immediately return calls seeking comment.  In July, Supervalu said it was working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Greenhill & Co. to examine options. During the
sale process, the company attracted interest in parts of its
business from billionaire Ronald Burkle, as well as private-
equity firms KKR & Co. and TPG Capital, people with knowledge 
of the matter have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
