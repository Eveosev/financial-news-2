Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) 
sold $2 billion of dollar-denominated debt as Japan’s second-
largest bank seeks to expand lending abroad.  The bank’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. unit issued $500
million of 3 percent, 10-year bonds that yield 117 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $750 million portions
of 0.9 percent, three-year notes at a 58 basis-point spread and
1.5 percent, five-year securities at 77, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  President  Koichi Miyata  said in a Dec. 19 interview that
dollar-denominated debt issuance by the company’s lending unit
may reach $4.5 billion this year. The bank is increasing lending
overseas as deflation and economic contraction damp credit
demand and loan profitability at home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
