Former Hochfeld Capital Management
manager Berton Hochfeld pleaded guilty to  securities fraud  and
wire fraud charges related to an investment scheme, U.S.
prosecutors said.  Hochfeld, 66, who managed the $6 million Hepplewhite Fund,
admitted in a hearing yesterday before U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty that he stole more than $1 million from investors,
according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in  Manhattan .  Prosecutors said Hochfeld withdrew the money from the fund
for his personal use. The fundâ€™s value was falsely inflated in
monthly statements Hochfeld provided to its investors to conceal
his withdrawals, they said. He told investors at a meeting in
October that he spent the money on antiques and vacations,
according to the government.  As part of a plea agreement, Hochfeld agreed to forfeit the
money he stole and to pay restitution to his victims. He is
scheduled to be sentenced June 27.  The case is U.S. v. Hochfeld, 12-mj-02897, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
