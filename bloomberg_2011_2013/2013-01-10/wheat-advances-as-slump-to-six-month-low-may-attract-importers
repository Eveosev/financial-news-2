Wheat climbed for the first time in
three days on speculation that importers such as  Egypt  will take
advantage of the decline in prices this month. Corn gained on
dwindling supplies from the U.S., the biggest exporter.  Wheat for March delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$7.5125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$7.5025 by 11:16 a.m. Singapore time. Futures lost 3.6 percent
this month and reached $7.3975 on Jan. 4, the cheapest level
since June 27.  Egypt, the world’s biggest importer, is seeking to buy at
least 60,000 metric tons at a tender today, Nomani Nomani, the
vice chairman of the state-run  General Authority  for Supply
Commodities, said yesterday. Corn supplies in the U.S. probably
fell 15 percent to 208.8 million tons as of Dec. 1, the smallest
post-harvest stockpile since 2003, according to the average
estimate of 26 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “We may see greater demand for U.S. supplies because
prices have fallen significantly from its highs and are bullish
short-term for wheat,” Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte, wrote in a report today. “The market seem to favor long
positions ahead of the key January WASDE report, reflecting
sentiments for a reduction in U.S. corn ending stocks,” she
said, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s world
supply-and-demand estimates due tomorrow.  Corn for March delivery climbed as much as 0.6 percent to
$6.9825 a bushel before trading at $6.9775. Soybeans for
delivery in the same month rose 0.2 percent to $13.8825 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
