Galena Asset Management Ltd., a unit
of commodities trader Trafigura Beheer BV, raised $275 million
for its Private Equity Resource Fund to invest in metals and
mining companies.  The fund aims to have $600 million in assets by December
and at that level it would be closed to new investment, Jeremy Weir, Galena’s chief executive officer, said from Geneva.
Trafigura provided $100 million in  seed capital , he said. Jesus Fernandez, Trafigura’s mining investment chief, will manage the
project and move his team to Galena, Weir said.  “It’s a new business for Galena, but effectively Trafigura
has been doing it since 2005,” Weir said in an interview
yesterday. “We can do more deals, and larger deals.”  Galena, which manages more than $2.5 billion in assets, is
expanding in private equity as small and medium-sized mining
companies find it harder to access funding. Initial public
offerings in 2012 slumped to the lowest level since the
financial crisis on signs of an economic slowdown, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The fund may do at least three or four transactions this
year, Weir said. It will target stakes of between 25 percent and
60 percent in companies involved in coal mining, industrial,
ferrous and precious metals, according to Weir.  Trafigura’s revenues fell 1 percent to $120.4 billion in
the 12 months ending Sept. 30, according to the company’s
website. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
gained 0.3 percent in 2012, its worst performance since a 43
percent drop in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
