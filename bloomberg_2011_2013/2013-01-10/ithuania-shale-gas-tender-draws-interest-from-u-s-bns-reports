Lithuania’s tender for shale-gas
exploration rights has drawn expressions of interest by more
than 10 companies from the U.S., Canada and elsewhere,  Baltic
News Service  reported citing the Lithuanian Geological Service.  Bids are due Jan. 14 for licenses to explore for
hydrocarbons at two fields with total area of about 2,000 square
kilometers, the newswire said today.  A study last year showed the Baltic nation’s territory may
have more than 100 billion cubic meters of shale gas, BNS said.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , which last year bought 50 percent of a local
oil recovery company, and Poland’s Grupa Lotos SA, which has a
Lithuanian unit, have both said they intended to seek shale gas
in Lithuania, according to BNS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
