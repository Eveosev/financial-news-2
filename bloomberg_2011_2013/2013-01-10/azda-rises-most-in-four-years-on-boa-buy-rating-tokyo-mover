Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  rose the most in
more than four years in  Tokyo  trading after Bank of America
Corp. Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, citing the
improving profitability of new vehicles and a weaker yen.  Mazda, expecting to return to profit after four consecutive
annual losses, climbed as much as  12 percent , headed for the
biggest gain since Jan. 7, 2009, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to
198 yen before trading at 194 yen as of 1:54 p.m., local time.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.8 percent.  The carmaker has more than doubled in Tokyo trading over
the past three months as it benefits from demand for vehicles
with greater fuel efficiency and an 11 percent depreciation in
the yen over the same period. It sold 143,646 units of the CX-5
crossover between February and November, the first vehicle fully
fitted with the so-called Skyactiv fuel-saving technology, the
Hiroshima, Japan-based company said.  “Earnings look poised for robust recovery over the coming
few quarters” from the initial production growth in new models
and better profitability of Skyactive-fitted vehicles, Takaki Nakanishi, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at Bank of America Corp.
Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report dated yesterday. “The
weakening yen will magnify improvements in earnings a notch
further.”  By March 2016, Mazda plans to equip 80 percent of its
vehicles with Skyactiv technology to meet demand for cars that
consume less fuel.  The Japanese currency traded at 88.15 yen against the
dollar as of 2:16 p.m. in Tokyo, compared with 78.18 yen on Oct.
10, 2012.  Mazda gets about 84 percent of unit sales overseas, making
it vulnerable to gains in the yen, which erode the value of
earnings from outside  Japan .  A one-yen movement against the dollar has a 3.5 billion yen
($40 million) effect on the carmaker’s annual operating profit,
while the same move against the euro will make a 1.2 billion yen
difference, according to Mazda.  President Takashi Yamanouchi has said the CX-5 model can be
profitable even at an exchange rate of 77 yen to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
