German stocks  were little changed as
the  European Central Bank  left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged and  Spain ’s borrowing costs fell at the country’s
first bond auction of the year.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany’s biggest
lenders , gained more than 1 percent.  MAN SE (MAN)  jumped 3.5 percent
after  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  offered to buy the rest of the truckmaker.
Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA fell 2.6 percent after
Credit Suisse Group AG lowered its recommendation on the stock.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  slipped 0.2 percent to 7,708.47 at the close
in Frankfurt. The gauge earlier climbed as much as 0.7 percent
after ECB President  Mario Draghi  said the euro-area economy
economy will slowly recover in 2013. The DAX has gained 1.3
percent this year as U.S. politicians agreed on a compromise
budget. The broader HDAX Index also lost 0.2 percent today.  “Draghi’s view on the economy was upbeat considering the
circumstances,” said  Philippe Gijsels , head of fixed-income
research at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels. “The reaction of
the market is reasonably positive. Everybody wants to get into
the market. People are waiting for a pullback, but that’s not
materializing, so many investors are being forced to jump in.”  The number of shares changing hands on the DAX was 64
percent greater than the average of the last 30 days.  ECB Rates  ECB policy makers meeting in Frankfurt today left their
benchmark rate at a record low of 0.75 percent, as predicted by
 50 out of 55 economists  in a Bloomberg News survey. They held
the deposit and marginal lending rates at zero and 1.5 percent,
respectively.  “We have signs that fragmentation is being gradually
repaired,” Draghi said at a press conference in Frankfurt. “A
gradual recovery should start” later this year as ECB measures
work their way through the euro area’s economy.  Bank of England  policy makers refrained from adding further
stimulus to the U.K. economy. The nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee led by Governor  Mervyn King  kept the target for
quantitative easing at 375 billion pounds ($605 billion),
matching the  forecasts of all 39 economists  in a Bloomberg News
survey. They also held their key interest rate at a record low
of 0.5 percent.  Spain overshot its maximum target at the first bond auction
of the year. The nation aims to raise net debt issuance by 24
percent in 2013.  Overseas Shipments  In  China ,  exports  rose 14 percent in December from a year
earlier, while imports increased 6 percent, the customs office
said. The pickup in overseas shipments beat the 5 percent  median
estimate of 40 economists  in a Bloomberg News survey and a 2.9
percent increase in November.  Deutsche Bank rose 1.2 percent to 37.16 euros and
Commerzbank climbed 3.2 percent to 1.70 euros as shares of
lenders advanced across Europe.  MAN jumped 3.5 percent to 86.94 euros. Volkswagen, Europe’s
largest carmaker, will offer to buy out the rest of MAN’s
shareholders, it said in a statement.  Germany’s largest carmaker already holds 75.03 percent of
the  voting rights  and will seek a domination agreement. The
remaining stake is worth 3.2 billion euros ($4.2 billion) based
on yesterday’s closing price. Volkswagen added 1 percent to
173.30 euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the world’s biggest maker of
luxury cars, advanced 1 percent to 72.89 euros. BMW Group
generated record sales in 2012, the company said. Sales rose 11
percent to 1.85 million vehicles in the year. The company said
it aims to beat the record in 2013.  Fresenius Medical  Fresenius Medical Care lost 2.6 percent to 48.91 euros.
Credit Suisse lowered its rating on the stock to neutral from
outperform, meaning that investors should not buy more of the
shares. Analyst Christoph Gretler reduced his estimate for
earnings per shares in 2014 by 10 percent.  Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG)  surged 6 percent to 15.68 euros
after the company reported preliminary fourth-quarter revenue of
$268 million. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of $226
million.  Suedzucker AG (SZU)  dropped 5.7 percent to 29.20 euros after the
maker of sugar, starch and bakery additives reported  third-
quarter profit  of 112.6 million euros, missing  analysts’
estimates  of 117.7 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
