Synergon Nyrt. (SYNERG)  jumped the most in
more than 15 months after the Hungarian computer services
provider won a subsidy to build a data center powered by
renewable energy.  The stock rose 12 percent to 470 forint by 4:05 p.m. in
Budapest, the biggest advance on a closing basis since September
2011. Synergon had the biggest gain in the 11-member benchmark
BUX stock  index , which rose 0.6 percent. Traders bought and sold
more than 130,000 Synergon shares, 642 percent of the three-
month average.  Synergon won a grant of 2 billion forint ($9 million) to
build the data center, which will partly run on geothermal
energy, according to an e-mailed  statement  today. The center,
which will support telecommunications services, will have an
initial area of 2,000 square meters (21,528 square feet) and can
be expanded to 5,000 square meters, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
