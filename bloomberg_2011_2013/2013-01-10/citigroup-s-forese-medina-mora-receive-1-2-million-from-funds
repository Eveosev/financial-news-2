Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s new co-presidents,
Jamie Forese and Manuel Medina-Mora, received a combined $1.2
million last year from their holdings in internal private-equity
investment funds.  Forese, 49, got $755,675 in total distributions from his
stakes in two of the funds while Medina-Mora, 62, received
$418,800 from one of the funds, according to a regulatory filing
today by the New York-based firm. The Citigroup Employee Fund of
Funds I and Citigroup Capital Partners II seek to profit from
private-equity investments, the filing shows.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat , 52, promoted the
two company veterans this week to help him push through a cost-
reduction strategy that has already resulted in 11,000 job cuts.
Forese will oversee all institutional businesses while Medina-
Mora continues to run  consumer banking  and the lender’s Mexico
operations.  “Citi is fortunate to have very strong leaders with the
skills and experience I will rely on as we navigate the
challenges and opportunities ahead,” Corbat said in a Jan. 7
statement announcing the shake-up. “Jamie and Manuel have both
spent their entire careers at Citi and its predecessor
companies, and they exemplify the best of Citi.”  Medina-Mora received about $11.4 million in total
compensation for 2011, including a $4.2 million cash bonus, a
 filing  shows. The bank didn’t disclose compensation for Forese,
who previously ran Citigroup’s securities and banking unit.  Citigroup paid $124,524 in 2012 compensation to the spouse
of a child of Medina-Mora, according to the filing. The bank
doesn’t identify the person, who was no longer an employee by
June 15, the filing shows.  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for Citigroup, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
