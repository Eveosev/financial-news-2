Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, rose the most in a week after Chief Executive
Officer Murilo Ferreira said the company will benefit from a
recovery in Chinese construction and manufacturing.  Demand for steel is higher amid a “more favorable”
environment in  China , the company’s biggest client, Ferreira
told reporters in Brasilia yesterday. Prices for  iron ore , the
main ingredient for making steel, will be less volatile this
year after a “significant” recovery, he said.  “I don’t see a scenario that is as pessimistic as in
September 2012, or as exuberant as in 2008 and 2010, when prices
reached $200,” Ferreira said.  Iron ore posted the biggest quarterly climb on record in
the final three months of 2012 and jumped 82 percent since a
three-year low on Sept. 5 as Chinese mills restock. Ore with 62
percent content delivered to Tianjin  rose  to $158.50 a dry ton
on Jan. 8, the highest since October 2011, according to data
from the Steel Index Ltd. Prices fell to $158.20 yesterday.  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro ,  added  0.7 percent to 40.57
reais in  Sao Paulo  yesterday, the most since Jan. 2, after
advancing as much as 1.1 percent on Ferreira’s comments.
Brazil’s benchmark stock index  rose  0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
