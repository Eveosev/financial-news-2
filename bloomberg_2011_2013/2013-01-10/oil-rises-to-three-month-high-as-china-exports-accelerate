Oil rose to the highest level in
three months as exports from  China  accelerated and European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said “a gradual recovery
should start” in the region this year.  Prices advanced 0.8 percent after China’s customs agency
said overseas sales in the world’s second-largest fuel-consuming
country jumped 14.1 percent last month from a year earlier. Oil
also gained as the euro surged against the dollar on Draghi’s
remarks.  “We are breaking out on the back of the incredibly strong
export data from China that clearly argue for an enhanced demand
picture for 2013,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again
Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy.
“The comments by Draghi about the economy are positive. The
euro is mostly definitely helping oil.”  Crude oil for February delivery gained 72 cents to $93.82 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Sept. 18. Trading volume was 47 percent more
than the 100-day average.  Brent oil for February settlement increased 13 cents to
$111.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 60 percent above the 100-day average.
Brent’s premium to New York futures narrowed 59 cents to $18.07
a barrel, the narrowest spread since Sept. 24.  Chinese Exports  Chinese December exports exceeded the 5 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 40 economists. Exports for all
of 2012 rose 7.9 percent, according to the Beijing-based General
Administration of Customs. The country’s December  trade surplus 
almost doubled from a year earlier to $31.6 billion.  China imported 271 million metric tons of crude last year,
6.8 percent more than in 2011, the customs agency reported. It
ranks behind only the U.S. in term of oil consumption.  “Oil is rising because of the good news from China, the
growing exports,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “It
definitely gives a bullish flavor to the market.”  European bond markets will stabilize this year after three
years of turmoil as the euro-area economy recovers, Draghi said
at a press conference in  Frankfurt  today after policy makers
kept their benchmark  interest rate  at 0.75 percent.  “We have signs that fragmentation is being gradually
repaired,” he said.  Spanish Bonds  The euro rose as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar on
Draghi’s remarks and as  Spain  sold more than the maximum target
at its first debt auction of the year. A stronger common
currency and weaker dollar boost oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs, which hit a euro-era
record of 7.75 percent in July, fell below 5 percent today for
the first time since March.  The “sub-5 percent” yield is “an unbelievable turn of
events in just several months,” Kilduff said. “There are a lot
of positive aspects out there today.”  Oil also gained as  Saudi Arabia  reduced production in
December to a 19-month low, according to a Gulf official with
knowledge of the kingdom’s energy policy.  Saudi Arabia cut production by 4.9 percent to 9.025 million
barrels a day in December, said the official, who asked not to
be identified because the information is confidential.  OPEC Output  The 465,000-barrel-a-day reduction is the largest monthly
drop since November 2008.  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and the Centre for
Global Energy Studies have said the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries needs to trim output to prevent markets from
being oversupplied. Saudi Arabia is OPEC’s largest oil producer.  “The Saudi Arabia news will reinforce the bullish mood,”
Lynch said.  Oil reduced gains as more Americans than forecast filed
 applications  for  unemployment benefits  last week. Jobless claims
increased by 4,000 to 371,000 in the week ended Jan. 5, higher
than the 365,000 forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg,
Labor Department data showed.  WTI slid in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened a glut at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s biggest storage hub and the
delivery point for the New York contract. That left it at an
average $17.48 a barrel below Brent last year, versus a premium
of about 95 cents in the 10 years through 2010.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 617,490
contracts as of 2:37 p.m. Volume totaled 470,459 contracts
yesterday, 2.1 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.48 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
