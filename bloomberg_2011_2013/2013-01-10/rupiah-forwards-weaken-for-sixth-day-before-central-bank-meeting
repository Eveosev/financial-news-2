Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards fell to
the weakest level in three years and  government bonds  dropped on
concern the widening current-account deficit will damp capital
inflows. Stocks declined as the rupiah touched a three-year low.  Offshore funds pulled  360 billion rupiah  ($37 million) from
local-currency sovereign notes in the first two days of this
week, finance ministry data show. Bank Indonesia held its policy
rate at a record low of  5.75 percent  for an 11th month today, as
predicted by all 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The nation’s
current-account deficit may widen to 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012, the largest in data going back to 1998,
the central bank said on Dec. 11.  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.8 percent to
9,950 per dollar as of 4:21 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level
since Sept. 15, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s a
2.9 percent discount to the spot rate, which was unchanged at
9,660 after touching a three-year low of 9,880 earlier, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. Non-deliverable
forwards are settled in dollars.  “The forwards move is in line with the onshore market and
it’s possible the spot rate will move toward that level,” said
 Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. “Weakening in the rupiah will persist in the near
term as investor sentiment in Indonesia has turned bearish.”  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose
1.38 percentage points to 6.88 percent.  Stocks Slide  The benchmark Jakarta Composite index of shares slid 1
percent to 4,317.365, the biggest drop since Sept. 26. The yield
on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 rose eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.20 percent, the
biggest climb since Aug. 27, closing prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show.  “The drop in stocks seems to be due to the rupiah,” said
John Teja, the head of equities sales at PT Ciptadana Securities
in Jakarta. “The market no longer has a positive catalyst that
can drive share prices higher.”  Indonesia’s foreign-exchange reserves rose for a sixth
month to $112.8 billion in December, the highest level since
April, according to data from  Bank Indonesia .  “The clear message coming from the central bank is that it
is happy to see the currency soften,” Robert-Prior Wandesforde,
an economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in  Singapore , wrote in a
note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
