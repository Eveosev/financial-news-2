China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in three days, as export data that beat economists’

exports will boost demand for marine transport.  Baoshan Iron &

40 percent in 2012. Xi’an LONGi Silicon Materials Co. and

“However, some investors would like to cash out now to lock in
their profits after a decent rally.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.4 percent to 2,283.66
at the close, after falling as much as 0.3 percent. The  CSI 300

zone  and Japan,” Ting Lu, economist at Bank of America Corp.,
wrote in a report.  The nation’s trade this year will be “slightly better”
