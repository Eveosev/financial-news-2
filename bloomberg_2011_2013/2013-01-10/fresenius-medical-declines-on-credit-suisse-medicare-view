Fresenius Medical Care AG, the
world’s biggest provider of  kidney dialysis , headed for a 13
1/2-month low after Credit Suisse reduced its recommendation
because U.S. government health-cost cuts may hurt earnings.  Fresenius Medical fell as much as 4.8 percent and was
trading down 1.5 percent at 49.46 euros as of 2:47 p.m. in
 Frankfurt , the lowest since Nov. 25, 2011, based on closing
prices. Parent company Fresenius SE dropped 1.8 percent to 84.27
euros, the steepest decline since Nov. 1. The stocks were the
among the three worst performers on  Germany ’s benchmark  DAX
Index (DAX)  today.  Medicare-program dialysis pricing envisioned under the U.S.
budget agreement passed this month could shrink Fresenius
Medical’s medium-term operating profit by $165 million to $225
million, Christoph Gretler, an analyst at Credit Suisse in
Zurich, wrote in a report to clients today. Gretler reduced his
 recommendation  on Fresenius Medical to neutral from outperform,
the first cut this year among 33 analysts covering the company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cuts in the Medicare program of U.S. government health
insurance for the elderly would make margin growth
“difficult,” and Fresenius Medical has yet to disclose much
about its medium-term financial plans, Gretler wrote.  Fresenius SE owns about 30 percent of Fresenius Medical,
and both companies are based in the Frankfurt suburb of  Bad
Homburg . The parent company also has businesses in private
hospital operations, health-care services, and intravenous drugs
and devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
