The pound was little changed against
the dollar and euro after National Statistician Jil Matheson
said the U.K. should maintain its current approach to
calculating its retail price index.  Sterling traded at $1.6016 as of 7:06 a.m.  London  time. It
was also little changed at 81.51 pence.  The statistics office will develop a new inflation index
known as RPIJ to address an issue with the measurement of
clothing prices in the RPI, the Office for National Statistics
said in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
