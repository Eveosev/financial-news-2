Airbus SAS said it won an order for
20 A320neo aircraft from Ireland’s Avolon Aerospace Leasing Ltd.  The purchase, worth about $1.9 billion at list prices, was
sealed last month and follows a commitment for 15 of the planes
from Dublin-based Avolon in July, Toulouse, France-based Airbus
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Avolon has yet to make an engine choice for the planes,
which are available with turbines from a joint venture of
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF)  and another led by  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney division.  Avolon becomes the eighth aircraft leasing company to
commit to buying the neo. The leasing company, which is also
buying 20  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 Max airliners, has a fleet of 91
aircraft and orders for 76 more, it said on its website. Current
model 737s and A320s represent more than half its fleet.  Airbus, which plans first neo deliveries in 2015, has
amassed a backlog of 1,684 aircraft since the program began in
December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
