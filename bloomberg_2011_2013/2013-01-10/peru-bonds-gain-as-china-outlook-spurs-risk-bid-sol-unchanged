Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
to a record low, as  China ’s export growth buoyed global economic
prospects and spurred demand for higher-yielding, emerging-
market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.82 percent at 2:29 p.m. in Lima,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased
0.18 centimo to 126.08 centimos per sol.  “Emerging assets, bonds and currencies, are performing
very well,”  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP
Paribas Brasil SA in Sao Paulo. “If you buy Peruvian sol bonds,
you gain on the yield and the possible appreciation of the
currency. The outlook for the currency is comfortable.”  Stocks rallied after China’s exports climbed last month the
most since May. Weaker demand in Europe and U.S. damped China’s
exports last year, hurting growth in the world’s second-largest
economy and  Peru ’s top trading partner.  The sol was unchanged at 2.5505 per U.S. dollar at today’s
close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 2.5411 per U.S. dollar on Jan. 7, the strongest since
October 1996,  data  from Peru’s banking regulator show.  Peru’s central bank bought $60 million in the spot currency
market today and said on its website it paid an average 2.5505
soles per U.S. dollar.  Policy makers convening today will keep borrowing costs
unchanged at 4.25 percent for a 20th consecutive month,
according to 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The bank is due
to announce its decision at 6 p.m. in  Lima .  To contact the reporter on this story:
