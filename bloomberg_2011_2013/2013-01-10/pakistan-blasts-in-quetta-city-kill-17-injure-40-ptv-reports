At least 40 people were killed in
two blasts today in  Pakistan ’s southwestern city of Quetta, a
government official said.  “I can confirm at least 40 dead in the two blasts with
another 120 wounded,” Baluchistan Provincial Home Secretary
Akbar Durrani said in a phone interview from Quetta, the capital
city of the province.  Baluch separatists have fought a low scale insurgency for
decades as they seek more economic and political autonomy in the
country’s largest yet poorest mineral-rich province. Taliban
militants are also active in the province, which shares a border
with Iran and  Afghanistan .  As many as 56 people were killed and 163 wounded, Geo TV
reported separately, citing a police official. The first blast
in the city was a suicide bombing, Geo TV said, citing police.  Six police officers were killed in the explosions,
according to police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
