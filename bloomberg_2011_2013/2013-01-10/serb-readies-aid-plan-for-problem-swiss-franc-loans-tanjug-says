Serbia â€™s central bank will present a
plan within 10 days to help households in difficulty paying off
Swiss franc denominated-loans,  Tanjug  reported.  The central bank is working closely with banks and consumer
associations to develop the plan, the  news agency  reported.  Total consumer bad debt, defined as payments 90 days or
more overdue, was 49.6 billion dinars ($584.7 million) at the
end of November. Swiss franc-denominated loans accounted for 7.9
billion dinars, or 16 percent of total problem household
borrowing, according to central bank data released today.  Banks in Serbia stopped granting loans linked to the Swiss
franc in October 2008. A total of 2,272 clients have run into
difficulty making repayments since then because of a surge in
the value of the Swiss franc, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
