Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  said passenger
traffic rose 2.2 percent last year as it boosted capacity 0.6
percent, lifting seat occupancy by 1.2 points to 78.8 percent.  Traffic, the number of people carried times the distance
flown, shrank 4.7 percent in December as the company cut
available seating by 6.3 percent, it said in a  statement  today.  The Cologne, Germany-based carrier transported 103.1
million passengers in the year, 2.4 percent more than in 2011.  Lufthansaâ€™s operations were hampered by strikes involving
baggage handlers, airport security staff and cabin crew.  To contact the reporter on this story:
