Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
maker of agricultural equipment, said the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission completed an investigation of the company
and doesn’t plan to pursue any enforcement action.  Deere fully cooperated with the SEC, the Moline, Illinois-
based company said today in a statement.  The company said in August 2011 it was being investigated
by the SEC about a possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and that the agency requested documents related to
Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
