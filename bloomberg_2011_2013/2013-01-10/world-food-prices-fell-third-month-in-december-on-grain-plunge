World food prices  fell for a third
month in December as the cost of grains and oilseeds declined,
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO fell to 209.3
points from a restated 211.7 in November, the Rome-based agency
wrote in an e-mailed report today. The index averaged 211.6 for
the year, down from a record 227.6 points in 2011.  Wheat futures dropped 9.9 percent last month in  Chicago ,
the biggest monthly slide since September 2011, while corn fell
7.2 percent and soybeans declined 2 percent. The food price
index is still above its June level of 200.4, which was the low
for the year.  “The decline in December was led by drops in the
international prices of major cereals and oils,” the FAO wrote.
“Cereal export quotations dropped because of weaker demand for
feed and industrial uses.”  The global food-import bill was forecast to fall 9.7
percent in 2012 to $1.14 trillion from a record $1.26 trillion
in 2011 on lower freight costs and less spending on vegetables
and fruits, grains and sugar, the FAO said in November.  The FAO’s gauge of world grain prices declined 2.3 percent
to 249.6 points from 255.6. Corn prices dropped as export
supplies in  South America  relieved pressure from tight
availability in the U.S., the UN agency said.  The December index for fats and oils dropped to 196.5, the
lowest level since August 2010, from 200.4 the previous month,
the FAO reported. Palm oil futures in  Malaysia  dropped 23
percent last year on record stocks in the country, the world’s
second-largest producer behind  Indonesia .  The index of sugar prices dropped to 273.8 points from
274.5 points in November, to the lowest level since August 2010.
The FAO dairy-price index rose to 196.8 points from 195, the
data showed. The index for meat prices dropped to 175.6 points
from 177.  To contact the reporter on this story:
