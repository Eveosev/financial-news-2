Italian caretaker Prime Minister
 Mario Monti , preparing for elections next month, selected a
professor living under armed guard and two ex-allies of  Silvio Berlusconi  to run for him in the battleground region of
Lombardy.  Labor market professor Pietro Ichino, ex-Milan Mayor
Gabriele Albertini and Mario Mauro, formerly Berlusconi’s top
representative at the European Parliament, were presented by
Monti today at a press conference. Speaking to reporters in
Milan, the capital of Lombardy, Monti said his objective is to
gradually open Italian politics to more people and ideas.  Monti is assembling a political team after 14 months in
power at the helm of a technocratic government of professors and
bureaucrats. With the selections, Monti is challenging
established rivals in Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party and
the  Democratic Party  of Pier Luigi Bersani.  Monti, who’s seeking to bring more non-politicians to
parliament, explained his reason for selecting people who have
previously held office. To exclude certain politicians would be
“elitist, improper and typical of one of the defects of  Italy ’s
civil society,” he said.  Ichino, a senator with Bersani’s Democratic Party, has been
protected for a decade by an armed escort provided by the
government, which believes that people want to murder him for
his views on labor-market reform. Albertini served in
Berlusconi’s party when he was mayor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
