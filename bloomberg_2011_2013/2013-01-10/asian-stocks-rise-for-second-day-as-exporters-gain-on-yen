Asian  stocks  climbed, with the

months, as  China ’s export data topped estimates and Japanese

jumped 7.3 percent in Hong Kong.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  led
automakers higher, climbing 10 percent in  Tokyo  as Bank of

as of 6:26 p.m. Tokyo time, on track for its highest close since
August 2011. The benchmark gauge capped seven straight weeks of
gains last week as the U.S. Congress approved a budget deal and
Japanese shares rallied on expectations the nation’s new
government would call for more stimulus.  “China’s export data is boosting investor sentiment,”
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based global market strategist at
JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which oversees about $1.3
trillion globally. “Imports also improved, showing that
domestic demand is picking up.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  increased 0.7 percent,
advancing for a second day. The gauge has risen 23 percent from
Nov. 14 when Japanese elections were announced, driving the
measure into a bull market.  South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.8 percent.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index increased 0.6 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite

6 percent, the customs office said today. The pickup in overseas
shipments beat the 5 percent median estimate of 40 analysts in a

low after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged Bank of  Japan  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa at a meeting yesterday to double the nation’s
inflation target to 2 percent. A weaker currency boosts the
value of overseas earnings when repatriated.  “The government’s economic policy can prompt a sustained
improvement in investor sentiment by weakening the yen before
the recovery in the U.S. economy becomes definite,” said Naoki Kamiyama, equity strategist at Bank of America Corp. in Tokyo.

ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Billionaire Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary,
the company’s largest shareholder, may make an offer to take DRB
private at 3.50 ringgit to 4 ringgit per share, the Business
Times reported, citing unidentified people it said were working
on the plan.  “We are unaware, caught by surprise, and there hasn’t been
any proposal that came to DRB,” Group Managing Director Mohd Khamil Jamil told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. “You put it
rightly that it’s a rumor.”  Kepco Tariff  Korea Electric, the state-controlled utility also known as
