Fast Retailing Co. (9983) ,  Asia ’s largest
apparel retailer, climbed to a record in  Tokyo  trading after
boosting its annual profit forecast on higher overseas sales of
its Uniqlo clothing brand.  The stock rose as much as 4.3 percent to 23,520 yen, headed
for the highest close since Bloomberg started tracking the data
in 1997, before trading at 23,220 yen at 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo. The
Topix index gained 1.2 percent.  Net income  will probably be 87
billion yen ($987 million) for the year ending August, higher
than its previous forecast of 84.5 billion yen, the Yamaguchi,
Japan-based company said yesterday in a statement.  Billionaire Tadashi Yanai, Japan’s richest man, is
expanding his chain overseas to reduce reliance on  Japan , where
the retailer got about 77 percent of  revenue  last fiscal year.
The maker of Uniqlo brand clothes has said it won’t slow down
its  China  expansion, even after violent demonstrations over a
territorial dispute with Japan forced it to close as many as 60
outlets temporarily in September.  “There was concern that the overseas business may not be
good as people expected a consumer boycott in China after the
dispute,” said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based  fund manager  at
Mizuho Asset Management Co. “It did better than I thought.”  The diplomatic spat flared up last year after Japan’s
government said it would buy the islands, known as the Diaoyu in
China and the Senkaku in Japanese, from their private Japanese
owner.  Cold Weather  First-quarter  net income  rose 24 percent to 38.5 billion
yen, the company said yesterday. Overseas sales jumped 51
percent for the three months ended November, aided by expansion
in China,  South Korea  and  Taiwan . Domestic Uniqlo same-store
sales rose 5 percent in in the quarter as lower temperatures
boosted demand for winter clothing.  Tokyo temperatures averaged below the 30-year median on 26
of 30 days in November and 24 of 31 days in December, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fast Retailing plans to open as many as 300 outlets every
year, mainly in Asia. It expects to have more than 2,000 in
Greater China and other Asian countries in the next 10 years,
Yanai said in April. Overseas sales are expected to exceed
domestic in fiscal 2015, he said.  The Japanese retailer had the highest per-share earnings on
a trailing 12-month basis, almost double that of Zara seller
 Inditex SA (ITX) , among the world’s 10 largest apparel retailers by
market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fast Retailing’s forecast in October called for sales to
rise 14 percent to 1.06 trillion yen and net income to increase
18 percent to 84.5 billion yen for the year ending August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
