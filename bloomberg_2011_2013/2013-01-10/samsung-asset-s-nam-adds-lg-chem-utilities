Samsung Asset Management Co.,  South
Korea ’s biggest asset manager, bought shares of  LG Chem Ltd. (051910) ,
Posco along with telecom and utility companies on the prospect
of improving earnings this year, its head of equities said.  “I believe those companies could generate decent earnings
growth this year, though the economy is likely to post a mild
recovery,” Samsung Asset’s Nam Dong Joon said in an interview
yesterday. His flagship  fund  has beaten 98 percent of its peers
over a three-year period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  LG Chem, the biggest South Korean chemicals maker, Posco,
the country’s No. 1 steelmaker, and SK Telecom Co., the largest
wireless operator, may post at least 16 percent growth in
operating earnings this year, while state-monopoly  Korea
Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  will swing to profit, according to the
average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Kospi index (KOSPI)  rose 0.6 percent to 2,003.06 at 12:19 p.m.
in  Seoul , the first advance in six days. The measure has gained
0.3 percent this year after climbing 9.4 percent in 2012.
Companies on the Kospi  trade  at 9.2 times estimated profit,
versus the five-year average of 10.9, making the nation’s stocks
the cheapest in Asia after  Pakistan , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Nam’s Samsung For You Korea Representative Securities
Investment Trust 1 returned an annualized 15 percent in the past
three years. Samsung Asset manages about $119 billion in assets.  Economic Growth  LG Chem and  Posco (005490)  have diversified products, shielding them
from “external risks,” Nam said. SK Telecom will boost its
average revenue per users as it lures more subscribers to pay
for faster services, he said.  The government’s regulations against utilities are likely
to ease, he said. South Korea will raise electricity prices by
an average 4 percent starting next week, the Knowledge Economy
 Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  South Korea’s gross domestic product will expand 3 percent
in 2013, compared with an estimated 2.1 percent growth last
year, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Korea Electric Power, which climbed 19 percent last year,
rallied 3 percent to 32,600 won today, bound for the highest
close since October 2010.  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s largest
buyer of liquefied natural gas, added 3.1 percent to 77,800 won
after surging 80 percent in 2012.  SK Telecom, which posted a 7.8 percent gain last year,
climbed 1.3 percent today, while LG Chem added 1.4 percent.
Posco, which fell 8.2 percent in 2012, advanced 0.4 percent.  Credit Suisse Group AG this month set a year-end Kospi
target of 2,350 points, which implies an 18 percent gain from
yesterday’s close, citing signs of improvement in the U.S. and
China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
