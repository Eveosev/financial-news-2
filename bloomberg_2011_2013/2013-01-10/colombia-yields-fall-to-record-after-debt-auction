Colombia ’s peso rose the most in a
week as companies bought the local currency to pay taxes and
amid gains in oil, the country’s biggest export.  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,763.30 per  U.S.
dollar  and earlier strengthened 0.5 percent for its biggest
intraday increase since Jan. 2. It touched 1,750.50 that day,
the strongest intraday level since July 2011.  “We’re seeing strong sales of dollars by companies, and
that should continue to pressure gains in the peso this
quarter,” Juan Pablo Colmenares, a currency trader at Corp.
Financiera Colombiana, said in a phone interview in Bogota.
“Oil is also helping in addition to investments we should see
this year from  oil companies  in Colombia.”  Agriculture Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo called on the
central bank yesterday to boost dollar purchases to ease gains
in the local currency that are hurting coffee, flower and banana
exporters. On Jan. 2, central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe
said on RCN Radio that the peso’s strength is a concern and
reiterated that Banco de la Republica will buy a minimum of $20
million a day through at least the first quarter. The central
bank printed pesos to buy a record $4.4 billion last year.  The peso will probably strengthen to 1,750 next week,
according to Colmenares, a level where investors see increased
chances of further measures by policy makers to stem gains.  Oil rose to its highest level in three months after  China ’s
exports topped estimates, boosting speculation a strengthening
economy will drive demand. Oil accounts for about 40 percent of
Colombia’s sales abroad.  The yield on 10 percent peso-denominated debt due in July
2024 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
5.47 percent, the lowest since the securities were first issued
in 2009, according to the central bank. The price rose 0.526
centavo to 137.953 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
