Chinese equities  climbed for a
second day in New York, led by Internet companies and airlines,
as trade figures that beat economists’ estimates bolstered the
case for a rebound in Asia’s biggest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rallied 1.1 percent to 101.9 by 12:57
p.m., poised for the highest in a week. Search engine  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) 
posted the steepest two-day rally in a year while video website
operator  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU)  jumped to a six-month high.  China
Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH) , the nation’s biggest carrier, and  China
Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA)  surged after they were classed as top
picks by UOB Kay-Hian Holdings Ltd.  The benchmark gauge of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks is headed
for its second  weekly advance  of 2013, buoyed by government data
yesterday showing  overseas shipments  rose 14.1 percent last
month from a year earlier, the most since May and more than
double the 5 percent median of 40 economists’ estimates. Gains
in December data, from retail sales to industrial output,
indicate  China  is recovering from its seven-quarter slowdown.  “China’s economic growth certainly stabilized and might
even pick up a bit from here, and its exports acceleration does
reflect a broader recovery in the global economy,” Morgan Harting, who helps manage the $75 million Alliance Bernstein
 Emerging Markets  Multi-Asset Portfolio fund, said by phone in
New York yesterday. “It’s a good year for emerging markets.
We’ve increased Chinese equities holdings over the past six
months.”  Harting’s  fund  has outperformed 70 percent of its peers in
the past month, rising 3.9 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  ETF Advances  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 1.3 percent to $41.52 in
its second day of gains. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed
0.8 percent to a five-year high of 1,472.12, buoyed by the
Chinese data and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s
forecast that the euro area economy will return to health later
in 2013.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 1 percent to
11,913.47 yesterday, the steepest advance in a week, while the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic shares increased 0.4
percent to 2,283.66, after falling the previous two days.  Baidu, which owns China’s most-used online search engine,
climbed 6 percent to $110.57, the biggest surge since July 24.
Its stock has risen 10 percent this year, after losing 14
percent in 2012.  Youku Jumps  Beijing-based Baidu started a computer security software in
English and Thai, making the product accessible to users in
 Southeast Asia , according to  TechinAsia’s website .  Youku, the Beijing-based operator of China’s biggest video
websites, climbed 10 percent to $21.84, the highest since June
27. Trading volume on its shares was 1.8 times the daily average
in the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Morgan Stanley held 7.1 percent of Youku Tudou’s shares as of
the end of 2012, a  regulatory filing  made public Jan. 9 showed.  China Southern, based in Guangzhou, surged 7.4 percent to a
one-year high of $28.47.  China Eastern , the nation’s second-
largest airline by market value, climbed 6 percent to $22.78,
the highest level since September 2011.  Both carriers are among top picks in Asia’s aviation sector
because of “attractive valuations,” K Ajith, an analyst at UOB
Key-Hian in  Singapore , wrote in a note to clients yesterday.
China’s economic outlook is “positive,” while a recovery in
cargo transport could be weak, according to the note.  Shanghai-based China Eastern’s passenger load factor, or
the percentage of seats filled by paying customers, rose 1.5
percent last month from a year earlier to 77.4 percent,
according to data released yesterday.  Chalco Gains  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the largest producer of the
light metal in the country, advanced 6.6 percent to $13.28, the
highest level since March 2. Its American depositary receipts,
each representing 25 underlying shares in the Beijing-based
company known as Chalco, traded 1.2 percent above its  Hong Kong 
stock, the widest  premium  in four days. The ADRs have traded
higher than shares in Hong Kong for two straight weeks since
Dec. 24.  Chalco’s unit Chinalco Mining Corp. planned to start
gauging demand yesterday for an initial public offering in Hong
Kong to raise as much as $400 million, said two people with
knowledge of the matter on Jan. 9, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private.  Suntech Volatility  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s biggest solar-panel
maker, retreated 4.8 percent to $1.78 in New York after surging
26 percent in the previous two days. Trading volume on its ADRs
was 1.7 times the daily average over the past three months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Thirty-day volatility  on Suntech’s
ADRs rose to 123 yesterday, the highest since December 2011.  The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a
basket of companies that gained U.S. listings after buying firms
that already trade, increased for a fifth day, adding 0.6
percent to an eight-month high of 78.88. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards on the  yuan  strengthened 0.45 percent to
6.2685 per dollar yesterday in New York, the biggest one-day
jump since Jan. 18, 2012. The currency was little changed at
6.2244 versus the dollar in Shanghai trading.  China’s national statistics bureau may report today
 consumer prices  rose 2.3 percent last month from a year earlier,
after gaining 2 percent in November, according to the median
estimate of 42 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
