The European Central Bank said it
removed 12.4 percent fewer counterfeit euro banknotes from
circulation in 2012 than in the previous year.  The bank withdrew about 531,000 forged notes compared with
606,000 in 2011, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in an e-mailed
statement today. The number was 11.6 percent higher in the
second half of the year than in the first.  The 20-euro and 50-euro notes continue to be the most
forged, accounting for a combined 82.5 percent of discovered
fakes. The 100-euro banknote was the third-most counterfeited
denomination, accounting for 13 percent. The proportion of
counterfeit notes compared with the total in circulation remains
“very low”, the bank said.  ECB President Mario Draghi today unveiled a new 5-euro
banknote to be introduced on May 2 as the first of the new
“Europa series” with new security features. The other
denominations will be “introduced gradually over the coming
years,” the ECB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
