U.K. 10-year  break-even rates , the
difference in yield between nominal and index-linked bonds,
widened after National Statistician Jil Matheson said the U.K.
should maintain its current approach to calculating its retail
price index.  The rate increased 24 basis points to 289 basis points at
8:06 a.m. London time. Thatâ€™s the biggest intraday gain since
May 19, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
