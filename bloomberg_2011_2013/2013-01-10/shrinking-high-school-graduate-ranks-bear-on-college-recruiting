The number of U.S. high-school
graduates is expected to decline through the rest of the decade,
with the largest drop in non-hispanic whites, raising questions
about how colleges will recruit and enroll students.  After two decades of growth, the number of high-school
graduates probably peaked at 3.4 million in the 2010-2011 school
year, according to projections released today by the  Western
Interstate Commission on Higher Education , a nonprofit research
group in Boulder,  Colorado .  In the next decade, the Midwest and Northeast can expect
the biggest decrease in graduates, while the South and West are
most likely to see growth, particularly in hispanic students.
Colleges will need to develop strategies on how to fill classes
as they deal with smaller populations, and families weigh the
value of college with costs as student borrowers graduate with
record-high debt levels. Some private schools charge more than
$60,000 a year.  “Schools can no longer choose from ever-growing pools of
potential applicants,” Brian Prescott, the study’s principal
author, said in an interview. “The whole environment of
admissions and enrollment management is shifting in fundamental
ways, with schools facing even tougher decisions about how to
recruit, where to recruit and how to keep the students that they
recruit enrolled.”  The next period of high-school student growth won’t begin
until 2020 and will continue to the 2026-2027 school year,
according to the report.  Hispanic Students  The study projects that between the 2008-2009 and 2019-2020
school years, the number of hispanic high-school graduates will
increase 41 percent, or almost 200,000, while Asian/Pacific
Islander graduates will rise 30 percent, or almost 50,000.  The number of white non-hispanic students will decline 12
percent, or about 228,000, and black graduates will decrease
41,000, or 9 percent.  The study, published about every five years, analyzed
federal birth data from the National Center for Health
Statistics. The authors developed ratios of students born in a
given year who go to first grade about six years later and then
performed the same analysis for subsequent years to determine
projections, Prescott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
