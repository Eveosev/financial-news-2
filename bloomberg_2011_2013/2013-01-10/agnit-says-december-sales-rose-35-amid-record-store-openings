OAO Magnit (MGNT) ,  Russia ’s largest food
retailer by market value, said December sales increased 35
percent because of new store openings and an increase in the
average amount spent by each customer.  Sales were 51.8 billion rubles ($1.7 billion), the
Krasnodar, Russia-based company said in a regulatory filing.
Full-year revenue rose 34 percent to 448 billion rubles,
outpacing a Russian retail market that grew 6 percent in the
year through November, according to the state’s statistics
 service .  Magnit said it opened 407 stores in December, bringing its
total to 6,884. The monthly increase is the biggest in the fast-
growing company’s history, according to analysts at VTB Capital.
Two-thirds of its shops are in small cities with a population of
less than 500,000 as the company expands into under-developed
parts of the Russian regions, the retailer said.  Average ticket, or the amount spent per customer, rose 7.8
percent in the fourth quarter and 5.6 percent in 2012, the
company said.  Magnit, founded and run by billionaire Chief Executive
Officer Sergey Galitskiy, advanced 82 percent in 2012, the best
performer in the MSCI Russia Index. Competitor X5 Retail Group
declined 22 percent over the period. Magnit’s market value
touched $20 billion earlier this month.  The strong results are “unlikely to cause a stir in the
market,” Maria Kolbina, an analyst at VTB Capital, said in a
note today. Magnit’s stock is trading at an enterprise value of
12.9 times forecast 2013 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, which implies a premium to peers
in  Turkey  and other  emerging markets , Kolbina wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
