House prices  in the Netherlands, the
fifth-largest economy in the euro area, will probably fall as
much as 7 percent in 2013, the  realtors’ trade group NVM  said.  The average house price declined 1 percent to 207,000 euros
($271,000) in the fourth quarter from the previous three months
and dropped 6.7 percent from a year earlier, NVM said today.
Transactions jumped in the final quarter before the
implementation of stricter mortgage rules, the group said.  House prices are predicted to drop this year as the Dutch
economy may contract 0.5 percent and unemployment is set to rise
to 6 percent, according to Dec. 19 forecasts by the government’s
planning agency, CPB. Prices have declined by an average 16
percent since the start of the credit crisis, NVM said.  “The market will improve in the course of the year as long
as there are no new developments that undermine  consumer
confidence ,” it said.  About 115,000 houses were sold last year, NVM said.
Transactions handled by the group’s members fell 4.1 percent to
85,321.  To contact the reporter on this story:
