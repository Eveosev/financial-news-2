Australia ’s dollar gained to its
strongest since September 2008 versus the yen and a three-week
high versus the greenback as Chinese data showed imports rose to
a record in the nation’s biggest overseas market.  The New Zealand dollar, known as the kiwi, climbed to the
highest level in more than four years against the yen as Asian
stocks advanced for a second day on Chinese growth optimism.  “The Chinese data is a whole lot better than anyone
expected with both imports and exports accelerating,” said Mike Jones, a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand in
Wellington. “That will only add to recent investor optimism
that the Chinese rebound has got legs and should take the Aussie
dollar higher.”  Australia’s currency climbed 0.3 percent to $1.0552 as of
4:31 p.m. in Sydney after touching $1.0555, its strongest since
Dec. 18. The currency strengthened 0.7 percent to 93.03 yen, the
most since September 2008.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to 84.05 U.S.
cents. It rose as high as 74.10 yen, the strongest since
September 2008, before trading at 74.09 yen from 73.78
yesterday.  China ’s exports rose 14.1 percent in December from a year
earlier while  imports  increased 6 percent, leaving a trade
surplus of $31.6 billion, the customs administration said today.  The pickup in shipments abroad compares with the 5 percent
median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a
projected 3.5 percent increase for imports.  Stopped Out  Westpac Banking Corp. said it was stopped out of a trade to
sell the Australian dollar versus  Canada ’s when the C$1.0390
level was breached after the Chinese data “smashed consensus.”  “We would not revisit this trade near term, with risk
atmospherics broadly positive for the Australian dollar this
month,” the bank said in an e-mailed report.  The Aussie climbed as much as 0.3 percent to C$1.0417,
having closed yesterday at C$1.0384.  Australian home-building approvals advanced for the third
time in four months in November as lower interest rates
encouraged plans for apartment projects, the statistics bureau
said today. The number of permits granted to build or renovate
houses and apartments gained 2.9 percent from October, in line
with the median forecast for a 3 percent gain in a Bloomberg
survey of 13 economists.  The nation’s  10-year bond yield  rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 3.44 percent, ending three days of
declines. The yield on the three-year security climbed five
basis points to 2.84 percent.  New Zealand’s annual trade deficit swelled to the widest in
more than three years in November as imports rose to a four-year
high and a rising currency curbed returns from exports, a report
today showed.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, rose to 2.77 percent from 2.73 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
