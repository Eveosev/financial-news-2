Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s
second-largest clothing retailer, will open its first store in
 Serbia  at a Belgrade shopping mall owned by Serbia’s richest
man, Miroslav Miskovic.  The Swedish retailer “will change the retail trade
structure in Serbia and position Belgrade as a primary shopping
destination” in the region, Miskovic’s Delta Holding said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The store, due to open in the fall, is part of H&M’s
expansion plans this year, which also include Chile, Estonia,
 Lithuania  and a franchise in Indonesia, the Stockholm-based
company said in a statement. The retailer said yesterday it’s
diversifying with a sixth brand, “& Other Stories,” with both
stores and online sales, after falling behind larger competitor
Inditex SA in the global race to attract price-sensitive
fashionistas.  “We see a potential for expansion within the country, but
now we are focusing on our first opening,” H&M spokeswoman
Camilla Emilsson-Falk said in e-mailed comments to  Bloomberg
News , without disclosing cost on investments.  Serbian retail trade has been declining since June, with
October and November activity falling 10.5 percent and 10.6
percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
