Chilean economists expect policy
makers to raise  interest rates  this year as inflation
accelerates, after forecasting no change in borrowing costs for
all of 2013 in a poll published last month.  Policy makers will keep borrowing costs unchanged at
today’s 5 percent for at least five months before raising them a
quarter-point by year-end, according to a monthly survey posted
on the central bank website today. The analysts polled in
December by the bank expected rates to reach 5.25 percent within
17 months after remaining unchanged this year.  Economists forecast the economy will expand 4.8 percent
this year and 5 percent in 2014, exceeding the nation’s average
growth rate of 4.4 percent in the decade through 2011. While
 inflation  will accelerate in 2013, the economic expansion still
won’t be enough to push the inflation rate above the bank’s
target range of 2 percent to 4 percent, according to the poll.  “Recent speculation that the strength of the local economy
would cause inflation to accelerate has so far proven wide of
the mark,” Michael Henderson,  emerging markets  economist at
Capital Economics, wrote in a note e-mailed to investors
yesterday.  The peso rose 0.16 percent to 470.58 per U.S. dollar at
8:43 a.m. Santiago time. Chile’s currency will trade at 475 per
dollar in two months, according to the median estimate of 59
analysts in today’s poll.  Inflation in the world’s top copper miner slowed to 1.5
percent last month from 2.1 percent in November even after
economic growth exceeded analyst estimates in eight of the past
12 months. Inflation will end 2013 and 2014 at 3 percent,
economists said in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
