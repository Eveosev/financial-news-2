Corn rose for a fourth day, heading
for the longest rally since October, on speculation that the
worst drought since the 1930s sent U.S. inventories to a nine-
year low. Soybeans dropped.  The government probably will say tomorrow that domestic
corn reserves on Dec. 1 fell 15 percent from a year earlier, the
biggest drop since 1995, according to a Bloomberg survey. Cash
 prices  yesterday in  Kansas City  were almost double the 10-year
average, while ethanol producers in  Cedar Rapids ,  Iowa , were
paying a premium of 28.4 cents a bushel over  Chicago  futures,
compared with a 4.4-cent discount a year earlier.  “Gains were fueled by expectations for the federal
government to trim its estimate for 2012 domestic corn
production,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in
Fowler, Indiana, said in a report to clients. “Cash markets are
firming” on increasing completion for supplies from U.S.
livestock producers and ethanol plants, he said.  Corn futures for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to
$6.9675 a bushel at 9:55 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for the first four-day rally since Oct. 19. Prices
rallied as much as 68 percent since mid-June to a record $8.49
on Aug. 10 before retreating.  Soybean futures for March delivery slid 0.2 percent to
$13.825 a bushel in Chicago. Through yesterday, the most-active
contract fell 23 percent since reaching a record $17.89 on Sept.
4 as rains boosted crops in Brazil and Argentina, the two
biggest producers after the U.S. last year.  Earlier, the contract gained 0.7 percent after the U.S.
Department of Agriculture reported export sales of 120,000
metric tons to  China  for delivery in the 12 months starting
Sept. 1 and 60,000 tons for delivery before Aug. 31. Exporters
reported sales of 281,500 tons to unknown destinations for
delivery by Aug. 31.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
