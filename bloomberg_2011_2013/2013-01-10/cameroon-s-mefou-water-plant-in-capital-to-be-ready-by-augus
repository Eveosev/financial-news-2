Cameroon’s Mefou water and sewage
treatment plant that will boost supplies in the capital Yaounde
will be operational by August, Water Resources and Energy
Minister Basile Atangana Kouna said today.  The $80 million supply and treatment facility will add
50,000 cubic meters of water a day for about 2 million residents
in Yaounde, the minister said. Water supplies in Yaounde are
about 100,000 cubic meters compared with demand of 300,000 cubic
meters, Atangana Kouna said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
