The Buffalo Bills hired former New
York Jets defensive coordinator Mike Pettine and brought in 33-
year-old Nathaniel Hackett to run the offense on new coach Doug Marrone’s staff.  Pettine, 46, spent four years with the Jets and his
contract expired after this season, when New York ranked eighth
in the  National Football League  in yards allowed and 20th in
scoring defense. He worked with Jets coach  Rex Ryan  since coming
to the NFL in 2002 with the  Baltimore Ravens .  “Rex and I are like brothers, brothers that fight a lot,”
Pettine, whose father won four state championships as a high
school football coach in Pennsylvania, said at a news conference
yesterday. “Rex and I have a very unique relationship. It’s a
strong bond based on the love of the game.”  The Bills’ defense allowed the seventh-most points in the
NFL last season as the team went 6-10, the same record as the
Jets in the American Football Conference’s East division.  Hackett returns to the Bills’ staff after three years under
Marrone at Syracuse University, where he was offensive
coordinator in 2011-12. Hackett was an offensive quality control
coach for the Bills from 2008 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
