Israel ’s 2022 government bonds fell,
lifting yields for the first time in three days, as investors
turned to riskier assets amid a rise in U.S. bond yields and a
recovery of global economies.  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark government bonds due
in 2022 gained five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
3.78 percent at the close in Tel Aviv. The benchmark TA-25 Index
of stocks rose 1.1 percent.  “Yields are rising abroad and there is a mood for riskier
assets because global economies are improving,” Ori Greenfeld,
macro economist at Psagot Investment House Ltd., said today by
phone. “People are selling bonds and moving to shares or
corporate bonds.”  Thirty-year Treasuries fell, extending a January decline
that almost wiped out 2012’s gain, as money managers prepared to
bid at a $13 billion auction of the securities today, the last
of three debt sales this week. European Central Bank policy
makers today kept interest rates on hold as improving economic
sentiment underpinned expectations of a gradual
recovery this year.  The Bank of Israel, led by Governor Stanley Fischer, cut
its benchmark interest rate last month to the lowest level in
more than two years to boost economic growth, which it estimates
may have slowed to 3.3 percent in 2012 from 4.6 percent in the
previous year. “Investors assume there is less pressure on the
 central bank to cut interest rates ,” Greenfeld said.  Corporate Sales  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for borrowing costs over the period, advanced 2.4
basis points to 1.725 percent. The shekel gained 0.3 percent to
3.7691 per dollar at 4:40 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  The two-year break-even rate, the difference between yields
on inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government notes of
similar maturity, retreated five basis points to 205, implying
an average annual inflation rate of 2.05 percent over the
period. The government’s price target range is between 1 percent
and 3 percent.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined 0.1  percent to 281.96.
Avgol Industries announced the private institutional placement
of as much as 22.5 million shekels of its Series B bonds. Israel
Aerospace Industries said it raised 1.2 billion shekels in a
sale of its series Gimmel notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
