Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
12 percent to the highest level in 11 months, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies including naphtha, gasoline and reformate
climbed 1.24 million barrels to 11.5 million in the seven days
to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today in
an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since Feb. 29.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen fell 1.04 million
barrels, or 5.5 percent, to 17.8 million, the ministry’s data
showed. Supplies declined for a fifth week, the longest losing
streak since April 2009.  Middle-distillate supplies including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene rose 778,000 barrels, or 7.6 percent, to 11 million,
according to the data. That’s the biggest gain in five weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
