Crude options volatility was little
changed as the underlying futures advanced to the highest level
in three months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 22.08 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 3:35 p.m., down from 22.19 percent
yesterday. It was the seventh consecutive day that volatility
was less than 25 percent.  February-delivery crude oil advanced 72 cents to $93.82 a
barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement since Sept. 18.
Volatility has lessened and  oil prices  have been little changed
since Congress approved a budget deal Jan. 2 to avert the
“fiscal cliff” of spending cuts and higher taxes for most
Americans that threatened the  U.S. economy .  “Implied volatility for crude oil has declined sharply,”
said Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy options broker at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
February $90 puts, which fell 8 cents to 13 cents a barrel on

calls were the second-most active, with 3,720 lots exchanged as
