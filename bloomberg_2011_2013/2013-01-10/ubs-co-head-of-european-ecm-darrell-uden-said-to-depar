Darrell Uden, a managing director
and co-head of equity capital markets for  UBS AG (UBSN)  in Europe, is
leaving the  firm , said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Uden, who joined UBS in 2011 after working for Citigroup
Inc., is leaving for personal reasons, said one of the people,
asking not to be named as the details aren’t public.  Chicco di Stasi, managing director and the other co-head of
ECM in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, will now run the unit
alone and Uden will not be replaced, the person said.  Uden, based in London, couldn’t immediately be reached on
his mobile phone. A spokesman for UBS declined to comment.  UBS, based in Zurich, said in October that it will cut
about 10,000 jobs and retreat from capital-intensive trading
businesses at the investment bank to increase profitability.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  is overhauling UBS
as stricter  capital requirements  and sluggish client activity
hurt profit at the investment bank. The bank will focus more on
its wealth-management business, the world’s second largest, to
boost returns for shareholders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
