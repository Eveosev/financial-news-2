Iran’s next elected president must
follow the “ideals” of Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
and avoid questioning the Islamic republic’s foundation, said a
senior member of the country’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.  “In the elections we must make the right pick and choose
someone who won’t question the regime,” Khamenei’s
representative to the guards, Ali Saeedi, was quoted as saying
in a report today by the state-run  Mehr  news agency.  “The president must follow the ideals and goals of the
supreme leader and have values, and not let position or pressure
change him,” Saeedi said in a speech yesterday.  The comments seem aimed at President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ,
who has challenged Khamenei’s authority ever since his 2009 re-
election amid widespread protests over voter fraud allegations.
They come as  Iran  prepares for a presidential election in June.
Ahmadinejad is constitutionally unable to run for a third
consecutive term.  The race takes place amid accelerating inflation and a drop
of about 40 percent in the national currency’s value against the
dollar as a result of tighter U.S. and European Union sanctions
over the country’s nuclear program. The economic pressure has
also revived political rivalries inside the Iranian leadership.  Iran’s supreme leader is appointed for life by senior
clerics and is the ultimate decision maker for the nation’s
affairs, while the president is elected by popular vote for a
four-year term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
