Tim Tebow  probably won’t be playing
quarterback next season with his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars,
General Manager David Caldwell said.  “I can’t imagine a scenario where Tim Tebow would be a
Jacksonville Jaguar,” Caldwell said in a news conference
yesterday, according to the National Football League team’s
Twitter page.  Tebow probably will be released or traded by the New York
Jets during the offseason, the New York Daily News reported last
month. The 25-year-old has expressed displeasure in his first
year with the Jets. He was used sparingly throughout the year
and coach Rex Ryan turned to third-string quarterback  Greg McElroy  late in the season when starter  Mark Sanchez  was benched.  Tebow grew up in Jacksonville and played at the University
of Florida in Gainesville. He opted to be traded in March to the
Jets instead of the Jaguars, according to ESPN.  Caldwell, who was named general manager three days ago,
also announced that first-year coach Mike Mularkey was fired
after the team finished 2-14, the worst season in the 18-year
history of the franchise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
