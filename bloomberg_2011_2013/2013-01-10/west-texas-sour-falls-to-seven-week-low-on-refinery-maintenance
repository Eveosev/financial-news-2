West Texas Sour crude fell to a 50-
day low on the  spot market  as  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  was scheduled
to begin maintenance at its refinery in  New Mexico  this month.  HollyFrontier planned to begin work on a crude unit, fluid
catalytic cracker and alkylation unit at its 100,000-barrel-a-
day Navajo refinery in Artesia, David Lamp, the company’s chief
operating officer, said in a conference call Nov. 7. The
refinery can process heavy, sour and light, sweet crude  and
runs a predominant slate of Permian Basin crudes, according to
the company’s website.  West Texas Sour, a low-density, high-sulfur oil loaded in
Midland, Texas, fell 75 cents to a discount of $18.50 a barrel
to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 3:48 p.m. in
New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
largest discount since Nov. 21.  Light, sweet oil in Midland dropped 65 cents to a discount
of $13.75 a barrel to the U.S. benchmark crude.  Production in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. oil
field, grew to 1.29 million barrels a day in December from an
average of 880,000 in 2009, according to a U.S. Energy
Department analysis of well data. The increase has outpaced
growth in pipeline capacity out of the region, leading to a glut
of oil.  The discount of West  Texas  Sour to WTI averaged $9.36 in
the fourth quarter of 2012, lowest quarterly average since
Bloomberg began recording prices in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
