China , the world’s biggest iron ore
buyer, boosted imports by 8.4 percent to a record last year amid
higher steel production and on speculation the economy is
recovering. December purchases were also at an all-time high.  Imports rose to 743.55 million metric tons in 2012,
according to customs  data released  today. Shipments last month
climbed to 70.94 million tons, up 7.8 percent from 65.78 million
tons in November and 11 percent higher than 64.11 million tons a
year earlier, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s  steel production  may have risen for a 31st year in
2012 driven by construction of railways, roads and bridges, even
as growth in the world’s second-largest economy slowed. Gross
domestic product is poised to expand 8.1 percent this year, from
7.7 percent in 2012, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed last month by Bloomberg, fueling optimism
for steel and iron ore demand.  “It is clear the government would continue with
urbanization plans this year, underpinning steel demand as well
as raw materials” demand, said Hu Yanping, Beijing-based chief
analyst with researcher Custeel.com, “The jump in prices has
factored in the market optimism.”  Iron ore  has rallied 83 percent since Sept. 5, rebounding
from a near-three year low. Ore with 62 percent content
delivered to Tianjin was unchanged at $158.5 a dry ton
yesterday, a 15-month high, according to data from the Steel
Index Ltd.  China’s steel production probably grew 5.1 percent to 720
million tons last year, according to an estimate by Custeel’s
Hu. Iron ore imports outpaced the growth of steel production as
Chinese mills switched to cheaper imports after iron ore prices
dropped during the July-September period.  China may announce steel output figures for 2012 next week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
