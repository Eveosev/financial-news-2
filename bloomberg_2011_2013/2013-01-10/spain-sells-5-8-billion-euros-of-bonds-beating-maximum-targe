Spain overshot its maximum target
and its borrowing costs fell during its first debt auction of
the year as the nation  aims  to raise net debt issuance by 24
percent in 2013.  The Madrid-based Treasury raised 5.82 billion euros ($7.6
billion) in the sale of three bonds, one of which hasn’t been
sold in recent months and a new two-year security with so-called
collective-action clauses limiting investors’ rights to oppose
writedowns. The upper target for the sale was 5 billion euros.  The 2015 note yielded 2.476 percent, compared with 3.282
percent the last time a similar maturity was sold on Oct. 4, the
2018 bond 3.988 percent, compared with 4.680 percent the last
time it was sold on Nov. 8, and the 2026 bond 5.555 percent,
compared with 5.593 percent on the secondary markets before the
sale.  Spain  aims to sell a net 71 billion euros of bonds and
bills this year, up from 57.1 billion euros of debt last year,
when it sold 55 percent more than planned. The Treasury faces
rising funding needs as most Spanish regions are locked out of
markets and a deepening  recession  blunts budget deficit cuts.  ‘No Imminent Concern’  “Today’s auction reflects there’s no imminent concern
Spain might go down the same road as Portugal, Ireland or
 Greece ,” Fadi Zaher, head of fixed-income sales and trading for
Barclays Wealth and  Investment Management  in  London , said in a
telephone interview. “Sentiment may dampen when budget cuts
start having an impact on the bank loans’ performance and
business is hurt as  consumer spending  is on its knees.”  Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  yield fell 13 basis points
to 5.040 percent after the sale at 11:08 a.m. in  Madrid ,
narrowing the spread with similar German maturities by as much
as 16 basis points to 3.54 percentage points. Demand for the
2015 bond was 2.07 times the amount sold, compared with 2.03 in
October, while the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.59 for the 2018
bond, compared with 1.57 in November. For the 2026 notes it was
2.85.  In office since December 2011, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
is hoping to avoid seeking a European Central Bank intervention
to lower Spain’s borrowing costs. The premier’s government is
struggling to meet budget goals set by the European Union to
tackle the second-largest shortfall in the euro area, as large
as Greece’s at 9.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2011.  Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs rose to a euro-era record
of 7.75 percent before ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to
save the euro on July 26. The program the ECB has since
presented, and which is known as OMT, would consist of debt
purchases on the secondary markets for nations requesting aid
from the EU’s ESM rescue-fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
