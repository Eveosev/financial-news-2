Taiwan ’s dollar rose to a one-week
high on speculation Japanese policy makers will expand stimulus
after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged the central bank to double
its inflation goal, and as Chinese exports beat estimates.  Abe said yesterday the  Bank of Japan (8301)  should aim for 2
percent inflation. Global funds boosted holdings of Taiwan’s
stocks by $4.9 billion in 2012, contributing to a 4 percent
appreciation in the local dollar, as bond-buying programs in the
U.S., Europe and  Japan  increased demand for emerging-market
assets. Exports from China, Taiwan’s biggest trade partner, rose
14.1 percent in December, almost triple the 5 percent gain
predicted in a Bloomberg analyst survey, data showed today.  “Japan boosting stimulus will flood markets like Taiwan
and  South Korea  with money,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based
foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “Japan’s
stimulus programs will further weaken the yen. Central banks in
Asia will look at the yen closely to maintain their export
competitiveness.”  The Taiwan dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.088 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached
NT$28.979 earlier, the strongest level since Jan. 3.  Foreign investors boosted their holdings of Taiwan stocks
for the first time in five days. Global funds bought $303
million more local equities than they sold today, exchange data
show.  Bond Sale  Taiwan’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
appreciation in the island’s currency during the final minutes
of trading on most days in the past nine months, according to
traders who asked not to be identified. The monetary authority’s
mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate stability and to
intervene in the event of abnormal moves, Governor Perng Fai-Nan
said Dec. 19.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.03 percent.  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 was
little changed at 0.909 percent after the government sold NT$40
billion ($1.4 billion) of five-year notes today at 0.911 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank
lending  rate was steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
