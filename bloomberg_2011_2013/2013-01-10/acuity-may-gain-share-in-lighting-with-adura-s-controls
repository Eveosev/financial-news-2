Acuity Brands Inc. (AYI) ’s purchase of
Adura Technologies Inc.’s assets will bring wireless control
systems that may help the Atlanta-based lighting company gain
share in commercial and industrial markets, said Colin McKerracher, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Acuity said San Francisco-based Adura’s wireless technology
will reduce power consumption for its light-emitting diode
installations at sites such as stores, schools, hospitals,
office buildings and parking garages. The deal was announced
Jan. 7 and terms weren’t provided.  Acuity typically uses a non-standardized communication
system to control lighting, McKerracher said. Adura’s wireless
technology is “an easy way to get an open communications
platform rather than their proprietary one,” he said today in
an interview from  London .  “Right now there are no industry standards for the way LED
lights interface with lighting controls,” McKerracher said.
“The control system component is set to become quite
important.”  Adura’s systems are already installed in about 7 million
square feet (650,000 square meters) of commercial space,
including 4 million square feet of covered parking lots. New
state and local regulations will require the eventual upgrade of
existing lighting systems at garages in the U.S., a market
opportunity that Acuity estimated at $15 billion to $20 billion
in the U.S.  “We’re in the early stages of a large-scale transition
toward LED lighting,” McKerracher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
