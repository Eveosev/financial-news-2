Greece ’s economy will show first
signs of growth between the end of this year and the beginning
of 2014, the Athens-based Foundation for Economic and Industrial
Research said.  The economy will shrink by about 4.6 percent in 2013 after
contracting by an estimated 6.6 percent in 2012, the foundation,
also known as IOBE, said today in its quarterly report on the
 Greek economy . That compares with a government forecast of 4.5
contraction in gross domestic product this year and 0.2 percent
growth next year.  Unemployment is expected to increase to 27.3 percent in
2013, after a revised 24.5 percent in 2012, IOBE said in an e-
mailed statement. Greece’s unemployment rate extended its record
high, climbing to 26.8 percent in October, the Greek Statistics
Service said today.  Greece is entering its sixth year of recession, after the
country’s coalition government imposed a new round of austerity
measures in November in exchange for a bailout from the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund . The recession and
unemployment have worsened amid spending cuts and tax increases
aimed at reducing a budget shortfall that was more than five
times the euro-area limit in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
