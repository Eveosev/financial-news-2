Canada ’s self-regulatory
organization for investment dealers called for reforms in the
way financial institutions set the reference rate for Canadian
bankers’ acceptances.  “There is a case in favor of reforming CDOR as a
benchmark,” the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada said today in an e-mailed statement, referring to the
Canadian Dealer Offered Rate.  IIROC said in July it was investigating CDOR practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
