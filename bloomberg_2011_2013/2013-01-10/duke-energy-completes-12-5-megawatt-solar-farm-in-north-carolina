Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner by market value, completed a 12.5-megawatt solar
farm in eastern North Carolina.  The Washington White Post plant in Beaufort County, about
110 miles (175 kilometers) east of Raleigh, is selling
electricity to North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency
under a 15-year agreement, Duke said today in a statement.  The solar farm is the largest that the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company operates in the eastern U.S. It went into
operation last month and has enough capacity to power about
3,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
