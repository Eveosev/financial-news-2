Morocco’s prime minister announced
plans to reform the state pension system that include raising
the  retirement age  to avoid its “collapse.”  “We will negotiate with unions, but raising the retirement
age is necessary to avoid collapse,”  Abdelilah Benkirane  said
in a speech to parliament late yesterday as he presented the
draft proposal. “It cannot continue like this.” A national
pension commission will meet on Jan. 23, he said.  The deficit of the Moroccan Pension Fund for public-sector
workers may reach 1.28 billion dirhams ($151 million) in 2014,
24.85 billion dirhams in 2021 and 45.66 billion dirhams in 2030,
the prime minister said. The accumulated deficit in 2020 will
reach 125 billion dirhams, he added.  The  International Monetary Fund  has urged the North African
country to push through changes to improve the business
environment, and support higher economic growth and job
creation. Redesigning the pension and subsidy systems were among
its suggested policy changes.  Benkirane, elected in 2011 after King Mohammed VI shifted
powers to the government as part of efforts to prevent pro-
democracy protests from escalating, said the fund was losing
money for several reasons, including changing demographics. He
provided no further details on the proposals.  Moroccans can currently retire at the age of 60. In
October, Finance Minister Nizar Baraka suggested raising it to
65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
