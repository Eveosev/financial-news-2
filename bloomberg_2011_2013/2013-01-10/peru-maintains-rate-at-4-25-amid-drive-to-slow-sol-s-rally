Peru  kept borrowing costs unchanged
for a 20th consecutive month as policy makers said their
decision reflects slowing inflation, stable economic growth and
a “complicated” external situation  The five-member board, led by bank President Julio Velarde,
yesterday held the  overnight rate  at 4.25 percent, the lowest in
Latin America along with Colombia, matching the forecasts of all
15 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  “Inflation is forecast to slow to 2 percent in 2013 due to
better conditions for food supply and a pace of economic grow
close to potential while global activity indicators remain
weak,” the bank’s board said, according to a  statement  posted
on the bank’s website.  Policy makers this month raised reserve requirements for
the fifth time since May as part of efforts to rein in lending
and help soak up inflows that pushed the  sol  to its strongest
level in 16 years. The pace of credit growth in South America’s
fastest-growing economy risks reviving inflation that slowed to
an 18-month low in December, said  Hugo Perea , the chief
economist at Banco Continental SA.  “If they want to avoid asset bubbles and excessive credit
growth, they’re going to use reserve requirements and not the
monetary policy rate,” Perea said in a phone interview from
Lima. “The bias on the current rate policy stance, if any, is
neutral.”  Peruvian lenders and companies are tapping overseas markets
for financing to take advantage of record low borrowing costs,
fueling dollar inflows and a strengthening of the sol.  Investment, Markets  The sol gained 5.4 percent last year, the best annual
performance since 2009, even after the central bank  purchased  a
record $13.9 billion in the spot market to soak up excess
greenbacks. The currency touched 2.5411 per U.S. dollar on Jan.
7, the strongest since October 1996.  Foreign direct investment, the biggest source of dollar
inflows, probably rose to a record $11.1 billion last year,
while non-residents purchased $2.42 billion of Peruvian
securities after being net sellers in 2011, the central bank
said in a Dec. 14 report.  Companies likely issued $1.9 billion bonds abroad in 2012
after selling none in 2011, the report showed.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell 1.87 percentage points to 3.88 percent
last year and has rallied further to 3.74 percent in 2013. The
 Lima General Index (IGBVL)  rose 5.9 percent in 2012 and has gained 6.2
percent already in 2013.  ‘Has to Appreciate’  “Peru is growing at a faster pace than everyone else so
the currency has to appreciate,” said  Pedro Tuesta , an
economist at 4Cast Inc., in a phone interview from  Washington .
“There’s no way to avoid that.”  Construction is booming in the Andean nation amid
investment in mines, power plants, infrastructure and homes.  Economic activity grew 6.7 percent in October from the year
earlier after a 5.9 percent increase in September, exceeding the
estimates of  economists  and the central bank.  Policy makers increased the reserve ratio by 0.75
percentage point for dollar deposits and 0.25 percentage point
for soles, effective Jan. 1.  Banks held an average 17.8 percent of their sol deposits
and 40 percent of their dollar deposits at the central bank in
October, according to the central bank.  Dollar credit increased 16.6 percent to $28.3 billion in
November, the fastest pace in eight months, and accounted for
43.4 percent of all outstanding loans to companies and
households, the central bank said in a Dec. 28  report . Sol loans
grew 16.6 percent, the slowest since May.  The country’s banking regulator in November told lenders to
set aside more funds against potential losses on mortgages and
car loans after delinquency rates rose to a two-year high of
1.79 percent in October.  ‘Near Potential’ GDP  Still, concern that the global economic outlook could
deteriorate has led policy makers to keep rates unchanged for
the longest period since Peru’s central bank began targeting
inflation in 2002.  Exports slid 0.9 percent to $41.5 billion in the first
eleven months of 2012 from the same period a year earlier,
exporters association Adex said Jan. 7. Exports in November rose
13.2 percent, the national statistics institute reported Jan. 9.  Consumer prices rose 0.26 percent last month while the
 annual inflation  rate last month slid to 2.65 percent from 2.66
percent in November and 3.25 percent the previous month.  Inflation will slow to about 2 percent this year, the mid-
point of the central bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range,
the bank said Dec. 14.  The central bank can maintain a neutral stance this year as
investment-driven growth shouldn’t stoke consumer prices, Tuesta
said.  “Inflation isn’t running away from the band and GDP is
near potential,” Tuesta said. “They don’t have any urgency to
hike.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
