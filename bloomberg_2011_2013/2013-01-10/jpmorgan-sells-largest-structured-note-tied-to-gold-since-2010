JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $35
million of one-year notes linked to the price of gold, the
bank’s largest offering tied to the precious metal in at least
three years.  The securities, issued Jan. 2, yield three times the gains
of the price of gold in  London  up to 15.6 percent, with no
protection against losses and all capital at risk, according to
a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The metal’s price  increased  8.3 percent last year in
London.  The bank sold $82.4 million of notes tied to gold in eight
offerings last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
New York-based JPMorgan issued $27.8 million of one-year
securities on Oct. 26, the next-largest  deal  since 2010, when
Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on U.S. structured
notes.  Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the latest offering or future gold notes.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
