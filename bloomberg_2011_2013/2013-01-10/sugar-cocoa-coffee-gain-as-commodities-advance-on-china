Sugar, cocoa and coffee climbed in
London and New York as raw materials advanced after Chinese data
showed exports increased more than forecast in December.  China ’s overseas shipments increased 14.1 percent from a
year earlier, the most since May, customs administration data
showed today. That compares with the 5 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 40 economists. A broad measure of
credit in the Asian nation surged 28 percent. The data lifted
commodity prices, with the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
raw materials rising as much as 1.1 percent. Cotton also gained
in New York.  “The general market sentiment is positive, lifting
commodity prices across the board,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst
at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail today. “China’s
data were the trigger for this.”  Robusta coffee for March delivery advanced 0.7 percent to
$1,924 a metric ton by 10:32 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
White, or refined, sugar for March delivery was up 0.7 percent
to $510.70 a ton, while cocoa for delivery in the same period
gained 0.3 percent to 1,430 pounds ($2,295) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  The Chinese export and credit figures helped the Asian
nation’s new leaders sustain a pickup in economic growth after a
seven-quarter slowdown. Aggregate financing of 1.63 trillion
yuan ($262 billion), which includes bank and non-bank lending,
was up from 1.27 trillion  yuan  a year earlier, according to the
central bank.  In New York, arabica coffee for March delivery rose 0.7
percent to $1.49 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Raw sugar for March
delivery gained 1 percent to 18.91 cents a pound and cocoa for
delivery in the same period was up 0.9 percent to $2,242 a ton.
Cotton for March delivery advanced 0.3 percent to 75.03 cents a
pound on ICE.  “Soft commodities prices have fallen to such low levels
that bearish news should be priced in now,” Fritsch said.
Arabica coffee fell 37 percent in New York in 2012, while raw
sugar declined 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
