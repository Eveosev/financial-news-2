Plans to build a barrage for
generating electricity across the Severn Estuary would provide
the U.K. “massive savings running into the billions” of pounds
on flood protection, a member of Parliament said.  Peter Hain, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party
whose constituency in  Wales  would be near the facility, said the
barrage wouldn’t require more subsidy than offshore wind power,
which the government is encouraging as an alternative to
generators powered by fossil fuels.  Hain spoke today at a hearing of the Energy and Climate
Change Committee in Parliament in  London . The barrage has been
proposed by Hafren Power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
