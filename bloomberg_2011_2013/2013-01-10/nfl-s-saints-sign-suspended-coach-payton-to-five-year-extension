The  New Orleans Saints  signed a
five-year contract extension with coach  Sean Payton , who was
suspended for the 2012 season due to a performance pool in which
players got bonuses for injuring opponents.  The Saints announced yesterday on their  website  that
Payton’s extension runs through the 2017 National Football
League season.  Terms of the deal were not released by the team. ESPN
reported Dec. 29 that Payton will receive more than $8 million
per season, making him the NFL’s highest-paid coach. ESPN based
its report on a person in the league who requested anonymity.  “I am excited that we have finalized this contract with
Sean,” Saints owner Tom Benson said in a statement on the
team’s website. “We have already begun preparations for the
2013 season and I look forward to getting Sean back in the
building as soon as possible, as I know our fans do as well.”  Since being hired by the Saints in January 2006, Payton, 49,
has led the club to a 62-34 record as well as three division
titles and four postseason appearances. The 2009 New Orleans
squad won the  Super Bowl .  To contact the reporter on this story:
