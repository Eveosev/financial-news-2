The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau will unveil plans for a simplified mortgage disclosure
this summer, its director,  Richard Cordray , said in an
interview.  “We have to do some quantitative consumer testing on that
to really get to the finish line,” Cordray said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television that will air today. “I think that
will be a game changer in the market because consumers will be
able to see in a single document the main key points they need
to know without all of the fine print that has often obscured
and confused consumers.”  Under a mandate of the Dodd-Frank law of 2010, the consumer
bureau had to propose by July 21, 2012, a simplified mortgage
shopping sheet that aimed to enable comparisons. The 1,099-page
proposal subsequently drew strong criticism from lawmakers and
smaller banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
