Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , the
Japanese refining unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , and
Development  Bank of Japan (8301)  Inc. agreed to set up a venture to
finance utility-scale solar power plants in  Japan .  Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of Showa Shell, will take a 60
percent stake in the venture, while state-run DBJ will hold the
rest, Solar Frontier said in a statement today. The venture will
invest in projects totaling 100 megawatts a year, according to
the statement.  The partners could finance projects worth as much as 40
billion yen ($454 million) a year, the Nikkei newspaper reported
earlier, without saying where it got the information.  Solar Frontier will supply its thin-film panels for the
venture, according to Akane Yamiya, a company spokeswoman. She
declined to comment on yearly project funding.  Solar Frontier makes panels using copper, indium, gallium
and selenium, known as CIGS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
