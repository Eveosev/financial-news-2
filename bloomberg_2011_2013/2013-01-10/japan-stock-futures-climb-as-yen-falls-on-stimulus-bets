Japanese stock futures rose, with
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average poised for a third day of gains, as
the yen fell to the lowest level since 2010 amid speculation
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to announce more stimulus
measures. Australian equities gained.  American Depositary Receipts  of Nissan Motor Co. and Honda
Motor Co., which both generate around 80 percent of their sales
from overseas, climbed 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, increased 2.3
percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,775 in Chicago yesterday, up from 10,660 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,790 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little
changed.  “There is significant scope for the equity market to
outperform in 2013 if Abe’s promised reforms are undertaken,”
said  Sean Darby , chief global equity strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. in  Hong Kong . “A weaker yen would be beneficial for
export-led sectors such as the automobile, electronics and
machinery sectors.”  The yen slid to the weakest level since July 2010 against
the dollar today after a Nikkei report quoted Abe as saying the
central bank should include maximum employment among its goals.  Stimulus Measures  The government will announce around 12 trillion yen ($136
billion) in fiscal stimulus measures to boost the nation’s
shrinking economy, Japanese media reported on Jan 7. Japan’s
Economy Minister Akira Amari told reporters in Tokyo on Jan. 8
that the size of economic stimulus would be significant.  The Nikkei 225 has risen 23 percent from Nov. 14 when
Japanese elections were announced, driving the measure into a
 bull market , on expectations Abe’s new government would call for
more stimulus. The yen weakened today to 88.78 per dollar.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose to a 17-month high
yesterday as Chinese export data beat forecasts. The gauge
capped seven straight weeks of gains last week as the  U.S.
Congress  approved a budget deal.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  increased 0.2 percent today.
The benchmark index for U.S. equities yesterday advanced to the
highest level in five years, led by a rally in financial shares.
The gauge traded at 14.1 times estimated earnings, compared with
13.3 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a multiple of
12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 1.7 percent to 102.47 yesterday
in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
