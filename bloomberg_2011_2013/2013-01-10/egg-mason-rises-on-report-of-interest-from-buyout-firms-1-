Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the money manager
searching for a new chief executive officer, rose the most in
four months after a report said two buyout firms have shown an
interest in taking it private.  Legg Mason climbed  3.2 percent  to $26.84, the biggest gain
since Sept. 11, after Reuters said today that two large private-
equity investors showed interest in financing a buyout led by
the Baltimore-based firm’s largest affiliates. Legg Mason’s
board has refused to engage in discussions about a sale, said
Reuters, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the
matter.  Mary Athridge , a spokeswoman for Legg Mason, declined to
comment on the report.  The company is in transition, following the departure of
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Fetting , who stepped down Oct. 1
amid pressure from activist investor  Nelson Peltz  to improve
performance and reverse redemptions. Joseph A. Sullivan, head of
global distribution, is serving as interim CEO while the board
looks for a permanent successor to Fetting.  The company’s largest bond affiliate is Western Asset
Management Co., which is seeking more control of its fund sales,
a person familiar with the matter said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
