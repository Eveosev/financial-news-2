Richard’s Bay Coal Terminal on  South
Africa ’s eastern coast shipped the most fuel in 2012 for six
years as U.S. exports pushed down prices while demand held for
higher-quality African coal.  Shipments rose 4.3 percent to 68.3 million metric tons, the
highest level since 2006, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on data published today on the company’s  website .  “I think that there’s a combination of quality and price
that makes it attractive to buyers,” said Xavier Prevost at XMP
Consulting in Pretoria. “The mines were not willing to produce
more because the price was very low.”  Spot prices for coal shipped from Richards Bay reached an
annual low of $79.87 a ton on Nov. 2, according to data on
Bloomberg provided by IHS McCloskey. They have risen 11 percent
since to $88.94. Prices averaged $92.89 in 2012, 20 percent
cheaper than 2011’s $116.20, according to IHS McCloskey.  “A lot of the coal that Americans were supposed to sell
remained, so they decided to go into a very aggressive export,”
Prevost said. Many of the buyers in China,  India  and  Europe 
preferred the higher quality coal from South Africa, he said.  Total U.S. coal exports for the quarter ended June rose to
 the highest level  on record, according to the Energy Department.  The port, whose owners include  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , has capacity to export 91 million tons annually.
It had 3.3 million tons of stockpiles at the end of the year,
nearly double the 1.7 million tons at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
