The global solar market will rise 22
percent to 33.4 gigawatts in 2013, with gains in  China , the U.S.
and  India  more than offsetting declines in Germany and  Italy ,
Deutsche Bank predicted today in a note to investors.  The Chinese market, the second biggest in 2012, will more
than double to 10 gigawatts this year from 4 gigawatts last
year, Deutsche said. The Indian market will more than triple to
4 gigawatts and the U.S. will rise 29 percent to 4.5 gigawatts,
the bankâ€™s analysts, led by  Vishal Shah , predicted in the note.  Those gains will help offset declines in European markets,
led by Germany and Italy, where demand will be cut in half,
according to the bank. Those two countries were the biggest and
third-largest markets in 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
