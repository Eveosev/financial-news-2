Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) 
expressed interest in buying a stake in  Bank of Ayudhya Pcl  from
 General Electric Co. (GE) , which has yet to give an offer for the
Thai lender, said an executive from Japan’s biggest bank.  “We expressed our interest but it hasn’t reached the
discussion stage yet,” Takashi Morimura, deputy president and
group CEO of global banking at lending unit Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., said in an interview today.  Mitsubishi UFJ won bidding to buy GE’s 25.3 percent stake
in Bank of Ayudhya, the Kao Hoon newspaper reported on Dec. 24.
The Japanese bank is expanding in  Southeast Asia  amid tepid loan
demand at home, last month announcing plans to buy 20 percent of
Hanoi-based  VietinBank (CTG)  for 15.5 trillion dong ($743 million).  “Our name was well received but at this stage we haven’t
received a firm offer” from GE, Morimura said in  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporter on this story:
