Copper  imports  by  China , the world’s
largest user, declined 6.6 percent in December from a month
earlier as the arbitrage window, or buying the metal in  London 
and selling in China, remained closed.  Inbound shipments of refined metal, alloy and products were
341,211 metric tons last month, the General Administration of
Customs said on its website today. That compared with 365,331
tons in November, and a record 508,942 tons a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A drop of arrivals in China could help to cap inventories
at the highest in eight months as domestic production advanced.
Trade data released today showed the largest metals user
sustained a pickup in growth as total imports grew 6 percent in
December and exports rose 14.1 percent, both exceeding estimates.  “Copper imports will probably remain steady in the next
couple of months, supported by financing deals, while huge local
inventories will keep arbitrage trade unprofitable,” Liang Lijuan, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co., said from Beijing.  Copper  stockpiles  tallied by the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange
climbed to 206,458 tons last week, the highest since April 19.
Output climbed to a record 531,000 tons in November.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange traded at $8,094 a ton at 12:26 p.m. in Shanghai, $79
higher than futures for April delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange at 58,440  yuan  ($9,391) a ton, including a 17 percent
value-added tax.  Scrap-copper imports rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier
to 4.86 million tons in 2012, customs data showed. Imports of
unwrought copper and products gained 14 percent to 4.65 million
tons last year. Imports of unwrought aluminum and products
jumped 29 percent to 1.17 million tons, while exports of
unwrought aluminum fell 18 percent to 631,214 tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
