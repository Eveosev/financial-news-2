Spain’s government bonds surged,
with two-year yields falling to the lowest level since October
2010, after the nation sold more securities than planned at its
first debt auction this year.  Spanish  10-year yields  fell below 5 percent for the first
time since March and Italian bonds also rallied as optimism the
European financial crisis is easing spurred demand for the debt
of so-called peripheral countries. German bonds slumped, with
 two - and 10-year yields climbing to the highest levels in 11
weeks, after the  European Central Bank  refrained from cutting
its key  interest rate  and President  Mario Draghi  said the
decision was “unanimous.”  “The auction went very well and the size was also higher
than the market was expecting,” said Mohit Kumar, the head of
European interest-rate strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London .
“German bonds are falling as Draghi is being on the
constructive side. That is paring down market expectations of an
ECB rate cut in the near future.”  Spain’s  two-year yields  slid 29 basis points, or 0.29
percentage point, to 2.10 percent at 4:33 p.m. London time,
after falling to 2.08 percent, the lowest since Oct. 28, 2010.
The 3.3 percent note due in October 2014 rose 0.515, or 5.15
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,322) face amount, to 102.08.  The country’s 10-year yield declined as much as 24 basis
points to 4.89 percent, the  lowest  level since March 2.  Yield Spread  Spain  sold a combined 5.8 billion euros of securities,
above its target of 5 billion euros.  Investors bought January 2018 notes at an average yield of
3.988 percent, versus 4.68 percent at the previous auction on
Nov. 8. The new March 2015 securities, which include collective-
action clauses that limit investors’ rights to oppose
writedowns, were sold at an average yield of 2.476 percent. It
also sold 2016 notes.  The yield difference, or  spread , between Spanish two- and
10-year yields increased to the most in more than four months,
based on closing-market rates.  The spread widened to 282 basis points, the most since
Sept. 7, the day after ECB President Draghi announced a plan to
buy short-dated securities when requested by indebted nations.  “When you stack some of these countries like Spain and
 Italy  against the alternatives in global fixed-income, they look
like pretty good yields,”  Andrew Bosomworth , managing director
at Pacific Investment Management Co. in London, said on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Francine Lacqua . “On
a relative-value basis, I think this part of the world is worth
investing in.”  Italy's Bonds  Italy’s  two-year yields  declined as much as 27 basis points
to 1.28 percent, the least since April 2010. Ten-year yields
dropped 15 basis points to 4.13 percent, the lowest since
November 2010.  The  gap  between Italy’s two- and 10-year yields widened to
285 basis points, the most since Nov. 8.  The ECB left its main  refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.75
percent today, as forecast by 50 of 55 economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . Five had predicted a reduction to 0.5 percent.  The unanimous decision by policy makers and Draghi’s
comment on market stability “clearly defuse any rate cut
speculation,” said  Peter Schaffrik , the head of European
interest-rate strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “We
do not think there will be a cut, and we do not think there will
be any move in the ECB rate at all in 2013.”  German Bunds  German 10-year bunds snapped a three-day advance after
Draghi, speaking at a press conference in  Frankfurt , said the
euro-area economy should gradually recover in the second half of
this year.  Germany ’s two-year note yield climbed as much as five basis
points to 0.105 percent, the highest since Oct. 26. The 10-year
rate rose eight basis points to 1.56 percent, after reaching
1.57 percent, also the highest since Oct. 26. The yield dropped
six basis points during the previous three days.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of the Netherlands and Italy,
according to measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt,
the yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit
default swaps.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said today
the euro crisis may have passed its most difficult phase.  “I think the worst probably is over, but what we still
have to do is difficult,” Juncker, who also heads the group of
euro-area finance ministers, told a European Parliament
committee today in Brussels.  Spanish bonds returned 1.1 percent this month through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
securities gained 1.4 percent and German debt lost 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
