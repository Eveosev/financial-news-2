Perdaman Chemicals & Fertilisers
Pty, which is developing a fertilizer plant in  Australia , sued
ICICI Bank Ltd., claiming the Indian bank restrained Griffin
Coal Mining Co. from supplying coal to the project.  ICICI “used unfair tactics and acted in bad faith,”
Perdaman said in its lawsuit filed Jan. 3 with the federal court
in  Western Australia .  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI) , an Indian power
producer, acquired Perth-based Griffin Coal in 2011 using
financing from ICICI.  Perdaman had sued Lanco and Griffin claiming a coal-supply
agreement was illegally terminated after Lanco acquired Griffin.
Perdaman had said then the termination prevented it from getting
financing for the construction of the urea fertilizer plant. The
present value of the plant is at least $3.39 billion, Perdaman
said in its lawsuit.  ICICI, based in Mumbai, declined to comment on the case.
The Indian lender has no contractual relationship with Perdaman,
Lanco said in an e-mailed statement today.  The case is Perdaman Chemicals & Fertilisers Pty v  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  WAD1/2013. Federal Court of Australia (Perth).  To contact the reporter on this story:
