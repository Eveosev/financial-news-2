San Francisco  office rents jumped 27
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier as reduced
occupancy gains signaled a market “downshift” for 2013,
according to broker  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)   The average rent was $48.83 a square foot, up 5.9 percent
from the previous three months, Los Angeles-based CBRE said in a
report. It was the 11th straight quarterly advance, according to
Colin Yasukochi, CBRE’s director of research and analytics in
San Francisco. The rapid pace of growth, driven by large deals
by expanding technology companies, may slow as tenants balk at
asking rates for top-quality space, the brokerage said in the
report.  “San Francisco has been defying the slow economic growth
throughout the country, but there is some uncertainty now in the
market,” Frank Fudem, a tenant broker and San Francisco-based
partner at real estate services firm Cassidy Turley, said in an
interview. “When rents get north of $50, people talk
differently.”  Newly occupied  office space  in San Francisco increased by
1.3 million square feet (121,000 square meters) last year, a 38
percent drop from 2011, according to CBRE data. Citywide office
costs -- including rent, taxes and service charges -- soared 36
percent, the biggest gain of any global office market, CBRE said
in a separate report on Dec. 14.  Technology firms accounted for 55 percent of the 10.9
million square feet of space leased last year, with San
Francisco-based  Salesforce (CRM) .com accounting for 1.28 million
square feet, the biggest annual commitment by a single company
since at least 2000, according to CBRE.  Salesforce, Square  Salesforce, the largest maker of online customer-management
software, signed five leases, including a fourth-quarter deal
for 444,000 square feet at  Kilroy Realty Corp. ’s planned 350
Mission St. tower. Other large leases in the period included
mobile-payment provider Square Inc.’s agreement for 250,000
square feet at 1455 Market St., and software maker  Splunk Inc. (SPLK) ’s
deal for 92,000 square feet at 250 Brannan St., also a Kilroy
property, CBRE said.  Finance, insurance and real estate firms haven’t expanded
following sharp contractions resulting from the 2008 financial
crisis, Jak Churton, a CBRE managing director, said in a
telephone interview. Like technology firms, those traditional
tenants have configured workplaces with employees sitting side
by side rather than at individual desks, reducing space needs.
Still, rents may advance as much as 12 percent amid limited new
supply, he said.  “We still need to see growth in the FIRE industries, which
cut a lot and never rehired,” Churton said. “I don’t think
we’re going to see rents moving up in the high double digits,
but 8 percent or 12 percent would be a boom outside the  Bay
Area .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
