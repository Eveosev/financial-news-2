Xylem Inc. (XYL) , the  ITT Corp. (ITT)  spin-off
whose pumps helped clean Hurricane Sandy floodwaters, said it
won a NASA contract for technology that may help detect water on
the moon.  Under the $300,000 contract, Xylem will provide NASA with
mass spectrometer technology that could be used in a mission to
the moon, the  White Plains , New York-based company said today in
a statement. Mass spectrometers can measure the mass and
relative concentrations of different atoms and molecules.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is
currently developing a rover mission called Resolve for a
potential mission to the moon to determine whether water seen
from orbit is accessible. That could provide a break-through
opening up exploration of the rest of the solar system to
humans, according to the NASA  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
