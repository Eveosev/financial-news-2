Beijing Automotive Group Co., which
makes vehicles in China with  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,
hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  for the Hong
Kong initial public offering of its car unit, three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  The Beijing-based company, known as BAIC, may seek more
than $1 billion in the IPO as soon as this year, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. The IPO would be the biggest by an automaker since
 General Motors Co. (GM) ’s $18.1 billion offering in 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  BAIC would use IPO proceeds to develop its own brand,
Chairman Xu Heyi said in September. The state-owned company,
which traces its roots to making sidecar motorcycles used in the
 Korean War , has said it wants to make “world-class” cars by
2025 and hired Ferrari designer Leonardo Fioravanti to help
improve its brand appeal.  The IPO may get pushed into 2014 as BAIC restructures the
car unit, said one of the people. A press official at BAIC said
he couldn’t immediately comment.  New share sales by Chinese companies in Hong Kong have
slowed along with growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
Chinese companies raised $6.4 billion in Hong Kong IPOs last
year, the smallest amount since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
