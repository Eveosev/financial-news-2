Bonavista Energy Corp. (BNP)  fell to its
lowest in more than three years after the Canadian oil and
natural gas producer almost halved its dividend to cope with
lower gas prices.  The shares fell 1.8 percent to C$13.83 at 11:50 a.m. in
Toronto, after earlier dropping to C$13.02, the lowest intraday
since Mar. 11, 2009.  Bonavista will reduce the monthly dividend to 7 Canadian
cents (7 cents) a share from 12 Canadian cents, beginning with
the payment due February 15, the Calgary-based company said in a
statement yesterday after the close of trading.  Bonavista, like other Canadian producers, has suffered from
falling gas prices and discounted Canadian crude. The company
will focus on investment to expand operations and plans to
provide shareholders with a “sustainable balance” between
growth and dividends, according to the statement.  “Despite encouraging signs of recovery in the fall of
2012, North American natural gas fundamentals have deteriorated
significantly since that point,” the company said in the
statement.  The dividend cut may offer only a “short-term reprieve,”
Matt Donohue, a Calgary-based analyst at UBS said in a note to
investors today.  “Payouts under our numbers remain higher then we would
like through 2013,” said Donohue, who rates the shares a buy.  Bonavista operates in the western Canadian provinces of
British Columbia,  Alberta  and Saskatchewan. Current production
is about 61 percent natural gas, according to the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
