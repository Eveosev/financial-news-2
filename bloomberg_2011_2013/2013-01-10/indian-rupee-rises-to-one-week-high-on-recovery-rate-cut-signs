India ’s rupee climbed to a one-week
high on speculation the central bank will reduce borrowing costs
to support growth amid signs of a recovery in the global
economy.  Wholesale prices rose 7.37 percent in December from a year
earlier, near the 10-month low of 7.24 percent in November,
according to the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey
before data due Jan. 14. The Reserve Bank of India will review
interest rates on Jan. 29.  China ’s exports rose more than
forecast last month, official data showed today, and Credit
Agricole CIB predicts a slowdown in the pace of contraction of
Indian shipments.  “India’s trade results should help support the rupee,”
analysts at Credit Agricole, including Paris-based Sebastien Barbe, wrote in a research report today. An interest-rate cut
would “boost sentiment,” they wrote.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 54.5750 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
54.5656 earlier, the strongest since Jan. 3. The currency
advanced for a third day and has gained 0.9 percent this week.
One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 9.85 percent.  Over the past two days, Credit Agricole and Credit Suisse
AG have recommended buying the rupee, saying interest-rate
reductions and the government’s policy revamps will boost the
currency.  Indian  exports  fell 4.2 percent in November, official data
show, the seventh straight month of decreases. December data are
due anytime in the coming five days.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.57 per
dollar, compared with 55.82 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.57 versus 55.78. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
