European Union carbon permits fell
to near a record after the bloc sold allowances in an auction at
a price below the prevailing market level for a second time this
week.  The contract for December declined 2.6 percent to 6.05
euros ($8.01) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the lowest close since the record on Dec. 4. United
Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December rose 1 cent
to 47 euro cents a ton at 4:59 p.m.  The bloc sold 3.5 million tons of prompt-delivery EU
permits at 5.93 euros a ton in the auction, held by the European
Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig,  Germany . Day-ahead futures for
Phase 3 permits eligible through 2020 were at 5.98 euros at the
auction close, the mid-point between the best bid and offer.  The EU scheduled a vote on Jan. 23 on draft carbon-registry
regulation that may include limits on some imported emission
credits and it’s seeking further talks on an emission-permit
glut fix, according to an EU document obtained by Bloomberg.  Member states  will continue discussions on the commission’s
proposal to delay auctions of 900 million carbon permits in the
three years through 2015, according to the document. Several
nations, including the U.K. and Germany, were undecided at their
previous meeting about whether they would back the measure,
known as backloading, an EU official, who declined to be
identified, said last month.  German and French power for 2014 declined to records as
carbon slipped. German 2014 power, a European benchmark, lost as
much as 0.9 percent to 44.35 euros a megawatt-hour, while its
French counterpart slid 0.5 percent to 47 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
