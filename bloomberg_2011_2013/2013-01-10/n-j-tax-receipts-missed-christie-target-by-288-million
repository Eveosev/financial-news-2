New Jersey tax collections fell $288
million below Governor  Chris Christie ’s fiscal 2012 target,
winding up closer to projections made by a legislative analyst
the Republican once called the “Dr. Kevorkian of the numbers.”  Christie, who is seeking a second term in November’s state
election, battled with  David Rosen , a budget analyst with the
nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, after Rosen warned
lawmakers that 2012 revenue was short of plan by $250 million.  Receipts came to almost $29.1 billion for the 12 months
that ended June 30, while the budget Christie signed in 2011
called for $29.4 billion, according to the state’s Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report posted yesterday and budget documents.
Rosen’s warning in September led lawmakers to block funding for
a tax-cut proposal from Christie, who is 50 years old.  “We had the right message: Let’s wait and see,”
Assemblyman Vincent Prieto, a Democrat from Secaucus who leads
the chamber’s budget panel, said in an interview. Lawmakers had
set aside $183 million to cover the governor’s tax-relief
program and have refused to release the money.  Bill Quinn, a Treasury spokesman, declined to comment on
the annual financial report.  Christie’s administration trimmed some spending and moved
money between accounts to cover most of the 2012 revenue
shortfall. The administration covered a remaining $123 million
gap by drawing down the year-end balance, leaving the amount
that can be applied to this year’s spending plan at $446
million, state documents indicate.  2014 Outlook  The governor’s 2013 budget counted on a $570 million
carryover from the previous year. The lower actual amount may
affect his 2014 spending plan if revenue continues to trail
targets through June.  Christie’s characterization of Rosen in May followed the
analyst’s statement that state revenue may miss the governor’s
projections by as much as $1.8 billion through the end of the
current fiscal year, potentially dousing the Republican’s tax-
cut plans. Dr. Jack Kevorkian advocated for the legalization of
assisted suicide before he died in June 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
