Thailand ’s baht fell, snapping a
three-day rally, on speculation the central bank will intervene
to slow gains that may hurt exports. Bonds were steady.  The Bank of Thailand will monitor capital flows, it said
yesterday after keeping the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at
2.75 percent. The baht touched a 10-month high on Jan. 3 as
overseas investors  bought  9.9 billion baht ($327 million) more
local stocks than they sold this year through yesterday and
pumped a net $1.3 billion into sovereign notes, data from the
stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association show.  “Emerging-market currencies, especially in  Asia , have been
strengthening versus the dollar with fund inflows to the
region,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust and
fixed-income business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in  Tokyo .
“The central bank will not try to reverse the trend but may
want to slow the pace of appreciation.”  The baht slipped 0.1 percent to 30.39 per dollar as of 8:45
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
reached 30.29 on Jan. 3, the strongest level since March 1, 2012,
and has risen 0.6 percent this year, the biggest advance among
the 11 most-traded Asian currencies.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.07 percent.  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of  Southeast
Asia ’s second-largest economy, climbed 27 percent in November
from a year earlier, after increasing 14 percent the previous
month, official data showed.  While weakness in Europe and Japan persists, there is a
broad-based recovery in Thai overseas sales and the performance
of Asian economies has turned positive, the central bank said
yesterday. A stronger currency makes Thai goods more expensive
for overseas buyers relative to its rivals.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 was little changed at 3.68 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
