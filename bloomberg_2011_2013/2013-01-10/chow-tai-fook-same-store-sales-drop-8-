Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) ,
the world’s biggest jeweler by market value, posted an 8 percent
drop in third-quarter same-store sales as Chinese shoppers
curbed spending amid a slower economy.  Sales at outlets open at least a year fell 11 percent on
China’s mainland and 6 percent in  Hong Kong  and Macau during the
three months ended December, the company said in a stock
exchange statement yesterday.  The Hong Kong-based chain in November reported first-half
profit that missed analysts’ estimates amid hedging losses on
gold contracts and slower  consumer spending . Revenue climbed 4
percent in the quarter as the jeweler added 70 outlets amid a
push to reach Chinese shoppers in smaller cities.  The company expects to report a decline in same-store sales
for this fiscal year, Finance Director Hamilton Cheng told
reporters on a conference call yesterday.  The company, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Cheng Yu- tung, is betting China’s increasingly affluent shoppers will
help boost profits. Chinese consumers overtook U.S. shoppers in
2012 to become the world’s biggest buyers of  luxury goods ,
consultancy firm Bain & Co. said last month. The company plans
to add 45 to 50 outlets in its fiscal fourth quarter.  Chow Tai Fook rose 1.6 percent to close at HK$13 in Hong
Kong trading yesterday. The stock fell 11 percent last year
while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained 23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
