Malaysian industrial output growth
quickened in November to the fastest in six months as the 
global economy’s recovery boosts demand for Asian goods.  Production at factories, utilities and mines rose 7.5
percent from a year earlier after gaining a revised 6.4 percent
in October, the statistics department said in a statement today.
The median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
5.9 percent increase.  China ’s exports and imports rose to a record in December,
official data today showed, while U.S. companies added more
workers than projected last month, signaling the world’s largest
economies are picking up.  Malaysia ’s  exports  rebounded at a
stronger pace than estimated in November on bigger shipments of
electronics and petroleum products, a report showed yesterday.  “With China’s ongoing strength, Asian economies will get a
huge boost from increasing demand,”  Frederic Neumann , co-head
of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong ,
said before the report. “Commodity exports continue to benefit
from China’s appetite for raw materials.”  Manufacturing output gained 7.6 percent in November from a
year earlier, after a revised 6.6 percent increase the previous
month, today’s report showed. Mining rose 7.5 percent, while
electricity production grew 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
