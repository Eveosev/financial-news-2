Fulcrum Asset Management LLP, the
$1.4 billion computer-driven hedge fund group founded by former
British Broadcasting Corp. Chairman Gavyn Davies, has lost its
head trader, James Horrocks.  Horrocks resigned Dec. 31, according to a filing on the
website of the U.K.’s Companies House. He left after four years
at the firm for personal reasons and will be relocating to  South
Africa , Chief Executive Officer Andrew Stevens said in a
telephone interview from  London  today. A replacement has been
found and will be announced in due course, he said.  Fulcrum Alpha, the company’s flagship fund, returned 1
percent net of fees in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, beating the 3.4 percent decline in the Newedge CTA
Trend Sub-Index, which tracks the performance of the largest
computer-driven, or quant, funds. Alpha lost 8.9 percent the
previous year and has returned 31 percent since its inception in
2006, compared with a 16 percent increase in the Newedge index.  Fulcrum made money in 2012 as many of its biggest peers
experienced losses.  Man Group Plc (EMG) ’s AHL Diversified $17 billion
fund lost 2.1 percent last year while the $10 billion Winton
Futures Fund Ltd. slid 3.5 percent, according to investors.
BlueCrest Capital Management’s $14 billion trend-following fund
gained 0.02 percent.  Trading Strategies  Alpha is a “quantitative global macro fund that combines
fundamental economics,  behavioral finance  and short term macro
dislocation trading strategies,” according to Fulcrum’s
 website . It invests in currency, equity, fixed income and
commodity markets.  Before joining Fulcrum in 2008, Horrocks spent five years
running statistical arbitrage strategies at Man Group. Prior to
that, he was a trader at banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Societe Generale SA.  Davies, who was a managing director at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. from 1996 to 2001 and an advisory director until 2004, is
also a founding partner of Prisma Capital Partners LP, a fund-
of-hedge-funds manager that was acquired by KKR & Co. in June.
He was chairman of the  BBC  from 2001 to 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
