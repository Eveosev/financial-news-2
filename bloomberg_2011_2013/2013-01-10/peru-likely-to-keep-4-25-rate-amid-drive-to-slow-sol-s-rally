Peru ’s central bank probably will
keep borrowing costs unchanged today for a 20th consecutive
month after increasing efforts to slow credit growth and tame a
rally in the sol.  The five-member board, led by bank President Julio Velarde,
will maintain the  overnight rate  at 4.25 percent, the joint
lowest in  Latin America  with  Colombia , according to all 14
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. The decision will be announced
at about 6 p.m. in Lima.  Policy makers this month raised  reserve requirements  for
the fifth time since May as part of efforts to rein in lending
and help soak up inflows that pushed the  sol  to its strongest
level in 16 years. The pace of credit growth in  South America ’s
fastest-growing economy risks reviving inflation that slowed to
an 18-month low in December, said  Hugo Perea , the chief
economist at Banco Continental SA.  “There’s been some deceleration in credit but the central
bank may want to induce a soft landing toward more appropriate
levels,” Perea said in a phone interview from Lima. “We can’t
rule out another increase in reserve requirements. Raising the
benchmark rate might encourage bigger capital inflows.”  Peruvian lenders and companies are tapping overseas markets
for financing to take advantage of record low borrowing costs,
fueling dollar inflows and a strengthening of the sol.  The sol gained 5.4 percent last year, the best annual
performance since 2009, even after the central bank  purchased  a
record $13.9 billion in the  spot market  to soak up excess
greenbacks. The currency touched 2.5411 per  U.S. dollar  on Jan.
7, the strongest since October 1996.  Inflows, Growth  Foreign direct investment, the biggest source of dollar
inflows, probably rose to a record $11.1 billion last year,
while non-residents purchased $2.42 billion of Peruvian
securities after being net sellers in 2011, the central bank
said in a Dec. 14 report.  Companies likely issued $1.9 billion bonds abroad in 2012
after selling none in 2011, the report showed.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell 1.87 percentage points to 3.88 percent
last year and has rallied further to 3.80 percent in 2013. The
 Lima General Index (IGBVL)  rose 5.9 percent in 2012 and has gained 4.7
percent already in 2013.  “Peru is growing at a faster pace than everyone else so
the currency has to appreciate,” said  Pedro Tuesta , an
economist at 4Cast Inc., in a phone interview from  Washington .
“There’s no way to avoid that.”  Construction is booming in the Andean nation amid
investment in mines, power plants, infrastructure and homes.
Economic activity grew 6.7 percent in November from the year
earlier after a 5.9 percent increase in September, exceeding the
estimates of  economists  and the central bank.  Credit, Mortgages  Policy makers increased the reserve ratio by 0.75
percentage point for dollar deposits and 0.25 percentage point
for soles, effective Jan. 1.  Banks held an average 17.8 percent of their sol deposits
and 40 percent of their dollar deposits at the central bank in
October, according to the central bank.  Dollar credit increased 16.6 percent to $28.3 billion in
November, the fastest pace in eight months, and accounted for
43.4 percent of all outstanding loans to companies and
households, the central bank said in a Dec. 28  report . Sol loans
grew 16.6 percent, the slowest since May.  The country’s banking regulator in November told lenders to
set aside more funds against potential losses on mortgages and
car loans after delinquency rates rose to a two-year high of
1.79 percent in October.  No ‘Urgency’  Still concern that the global economic outlook could
deteriorate has led policy makers to keep rates unchanged for
the longest period since Peru’s central bank began targeting
inflation in 2002.  Exports in November rose 13.2 percent to $3.7 billion from
the same month a year earlier, the national statistics institute
reported yesterday.  Consumer prices rose 0.26 percent last month while the
 annual inflation  rate last month slid to 2.65 percent from 2.66
percent in November and 3.25 percent the previous month.
Inflation will slow to about 2 percent this year, the mid-point
of the central bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range, the
bank said Dec. 14.  The central bank can maintain a neutral stance this year as
investment-driven growth shouldn’t stoke consumer prices, Tuesta
said.  “Inflation isn’t running away from the band and GDP is
near potential,” Tuesta said. “They don’t have any urgency to
hike.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
