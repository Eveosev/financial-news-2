A Chinese court sentenced a 35-year-
old man to death for raping 28 women over six years, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Huo Linzhen, first detained in May 2011, was sentenced on
Jan. 6 by the Chuzhou City Intermediate Peopleâ€™s Court in the
eastern province of Anhui, according to Xinhua. Five of the
women he was convicted of raping were underage, Xinhua reported.  Huo coerced women he met online to meet in person by
threatening to fabricate naked images of them and to disseminate
those pictures, Xinhua reported. He then took video of him
raping the women and threatened to distribute the footage if
they reported him, according to Xinhua.  The threat of the videos being released led most of the
women to not report the rapes to police, Xinhua reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
