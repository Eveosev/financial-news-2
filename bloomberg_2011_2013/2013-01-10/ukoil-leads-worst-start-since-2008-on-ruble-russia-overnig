OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  retreated for a fourth
day in New York, leading the worst start to a year since 2008
for Russian crude producers, on concern that a strengthening
ruble will cut profitability and oil will extend its drop.  American depositary receipts of Lukoil, Russia’s second-
largest oil company, slipped 0.4 percent to $66.11 in New York
yesterday, extending its slump this year to 2.1 percent.  OAO
Gazprom Neft (GZPFY)  dropped 1.5 percent in the first 10 days of 2013,
the worst performance in three years, and  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY)  has
added 2.7 percent, the poorest start since 2011. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  rose 0.2 percent to 100.46 yesterday and
 RTS stock futures  expiring in March held at 157,290.  Russian oil stocks have been sliding as the ruble surged to
an eight-month high versus the dollar yesterday. A stronger
currency boosts producers’ domestic costs and reduces earnings
when converted from dollars. Oil, which together with natural
gas accounts for about 50 percent of government revenue, is up
2.2 percent this year, the worst start to a year since 2011, and
may drop as stockpiles rise, Otkritie Financial Corp. said.  “There is no reason to expect any significant increase in
Russian oil companies’ profits this year,” Vladimir Tikhomirov,
the chief economist at Otkritie, said by phone from Geneva
yesterday. “A stronger ruble doesn’t help exporters.”  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export oil blend, will probably
average $105 a barrel in 2013, Tikhomirov said. Urals  mean price 
was at $110.3 a barrel in 2012 and $109.5 in 2011, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  ‘Bad for Oil’  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 0.8 percent to $30.05,
gaining for the first time in four days. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the stock futures, rose
0.6 percent to 20.88.  The ruble added 0.6 percent to 30.1910 yesterday, the
highest level since May 11. Ruble futures showed the currency
strengthening 0.1 percent to 30.508 per dollar.  “We may be forced to revise our forecast for stronger-
than-initially-expected ruble this year,” Slava Smolyaninov,
the chief strategist at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “A stronger ruble is
particularly bad for oil companies.”  The ruble gained 5.4 percent against the dollar last year,
rising for the first time since 2007. Oil dropped 7.1 percent in
2012, the first decline in four years.  Board Meeting  ADRs of Moscow-based Lukoil settled at a 0.6 percent
discount to the company’s Moscow-listed shares, the widest since
Dec. 24. The Moscow-listed  stock  slipped 0.8 percent to 2,008.90
rubles, or $66.53, yesterday.  Lukoil’s board meets today to review the company’s plans
for 2013, Deutsche Bank AG said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  Natalia Zinina, a spokeswoman at Lukoil, didn’t reply to an
e-mailed request to confirm that the company’s board of
directors is meeting today. The request was sent after normal
business hours in Moscow.  The country’s second-biggest producer saw output decline in
Russia in 2012, according to data from the Energy Ministry.
Lukoil’s crude output fell 0.8 percent last year, while
Surgutneftegas’s production advanced 1 percent and Gazprom
Neft’s output increased 4.7 percent, the biggest rise compared
with other domestic oil companies, the data show.  Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer,
dropped 0.1 percent to $6.82. The Moscow-listed preferred  shares 
declined 1.1 percent to 20.51 rubles, or 67.9 U.S. cents. One
ADR equals 10 shares.  Oil Climbs  Gazprom Neft, the oil unit of Russia’s natural gas export
monopoly, lost 0.1 percent to $23.41 yesterday, settling at a
0.8 percent discount to the company’s Moscow-listed shares, the
biggest gap since Dec. 26. Its  Moscow shares  retreated 0.5
percent to 142.51 rubles, or $4.72 yesterday. One ADR is equal
to five ordinary shares.  Crude oil for February delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
$93.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday,
the highest level since Sept. 18. Brent oil for February
settlement increased 0.1 percent to $111.89 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, while  Urals crude ,
Russia’s chief export blend, added 0.4 percent to $110.35.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  rose 0.1 percent to $8.1 yesterday,
extending a 4.1 percent advance this year.  CTC TV television channel, the company’s biggest source of
revenue, saw its share of viewers rise in the first week of this
year, TNS Global researcher said in a report yesterday.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 0.2 percent to HK$5.08 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:31
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
