India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
the yield to a 27-month low, on speculation the central bank
will reduce interest rates this quarter to revive growth.  The Reserve Bank of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent by the end of March, after
keeping it unchanged since April, according to 11 of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The next review is on Jan. 29. Government
data due tomorrow will show industrial output rose 0.1 percent
in November, compared with an 8.2 percent increase in October,
according to a separate Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell two
basis points to 7.88 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate is the lowest for a benchmark
10-year security since Sept. 29, 2010. The yield has fallen 30
basis points since the end of November.  “Expectations of an easing in monetary policy are
reflected in the recent bond rally,” said Srinivasa Raghavan,
an executive vice president of treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK) 
in Mumbai. “Factory production data and inflation data due in
coming days will influence the size of the rate cut.”  Wholesale prices probably rose 7.37 percent in December,
according to a Bloomberg survey before the data are published on
Jan. 14. Prices increased 7.24 percent in November, the slowest
pace in 10 months, official data show.  Seven of the economists surveyed on the repurchase rate see
a 25 basis point reduction by the end of this quarter. Of the
remaining three, UBS AG expects a 100 basis point cut,  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  predicts the rate will be held, while Woori CBV
Securities Corp. sees a quarter of a percentage point increase.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was unchanged at
7.56 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
