European  bank shares , the best-
performing industry group on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index since
the start of the year, will rally as much as 14 percent,
according to a technical analyst at Aviate Global LLP.  The Stoxx 600 Banks Index will rise as high as 200,
Riccardo Ronco, head of technical analysis at Aviate Global in
London, said in e-mailed comments yesterday. Both its 50-day and
200-day moving averages are climbing, with the short-term line
trading higher of the two, he said. Also, the ratio between the
banks gauge and the Stoxx 600 has jumped above its 40-week mean
after crossing it in September 2012, he added.  “What we have here is a break-out above 52-week highs, and
it’s continuing on good volumes,” Ronco said. “The system is
healing little by little. We are, maybe, not going to have
growth in the big economies, but my charts tell me that the
situation is getting better.”  The Stoxx 600 Banks Index rose 0.7 percent to 177.45 at
1:59 p.m. in London, climbing for the eighth day. This is its
longest winning streak since November 2009.  The  relative strength index  on the banks gauge, which
includes  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Banco Santander SA and BNP Paribas
SA, has risen to the highest level since April 1998. It has
exceeded 82, well above the 70 mark that some analysts consider
a turning point in the momentum of price increases.  Still, investors should not read this as a bearish signal,
Ronco said.  “Sometimes when you have a sharp strong reading, it means
a change in the structure of the market,” Ronco said. “I’m not
going to short and I don’t think it is overdone. I think we’ll
be able to see a rotation into this sector.”  The banks index increased 23 percent last year. Since the
New Year, the gauge has rallied 8.7 percent as global central-
bank chiefs agreed to relax and delay new rules on bank
liquidity, and U.S. lawmakers announced a compromise budget. The
Stoxx 600 gained 3.1 percent in the same period.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of price, volume and other trading data to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
