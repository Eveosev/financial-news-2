European Union antitrust regulators
believe  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s search engine diverts Web traffic from
competitors, the Financial Times reported today, citing an
interview with EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia .  Almunia told the newspaper he is convinced that Google
diverts traffic and may be abusing its dominant position in the
search market. Almunia said regulators investigating the company
are focusing on the way the company presents its own services in
search results rather than the software algorithm that ranks
results, according to the newspaper.  The EU last month asked Google to submit concessions that
may lead to a settlement of its antitrust probe. Another EU
investigation into Google’s Android operating system for mobile
devices wouldn’t be covered by that settlement, Almunia told the
Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
