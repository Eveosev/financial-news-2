Aerosvit, Ukraine’s biggest private
airline, which is in a bankruptcy procedure, canceled 15 flights
and delayed two long-distance flights as the government pledged
to find money to take passengers to their destinations.  Six arrivals and nine departures were canceled by the
carrier today, Kiev Boryspil Airport said in a statement on its
website. Flights from Goa and Bangkok were delayed for more than
ten hours, the airport said. Aerosvit is controlled by Ukrainian
billionaire Igor Kolomoisky. It operates 80 international routes
to 34 countries, according to its website.  The Kiev regional economic court started a bankruptcy
procedure against Aerosvit on Dec. 29. over outstanding debts of
4.27 billion hryvnia ($520 million) as of Dec. 27 and assets of
1.47 billion hryvnia as of Nov. 30, according to court
documents.  The government pledged to find finances and to lease or
rent aircraft to ensure passengers get to their destinations
“for this acute period,” Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said in
