Libya’s prime minister warned that
authorities are ready to use force to protect oil installations,
as government frustration mounted over the losses linked to the
country’s chronic instability.  Ali Zaidan told reporters late yesterday the government
won’t allow any groups to threaten the security of the nation,
including oil infrastructure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
