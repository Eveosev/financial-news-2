Investor sentiment toward U.S.
stocks is poised to change for the better and contribute to a
multiyear advance, according to  Ralph Acampora , a partner and
head of market research at Altaira Wealth Management LLC.  “I have never seen so many people so negative on the stock
market for so long,” Acampora wrote yesterday in a posting on
Twitter. The Minneapolis-based analyst has been a technical
analyst, focusing on price charts, since 1966.  The CHART OF THE DAY highlights a contrast between the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index performance and the outlook for
share prices, based on weekly survey data from the  American
Association  of Individual Investors, since the current  bull
market  started in March 2009.  Optimism peaked in September 2011, judging by the average
gap between the percentage of bulls and bears in the prior 52
weeks of AAII surveys. The latest average was 2.6 percentage
points, close to last year’s low of 2.02 points in July.  The potential for a sentiment shift was among 11 reasons
that Acampora provided for being a “secular bull” in postings
on  Twitter , where he had about 3,750 followers as of yesterday.
Gains in overseas stock markets and the 10-year Treasury note
yield’s rise above 1.9 percent this month were among others.  “The March 2009 low was and is a generational low,” he
wrote. “We will work our way irregularly higher.” The  S&P 500 
has more than doubled since dropping to a 12-year low of 676.53
on March 9, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
