Steven Spielberg ’s DreamWorks Studios
delayed production of the director’s science-fiction film
“Robopocalypse” indefinitely to spend more time on the script.  A new date hasn’t been set for the film, a co-production
with  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Twentieth Century Fox, Marvin Levy, a
spokesman for DreamWorks Studios, said in an interview.  Spielberg still wants to make the movie based on Daniel H.
Wilson’s novel about war between robots and their human
creators, Levy said. The Oscar-winning director of action hits
including “Jurassic Park” and “War of the Worlds” was
reluctant to start production without an improved script.  Spielberg’s next directing project hasn’t been settled,
Levy said. Films in development at Los Angeles-based DreamWorks
Studios include “Need for Speed,” based on the  video game , and
“Delivery Man,” according to the company’s website.  The delay was reported earlier by the TheWrap.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
