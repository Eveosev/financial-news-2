U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened as
the region’s inventories rose to the highest level in more than
two decades and Motiva Enterprises LLC prepared to start a crude
unit at the  Port Arthur ,  Texas , refinery.  Inventories of gasoline on the Gulf Coast, known as PADD 3,
gained 1.2 million barrels, or 1.4 percent, to 81.4 million
barrels in the week ended Jan. 4, the Energy Department reported
yesterday. That’s the highest since the department started
collecting data in 1990.  Stockpiles may continue to grow as Motiva prepares to start
a 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit that will almost double
processing capacity at the  Port Arthur refinery . At full rates,
the site would be able to make 240,000 barrels a day of gasoline
and 190,000 barrels of diesel, according to the company. The
expansion made it the largest plant in the Gulf Coast region,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline on the Gulf retreated 0.25
cent to 11 cents a gallon below futures at 11:59 a.m., the
widest gap since Dec. 27.  Conventional gasoline  also fell 0.25
cent to trade at a discount of 13.5 cents. The same grade to be
blended with ethanol on the Gulf slid 1 cent to 16.25 cents
below futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
