Meridian Energy Ltd., New Zealand’s
biggest electricity generator, is considering selling its share
of the A$1 billion ($1.05 billion) Macarthur wind farm in
Australia operated by  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)   The Wellington-based company hired  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  to
find potential buyers for its half of the project, the largest
wind farm in the Southern Hemisphere, said a person with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the
information is private.  While Meridian is “investigating that potential
opportunity,” it hasn’t yet decided if it will sell, said Chief
Executive Officer Mark Binns in a telephone interview.  “If there’s a good profit to be made, it’s a chance for us
to take any profits and recycle the capital,” Binns said.  Potential buyers of the stake could include pension funds
seeking bond-like investments, Binns said. Meridian’s investment
in Macarthur was structured as a “low-risk participation”
similar to holding an AGL Energy bond, he said.  AGL said in November that it expects to be fully operating
the 420-megawatt project in Victoria state by next month. A
spokeswoman for Macquarie declined to comment on its role in the
possible sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
