  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  was told by
the European Commission this week that more must to be done to
rescue its bid to take over  Aer Lingus (AERL)  Plc, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  European Commission officials met executives from Dublin-
based Ryanair in Brussels two days ago to discuss anti-trust
objections to the bid and outlined shortcomings in remedies
proposed by the carrier last month, said the people, who
declined to be identified as the matter is private. Ryanair has
until the end of the month to respond, one of the people said.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission,
declined to comment on the process, as did Ryanair spokesman
Stephen McNamara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
