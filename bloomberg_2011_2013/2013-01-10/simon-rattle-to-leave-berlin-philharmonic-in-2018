Simon Rattle , the chief conductor of
the  Berlin Philharmonic , announced today that he will leave the
orchestra when his contract expires in 2018.  “In 2018, I will have worked with the Berlin Philharmonic
for 16 years,” Rattle said in an e-mailed statement sent by the
orchestra. “I will then be nearly 64. As a Liverpudlian, I
cannot celebrate this special birthday without asking the
Beatles’ question: ‘Will you still need me when I’m 64?’”  Rattle said the decision wasn’t easy, yet he is sure the
time has come for someone else to take on the “big and
wonderful challenge” of leading the  orchestra .  The self-governed Berlin Philharmonic elects its own chief
conductor and in 2009, extended Rattle’s contract through to
2018. Rattle began his stint there in 2002, having previously
led the City of Birmingham Orchestra.  Double bassist Peter Riegelbauer and horn player Stefan
Dohr, leaders of the orchestra’s executive board, said they
regret and respect Rattle’s decision and praised the
“sympathetic and respectful artistic and human collaboration”
between the conductor and his orchestra.  Muse highlights include  Jason Harper  on cars,  Rich
Jaroslovsky  on tech,  Lance Esplund  on art and  Catherine Hickley 
on film.  To contact the writer on the story:
