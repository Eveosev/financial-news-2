Venezuelan bonds rose for the first
time in five days as the day cancer-stricken President Hugo Chavez was due to be inaugurated was passing without violence.  The yield on  Venezuela ’s 2027 bonds fell eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 9.20 percent at 12:27 p.m.
in Caracas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
on the bonds increased 54 basis points over the previous four
days.  Opposition leader Henrique Capriles urged supporters
yesterday to avoid clashes with Chavez loyalists as the Supreme
Court endorsed a delay in the inauguration, saying that any such
ceremony is a formality. The ruling means Chavez’s handpicked
successor, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, will continue to
conduct affairs.  “People were putting in question if there was going to be
violence on the streets,” Kathryn Rooney Vera, a strategist at
Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami, said in a telephone
interview. “Jan. 10 came and went and nothing happened.”  Regional allies including Bolivian President Evo Morales,
 Nicaragua ’s Daniel Ortega and Uruguay’s Jose Mujica were
expected to attend a government-organized rally today in Caracas
to express solidarity with the socialist leader, who is
struggling to recover from surgery last month in Cuba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
