South Korea’s bank lending to
households rose the most in six years in December as demand
increased before tax incentives to encourage home purchases
expired at the end of the year.  Loans to households increased by 4.9 trillion won ($4.6
billion) last month to 466.5 trillion won, the biggest gain
since December 2006, the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed
statement today. Mortgage lending expanded by 5 trillion won to
316.9 trillion won and loans to companies fell 11.8 trillion won
to 589 trillion won.  The central bank will keep interest rates unchanged at 2.75
percent tomorrow after two cuts last year, 13 out of 14
economists predict in a Bloomberg  survey . One economist projects
a cut to 2.5 percent.  The broadest measure of money supply, M2, rose 0.2 percent
in November from the previous month, according to a separate
central bank statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
