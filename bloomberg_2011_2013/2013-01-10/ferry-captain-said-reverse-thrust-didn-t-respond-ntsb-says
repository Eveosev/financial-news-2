The captain of a commuter ferry that
crashed while docking in Manhattan’s financial district told
investigators the ship didn’t respond when he put the thrust
into reverse, the National Transportation Safety Board said.  “The vessel didn’t respond to reverse thrust control,”
Robert Sumwalt, an NTSB board member, said at a press briefing
today at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal.  The Seastreak Wall Street slammed into Pier 11 at South
Street and Gouverneur Lane about 8:43 a.m. yesterday, according
to the  New York City Police Department , injuring about 57
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
