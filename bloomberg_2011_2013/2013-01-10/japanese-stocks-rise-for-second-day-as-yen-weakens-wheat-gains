U.S. stocks gained for a second day,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returning to a five-year
high, and commodities advanced following faster-than-forecast
growth in Chinese exports. The euro and Spanish bonds rallied.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.8 percent to
1,472.12 at 4 p.m. in  New York , above its highest closing level
since December 2007. The S&P GSCI commodities index rose to the
highest since October as oil reached a three-month high. The
euro jumped as much as 1.6 percent to $1.3266, the biggest gain
since August, as the region’s central bank left  interest rates 
unchanged.  Spain ’s two-year note yields fell 29 basis points to
2.11 percent after the country sold more debt than targeted.  China ’s export growth and a 28 percent increase in a broad
measure of credit fueled speculation the nation’s new leaders
will sustain a pickup in economic growth after a seven-quarter
slowdown. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
today’s decision to keep interest rates on hold was unanimous
and the euro-area economy will slowly return to health this
year. Spain sold 5.8 billion euros ($7.6 billion) of bonds, more
than the maximum target of 5 billion euros.  “China is definitely healing,” Michael Mullaney, who
helps manage $9.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Fiduciary Trust in  Boston , said in a phone interview. “Stocks
started to do better after Draghi’s comments. People feel that
the recovery will take hold. As long as we don’t see Greek-
Portugal-Spain debacle in 2013, those markets should continue to
do better.”  Jobless Claims  The  S&P 500  rose even after more Americans than forecast
filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week, with
jobless claims increasing by 4,000 to 371,000.  Bank of America Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and  Intel Corp .
jumped more than 1.6 percent to lead the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  up 80.71 points to 13,471.22, its highest level since
October .  Ford Motor Co., the second-largest U.S. carmaker, gained
2.7 percent after increasing its dividend. Supervalu Inc. surged
14 percent after an investor group led by Cerberus Capital
Management LP agreed to buy five of its chains in a transaction
valued at about $3.3 billion. Tiffany & Co. sank 4.5 percent as
the jewelry retailer said earnings will be at the low end of its
forecast.  European Markets  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index lost 0.3 percent after rising
yesterday to a 22-month high. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA fell
2.1 percent after the forecast from its U.S. peer Tiffany.
Sanofi lost 0.7 percent after U.S. regulators cut the
recommended dosage of some drugs including those sold by the
French company. Nokia Oyj surged 11 percent after saying its
handset business probably saw a profit in the fourth quarter.  MAN SE jumped 3.5 percent as  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  offered to take
full control of the German truckmaker. Europe’s largest carmaker
already holds 75.03 percent of MAN’s voting rights.  The euro gained against all 16 major counterparts,
advancing 1.9 percent versus the yen.  The unanimous decision by the ECB to leave interest rates
unchanged “is a major change as the fundamental scenario has
not changed much since December but the ECB seems to be more
optimistic due to the development of financial markets,”
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in
 London , said in an e-mailed note.  Bond Yields  Treasury 30-year bonds pared losses after the first U.S.
sale this year of $13 billion in the securities was met with
stronger-than-average demand. The bonds drew a yield of 3.07
percent, compared with a forecast of 3.095 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.77, tied for the highest since December 2011.  Thirty-year yields were up two basis points at 3.08 percent
after climbing four points earlier.  The  yield  on Spain’s 10-year bond fell 23 basis points to
4.90 percent, falling below 5 percent for the first time since
March. The rate on Italy’s two-year note slid 18 basis points to
1.37 percent.  Borrowing costs fell at Spain’s auction with the 2015 note
yielding 2.476 percent, compared with 3.282 percent the last
time a similar maturity was sold on Oct. 4. The yield on the
2018 bond was 3.988 percent, down from 4.680 percent at the
previous sale on Nov. 8.  “Europe was the story for 2012, will it hold together?”
said  Bob Doll , chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset
Management.  “What about the systemic risk related to the
banks, etc. Look, they are not out the woods, but I think it
will be less of the negative headlines on 2013 that it was in
2012.”  Record Low  U.K. 10-year inflation-linked gilts advanced, with the
yield on the securities touching a  record-low  minus 0.99
percent, after National Statistician Jil Matheson said the U.K.
should maintain its current approach to calculating its retail
 price index , easing investor concern changes to the measure may
have impaired payments on inflation-linked bonds.  The S&P GSCI advanced to the highest level on a closing
basis since October, with copper climbing 0.4 percent. China is
the world’s biggest user of industrial metals and energy. Oil
jumped 0.8 percent to $93.82 a barrel, the highest settlement
price since Sept. 18.  China’s overseas sales rose 14.1 percent in December from a
year earlier, almost triple the 5 percent gain predicted in a
Bloomberg analyst survey, data showed today.  “China is back on the growth path and the imports of
industrial metals will continue to remain strong,” said  Eugen Weinberg , the head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt . “Copper is likely to remain in focus.”  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  added 0.5 percent. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in
 Hong Kong  rose 1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index jumped 0.8
percent and Taiwan’s Taiex added 0.9 percent. Brazil’s Bovespa
index increased 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
