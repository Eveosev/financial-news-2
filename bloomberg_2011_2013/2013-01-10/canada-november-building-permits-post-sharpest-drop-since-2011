 Canadian construction permits in
November recorded the  sharpest drop  in 19 months as builders
scaled back plans for industrial facilities and condominiums.  The value of permits granted by municipal governments fell
17.9 percent to C$6.2 billion ($6.29 billion), the lowest level
since January 2012, after a revised 15.9 percent gain in
October,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
forecast a 5 percent drop, according to the median of 9
responses to a Bloomberg survey.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  and the country’s banking
regulator tightened lending rules last year as consumer debts
reached record levels amid signs of overbuilding in cities such
as Vancouver and Toronto.  Homeowners have taken advantage of low  mortgage rates  as
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney has kept his key  policy rate 
at 1 percent for more than two years, the longest pause since
the 1950s.  Residential permits declined 6.8 percent to C$3.77 billion
in November, as the value of multiple-unit projects decreased
10.8 percent and single-family permits dropped 4 percent.  Non-residential construction permits fell 30.6 percent to
C$2.43 billion, as industrial projects such as factories
recorded a 60.7 percent drop. Industrial construction permits
more than tripled in the prior month.  Permits for institutional projects such as schools dropped
49.1 percent, while commercial projects such as offices rose 5.9
percent, the statistics agency said.  The value of permits was 0.2 percent higher in November
than the same month a year earlier.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said its new-home
price  index  rose 0.1 percent in November and 2.2 percent from a
year earlier. Toronto, the country’s biggest market, recorded a
0.3 percent gain on the month.  Economists surveyed forecast a 0.2 percent increase in new
 home prices  for November, according to the median of 9
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
