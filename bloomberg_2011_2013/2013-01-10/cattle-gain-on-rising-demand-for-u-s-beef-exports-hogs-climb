Cattle prices rose for the first
time in three sessions on signs of increasing demand for U.S.
beef. Hog futures climbed the most in a week.  Beef-export sales were 67,124 metric tons (147.98 million
pounds) in the week ended Jan. 3, up 56 percent from the four-
week average, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Spot
 steers  averaged $1.2799 in the first two days of this week, up
0.6 percent from a week earlier, government data show.  “When you look at the export numbers, that is an area that
continues to be a bright spot here,”  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a
telephone interview.  Cattle futures for February delivery increased 0.2 percent
to $1.31775 a pound at 9:56 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices lost 1.1 percent in the previous two sessions.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slipped less
than 0.1 percent to $1.53725 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.2 percent to
84.375 cents a pound on the CME. A close at that level would be
the biggest gain for the most-active contract since Jan. 3.  In Iowa and southern  Minnesota , meatpackers processed
392,000 hogs in the week ended Jan. 5, up 14 percent from the
same period a week earlier, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
