Vietnam’s three-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level since May 2009, on
speculation strong demand from banks at an auction tomorrow will
drive rates lower. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury will offer 5 trillion dong ($240 million)
of two-, three- and five-year securities, according to a
statement from the  Hanoi Stock Exchange . Rates for one-, two-
and three-year notes fell at auctions on Jan. 7 and Dec. 27. Low
credit demand has spurred banks to buy more debt with surplus
cash, said Nguyen Tan Thang, fixed-income investment director at
Ho Chi Minh City Securities Joint-Stock Co.  “Most good banks have a lot of money but cannot lend out
so mostly they’re buying bonds,” he said.  The yield on the three-year bonds fell 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 8.90 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
level since May 25, 2009 and the biggest decline since Nov. 27.
The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell five basis
points to 9.62 percent.  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 3:52 p.m. in
Hanoi, the same as yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The State Bank of  Vietnam  set its reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since December 2011, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
