Reed Elsevier  Plc sold its
Australian media business to private-equity firm  Catalyst
Investment Managers Pty  as the owner of the LexisNexis database
seeks to reduce its dependence on advertising revenue.  The Australian unit owns titles including Money Management,
Australian Doctor and Pharmacy News, and online directories such
as hotfrog.com.au, London-based Reed Elsevier said in a
statement. The business has annual revenue of about A$60 million
($63.5 million), said a person with knowledge of the matter who
asked not to be identified because the financial details aren’t
publicly disclosed.  Reed Elsevier has been disposing of print titles within its
Reed Business Information division to focus on electronic data
services and research offerings. It sold entertainment trade
magazine Variety to Internet entrepreneur Jay Penske in October.  Reed Business Information had sales of 347 million pounds
($560 million) in the first half of 2012,  accounting for  11
percent of the company’s revenue. The sale of magazines and a
reduction in costs helped the division reach a record operating
profit margin of 18 percent in that period.  Reed Elsevier rose as much as 1.3 percent in  London  and
traded 1 percent higher at 655.5 pence as of 9:07 a.m., valuing
the local stock at 7.9 billion pounds ($12.8 billion). Including
the company’s listing in Amsterdam, where the shares rose 0.4
percent, Reed Elsevier has a total market value of about 15 
billion pounds.  Failed Sale  Catalyst, which has completed management buyouts of
companies valued at a combined A$3 billion, will create a new
entity owned by its funds to acquire Reed’s Australian business,
Reed said.  Reed Elsevier called off an attempt to sell Reed Business
Information in 2008 amid an economic slowdown. Since then, the
company has sold titles piecemeal, including U.S. publications
Publishers Weekly, Broadcasting & Cable and Multichannel News.  Reed has divested 150 titles since 2008, with revenue from
print advertising in the unit falling from 350 million pounds to
less than 100 million pounds in the period. Total revenue at
Reed Business Information was 695 million pounds in 2011.  The company said in July that completed and planned
disposals will be “mildly dilutive” to earnings per share in
the short term. It said on Dec. 28 it would buy back shares
worth as much as 100 million pounds through February 2013.  The stock climbed 1.3 percent to 649 pence at the close of
trading in London yesterday. They gained 24 percent in 2012.  Reed said it was advised by Investec on the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
