Bonds of  Supervalu Inc. (SVU)  surged after
a Cerberus Capital Management LP-led investor group agreed to
buy stores of the grocery chain in a $3.3 billion transaction.  The company’s $1 billion of 8 percent notes due in May
2016, which traded as low as 83 cents on the dollar in July,
jumped 2.625 cents to 99.875 and yielded 8.04 percent at 1:22
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Cerberus also will lead a group to conduct a tender offer
to buy as much as 30 percent of Supervalu’s  common stock  for $4
a share in cash,  Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based Supervalu said
today in a statement. The third-largest U.S. grocery chain has
eliminated jobs and accelerated price cuts at stores as it
struggles to keep pace with discounters including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Target Corp.  Supervalu  shares  jumped 13.5 percent to $3.45, the highest
level since July. Credit swaps protecting against losses on the
company’s debt dropped 47.7 basis points to 772.2 basis points
at 1:30 p.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  That means investors pay $772,200 annually to protect $10
million of debt for five years. Credit swaps, which typically
fall as investor confidence improves and rise as it
deteriorates, pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
