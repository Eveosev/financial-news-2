Australia’s dollar rallied to its
strongest level since August 2008 against the yen and a four-
week high versus the greenback as Chinese imports rose to a
record in the nation’s biggest overseas market.  The  New Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, climbed to the
highest level since September 2008 against the yen as investors’
appetite for higher-yielding assets increased and stocks and
commodities rose. The  European Central Bank  refrained from
cutting its benchmark  interest rate  and said the euro region’s
economy should gradually recover.  “There was broader improvement in risk appetite, starting
in Asia with better Chinese trade numbers,”  Mike Moran , a
senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in New
York, said in an interview.  Australia’s currency strengthened 1.8 percent to 94.02 yen
and reached 94.12 yesterday in New York trading. The currency
climbed 0.8 percent to $1.0596 and touched $1.0599, its
strongest since Sept. 14.  New Zealand’s dollar rose as high as 75.08 yen, the
strongest since September 2008, before trading at 75, a 1.8
percent gain. It gained 0.7 percent to 84.56 U.S. cents.  China’s exports rose 14.1 percent in December from a year
earlier, while  imports  increased 6 percent, leaving a trade
surplus of $31.6 billion, the customs administration said
yesterday.  The pickup in shipments abroad compared with forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey for a 5 percent export gain and a 3.5
percent rise in imports.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  rose 0.8 percent, and S&P’s
GSCI Index of 24 raw materials advanced 0.6 percent.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
