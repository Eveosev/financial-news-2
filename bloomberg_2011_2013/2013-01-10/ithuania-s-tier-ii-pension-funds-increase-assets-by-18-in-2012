Lithuania’s voluntary second-tier
pension funds boosted net assets by almost a fifth last year,
providing participants with an average return of 11.21 percent.  The 30 active funds had combined net assets of 4.8 billion
litai ($1.8 billion) at Dec. 31, or 18 percent more than a year
earlier, the central bank in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius,
said in a statement on its website today.  Introduced in 2004, second-tier pension funds are funded by
diverting social security contributions of the current 1.07
million participants in the Baltic nation of 3 million people.
They received about 300 million litai from the state social
insurance fund in 2012, meaning they generated the remaining
asset increase of 426 million litai through investment activity,
the Bank of Lithuania said.  Lithuania’s nine third-tier pension funds, which manage
private individual pensions, had 28,600 participants at year-end
and combined net assets of 108 million litai, according to the
central bank. That was 15 million litai more than a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
