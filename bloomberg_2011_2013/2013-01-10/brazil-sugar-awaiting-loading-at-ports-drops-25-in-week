The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, declined 25
percent over the past week, according to Williams Servicos
Maritimos Ltda., as demand slowed.  About 918,433 metric tons of the sweetener were waiting to
be loaded onto ships at Recife, Maceio, Paranagua and Santos,
the country’s biggest port, figures e-mailed yesterday from the
Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That compared with
1.22 million tons a week earlier.  Brazil’s center south, the main growing region, will
produce a record 34.05 million tons of sugar in the 2012-13
season, up from a previous forecast of 32.7 million tons,
industry group Unica said on Dec. 20. There are a lot of offers
to sell raw sugar in Brazil and not enough demand, Luiz Carlos
dos Santos Jr., head of sugar brokerage and operations at SA
Commodities in Santos, said in a report e-mailed on Jan. 8.  “Center south Brazil’s 34 million tons-plus production for
2012-13 exceeded all expectations, and with good progress on
Northern Hemisphere beet and importantly cane crops, it’s hard
not to be bearish,” Tom McNeill, a director at Brisbane,
Australia-based researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists
Pty., said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Brazilian sugar from the center south for immediate
delivery is trading at a discount of 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a
pound to the price on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange, according
to Green Pool. Sugar fell 16 percent last year as global
supplies were forecast to outpace demand for a third year,
according to the  International Sugar Organization  in  London .  “Center south Brazil raws are facing an uphill battle,”
McNeill said, referring to the discounts against the exchange.  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.8 percent to 18.87
cents a pound by 5:21 a.m. on ICE in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
