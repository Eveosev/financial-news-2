Richard Chichakli, an associate of
convicted international arms dealer Viktor Bout, was arrested in
 Australia  at the U.S. government’s request, prosecutors said.  Chichakli is accused of conspiring with Bout, who is
serving a 25-year sentence in federal prison, to purchase
aircraft in violation of U.S. economic sanctions. The men were
barred from purchasing the aircraft because the U.S. Treasury
found they were associated with former Liberian President
Charles Taylor, prosecutors said.  Chichakli was arrested yesterday, the office of U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said today in a statement.  Prosecutors unsealed a new indictment against Chichakli
Jan. 2 charging him with conspiracy to violate U.S. export
restrictions, money laundering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy
and six counts of wire fraud. Each charge carries a maximum
punishment of 20 years in prison, according to Bharara’s office.  Bout was convicted in November 2011 of conspiring to sell
weapons to the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia,
which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the
U.S. government.  The case is U.S. v. Chichakli, 09-cr-1002, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan .)  To contact the reporters on this story:
