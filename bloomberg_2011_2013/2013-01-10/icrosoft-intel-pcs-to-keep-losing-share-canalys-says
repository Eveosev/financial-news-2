Computers running  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
Windows software and  Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s processors will continue
losing market share to tablets and smartphones this year,
according to researcher Canalys.  So-called Wintel machines will grab 65 percent of the
computer market this year, down from 72 percent in 2012, Canalys
said. In the fourth quarter of last year, combined shipments of
desktops, netbooks and notebooks declined about 10 percent from
the same period in 2011.  Windows 8, a new version of Microsoft’s flagship software
revamped to work with touch-screen machines, hasn’t helped boost
PC sales because many consumers resisted the need to learn a new
operating system, Canalys said. As PCs fall out of favor, the
market for tablets such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and touch-screen
devices running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software will surge to
reach 59 percent of the market, or 389 million units, by 2016.  “Wintel PCs are becoming less likely as an individual’s
first choice of computing device for everyday tasks, such as
sending e-mail or Web browsing,” Pin-Chen Tang, an analyst at
Canalys, said in a research report. “Pads and, increasingly,
smartphones can perform many of the day-to-day computing tasks
that most people require.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
