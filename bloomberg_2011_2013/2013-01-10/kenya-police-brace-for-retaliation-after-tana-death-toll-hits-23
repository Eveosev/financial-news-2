Kenyan police barricaded roads
leading to the southeastern Tana River delta to prevent more
bloodshed after the death toll from two days of raids between
feuding communities reached at least 23.  A retaliatory attack by the Orma people, who are nomadic
livestock herders, on the rival Pokomo community killed at least
12 people today, Tana Delta District Commissioner David Kiprop
said. The violence followed a Pokomo assault that killed 11
Ormas yesterday.  “It’s a revenge attack carried out by Orma youths,” he
said by mobile phone. “So far 12 bodies have been recovered and
rescue efforts to retrieve more bodies trapped in the burned
houses are ongoing.”  Fighting between the Orma and Pokomo has killed at least
178 people, including nine police officers, since violence broke
out over a land and water dispute in August, according to a
Bloomberg tally of police and  Kenya  Red Cross figures. The
United Nations says the Orma and Pokomo are competing for seats
in local government bodies that will be filled for the first
time at an election scheduled for March 4.  Kenya, East Africa’s largest economy, is expected to hold
its first national vote since a disputed 2007 ballot erupted
into violence that killed at least 1,100 and forced 350,000 more
to flee their homes. The country enacted a new constitution in
2010 that created a more devolved government structure, part of
a pact to end the post-election bloodshed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
