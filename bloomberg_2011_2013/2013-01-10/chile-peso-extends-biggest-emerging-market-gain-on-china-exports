Chile’s peso extended the biggest
emerging-market gain this month as  China ’s exports rose more
than forecast, boosting the price of copper.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 470.66 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:25 a.m. in Santiago, the strongest level on a closing
basis since Sept. 26. Futures on copper, Chile’s biggest export,
rose 1 percent to $3.7215 a pound in  New York . The peso extended
its gain this year to 1.8 percent, the biggest among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Commodities are up with the positive data in China,”
said Cristian Donoso, a currency trader at Banchile Inversiones
in Santiago. “The dollar could fall a bit more, but below 470
pesos per dollar there’s caution. The market becomes a bit more
nervous that authorities will step in.”  Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said Jan. 8 that the
government was monitoring the  exchange rate  and shared
exporters’ concern about the strength of the currency. The peso
rallied that day to a level stronger than 470 per dollar for the
first time since October before falling. Chile’s central bank
intervened in the  currency market  in 2008 and 2011, buying
dollars to slow gains in the peso.  Chinese exports rose 14.1 percent in December from a year
earlier, the most since May and faster than the 5 percent median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Copper made up 61
percent of Chile’s exports last month and 83 percent of its
exports to China in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
