The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  expanded for an 11th straight week to
the highest level since August 2011, stoked by rising demand
from U.S. money-market funds.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
climbed $23.2 billion to $1.105 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website.
It’s the longest stretch of advances since the period ended May
25, 2011, and the highest level since the market touched $1.117
trillion on Aug. 24, 2011, according to Fed data.  “Improved credit conditions for the commercial banks,
foreign banks included, and the problems of the Libor market are
making CP a preferred short-term funding vehicle and a parking-
place for short-term cash,”  Howard Simons , strategist at Bianco
Research LLC in  Chicago , wrote in an e-mail.  Money-market mutual funds, among the biggest investors for
short-term IOUs, have been raising their holdings during the
past six months, spurring companies and banks to accelerate
their issuance of commercial paper, typically maturing in 270
days or less, which corporations use to fund everyday activities
such as rent and salaries.  ‘Natural Lender’  The funds’ assets “increased another  $38 billion  this past
week, and that is restoring a natural lender to the CP market,”
Simons wrote.  Global authorities are investigating claims that more than
a dozen banks rigged submissions used to set lending benchmarks
such as the London interbank offered rate to profit from bets on
interest-rate derivatives or make their finances appear
healthier.  Commercial paper issued by U.S.-based financial
institutions  rose for a third week, climbing $12.9 billion to
$327.7 billion outstanding, the highest level since September
2011, while  the amount sold by non-U.S. banks  declined $500
million to $246.4 billion.  The discount rate on top-rated, 30-day, dealer-placed
commercial paper fell to  0.19 percent  at 8:40 a.m. today in  New
York ,  matching  the lowest level in data going back to 1988,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
