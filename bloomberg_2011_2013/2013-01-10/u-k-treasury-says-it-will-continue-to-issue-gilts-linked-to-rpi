The U.K. government will continue to
issue bonds linked to the Retail  Price Index  after the  Office
for National Statistics  said today it would leave unchanged the
way it calculates the inflation gauge.  “Following public consultation, the National Statistician
has today announced that no change will be made to the formula
used in the construction of the Retail Prices Index,” Treasury
minister Sajid Javid said said in an e-mail released by his
office in London.“The U.K. Statistics Authority has endorsed
this recommendation.”  “For gilt investors their future cash flows on existing
index-linked gilts will continue to be calculated by reference
to the RPI in accordance with the terms and conditions of those
gilts,” Javid said. “The government will continue to issue new
index-linked gilts linked to the RPI. The government will
consider any implications of the National Statistician’s
announcement on its approach to RPI indexation across different
policy areas in due course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
