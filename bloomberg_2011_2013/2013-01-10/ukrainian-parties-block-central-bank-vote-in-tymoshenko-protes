Ukrainian opposition parties blocked
a ballot to approve a new central bank head, demanding lawmakers
discuss changes to the criminal code that would release former
Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko  from prison.  Deputies surrounded the speaker’s rostrum to prevent
today’s ballot to approve Ihor Sorkin as central bank governor.
As well as demanding debate on amendments to free Tymoshenko and
former Interior Minister Yuriy Lytsenko, opposition politicians
sought confirmation of European Union integration plans,
opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk said.  President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s Party of Regions won the most
votes in October elections, though he fell short of a majority.
Tymoshenko was was jailed for seven years in 2011 for abuse of
office during her time as premier. She says Yanukovych
engineered the trial to keep her out of last year’s ballot.  “It’s not important for Ukraine who’ll govern the central
bank as under any conditions it will be Yanukovych,” Yatsenyuk
told lawmakers. “We demand inclusion into the agenda of an
amnesty bill that would free Tymoshenko and Lytsenko from
political persecution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
