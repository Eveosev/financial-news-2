The  Sacramento Kings  are in talks
with a group led by investor Chris Hansen about a possible sale
and relocation to Seattle,  the Sacramento Bee reported .  No formal offer has been extended to the Maloof family,
which owns the National Basketball Association team, the
newspaper said, citing sources it didn’t identify.  Hansen, founder of San Francisco-based Valiant Capital
Management, has put together a group including Microsoft Corp.
Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  that’s willing to finance
a new arena in Seattle, the Bee reported.  Seattle has been without an NBA team since the SuperSonics
ended their 41-year stay by moving to Oklahoma City and becoming
the Thunder in 2008-09.  To contact the reporter on this story:
