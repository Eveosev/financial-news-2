Natural gas futures advanced for the
first time in four days after a government report showed that
U.S. stockpiles declined by the most in almost two years.  Gas gained 2.6 percent after the Energy Department said
inventories fell 201 billion cubic feet in the seven days ended
Jan. 4 to 3.316 trillion cubic feet, the biggest weekly decline
since February 2011. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed an expected drop of 191 billion.  “This was definitely a bullish withdrawal,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston. “It
was a cold week. People had reduced their expectations because
of the New Year’s holiday, but this number would have been
bullish even if it hadn’t been a holiday week.”  Natural gas for February delivery rose 8 cents to settle at
$3.193 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have climbed 8.6 percent from a year
ago. Trading volume was up 14 percent from the 100-day average
at 334,279 as of 3:04 p.m. Volume was 40 percent below the
average before the supply report was released.  February $3.50 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.3 cent higher at 1.2 cents on
volume of 962 contracts as of 2:45 p.m. Calls accounted for
about half of options volume.  Gas for March delivery traded 1.5 cents above the February
contract, compared with 1.8 cents yesterday.  Stockpile Surplus  The five-year average stockpile decline for the week is 121
billion cubic feet, according to FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in
Calgary. A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 10.7 percent
from 12.4 percent the previous week. Supplies were 2.6 percent
below year-earlier inventories, the widest deficit since
September 2011.  The weather may be colder than normal in the Northeast from
Jan. 20 through Jan. 24, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The low in New York on Jan. 20 may be 16 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 7 Celsius), 11 lower than usual, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Boston  may be 21
degrees, 1 below average.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Department data show.  The department increased its estimate for 2013 natural gas
prices in a Jan. 8 report, citing more normal winter heating
demand compared with last year. Gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub 
in Erath,  Louisiana , will average $3.74 per million Btu, up from
the December estimate of $3.68, according to the monthly  Short-
Term Energy Outlook.  Prices averaged $2.75 in 2012.  Production Gain  Natural gas output in the lower-48 states rose to an all-
time high in October as more of the fuel was pumped from shale
formations in the Northeast and  North Dakota , the department
said Jan. 7.  Gross gas production increased 0.4 percent to 73.54 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 73.22 billion in September, the
department’s Energy Information Administration said in the
monthly  EIA-914 report .  Supplies from the “other states” category rose 1.8
percent to 23.94 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 23.51
billion in September. Production in that region advanced “as
operators reported new wells coming online in the Marcellus and
Bakken shale plays,” the department said.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first nine months of last year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
