Qatari stocks rose to the highest
level in nine months on expectations  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) ,
the Middle East’s biggest lender, will report higher full-year
earnings, boosting the outlook for the nation’s banks.  Qatar National, which will probably release results Jan.
13, surged the most since May 2011.  Commercial Bank of Qatar
QSC , the Persian Gulf country’s second-biggest bank, gained 1.7
percent. The  Qatar Exchange Banking Sector Index (DSMBNKI)  rallied 1.8
percent, helping lift the benchmark  QE Index (DSM)  1 percent to
8,781.70, the highest level since April 12, at the close in
Doha. The measure advanced 2.5 percent this week.  Qatar National “will kick off the Qatari earnings season
on Sunday and the market is clearly pricing in a strong
result,” said Akber Khan, director of asset management at Al
Rayan Investment in Doha. “The rally today was all about banks,
the sector that held the market back throughout 2012.”  The Doha-based bank, which said today it won approval to
open a representative office in China, agreed to take over
 Societe Generale SA (GLE) ’s  Egypt  unit last month in a deal that will
take its assets above $100 billion, a first for the Middle East.
The lender’s 2012 profit probably grew 13 percent, according to
the average  estimate  of 10 analysts on Bloomberg. Qatar National
shares climbed 2.9 percent to 140.4 riyals today.  Dividend Yields  The lender  missed profit estimates  in the first three
quarters of 2012, which contributed to pushing its stock down
5.3 percent last year. Banking industry shares lost 9.3 percent
in the period, dragging the QE Index 4.8 percent lower. They
also underperformed Gulf Cooperation Council peers as the
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial Index (BGCCFINL)  advanced 3.2 percent in 2012.  Qatar’s economy grew 6.3 percent last year, the slowest
pace since 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still,
banks are boosting lending as the government undertakes more
than $130 billion of investments to prepare for the 2022 soccer
 World Cup .  Commercial Bank of Qatar may post a 29 percent increase
fourth-quarter profit, the fastest quarterly earnings expansion
in two years, according to the median estimate of four analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Its shares gained the most since Sept. 16
to 75.8 riyals.  Investors are also showing “increased interest in banks in
anticipation of dividend yields,” Bobby Sarkar, head of
research at Doha-based Qatar National Bank Financial Services,
said by phone. The QE Banking Sector Index has a dividend yield
of 4.3 percent, compared with 3.11 percent for the Bloomberg GCC
200 Financial Index.  Al Ahli Bank QSC (ABQK)  rallied 8.3 percent, the most since Nov.
1, to 56 riyals after the bank said Bahrain-based Ahli United
Bank would sell 37.37 million shares in its Qatari affiliate to
the  Qatar Foundation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
