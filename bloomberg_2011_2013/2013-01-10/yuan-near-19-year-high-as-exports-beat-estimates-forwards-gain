China’s  yuan  strengthened to near
its 19-year high as export growth exceeded forecasts and the
nation’s central bank boosted the currency’s  reference rate .
Forwards advanced to a 10-month high.  Overseas sales  rose 14.1 percent from a year earlier in
December, official data showed today, compared with a 2.9
percent increase in November and the median estimate of a 5
percent gain in a Bloomberg survey. The People’s Bank of China
raised the reference rate by 0.03 percent to 6.2793 per dollar,
the strongest since May 2012. Inflation quickened to 2.3 percent
last month from 2 percent in November, according to the median
estimate of 43 economists before data due tomorrow.  “A recovery in exports is positive for  China’s economy  and
hence the yuan,” said Kenix Lai, a currency analyst at  Bank of
East Asia Ltd. (23)  in  Hong Kong . “A stronger currency will help
China to tame inflationary pressure, which is building up.”  The yuan rose 0.04 percent to 6.2236 per dollar as of 10:41
a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It touched 6.2216 yesterday, the highest level since the
government unified the official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the daily fixing.  The most-accurate forecasters for the yuan predict the
currency will advance 2 percent, doubling last year’s gains as
China seeks to encourage  consumer spending .  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards climbed 0.16 percent to 6.2895 per dollar,
a 1.1 percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reached 6.2875
earlier, the strongest level since March 6, 2012. The currency
gained 0.06 percent to 6.1990 per dollar.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options,
increased three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.53
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
