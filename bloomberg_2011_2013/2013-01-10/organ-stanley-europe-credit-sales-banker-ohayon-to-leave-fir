Eric Ohayon, co-head of European
credit sales at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , is leaving the investment bank
as it plans to reduce 1,600 jobs.  Ohayon, reached on his mobile phone today, confirmed his
departure and declined to comment on the reason for the move. A
spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Ohayon.  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
plans to eliminate about 6 percent of the staff at the company’s
institutional securities group, which includes investment
banking and trading units, and support staff, a person familiar
with the cuts said yesterday. About half the reductions will be
in the U.S., the person said. Chief Executive Officer  James
Gorman  has pledged to lower costs as return on equity remains
below the New York-based bank’s cost of capital.  Ohayon, based in  London , had worked for Morgan Stanley
since at least 2001, according to the U.K. Financial Services
Authority’s register of approved individuals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
