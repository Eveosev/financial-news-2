Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR) , the
Brazilian Unit of Spain’s biggest lender, jumped the most in
five months after a magazine report that was later retracted
renewed speculation about the sale of a stake in the bank.  Shares rose 5.1 percent to 15.98 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. It was the biggest advance on the  MSCI
Brazil/Financials Index (MXBR0FN) , which dropped 0.1 percent.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBD)  offered to buy a stake in Sao Paulo-based
Santander Brasil, the magazine Veja reported on its website late
yesterday. The magazine retracted the report 20 minutes later,
saying it was “mistaken.”  Bradesco, based in Osasco, Brazil, and Santander Brasil
said in separate e-mailed statements that they “categorically
deny” the report.  Speculation about the sale of a stake in Santander Brasil
began in May 2012, when its Spanish parent, Madrid-based  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) , agreed to sell its Colombian business to Santiago-
based Corpbanca SA for $1.16 billion as part of a plan to plug a
capital shortfall in the wake of Spain’s property crash.  The parent owns 75 percent of Santander Brasil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
