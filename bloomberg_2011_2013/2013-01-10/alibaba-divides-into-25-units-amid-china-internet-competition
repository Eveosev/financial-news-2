Alibaba Group Holding Ltd,  China ’s
largest e-commerce company, said it’s reorganizing into smaller
divisions to improve flexibility and to better focus on
different markets.  The company will divide into 25 units from seven, John Spelich, a spokesman, said by phone yesterday. The heads of the
new divisions will report to nine senior managers who will in
turn report to Chairman Jack Ma.  “We are going to make the most difficult organizational
and cultural transformation in Alibaba’s 13-year history,” said
Ma, according to an e-mail from the company. The new units will
include retail and wholesale e-commerce, data mining and cloud
computing.  Alibaba is re-organizing as it competes with companies
including  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  in China’s fast-growing e-commerce market.
Ma similarly divided e-commerce arm Taobao into three divisions
in 2011 to better focus on different markets, Spelich said.  Alibaba delisted its Hong Kong-traded unit last year, as
well as buying back a stake from  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
