Investor Jason Ader withdrew from
seeking a personal board seat at  International Game Technology (IGT) ,
while continuing to back a slate of independent candidates, the
company said.  IGT, the world’s largest slot machine maker, had said on
Jan. 7 that Ader, a former casino analyst, would propose four
new directors for the company’s board, including himself. Ader,
who runs New York-based Ader Investment Management LLC, has told
the company he still intends to nominate three candidates, the
IGT said today in a statement.  Ader is working with Charles Mathewson, IGT’s former
chairman and chief executive officer, the company said.
Mathewson, Raymond J. Brooks and Daniel B. Silver are the other
potential nominees.  IGT’s current chief executive, Patti Hart, said in an
interview this week that she and the company’s current board
opposed the new nominees.  IGT, based in  Las Vegas , rose 1.6 percent to $14.97 today
in New York. The shares have gained 5.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
