Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
 narrowed  to the lowest level in more than two weeks on
speculation that higher corn prices will curtail supply and on
optimism for increased demand.  The grain-based additive was 54.83 cents below the motor
fuel, which includes reformulated gasoline known as RBOB, based
on prompt-month contracts for both commodities. That was down
from 54.89 cents yesterday and the smallest gap since Dec. 24.  “The spread to RBOB has widened,” said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago . “I wouldn’t be
surprised to see guys take advantage.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.245 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest level since Dec. 18. Prices have fallen
0.8 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.285 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.20, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.25 and on the West Coast at $2.335 a gallon, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Gasoline for February delivery advanced 1.44 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7933 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers RBOB, which is made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery gained 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $6.9875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Losing Money  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  Corn  inventories  are dropping at the fastest pace in 17
years because of drought in the U.S. Midwest. Stockpiles on Dec.
1 were 15 percent lower than a year earlier at 8.22 billion
bushels, the smallest post-harvest level since 2003, according
to the average of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The Agriculture Department releases its supply report tomorrow.  Ethanol companies have tempered  output  13 percent in the
past year to 826,000 barrels a day as of last week, according to
data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the
analytical arm of the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
