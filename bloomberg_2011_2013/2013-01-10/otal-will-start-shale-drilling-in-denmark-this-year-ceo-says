Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-biggest oil
company, expects to start exploratory drilling in Denmark later
this year as part of a push to develop shale energy projects
outside the U.S.  The Paris-based company is also investing in Poland and
China, Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said in an
interview published in Le Monde newspaper. Sandre Dante, a
spokeswoman for Total, confirmed his comments.  Total has “slowed” investment in shale gas projects in
Texas because prices have dropped below the cost of production,
he was quoted as saying. It continues to invest in developing
shale projects in areas like  Ohio  that are condensate-rich and
more profitable.  Total in October wrote down the value of its Barnett shale
assets in the U.S. The impairment followed a combined $3 billion
of writedowns from BG Group Plc and Encana Corp. on the value of
their gas properties in  North America . The price adjustments
came amid a glut in supplies from booming shale production.  Total has a venture with Chesapeake Energy Corp. to produce
natural gas in the U.S., both in the Barnett shale in Texas and
the liquids-rich Utica shale play in Ohio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
