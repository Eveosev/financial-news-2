Spain ’s 10-year borrowing costs fell
below 5 percent for the first time since March after it overshot
its maximum target at its initial 2013 debt sales.  The Madrid-based Treasury raised 5.82 billion euros ($7.6
billion) in the sale of three bonds, including a new two-year
security with so-called collective-action clauses. Beating a
maximum target of 5 billion euros, it said it covered 4.8
percent of its planned 2013 medium and long-term debt sales.  Spanish bonds are slumping as the Treasury’s funding needs
have risen with most Spanish regions locked out of markets and a
deepening  recession  blunting budget deficit cuts. Spain  aims  to
raise net issuance by 24 percent this year, with a net target of
71 billion euros of bonds and bills, up from 57.1 billion euros
of debt last year, when it sold 55 percent more than planned.  “Market confidence is coming back,” said Mohit Kumar,
head of European fixed-income strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in
 London  in a interview with Bloomberg Television. “As long as
there is a reasonable amount of support from domestic investors,
yields will not rise.”  Yields Decline  At 4.947 percent at 1:07 p.m. in Madrid, the yield on the
nation’s  10-year benchmark bond  today completed its longest
period of sustained decline since the euro debt crisis started
in 2010. Over the last five months and a half, the yield has
shed around 2.8 percentage points, compared with a 1.79
percentage point drop over about two months between November
2011 and March 2012.  That compares with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent before
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to save the
euro on July 26. The program the ECB has since presented, and
which is known as OMT, would consist of debt purchases on the
secondary markets for nations requesting aid from the EU’s ESM
rescue-fund. The spread with similar German maturities narrowed
by as much as 16 basis points to 3.45 percentage points.  “On a relative-value basis, I think this part of the world
is worth investing in,”  Andrew Bosomworth , managing director at
Pacific  Investment Management  Co. told Bloomberg Television.
“When you stack up some of these countries like Spain and  Italy 
against the other alternatives in global fixed-income they are
looking like pretty good yields.”  ‘No Imminent Concern’  Spain’s 2015 note yielded 2.476 percent, compared with
3.282 percent the last time a similar maturity was sold on Oct.
4, the 2018 bond 3.988 percent, compared with 4.680 percent the
last time it was sold on Nov. 8, and the 2026 bond 5.555
percent, compared with 5.593 percent on the secondary markets
before the sale.  Demand for the 2015 bond was 2.07 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.03 in October, while the bid-to-cover ratio was
2.59 for the 2018 bond, compared with 1.57 in November. For the
2026 notes it was 2.85.  “Today’s auction reflects there’s no imminent concern
Spain might go down the same road as Portugal, Ireland or
 Greece ,” Fadi Zaher, head of fixed-income sales and trading for
Barclays Wealth and Investment Management in London, said in a
telephone interview. “Sentiment may dampen when budget cuts
start having an impact on the bank loans’ performance and
business is hurt as  consumer spending  is on its knees.”  In office since December 2011, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
is hoping to avoid seeking an ECB intervention to lower Spain’s
borrowing costs. The premier’s government is struggling to meet
budget goals set by the European Union to tackle the second-
largest shortfall in the euro area, as large as Greece’s at 9.4
percent of gross domestic product in 2011.  “International investors will continue to buy and go
overweight over the coming weeks,” Justin Knight, a London-
based European rates strategist at UBS AG, said in a telephone
interview. “Having said that, its going to be a challenge to
keep this pace of issuance up all year as the government needs
to issue an average 10 billion euros a month.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
