Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social,  Brazil â€™s national development bank, has
extended a 4 billion-real ($1.97 billion) financing program for
sugar-cane growers to the end of this year.  The Prorenova credit line was scheduled to terminate on
Dec. 31 2012, the Rio de Janeiro-based lender said today in a
statement. Companies registered 70 cane expansion and renewal
projects totaling 1.4 billion reais last year.  Cane growers will be able to borrow as much as 5,450 reais
a hectare compared with the previous cap of 4,350 reais,
according to the statement.  BNDES, as the bank is known, disbursed 475 million reais
from the line through the first week of January, a spokeswoman
for the bank who wanted to remain anonymous because of company
policy said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
