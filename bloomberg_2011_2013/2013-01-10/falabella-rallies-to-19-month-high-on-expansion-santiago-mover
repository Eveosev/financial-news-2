SACI Falabella (FALAB) ,  Chile ’s largest
public company by market value, rose to its highest in 19 months
after announcing plans to spend $3.92 billion in the next four
years to almost double its stores.  Falabella rose 0.8 percent to 5,169 pesos at 11:34 a.m. in
Santiago after touching 5,199, its highest intraday price since
June 2011. The Ipsa benchmark index gained 0.4 percent.  The retailer, which operates department stores,
supermarkets, home improvement stores, malls and a bank unit in
Chile, Peru,  Colombia  and Argentina, said yesterday in a
statement that it will spend $3.92 billion to open 231 new
stores and 20 malls by 2017. This represents a 78 percent
increase from its current 296 stores.  The expansion plan is positive for Falabella because it
will increase surface area at stores at a 9 percent compounded
annual growth rate in the period,  Banco Santander  said in a note
to clients today. Santander previously forecast a growth rate of
6 percent.  “The company does not need a capital increase or
additional debt to do it,” analysts Adolfo Ortuzar, Francisco Errandonea and Tobias Stingelin said in the note.  Falabella’s market value may rise by 8 percent this year
because of the expansion, Santander said. The retailer’s market
value is $26.5 billion, the biggest among Chilean listed
companies, followed by  Empresas Copec SA (COPEC) , with $19.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
