The biggest snowstorm to hit
 Jerusalem  in more than two decades shut down much of the city
today, after four days of heavy rain also caused flood damage
and power outages in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.  Two Palestinian women were drowned in flash floods in the
West Bank yesterday, the Wafa news agency said.  Israeli army rescue units used military helicopters and
naval boats to assist people stranded by rising waters at
several locations throughout the country.  “The emergency and rescue forces are struggling around the
clock in the storm in order to save lives,” Israeli Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said in an e-mailed statement.  The snow in Jerusalem, forecast to reach at least 20
centimeters (8 inches) before tapering off today, closed the
main highway from  Tel Aviv  and shut down public transportation
in the city.  The storm has cost Israeli industry at least 300 million
shekels ($80 million), with half of it attributed to absenteeism
as people were prevented from reaching work by roadblocks set up
by police due to flooding, the Manufacturers Association of
 Israel  said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
