Rubber climbed to the highest level
in more than eight months after the Japanese yen neared a 2 1/2
year-low and exports from  China  exceeded forecasts.  Rubber for delivery in June rose as much as 2.8 percent to
316.7 yen a kilogram ($3,597 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the highest level for the most-active
contract since May 2, and was at 313.5 yen at 11:52 a.m. local
time. Futures have gained 3.7 percent this year, extending last
year’s advance of 15 percent.  The yen weakened for a second day before data forecast to
show the nation’s trade deficit widened, raising the appeal of
contracts denominated in the Japanese currency. China’s exports
rose 14.1 percent in December from a year earlier, beating a
median estimate of 5 percent from 40 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey, helping the nation sustain a pickup in economic
growth after a seven-quarter slowdown.  “Weakening yen and better-than-expected Chinese trade data
are key drivers boosting the rubber,” Sureerat Kunthongjun, an
analyst at AGROW Enterprise Ltd., said by phone from Bangkok.
Investors are also optimistic that China will build inventories
ahead of the long holidays next month, she said. The country is
the world’s biggest rubber importer.  Natural-rubber inventories monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange gained 1,770 tons to 97,697 tons last week, the
highest level since March 2010. China’s markets are closed in
the week beginning Feb. 11 for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Rubber for delivery in May gained 0.4 percent to 26,140
 yuan  ($4,200) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board rose 0.2 percent to 101.55 baht ($3.34) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
