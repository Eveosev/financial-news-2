Greece ’s budget deficit narrowed 30
percent in 2012, beating a target set for the year as the
country cut spending.  The budget gap, excluding spending by state-controlled
enterprises, narrowed to 15.9 billion euros ($21 billion) from
22.8 billion euros in 2011, according to preliminary  figures 
released today by the Athens-based  Finance Ministry . The
government target for the period was 16.3 billion euros.  In November, Greece’s coalition government approved new
austerity measures to obtain aid under two bailouts from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . The economy
may have contracted as much as 6.5 percent in 2012, the fifth
year of recession, according to forecasts in the 2013 budget.  “These positive indicators show that our efforts for
fiscal consolidation, adjustment and discipline have started
yielding results,” Alternate Finance Minister Christos Staikouras wrote in a separate e-mailed statement today.
“However this satisfactory budget execution result doesn’t
allow for celebration. The road that we must travel is a long
and difficult one.”  The primary deficit, which excludes debt-service costs, was
3.7 billion euros compared with a goal of 4.6 billion euros. Net
revenue fell 4.1 percent to 51.7 billion euros compared with a
target of just under 52.4 billion euros. Spending dropped to
67.6 billion euros from 76.7 billion euros, beating a target of
68.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
