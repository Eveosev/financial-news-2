SAC Capital Advisors LP,  Steven A.
Cohen ’s $14 billion hedge fund, is closing its Chicago office
that housed four investment teams.  “We regularly review our operations, and given the limited
opportunity in the region we didn’t believe it made sense to
have a separate office,” Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for
the Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge fund, said in an e-mail.  The office closing was reported earlier today by Dow Jones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
