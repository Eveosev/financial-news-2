  Grupo BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11) , the Brazilian
investment bank led by billionaire  Andre Esteves , fell the most
in seven months after the exchange said a 5.38 percent block of
the company’s shares will be sold at a discount tomorrow.  Shares of BTG Pactual fell 4.3 percent to 31.50 reais at
3:21 p.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier sliding as much as 6.9
percent in the steepest intraday drop since June 8. The
benchmark Bovespa index slipped 0.2 percent.  Unidentified investors will sell about 6.5 million shares
tomorrow between 10:30 a.m. and 10:45 a.m., exchange operator
 BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3)  said today in a statement. The price will be
29.50 reais a share, 10 percent below yesterday’s closing level,
the exchange said.  Sao Paulo-based BTG Pactual will broker the sale, according
to the statement. The sellers are not controlling shareholders
and do not know “any relevant information about the company
that isn’t public,” the exchange said.  The exchange announces and holds such “special sales” to
ensure all investors have a fair chance to bid on the discounted
shares.  Today’s drop left BTG Pactual shares below its April 2012
initial public offering price of 31.25 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
