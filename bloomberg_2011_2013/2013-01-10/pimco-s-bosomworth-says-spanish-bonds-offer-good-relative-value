Spanish and Italian bonds offer
better yields than other fixed-income assets and are worth
keeping to receive the returns, according to Andrew Bosomworth,
managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co.  “When you stack up some of these countries like Spain and
Italy against the other alternatives in global fixed-income they
are looking like pretty good yields,” Bosomworth said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with Francine
Lacqua and  Guy Johnson . “On a relative-value basis, I think
this part of the world is worth investing in. If you sell it,
where else do you go?”  Spain’s introduction of conditions that make debt
restructuring easier, or so-called collective-action clauses,
“are not going to make a major difference,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
