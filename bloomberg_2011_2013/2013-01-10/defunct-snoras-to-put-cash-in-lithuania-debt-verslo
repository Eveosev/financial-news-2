Bankrupt lender Bankas Snoras AB’s
administrator will invest most of the cash it has recovered into
Lithuanian  government securities  pending a court ruling on the
priority of creditors’ claims, Verslo Zinios reported.  Creditors have authorized investing the money, which
totaled 1.3 billion litai ($490 million) at Nov. 1, for no
longer than two years in Lithuania debt securities or deposits
at local units of Nordic banks, the newspaper said, citing
Aurelija Mazintiene, the head of the creditors committee.  Lithuania’s Constitutional Court has been asked to rule on
a law that gives the state’s deposit-insurance company top
priority among Snoras creditors, the newspaper said.  The  Finance Ministry  is considering a private placement of
debt securities to Snoras so that it can invest its money
without any impact on  capital markets , Verslo Zinios reported,
without identifying the source of the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
