The  Philippine peso  advanced to a
four-year high as Deutsche Bank AG predicted the currency will
strengthen 7.2 percent by the end of the year. Bonds advanced.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 40.735 per dollar as of 2:18
p.m. in  Manila , the strongest level since March 10, 2008, prices
from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. It climbed 6.8 percent last year,
second only to South Koreans’ won among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded
currencies. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at
4.1 percent.  Dollar receipts will support the peso’s advance to 38
against the greenback,  Michael Spencer , Deutsche Bank’s chief
economist for Asia, said at a briefing in Manila today. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas may raise its benchmark rate three times
this year as inflation pressures may build up should strong
growth persist, he said. The peso will gain 3.2 percent to 39.5
by the end of 2013, according to the median estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “To the extent there are underlying flows, the central
bank will be willing to accommodate some appreciation,” of the
peso, Sameer Goel, head of Asian rates and currency strategy at
Deutsche Bank in  Singapore , said at the same briefing.  The central bank cut its overnight borrowing rate four
times last year to a record low 3.5 percent. The $225 billion
economy is at risk of overheating and “it’s very healthy for
the  Philippines  for  interest rates  to go up,” Spencer said.  Bonds advanced after the government reported today that
 exports  rose 5.5 percent in November from a year earlier. That
was the least since August and compares with the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey for a 20 percent increase.  The yield on the 3.875 percent notes due November 2019 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.11 percent,
halting four days of increases, according to midday fixing
prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
