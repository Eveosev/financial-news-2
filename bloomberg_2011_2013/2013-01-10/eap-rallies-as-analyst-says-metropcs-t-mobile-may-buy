Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) 
gained the most in five months after an analyst said there’s a
70 percent change  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  and  T-Mobile USA 
will bid for it after completing their merger.  Leap  advanced  9.6 percent to $6.88 at the close in New
York, for the biggest gain since Aug. 10. Shing Yin, a
Guggenheim Securities analyst, said such a deal would “make
sense.” The San Diego-based pay-as-you-go wireless carrier’s
shares dropped 28 percent in 2012 for the  sixth-consecutive  year
of declines.  Leap rallied 5.5 percent on Nov. 19 on a report that it
held talks with MetroPCS about a three-way deal with  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile division. MetroPCS had disclosed in a Nov.
16 filing that it previously discussed a deal with a third
party. T-Mobile and MetroPCS said in October that they planned
to merge.  “Leap’s complementary spectrum assets, the potential for
significant synergies and a straightforward integration process
that likely would not disrupt initiatives already under way,”
Yin wrote in a client note today.  Aside from MetroPCS’s proxy statement, “T-Mobile CEO John
Legere has said that a transaction with Leap could make ‘extreme
sense,’” Yin wrote.  T-Mobile and MetroPCS could pay as much as $9 to $10 a
share after they complete their deal, which is expected to close
some time in the first quarter, wrote Yin, who rates Leaps
shares as a buy.  He raised his price target for Leap to $8.50 from $7.
MetroPCS advanced 3.6 percent to $9.73 in  New York . Deutsche
Telekom fell less than 1 percent to 9.13 euros in Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
