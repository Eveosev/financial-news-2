Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  rose to the
highest level in more than four years in Tokyo trading after
agreeing to develop a pickup truck with  General Motors Co. (GM)   Isuzu gained 3.8 percent to 545 yen at the close of trade
today, its highest since June 2008. The benchmark  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.7 percent.  GM signed a memorandum of understanding with Isuzu to
cooperate in building next-generation pickup trucks, the
Detroit-based carmaker said in a Jan. 9 statement. After ending
their 35-year capital alliance in April 2006, GM and Isuzu have
continued to build trucks together at Isuzu’s factory in
Thailand. The automakers jointly developed the D-Max one-ton
pickup, which made its debut in  Thailand  in 2002.  “While no specific measures have been decided yet, we
already build pickups with GM,” Eiji Mitsuhashi, a spokesman
for Tokyo-based Isuzu, said by phone today. “I believe the idea
for now is to continue doing that for the next model as well.”  The chairmen from each company will meet as early as this
month to discuss the plan, the Nikkei newspaper reported before
GM’s announcement. Toshihiro Kishi, a Tokyo-based spokesman for
GM, said no specific dates have been set for the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
