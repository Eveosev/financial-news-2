Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gaining for a second day, as the yen
weakened after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pressed for a higher
inflation target and China’s trade data beat estimates.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets about 81 percent of its sales
outside Japan, advanced 2.5 percent. Komatsu Ltd., a maker of
construction equipment that gets about 14 percent of sales from
China, climbed 1.6 percent. Izutsuya Co. jumped 48 percent after
the department-store operator raised its profit forecast.
 Tokyo  Electric Power Co. finished the day flat after
a plunge that almost erased a 19 percent gain in seconds. The
stock exchange said the selloff wasn’t the result of an error.  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to close at 10,652.64 in
Tokyo. Trading volume on the gauge was 54 percent above the 30-
day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index advanced 1.1 percent to
889.02, with about three stocks advancing for each that fell.  “Optimism for policy action is continuing from the end of
last year,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $20 billion. “The
market seems to have priced in half of the weaker yen’s impact
on earnings and the effect of Abe’s stimulus measures.”  The Topix has advanced 23 percent since Nov. 14 when
elections were announced, driving the gauge into a  bull market 
on expectations a new government would call for more stimulus.
An advance of 20 percent or more from a low signals a bull
market to some investors. The gauge is trading at 1.06 times
book value, compared with 2.19 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPXL1)  and 1.59 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Inflation Target  Abe said yesterday the  Bank of Japan  should aim for 2
percent inflation at the first meeting in four years of a panel
that brings together government and central bank officials.  Exporters gained as the yen fell against all 16 of its
major peers for a second day. A weaker currency boosts the value
of overseas earnings for Japanese companies. Honda advanced 2.5
percent to 3,330 yen.  Companies that do business in China advanced after the
government reported today the nation’s exports rose 14.1 percent
in December from a year earlier. Imports increased 6 percent,
leaving a trade surplus of $31.6 billion.  “China’s export data is boosting investor sentiment,”
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based global market strategist at
JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which oversees about $1.3
trillion globally. “They beat the consensus and so confidence
among investors has been ticking up.”  China-Linked Shares  Komatsu added 1.6 percent to 2,294 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a maker
of electronics components that depends on China for 27 percent
of its sales, rose 1.5 percent to 3,460 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  rose 0.2 percent today. The
gauge yesterday advanced 0.3 percent amid investor optimism
about fourth-quarter corporate earnings.  Isuzu Motors Ltd. jumped 3.8 percent to 545 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported it would partner with General Motors
Co. to manufacture  pickup trucks .  Izutsuya surged 48 percent to 92 yen, its biggest advance
on record and its highest level since July 2008. The department
store operator yesterday raised its net income outlook by 46
percent to 1.9 billion yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 3.8 percent
to 20.15, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Tokyo Electric Power, the utility at the center of the
Fukushima nuclear disaster, closed unchanged at 209 yen after
rising as much as 20 percent. The gain were mostly erased in
less than a minute as the result of several sell orders that
weren’t made in error, said Natsuho Torii, a spokesman for  Japan 
Exchange Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
