An acceleration in Ukraine’s
economic growth may help the government avoid a third
 International Monetary Fund  bailout,  Renaissance Capital  said.  Gross domestic product may expand 3 percent this year,
compared with an estimated 1 percent in 2012,  Ivan Tchakarov ,
chief economist for Russia and the  Commonwealth of Independent
States  at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said today in an e-
mailed note.  “A better global backdrop in 2013 may blunt government
incentives to re-engage the IMF,” Tchakarov said. “The ruling
Party of Regions has all the incentives to drag its feet and not
enforce electorate confidence-busting measures until the all-
important 2015 presidential elections.”  The IMF will send a mission to Ukraine this month to
discuss a new loan as ebbing export demand weighs on GDP growth
and central bank reserves stand at an almost three-year low. The
government received $3.45 billion of a $15.4 billion stand-by
loan signed in 2010 before the facility was frozen because
officials refused to raise household utility tariffs.  “Rising external pressures may still likely bring  Ukraine 
back to IMF’s embrace, but this may happen well after the winter
season is over,” Tchakarov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
