Canadian  crude oil  weakened after
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  issued a mid-month apportionment notice for its
Mainline pipeline system.  Enbridge Line 6a has been apportioned by 16 percent and
Lines 4 and 67 each by 10 percent for the remainder of January,
the company said.  Western Canada Select, a heavy bitumen blend, fell $2.50 to
a $39.50 discount to U.S. oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate,
according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. Syncrude, a
synthetic light oil processed from oil-sands bitumen, fell 75
cents to a 25 cent discount, according to Net Energy data.  The mid-month shift was caused by power outages in
Manitoba, as well as an electrical equipment failure in  Edmonton 
in December, according to one of the people.  Oils produced in Texasâ€™s Permian Basin weakened as
 HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  was scheduled to begin maintenance at its
115,000 barrel-a-day  Navajo refinery  in Artesia,  New Mexico ,
early this month. Company officials said Nov. 7 maintenance
would begin this month, and the company reported extra emissions
from the plant on Jan. 7. The refinery processes crudes from
West Texas and Cushing.  West Texas Sour weakened 75 cents to an $18.75 per-barrel
discount to WTI, while West Texas Intermediate delivered in
Midland, Texas, weakened 65 cents to trade at a $13.75 discount
to the same grade delivered in the U.S. supply hub in Cushing,
Oklahoma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
