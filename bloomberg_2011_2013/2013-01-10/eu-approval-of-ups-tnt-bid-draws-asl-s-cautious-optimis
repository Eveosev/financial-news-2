United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s chances
of receiving European Commission approval to take over  TNT
Express NV (TNTE)  have drawn cautious optimism from the chief executive
officer of ASL Aviation Group Ltd., the company that agreed to
buy TNT’s airline operations in November.  ASL, based in Swords, Ireland, agreed to buy TNT’s airline
unit on the condition that UPS complete its proposed 5.16
billion-euro ($6.81 billion) purchase of TNT.  “We are cautiously optimistic,” ASL CEO Hugh Flynn said
in an e-mailed response when asked whether he thinks the EU will
approve the UPS-TNT deal. He declined to comment on potential
talks to provide services to La Poste SA’s DPD parcel-
distribution unit, which is UPS’s preferred buyer for European
assets, a person familiar with the matter said in November.  The EU is currently reviewing UPS’s concessions, such as
selling assets and offering air-network access to rivals, as it
seeks antitrust approval for the purchase of TNT, the Hoofddorp,
Netherlands-based package-delivery company. ASL, which provides
air freight services to parcel companies, including  FedEx Corp. (FDX) 
and  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL, has 90 aircraft and 1,200 employees,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
