Indonesian President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono has signed a  regulation  requiring producers to place
photographic warnings on cigarette packaging, a bid to curb
consumption in a nation where most adult males smoke.  The shares of PT Gudang Garam fell 0.4 percent to 53,800
rupiah ($5.45) at the midday break in Jakarta, while those of PT
Handaya Mandala Sampoerna and PT Wismilak Inti Makmur dropped
0.8 percent to 63,000 rupiah and 1.4 percent to 710 rupiah,
respectively. The Jakarta Composite Index declined 0.4 percent.  Tobacco taxes will generate more than 80 trillion rupiah
for  state coffers in 2013 , according to a draft government
budget. Any impact on  tobacco companies  would be outweighed by a
recent decision to increase minimum wages, which will boost
consumption among low-income groups, said Joseph Pangaribuan, an
analyst at PT Samuel Sekuritas in Jakarta.  “The industry outlook remains positive as tobacco excise
only rose by 5.6 percent this year, lower than the rate that we
have seen over the past eight years,” he said.  Cigarette producers will have 18 months to implement the
rules, which also prohibit the use of terms such as “mild” and
“light” in connection with tobacco products, according to a
posting on a government website late on Jan. 9. Some 66 percent
of Indonesia men aged 15 and over are smokers, according to the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey published by the  World Health
Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
