The price of iron ore in  China , at
the highest in more than 14 months, will fall in the second half
of 2013 as the country’s mines ramp up output that was curbed by
the coldest winter in 28 years, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Mills in China, the biggest iron-ore users, are restocking
through December and January amid an improved outlook for
construction, infrastructure activity and manufacturing in the
country, the investment bank said an e-mailed report today.
Mines in China that ran short of capacity last year will boost
production from March, according to Credit Suisse.  “China’s domestic mine supply has been unable to respond
through price-induced reactivations as China suffers its coldest
winter snap in almost 30 years,” the bank said. Resumed output
will probably “fuel a retreat in prices in the second half of
2013 as supply once again catches up with demand.”  The price of ore with an iron content of 62 percent landed
in Tianjin, a Chinese port, fell 0.2 percent to $158.20 a dry
metric ton today, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The price
has gained 82 percent since plunging a near-three year low of
$86.70 in September.  “This new-found buoyancy will not last beyond the first
half of the year, and shorter-term price corrections, in line
with increased volatility, are quite possible,” the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
