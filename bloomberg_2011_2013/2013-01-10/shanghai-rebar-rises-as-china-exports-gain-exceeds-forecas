Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose today as an unexpectedly strong expansion of
Chinese exports fueled expectations that industrial activity
will increase.  Rebar for delivery in May gained as much as 0.8 percent to
4,030  yuan  ($646) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
before trading at 4,019 at 10:47 a.m. local time. The most-
active contract reached 4,047 yuan on Jan. 7, the highest level
since July 10.  China ’s exports rose 14.1 percent in December from a year
earlier while imports increased 6 percent, producing a trade
surplus of $31.6 billion, the customs administration said today.
The pickup in overseas shipments compares with the 5 percent
median estimate of 40 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “China’s export sector is improving,” Dang Man, analyst
at Maike Futures Co., said in a report today. “Steel prices’
downside is limited because the market now expects demand from
the downstream industries to pick up.”  Prices surged 14 percent in December, the most since July
2009, as  China’s economy  headed for a rebound in the final three
months of the year after a seven-quarter slowdown as the
government increased infrastructure spending and accelerated
investment-project approvals.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $158.50 a
dry ton yesterday, matching the day before, when it reached the
highest level since Oct. 13, 2011, data compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd. showed. The average spot  price  for rebar was at 3,774
yuan a ton yesterday, unchanged from Jan. 7 when it reached the
highest level since Oct. 15, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
