An explosion in  Tel Aviv  today that
left four people injured was probably connected to a battle
between rival criminal gangs, Israeli police said.  The blast was caused by a small bomb planted on a car
driving along Menachem Begin Boulevard near the main Tel Aviv
train station, according to police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld .
The explosion caused only light injuries, he said.  “Investigators are looking into the possibility that this
was an assassination attempt against an organized crime
figure,” Rosenfeld said by phone.  Not far from the site of today’s incident, a bomb exploded
on a city bus on Nov. 21, injuring 20 people. Police later
arrested and charged an Arab citizen of Israel with planting the
device.  To contact the reporter on this story:
