Sprott Power Corp. (SPZ) , a Canadian
renewable energy developer, rose after saying it hired an
adviser to consider options including a possible sale of the
company.  Sprott increased 6.7 percent to C$1.27 at the close in
Toronto. Earlier it gained to C$1.37, the highest intraday since
Feb. 8, 2011.  The company, based in Toronto, hired Canaccord Genuity
Corp. to advise on its strategic options, “with a view to
enhancing shareholder value,” Sprott said today in a statement.
It doesn’t intend to make any further announcements until the
board “deems appropriate,” the company said.  Sprott agreed Aug. 8 to buy Shear Wind Inc. for C$33
million ($33.5 million) in cash and completed the deal Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
