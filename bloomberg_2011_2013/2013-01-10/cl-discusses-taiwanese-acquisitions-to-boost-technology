TCL Corp. (000100) ,  China ’s biggest flat-
panel television maker, said it held discussions to acquire
Taiwanese companies to add new technologies.  The TV-maker is interested in deals in the fields of
semiconductors, chipset design and panel-related components,
Chairman Li Dongsheng said in an interview yesterday at the
annual International  Consumer Electronics Show  in  Las Vegas . The
Huizhou, Guangdong-based company has held talks with potential
targets, he said, declining to identify them.  “We would be very interested in buying or merging
companies with very good technology,” he said. “There’s a lot
of talent related to our business in  Taiwan .”  TCL is also setting up a research facility on the island
following an increase in mainland labor costs that have dented
the advantage of concentrating development there, Li said. The
company is boosting ties with Taiwan after a reduction in cross-
strait tensions that has allowed Chinese companies including
 Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199)  and  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  to agree to invest in
businesses on the island.  Taiwan and China have been ruled separately since a civil
war more than 60 years ago. Parties on both sides claim to the
rightful governors of all of China.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
