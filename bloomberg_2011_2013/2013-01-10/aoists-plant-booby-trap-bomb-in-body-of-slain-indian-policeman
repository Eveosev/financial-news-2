Police said Maoist rebels in  India 
inserted a bomb inside the abdomen of an officer killed in a
clash with the guerrillas, who are fighting for control of
swathes of the country’s center and east.  Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told reporters in  New
Delhi  today that Maoists were using “new tactics.”  Police defused 2 kg (4.4 lbs) of explosives surgically
inserted to booby-trap the body,  Jharkhand  Inspector General of
Police S.N. Pradhan said. The policeman was among 10 killed in
an ambush in the province’s  Latehar  district this week.  “The intention was to blow up others” handling the body
after it was recovered from a forested area, Pradhan said.
“This is probably the first time it’s been done in India.”  Bombs were also attached to the corpses of four other
police killed in the clash, Pradhan said by phone. Two villagers
died Jan. 8 when one exploded.  The Maoists regularly clash with police in about six of
India’s 28 states, often in areas rich in  iron ore , coal,
bauxite, manganese and other minerals with potential to attract
large investments.  The rebels say they are fighting on behalf of poor
villagers and tribal communities whose resources are being
exploited to propel  India’s economy  with few benefits for local
people. They have killed more than 9,200 civilians and security
personnel since 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
