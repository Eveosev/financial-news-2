Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  extended its
sponsorship of the Australian Open through 2018, lifting the
South Korean automaker’s backing of the tennis Grand Slam
tournament to an unprecedented 17 straight years.  Kia, which replaced  Ford Motor Co. (F)  as the main sponsor of
the season-opening major in Melbourne in 2002, committed to a
“multi-million dollar” extension and the sponsorship rights of
the renewed agreement will remain largely the same, Tennis
Australia said today in a statement.  “To our knowledge, Kia will now be the longest and biggest
Asian-based sponsor of sport in Australian history,” Steve Wood, the governing body’s chief executive officer, told
reporters at Melbourne Park.  As part of its sponsorship, Kia supplies the two-week
tournament with a fleet of more than 100 vehicles that transport
tennis players, officials and VIPs around  Melbourne .  The latest agreement is said to be worth about A$50 million
($52.7 million), the Australian Financial Review reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
