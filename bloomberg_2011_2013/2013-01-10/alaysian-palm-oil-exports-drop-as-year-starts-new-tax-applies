Palm oil exports from  Malaysia , the
second-largest producer, fell 25 percent in the first 10 days of
this month, according to Intertek, stoking speculation reserves
may hold near a record even after a new tax regime took effect.  Exports dropped to 373,462 metric tons from 499,732 tons in
the same period last month, Intertek said in a statement today.
A separate estimate of shipments from surveyor Societe Generale
de Surveillance is due later today, as are official figures for
stockpiles, exports and production in December.  The Malaysian government said in October it would cut the
export tax to between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent, from 23
percent, effective Jan. 1, to help reduce the reserves, which
reached an all-time high in November. The tariff for this month
was set at zero as the base price was below the threshold of
2,250 ringgit a ton that triggers the 4.5 percent rate.  Palm oil 
has dropped 25 percent over the past year.  “January may be a bit too soon to really see the impact,”
said Hoe Lee Leng, an analyst at RHB Capital Bank Bhd. “People
are not rushing off to export directly and take advantage of the
zero percent tax for this month yet” as some planters may
continue to sell to local refiners, she said.  Palm oil for March delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to
2,433 ringgit ($801) ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
then pared gains after the Intertek estimate was issued. The
price was at 2,419 ringgit at 11:52 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur.  Inventories of the oil used in food and biofuels were 2.56
million tons in November, according to data from the Malaysian
Palm Oil Board. The figure for last month may be 2.53 million
tons, according to the median of estimates from six analysts and
two plantation companies in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
