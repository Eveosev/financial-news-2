South  Korea ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing their yield to a two-month low, before the central bank
meets to review  interest rates  tomorrow.  The  Bank of Korea  will leave its  seven-day repurchase rate 
at 2.75 percent, according to all but one of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. One forecast a 25 basis point cut, after
similar moves at reviews in July and October. The won, the best
performer of the past year among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, was little changed after reaching a 17-month high.  “The central bank will probably need to cut interest rates
at some point, if not tomorrow, to help the economy and also to
help slow the won’s appreciation,” said Hong Jung Hye, fixed-
income analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. “Still,
investors are generally cautious before the central bank rate
decision is announced.”  The yield on  South Korea ’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 slid four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.83
percent as of 9:57 a.m. in Seoul, according to Korea Exchange
prices. That is the lowest level since Nov. 8. So far this year,
the yield has dropped 14 basis points.  The won traded at 1,061.65 per dollar, having closed
yesterday at 1,061.60, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It strengthened 8.6 percent in the past 12 months and touched
1,059.97 today, the strongest level since Aug. 4, 2011.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week he was
concerned about herd behavior in the foreign-exchange market and
may introduce measures to curb won volatility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
