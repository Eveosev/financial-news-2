Beats Electronics LLC, the audio
brand founded by Dr. Dre and Geffen A&M Chairman Jimmy Iovine,
announced a new music service called Daisy and named Topspin
Mediaâ€™s Ian Rogers to lead it.  The Daisy service is scheduled to begin in late 2013, the
 Santa Monica , California-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. As part of the move, Rogers, who also previously
worked at Yahoo Inc., will step into a leadership role at MOG,
the music streaming service Beats acquired last year.  Beats Electronics will also make an investment in Topspin
Media, a direct-to-fans music marketing company, where Rogers
will remain a director. The two companies plan to collaborate on
ways to generate business for artists on the Daisy service.
Beats spent $14 million to purchase MOG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
