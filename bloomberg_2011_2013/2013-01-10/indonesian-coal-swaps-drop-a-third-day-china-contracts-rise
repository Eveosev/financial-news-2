Swaps prices fell for a third day
for thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of
the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the second
quarter dropped 20 cents yesterday to $64.55 a metric ton on a
net-as-received basis, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
February contract slid 20 cents to $63.65 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the
second quarter advanced 35 cents to $86.35 a ton on a net-as-
received basis, the energy broker said. The February contract
rose 10 cents to $85.20 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
