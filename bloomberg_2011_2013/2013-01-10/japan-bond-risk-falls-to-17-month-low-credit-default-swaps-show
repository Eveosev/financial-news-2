The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment dropped to a 17-month low,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 5 basis points to 134
basis points as of 09:10 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The gauge is on track for the lowest close since August
2011, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 105 basis points
as of 08:06 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to prices from Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The measure has declined 8 basis
points so far this year, after dropping 93 basis points in 2012,
CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index gained 2 basis points to
113 basis points as of 11:17 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The gauge has fallen 14 basis
points since Dec. 31, extending a 53 basis-point drop in 2012,
CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
