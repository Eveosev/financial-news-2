BRE Bank SA (BRE)  may pay its first
dividend in more than a decade as  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ’s Polish unit
expects profit near a  record  this year on growing loans.  The fourth-largest Polish bank will probably pay dividend
of less than 50 percent of last year’s profit, Chief Executive
Officer Cezary Stypulkowski told reporters in Warsaw today. Its
profit in 2012 was “close to” a record 1.13 billion zloty
($364 million) in 2011 and will reach a similar level this year,
Stypulkowski said. Its 2012 results are due on Feb. 8.  “Chances are very high that we will pay dividend from 2012
profit,” Stypulkowski said. “We’ve shown we can keep costs
under control and our revenue shouldn’t fall. Our earnings this
year should be close to last year’s level.”  Banks in  Poland  saw their combined profit rise 2.1 percent
to a record 14.8 billion zloty in the first 11 months of last
year as lending continued to grow even as the country’s economy
slowed, the Polish financial regulator said on its website
today. BRE’s lending rose 7.5 percent in the 12 months ended
Sept. 30, it said in a regulatory filing on Oct. 30.  BRE  shares  rose for the first time in six days, adding 0.2
percent to 316.3 zloty as of 4:13 p.m. in Warsaw, valuing the
lender at 13.3 billion zloty.  Last time BRE paid  dividend  in 2002, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Warsaw-based bank earlier planned to
resume dividend payouts from next year, Stypulkowski said. The
management will announce its dividend proposal in March.  In August, the Warsaw-based lender said it expects revenue
to grow 6 percent annually through 2016 and cost-to-income ratio
will be at no more than 48 percent in the next five years. If
these targets are met the dividend payout will increase to 50
percent or more, Stypulkowski said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
