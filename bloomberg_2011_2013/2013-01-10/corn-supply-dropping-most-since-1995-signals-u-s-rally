U.S. corn supplies, the world’s
biggest, are dropping at the fastest pace in 17 years as drought
damage exceeds government forecasts and five months of declining
prices spur demand from livestock producers.  Inventories on Dec. 1 were 15 percent lower than a year
earlier at 8.22 billion bushels (208.8 million metric tons), the
smallest post-harvest stockpile since 2003, according to the
average of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Group Ltd. expect
prices to rebound at least 17 percent to $8.14 a bushel in 2013.  While futures surged to a record $8.49 in August as the
drought spread, they then tumbled 18 percent as U.S. exports
slowed and buyers sought cheaper supply from Brazil and Ukraine.
Prices will rebound because the government overestimated the
harvest and probably will lower the figure when it reports
tomorrow, the analysts said. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
already expects global stockpiles on Oct. 1 to be the smallest
relative to consumption since 1974.  “Consumers have become too complacent waiting for lower
prices,” said Christopher Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie in
 London  who expects prices to reach $8.50 this year. “The story
going forward will be an improvement in U.S. exports. Buyers
have nowhere else to turn.”  Corn rose as much as 68 percent from June 15 to mid-August
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade before retreating. It ended the
year up 8 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities. The MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities jumped 13 percent. A Bank of
America Corp. index shows Treasuries returned 2.2 percent.  Exceptional Drought  About 55 percent of the nine-state Midwest region where
most of the nation’s crop is grown had moderate to exceptional
drought on Jan. 1, compared with 13 percent a year earlier,
according to the U.S.  Drought Monitor . In  Nebraska , the third-
largest producer, extreme to exceptional conditions covered 96
percent of the state, compared with none a year earlier.  The worst U.S. crop  conditions  since at least 1988 probably
reduced the area harvested to 89.6 percent of what was planted,
according to the average of 31 analyst estimates. Farmers reaped
10.65 billion bushels, a 14 percent decline that exceeds the 13
percent drop forecast by the USDA on Dec. 11. Domestic supply
before the 2013 harvest will retreat to the lowest since 1996,
the survey showed.  Farm Silos  While the USDA probably will increase its estimate for
production in  Brazil , the second-biggest exporter, by 400,000
tons, that will be more than offset by a 1.6 million-ton cut in
the forecast for  Argentina , the third-largest shipper, the
medians of estimates from 22 analysts showed.  Stockpiles are getting harder to predict because growers
are favoring silos on their farms for storage rather than
commercial grain elevators, increasing the amount of data that
must be collected. Storage on U.S. farms climbed 1.9 percent to
12.775 billion bushels in December 2011, the most since at least
1989, USDA data shows. It also raises the risk that prices could
keep dropping as more bushels are added to inventory estimates.  Analysts and traders’ estimates for inventories on Dec. 1
missed the USDA tally by an average of 188 million bushels over
the past six years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Futures moved by the maximum allowed by CBOT on the day of the
USDA report in each year, evenly divided by gains and losses.  Corn averaged a record $6.89 in 2012 and that may spur
farmers to plant more this year, easing concern about supply.
U.S. production will expand to 14.83 billion bushels in 2013, 38
percent more than in the previous season, Informa Economics said
in a report Dec. 19. The Memphis, Tennessee-based research
company previously forecast 14.64 billion bushels.  Least Bullish  Domestic supply also may exceed analysts’ expectations
because sales of cargoes for export before Sept. 1 fell 48
percent since Oct. 1, cutting the amount of grain that normally
is in transit and not counted as inventory, according to USDA
data.  Hedge funds  and other speculators cut bets on higher
prices by 51 percent in the past four weeks and are now the
least bullish since the end of June, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show.  “I sold grains in September for significant profits,”
said Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee more than $1 billion of
assets as the president and chief investment officer of Sica
Wealth Management LLC in Morristown,  New Jersey . “I anticipate
buying again toward the end of the month.”  Prices will average $8.14 through Aug. 31,  Hussein Allidina , the head of commodity research at Morgan Stanley in
 New York , wrote in a Jan. 8 report. Goldman, in a Dec. 5 report,
forecast $8.25 in six months. Corn futures for delivery in March
rose 0.4 percent to $6.9725 at 12:51 p.m. in Chicago.  Livestock Producers  Demand from livestock producers rose to 1.9 billion bushels
in the three months ended Dec. 1, from 1.823 billion a year
earlier, according to  Dan Cekander , the director of grain market
analysis at Newedge USA LLC in Chicago.  The U.S. hog-breeding  herd  has expanded at a time when
analysts said higher feed costs would cause a contraction. The
government said Dec. 28 that the herd rose 0.2 percent to 5.817
million head on Dec. 1, compared with a 0.8 percent drop
expected on average by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Poultry
production rose 5.9 percent to 5.405 billion pounds in the first
11 months of the year.  Spot Demand  U.S. cash markets for corn are signaling strengthening
demand, with exporters in  New Orleans  paying a premium of 62
cents a bushel over Chicago futures on Jan. 7, USDA data show.
That’s 58 percent more than the average over the past five
years. Chicago grain merchants were paying a 19.5-cent premium
for deliveries before the end of this month, compared with a
five-year average discount of 29 cents.  The premiums that exporters are paying for  corn  delivered
to ports in New Orleans and to processor  Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co. (ADM)  in Decatur,  Illinois , are the highest ever for this time of
the year, said William Tierney, the chief economist for
AgResource Co., a Chicago-based research company.  That’s “an indication of tightening supplies relative to
demand,” the former USDA analyst said. “We’re looking for
higher prices after this report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
