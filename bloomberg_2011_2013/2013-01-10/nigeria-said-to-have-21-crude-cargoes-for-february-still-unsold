At least 21 Nigerian crude cargoes
for loading in February, or 31 percent, remain unsold because of
reduced European refining margins and rising U.S. shale oil
output, said three traders who participate in the market.  That’s more than normal for this stage of the month,
according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the
information is confidential. Unsold grades for export next month
include six lots of Qua Iboe, four Brass, three Forcados, two
each of Bonny Light, Erha and Usan grade and one of Abo and
Yoho, the people said.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, plans to cut
exports in February to 67 cargoes totaling 2.19 million barrels
a day, compared with 75 shipments this month, according to
shipping schedules obtained by Bloomberg News. U.S. oil
production exceeded 7 million barrels a day for the first time
since March 1993, Energy Department data show.  Sales of Nigerian crude to the U.S. are set to fall in 2012
to the lowest in 27 years. The U.S.  imported  an average 422,550
barrels a day in the first 10 months of last year. That would be
the least since 1985, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  European margins have fluctuated between minus 4 euros ($5)
a metric ton and zero this month after averaging 14 euros last
month and 29 euros in November, according to  data  from French
refining group, Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres,
which represents refiners in the country including Total SA and
Exxon Mobil Corp.  Qua Iboe crude, Nigeria’s benchmark grade, was today priced
at a premium of $2.36 a barrel to Dated Brent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It rose to the highest in almost nine
months at $2.72 more than Dated Brent on Dec. 10.  The size of the cargoes range from 500,000 barrels to 1
million barrels. The export program for March is scheduled to be
released next week.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
