Most U.K. House of Commons lawmakers
believe they are underpaid and that their salaries should be
increased by almost a third, according to a survey carried out
for Parliament’s pay and expenses watchdog.  The anonymized survey,  published by the Independent
Parliamentary Standards Authority  in  London  today, showed that
69 percent of the lawmakers questioned think they don’t earn
enough. The average salary suggested by those regarding
themselves as underpaid is 86,250 pounds ($139,000) a year, up
from 65,738 pounds at present.  IPSA, which has taken over the setting of lawmakers’ pay
from members of Parliament themselves, said salaries for
legislators will be increased by 1 percent this year and next in
line with the rest of the public sector. They’ve been frozen
since 2010 to help cut the  budget deficit . Parliament also voted
this week to cap increases in welfare benefits at 1 percent
until 2016.  The watchdog said it had ruled out introducing performance-
related pay, regionally varied pay or salaries that reflect
outside earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
