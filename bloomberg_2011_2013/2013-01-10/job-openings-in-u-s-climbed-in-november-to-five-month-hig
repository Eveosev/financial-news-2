Job openings  in the U.S. rose in
November to the highest level in five months as companies looked
past congressional wrangling over a package of tax increases and
government budget cuts set to take effect this month.  The number of  positions  waiting to be filled climbed by
11,000 to 3.68 million from a revised 3.67 million in October,
the Labor Department said today in Washington. Hiring was little
changed and firings eased.  The pickup in openings lays the ground for the job growth
necessary to sustain  consumer spending , which accounts for about
70 percent of the economy. Employers added workers and boosted
wages last month even as they endured the budget battle in
Washington.  “All indications are that the labor market’s improving,”
 Brian Jones , senior economist at  Societe Generale  in New York,
said before the report. “I think we’re doing better.”  Employers added 155,000 workers in December and 161,000 in
November, the Labor Department reported last week, as the
world’s largest economy endured Sandy, the threat of port
strikes and the Washington budget battle. Last month, the
advance in hiring was accompanied by a bigger-than-projected
gain in wages and a longer workweek that could give households
the means to sustain spending.  The number of people hired was little changed at 4.32
million in November, keeping the hiring rate at 3.2 percent,
today’s report showed.  Retailers, Restaurants  The increase in job openings last month was led by
retailers and hotels and restaurants. Stores had 460,000
positions waiting to be filled in November as they geared up for
the  holiday shopping season , up from 374,000 the prior month.
The accommodation and food-service industry had 435,000 openings
compared with 394,000 in October.  The Labor Department said it attempted to contact
businesses in the area most heavily damaged by Superstorm Sandy.
The “very few” companies that didn’t respond were assumed to
have closed and therefore had no openings, agency said.  Openings dropped at professional and business services and
government agencies.  Firings, which exclude retirements and voluntary
departures, decreased to 1.66 million in November from 1.67
million a month earlier.  Another 2.14 million people quit their jobs in November, up
from 2.09 million in the prior month. That kept the total
separations rate at 3.1 percent.  12-Month Change  In the 12 months ended in November, the economy created a
net 1.9 million jobs, representing 51.7 million hires and about
49.9 million separations.  Today’s figures indicate there are about 3.3 people vying
for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the recession began in
December 2007.  Financial services companies are among those that continue
to trim payrolls.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and UBS AG have announced more than 300,000 job
cuts globally since the start of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest  U.S. bank  by assets,
plans to eliminate about 1,600 jobs from its investment bank and
support staff in coming weeks, a person familiar with the matter
said yesterday.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  last month said it will eliminate
11,000 jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
