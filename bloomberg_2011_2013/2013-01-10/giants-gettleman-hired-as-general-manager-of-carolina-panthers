Dave Gettleman was hired as general
manager of the  National Football League ’s  Carolina Panthers 
after more than a decade in the  New York Giants ’ front office.  Gettleman, 61, was the Giants’ senior pro personnel analyst
last season after working as director of pro personnel the
previous 13. He’s also worked in scouting for the Denver Broncos
and Buffalo Bills since 1986 and has been involved with six
Super Bowl-winning teams.  “He has an extensive background in personnel and comes
from an organization in the New York Giants that I hold in high
regard and played an instrumental role in their success,”
Panthers owner Jerry Richardson said.  The Panthers had a 7-9 record last season and fired Marty Hurney after a 1-5 start.  The San Diego Chargers yesterday hired Tom Telesco, former
Indianapolis Colts vice president of football operations, as
their general manager, a role in which he’ll oversee all aspects
of football operations and player personnel decisions.  Telesco, 40, spent 15 years with the Colts. He replaces
A.J. Smith, who was fired on Dec. 31 after 10 seasons with the
franchise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
