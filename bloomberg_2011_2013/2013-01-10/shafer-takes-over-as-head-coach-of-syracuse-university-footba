Scott Shafer was promoted to head
football coach by  Syracuse University , which is preparing to
join the Atlantic Coast Conference.  Shafer, the team’s defensive coordinator for the past four
years, replaces Doug Marrone, who moved into the  National
Football League  as coach of the Buffalo Bills.  “His commitment to developing the total student-athlete is
unmatched,” said Syracuse Director of Athletics Daryl Gross on
the team’s website. “We have all seen the attitude of his
defense, which consists of unity, toughness and persistence.”  The Orange were 8-5 overall and 5-2 in the Big East
Conference last season. Syracuse defeated West Virginia 38-14 in
the Pinstripe Bowl on Dec. 29.  One of the Big East’s founding schools in 1979, Syracuse
said in September that it was leaving for the ACC. Syracuse and
the  Big East  agreed on a $7.5 million cash buyout in July that
allows the Orange to move to the ACC this year.  “We will go to work every day to put a quality product on
the field as we storm our way into the Atlantic Coast
Conference,” Shafer said yesterday on the team’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
