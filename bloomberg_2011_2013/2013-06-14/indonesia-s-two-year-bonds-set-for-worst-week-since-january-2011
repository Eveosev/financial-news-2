Indonesian bonds due 2015 headed for
the worst week since January 2011 after the central bank
unexpectedly raised its key  interest rate  for the first time in
more than two years. The rupiah fell this week.  Bank Indonesia  increased the  reference rate  by a quarter of
a percentage point to 6 percent yesterday. On June 12, the
monetary authority boosted the deposit facility rate, known as
the Fasbi, by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent and said that was
a preemptive move to maintain monetary stability. A proposed
increase in domestic fuel prices will add to inflation
pressures, according to ING Groep NV.  “The move could be a flanking policy to support a
prospective fuel-subsidy cut,”  Tim Condon , head of Asia
research in Singapore at ING, wrote in a report today. “We
think the two to three percentage point inflation spike that
would accompany the fuel price hike would trigger a volatility
spike” in the  bond market , he wrote.  The yield on 9.5 percent bonds due June 2015 rose 94 basis
points this week to 6 percent as of 9:43 a.m. in Jakarta, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The 10-year
government bond yield jumped 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage
point, this week to 6.52 percent. ING revised its year-end
forecast for the 10-year rate to 6 percent from 5.5 percent,
according to the report.  Inflation, Rates  Indonesia has the fastest inflation among Southeast Asia’s
five biggest economies. The pace of annual gains in consumer
prices, which was 5.47 percent in May, will quicken to 7.2
percent this year if fuel prices are raised, government
estimates show. The central bank’s policy rate will be increased
by 25 basis points each in July and August, Citigroup Inc.
predicted in a report yesterday.  The  Finance Ministry  bought back  government bonds  in the
secondary market yesterday, according to a statement posted on
its website. Notes due in September 2016, April 2017, July 2017
and September 2018 were included in the purchase.  The rupiah dropped 0.8 percent this week to 9,883 per
dollar in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It touched 9,925 yesterday, the weakest level
since Sept. 15, 2009. One-month non-deliverable forwards rose
0.8 percent today and 0.6 percent this week to 10,062. The
contracts traded at a 1.8 percent discount to the spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
surged 4.87 percentage points this week to 13.55 percent. It
declined six basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
