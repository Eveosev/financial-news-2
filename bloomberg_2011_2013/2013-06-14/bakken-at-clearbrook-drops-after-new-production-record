Bakken oil priced in Clearbrook,
 Minnesota , dropped after North Dakota regulators reported that
production from the shale formation set a new record in April.  Bakken at Clearbrook fell 75 cents a barrel to a premium of
$2.25 over domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate at 4:33
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s strange when you set all kinds of new records and
call it more of the same, but that’s North Dakota these days,”
said Lynn Helms, director of the state Mineral Resources
Department.  The  premium  for Clearbrook Bakken over the Plains Marketing
LP posted price for Williston Basin Sweet Crude fell 57 cents to
$14.68 a barrel at 2:01 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Earlier in the week, it reached the highest level
since Dec. 20 as Bakken shipments by rail increased.  “Things have been changing in the last several weeks,”
said Justin Kringstad, director of the North Dakota Pipeline
Authority. “We may start to see barrels come off railroads and
into the pipeline system.”  Gulf crudes declined against WTI. Light Louisiana Sweet
slipped 35 cents to a premium of $8.90. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium fell 25 cents to $9.  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, weakened
by 10 cents to $5.75 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon strengthened by 25 cents to a $2
premium. Mars Blend’s premium to WTI was unchanged at $2.90 a
barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
