Spain’s credit rating was affirmed
at BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, which said that the country’s
commitment to the implementation of a comprehensive fiscal,
structural reform agenda remains strong.  The outlook on the long-term rating remains negative, which
still shows the potential for a downgrade if political support
on the current reform agenda dwindles, the budget
“significantly” worsens or policies in the euro area falter in
stabilizing the country’s funding costs, S&P analysts Marko Mrsnik and Frank Gill said in a statement today.  The rating is supported by a diversified and prosperous
economy and the government’s implementation of financial, fiscal
and structural reforms, the analysts said. Still, Spain faces
high external debt as well “relatively” low medium-term
economic growth prospects and a highly segmented labor market,
S&P said.  The European Commission forecasts Spain’s debt load next
year will be above the euro-area average for the first time in
the currency’s history. Rated one to two levels above junk by
S&P, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service amid a sixth
year of  slump , the euro region’s fourth-largest economy has so
far avoided a full bailout.  The country’s real gross domestic product will contract by
about 1.5 percent this year before slowly recovering, while next
year’s real GDP growth will be about 0.6 percent due to factors
such as weak consumption, the credit ratings company said.  Unemployment (SPUNEMPR)  will remain “very high, at above 26 percent,
at least until there is a sustained economic recovery,” even as
the economy is being revamped with improved competitiveness and
“robust” exports, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
