Facebook Inc. (FB)  sent out invitations
for a June 20 event to promote a “new product” as the world’s
most popular social-networking service seeks to attract users
with a wider range of services.  The invitation, received by reporters yesterday, said the
event will be held at the company’s headquarters at One Hacker
Way in  Menlo Park ,  California . The note, unlike most that are
sent electronically, was printed on paper and hand-delivered by
courier.  “A small team has been working on a big idea,” the
message said. “Join us for coffee and learn about a new
product.”  Facebook, with more than 1 billion members, is stepping up
efforts to introduce new services that will draw in new users
who can be targeted with advertisements, which generates the
majority of its revenue. The company unveiled a new search
service in January and rolled out an update to its home page in
March, adding tools for filtering the main News Feed by
categories such as music and photos.  A news reading service, which aggregates stories and posts
from other online sources, may be unveiled at the event,
according to a  blog post  on TechCrunch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
