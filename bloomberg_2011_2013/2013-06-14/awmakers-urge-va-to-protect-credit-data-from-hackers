The U.S. Department of  Veterans
Affairs  should pay vendors to protect the credit of as many as
20 million veterans and their families after a hearing revealed
overseas hackers have accessed VA databases, lawmakers said.  At least eight foreign organizations have hacked into VA
databases or are trying to do so, Jerry Davis, a former deputy
assistant secretary for information security at the agency, said
at a House Veterans’ Affairs panel subcommittee hearing last
week.  U.S. Representatives Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who
heads the committee, and Mike Michaud, a Maine Democrat who is
the panel’s ranking minority member, criticized the VA for
failing to notify Congress of those security breaches. The
agency needs to do more to protect former troops’  Social
Security  numbers, birthdates and addresses from identity
thieves, the lawmakers said today at a press conference.  “The chances are pretty good that information was in fact
removed,” Miller said. “Unfortunately, we don’t know until
somebody actually comes up and says their information was used
in a nefarious way. That’s why we’re asking the VA to provide
credit monitoring for veterans.”  There are “multiple state actors” trying to hack VA
systems as well as groups of thieves trying to steal information
as a “money-making activity,” Stephen Warren, the acting
assistant secretary for the department’s Office of Information
and Technology, said during the hearing this month. Department
officials don’t know what files were removed from their system,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
