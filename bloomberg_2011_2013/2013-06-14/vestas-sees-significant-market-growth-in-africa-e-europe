Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  said it sees
“significant growth” from  Morocco  to South Africa, while
demand in traditional wind-turbine markets is slowing down.  “Ninety percent of the growth of energy consumption in the
next 25 years will happen in  emerging markets ,” Chief Sales
Officer Juan Araluce said today in a telephone interview, citing
the  International Energy Agency . “It makes a lot of sense to
sell our products into countries where they need that power, and
are currently paying higher prices.”  The shifting patterns of demand means the proportion of
Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas’s  orders  from emerging markets has
risen to almost 60 percent this year from 42 percent last year,
Araluce said. Orders have been logged so far in Chile, Uruguay,
Mexico,  South Africa , Croatia, Romania and Ukraine.  “We will see the sector start to grow significantly in
Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, Namibia, Mozambique and all the eastern
European countries and former Soviet Republics,” Araluce said.  That market expansion is correlated with economic growth in
those countries, according to Araluce. Many more established
markets face growing regulatory uncertainty, he said, citing
announcements from different German political parties facing
elections in September, rule changes in the U.K. and stalled
markets in economic crisis-stricken Spain, Portugal and Greece.  “Mature markets will continue being important and still
play a significant role,” Araluce said.“However they are
standing still or declining, particularly in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
