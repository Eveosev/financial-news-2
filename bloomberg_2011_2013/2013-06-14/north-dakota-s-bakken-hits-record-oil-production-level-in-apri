Producers in North Dakota’s Bakken
shale formation increased  oil output  to a record 727,149 barrels
a day in April, according to preliminary data compiled by the
state Industrial Commission.  Continental Resources Inc. (CLR)  and  Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL)  are
among companies that boosted production in the largest U.S.
shale formation by 1.2 percent from March. Output was up 33
percent from April 2012.  Increased output from shale formations including the Bakken
and the Eagle Ford in southern Texas helped  U.S. oil production 
reach 7.37 million barrels a day in the week ended May 3, the
most since February 1992, Energy Information Administration data
show. The figure slipped by 76,000 barrels a day to 7.22 million
last week.  Bakken oil priced  on the  spot market  in Clearbrook,
 Minnesota , weakened by 25 cents yesterday to $2.75 a barrel
above West Texas Intermediate crude in Cushing, Oklahoma,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About 75 percent of Bakken oil left  North Dakota  on trains
in April, up from 71 percent in March, the state Pipeline
Authority said. About 17 percent was shipped out via pipeline,
down from 20 percent in March.  North Dakota produced 793,249 barrels a day, up 1.3 percent
from March. The state rig count in April was 186 in April, the
same as in May. It’s 184 now, said Lynn Helms, director of the
state Mineral Resources Department. Drillers completed 119 wells
in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
