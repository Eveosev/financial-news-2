Michelin & Cie (ML)  rose the most in four
weeks after  Europe ’s largest tiremaker reported monthly industry
volumes that showed signs of stabilization in the region’s car
market, which is poised to decline for the sixth straight year.  Michelin  advanced  as much as 3.7 percent to 69 euros, the
biggest intraday jump since May 17, and was up 3.6 percent at
11:54 a.m. in Paris. The number of shares traded was more than
53 percent of the three-month daily average. The stock has lost
3.7 percent this year, giving the company a market value of 12.6
billion euros ($16.8 billion).  Volumes for passenger car and light truck tires in Europe
were unchanged in May compared with a year earlier, the
Clermont-Ferrand, France-based company said late yesterday on
its  website . Volumes for original equipment rose 6 percent in
 North America , 20 percent in  Brazil  and 11 percent in  China .  “The figures confirm the upwards trend observed in the
previous month,” said Thomas Besson, an analyst with Kepler
Cheuvreux who recommends buying the shares. “Management sent a
reassuring message on full-year 2013 outlook” during a call
with Chief Financial Officer Marc Henry on June 12, he said.  Michelin said on June 10 it would end production of heavy-truck tires at its Joue-les-Tour factory in  France , eliminating
730 jobs at the site and trimming excess capacity amid slumping
demand in Europe.  The tiremaker’s plants are currently using 50 percent to 60
percent of capacity for truck tires and 70 percent for passenger
cars and light trucks, Michelin Chief Executive Officer Jean-Dominique Senard said on May 17. The company is seeking growth
outside Europe and expanding offerings of tires for large
vehicles such as mining equipment.  To improve its competitiveness in France, Michelin plans to
spend 800 million euros by 2019 in its home country, the company
said. The manufacturer employed about 24,000 people in France at
the end of 2012, or 22 percent of its global headcount. It also
wants to expand flexible-work rules to all its 17 factories in
France in the coming 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
