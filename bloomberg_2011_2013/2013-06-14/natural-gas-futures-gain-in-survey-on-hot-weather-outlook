Natural gas futures may advance next
week as hotter U.S. weather spurs demand for the power-plant
fuel to run air conditioners, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Seven of 13 analysts, or 54 percent, predicted that futures
will gain on the New York Mercantile Exchange through June 21.
Five, or 38 percent, said gas will decline and one said prices
will stay the same. Last week, 58 percent of participants said
gas would drop.  Temperatures will be above normal across the central U.S.
from June 18 through June 22 before the heat spreads to the
Northeast and West Coast over the next five days, according to
MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas prices fell
to a three-month low this week as mild weather reduced fuel use.  “After this week’s consolidation, we see prices moving
higher as the build in cooling demand begins to weigh in on
storage restocking,” Teri Viswanath, director of commodities
strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in an e-mail
yesterday.  Natural gas futures fell 1.4 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$3.814 per million British thermal units during the first four
days of this week on the Nymex. Prices dropped to $3.71 on June
12, the lowest intraday level since March 14. The futures are up
14 percent this year.  Temperature Outlook  The high in  Dallas  every day next week may be 96 degrees
Fahrenheit (36 Celsius), 3 to 4 degrees above normal, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania . New York’s
high on June 18 may be 84 degrees, 4 above normal.  Power plants will account for 32 percent of U.S. gas
consumption this year, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  Gas inventories  expanded by 95 billion cubic feet to 2.347
trillion in the week ended June 7, above the five-year average
gain for the period of 84 billion, EIA data show.  A  deficit  versus the historic norm narrowed to 2.4 percent
from 3 percent the previous week. Supplies were 20 percent below
 year-earlier levels  versus 21.5 percent in the previous report,
narrowing for the ninth straight week.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex gas futures will probably
rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This week’s
results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  7      5      1  To contact the reporter on this story:
