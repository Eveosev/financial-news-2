Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s
most acquisitive manufacturer, is close to an agreement to buy a
stake in Spanish auto-parts maker  Cie Automotive SA (CIE) , according
to three people familiar with the matter.  A deal may be announced today, two of the people said,
asking not to be identified because the talks are private.
Chairman  Anand Mahindra  is scheduled to brief reporters at 4
p.m. in Mumbai following a board meeting of the company’s
component businesses, known internally as Systech, according to
a press invitation.  An agreement would result in Mahindra & Mahindra’s 36th
stock purchase in the past decade, more than any Indian
manufacturer, based on data compiled by Bloomberg, and the
company has bid on assets ranging from luxury sports-car maker
Aston Martin to aircraft producer Hawker Beechcraft Inc. Aside
from being India’s largest SUV maker, Mahindra & Mahindra has
businesses ranging from financial services to holiday resorts.  Mahindra spokeswoman Roma Balwani declined to comment
beyond saying that the boards of Mahindra’s Systech companies
will meet tomorrow. Gonzalo Garrido, a spokesman for Cie,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
