European Union carbon permits
climbed for a fifth week as lawmakers proposed a compromise plan
to win support for a policy that would help fix oversupply in
the market.  EU allowances for December rose 8.8 percent to 4.80 euros
($6.40) a metric ton today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  at 4:59 p.m., boosting this week’s gain to 17 percent.  The permits dropped to a record 2.46 euros on April 17
after the European Parliament failed to approve a measure that
would have allowed a temporary supply cut known as backloading.
The June 12 compromise would allow the EU to intervene in the
market only if a study shows such a move has “no significant
impact” on industries prone to relocating production to regions
without emission limits, according to a document obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  This week’s gain stems from increased confidence European
parliamentarians will support backloading, Fred Payne, a carbon
trader at CF Partners U.K. LLP in London, said today by e-mail.  “EUAs remain firmly on trend,” he said. “Downside should
be limited even if we see profit-taking ahead of the weekend.”  Certified Emission Reduction credits for December rose 1
cent to 47 euro cents a ton after earlier reaching 48 cents, the
highest intraday price since Jan. 10. They gained 12 percent
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
