Asian stocks climbed, after the
regional benchmark index yesterday erased this year’s gain, as
U.S. economic data beat estimates and concern eased that the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce record stimulus.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose after entering a  bear
market  yesterday.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  rose 4.3

27 after dropping more than 10 percent from a May 20 high,
meeting some traders’ definition of a correction. The index
erased $1.06 trillion in value during that span through
yesterday. A measure of mainland shares listed in Hong Kong
capped a record losing streak.  “You get good data plus reduced fear about a premature
rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve, and that helped the
U.S. share market and that’s helping Japanese and Asian markets
today,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has $126 billion
under management. “Look at the underlying global growth
dynamics and they remain favorable.”  Relative Value  The Asia-Pacific measure traded at 12.5 times estimated
