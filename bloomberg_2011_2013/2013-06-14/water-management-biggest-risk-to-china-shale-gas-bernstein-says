Water management is the biggest
challenge to shale gas development in  China  amid concern that
extraction of the fuel will contaminate drinking supplies,
according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  China’s government will need to find ways of getting
capital and technology into its shale-gas sector without
compromising environmental standards, said  Neil Beveridge , a
Hong Kong-based analyst at the consultant.  “Despite very little knowledge of fracture stimulation or
shale drilling, there is already a perceived concern of
potential risks to clean-water contamination,” Beveridge said
in an e-mailed report today. “While water is abundant in
Sichuan, clean water is less so.”  China is the “biggest shale opportunity” outside of the
U.S., according to Bernstein. The country has the world’s
largest shale gas resources, estimated at 4,746 trillion cubic
feet (134.4 trillion cubic meters), it said, citing data from
the Ministry of Land and Resources and the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Within China, Sichuan has the
largest potential and the Silurian Longmaxi shale is the most
prolific, the consultant said.  In hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drillers shoot a
mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground to free oil and
natural gas trapped in shale-rock formations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
