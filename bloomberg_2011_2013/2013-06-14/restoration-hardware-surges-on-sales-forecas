Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc. (RH) ,
the home furnishings chain that went public in November, surged
after forecasting quarterly revenue and profit that topped
analysts’ estimates.  The shares advanced 16 percent to $68.47 at the close in
New York and have almost tripled since Restoration Hardware went
public on Nov. 1.  Sales will be as much as $380 million in the second
quarter, the Corte Madera, California-based home goods retailer
said yesterday in a statement. Analysts projected $351 million,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings
for the second quarter will be as much as 42 cents, topping
analysts’ projections of 38 cents.  Restoration Hardware is becoming a “brand phenomenon” as
it takes advantage of demand and a lack of options for high-end
home furnishings, David Schick, an analyst for Stifel Financial
Corp. in Baltimore, wrote today in a note to clients. Schick
recommends holding the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
