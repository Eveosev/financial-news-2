Almost two-thirds of U.K. citizens
say they are worried about the risk of electricity blackouts
because of the government’s “confused” energy policy, the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers said.  About 64 percent of more than 2,000 people polled for the
London-based institution said they’re worried about the prospect
of power cuts, and 93 percent said they’re concerned about
higher gas and electricity bills, according to an e-mailed
 statement  today from the group. The government said in a
statement that it’s “confident” the lights will stay on.  The government is trying to pass a law to spur the 110
billion pounds ($172 billion) of spending it says is needed in
generators and grid upgrades by 2020. Ministers have been in
talks for months with Electricite de France SA over the price it
may get for power from a proposed new nuclear plant and have
stepped up barriers to the building of onshore wind farms.  “There is a severe lack of public confidence in the
Government’s confused energy policy,” said Tim Fox, head of
energy and environment at the institution. “Confidence in
Government  energy policy  has been damaged by its mixed messages
on low-carbon energy policy and uncertainty over its support for
a new nuclear build program.”  All except for one of the U.K.’s nuclear power plants are
scheduled to close by 2023. In March, Parliament’s Energy and
Climate Change Committee, which oversees the work of the
government’s energy department, said ministers needed a “Plan
B” in case new reactors aren’t built.  “The U.K. energy system is, by international standards,
extremely resilient,” the Department of Energy and Climate
Change said in an e-mailed statement. “We are confident that
the reforms we’re introducing, the cross-party support they
enjoy, and the interest we’re seeing in the market, will mean
the lights stay on for the long term.”  Rising Blackout Chance  The energy regulator Ofgem estimated in October that
because of power plant closures, the statistical probability of
households losing power will rise to once in every 12 years by
2016 from once every 3,300 years now.  While EDF, Hitachi Ltd., Iberdrola and GDF Suez SA plan a
combined 16 gigawatts of power stations in the U.K., EDF is the
only company making progress with its proposals. Centrica Plc,
EON SE and RWE AG have withdrawn from projects.  Iberdrola Chairman  Ignacio Galan  said in February that
Britain risks blackouts this decade unless it provides details
soon on proposed auctions designed to remunerate generators for
keeping capacity available to be switched on at times of peak
demand. Last year, the former government’s chief scientific
adviser, Sir  David King , warned about the possibility of outages
without faster reforms of the  energy industry .  The survey of 2,034 people was carried out by ICM on behalf
of the Institution, which didn’t provide a margin of error. The
institution has about 100,000 members representing mechanical
engineers in the U.K. from industries including rail, aerospace
and construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
