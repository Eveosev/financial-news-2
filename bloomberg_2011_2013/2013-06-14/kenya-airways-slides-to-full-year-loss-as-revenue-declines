Kenya Airways Ltd., sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, reported its second loss in four
years as it failed to boost passenger numbers and revenue was
eroded by a stronger shilling.  The carrier had a full-year loss of 7.86 billion shillings
($92 million) in the 12 months through March, compared with a
profit of 1.66 billion shillings a year earlier, Chief Financial
Officer Alex Mbugua said in an investor briefing today in the
capital, Nairobi. Sales declined 8 percent to 98.8 billion
shillings. The company last reported a loss in the fiscal year
ended March 2009.  “We are quite bullish in terms of earnings going forward”
because of falling fuel costs and rising customer volumes,
Mbugua said. Passenger numbers during the year through March
rose 0.6 percent to 3.67 million from a year earlier, while
costs increased 20.7 percent.  Kenya Airways shares fell 6.5 percent to 10 shillings by
1:30 p.m. in Nairobi, the lowest level since April 2004. The
company is 27 percent owned by  Air France-KLM (AF) ,  Europe ’s biggest
airline.  Shilling Strengthened  “The main challenge was the fact that passengers remained
flat and the shilling strengthened,” Faith Atiti, an analyst at
Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said in an interview.  KQ, as the airline is known, said revenue had been reduced
by 4 billion shillings after the Kenyan currency traded at an
average rate of 85.02 per dollar, compared to 88.58 the previous
year. The shilling has gained 0.7 percent against the dollar
this year, making it the fourth best performer of 24 African
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Kenya Airways shares plunged 42 percent in 2012, the worst
performer on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The stock has
retreated 12 percent this year, while the bourse in  East
Africa ’s biggest economy rose 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
