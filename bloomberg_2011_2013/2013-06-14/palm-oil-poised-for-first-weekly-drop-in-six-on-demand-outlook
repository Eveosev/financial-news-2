Palm oil gained for the first time
in three days, paring a weekly loss, on speculation that demand
may increase for the vegetable oil as a biofuel feedstock.  The contract for August delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
close at 2,439 ringgit ($783) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives. Futures fell 0.7 percent this week, the first such
loss since the five days ended May 3. Palm for local  physical 
delivery in June was at 2,430 ringgit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer, stands to
win biodiesel market share from  Indonesia  after the biggest palm
oil grower was hit with E.U. tariffs, Sabri Ahmad, chief
executive officer of Felda Global Ventures Holdings, said today.
Malaysia’s exports of global biodiesel may jump to 300,000 tons
this year, he said.  “Support has come from the soy complex,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Risk Management Services
Pvt. Ltd. “Some support is also being seen as there are bits
and pieces of news coming on exports regarding biodiesel and the
purchases for Ramadan.”  Demand typically picks up ahead of Ramadan, which falls in
July this year, when Muslims break day-long fasts with communal
meals, and the Eid festival in August. A record 5.6 million tons
of palm was used for fuel in 2012, according to Oil World, a
Hamburg-based research company.  Sabri expects palm oil prices to trade between 2,400
ringgit a ton and 2,600 ringgit from July to December. Prices
will be supported by biodiesel demand, even though there are
concerns about demand from India and  China , the biggest
consumers, as economic growth slows, he said.  Soybean oil for December delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
47.40 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November climbed 0.3 percent to $13.045
a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery retreated 0.9 percent
to close at 6,218  yuan  ($1,014) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, while soybean oil for delivery in September lost 0.2
percent to 7,408 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
