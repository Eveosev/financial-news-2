Australia’s dollar headed for its
first weekly gain in six amid speculation the currency’s almost
9 percent drop in the past two months was excessive.  The Aussie touched a one-week high after U.S. stocks
rebounded, fueling appetite for the South-Pacific nation’s
higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand ’s kiwi dollar headed for its
biggest weekly gain versus the greenback in more than a year.
New Zealand manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in nine
years, according to a central bank report today.  “The market’s been very short, but the fact that the
Aussie couldn’t close a day below the key 93.80, 94 U.S. cent
level probably cleared a few things out,” said Richard Breen, a
Sydney-based senior consultant at Rochford Capital, a currency
and interest-rate risk management company. “I think this could
clean out a few more shorts and head up towards 98 U.S. cents.”
A short position is a bet that an asset’s price will fall.  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.3 percent to 96.11 U.S. cents at
9:50 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, after touching 96.66, the
highest since June 3 on a closing basis. It rose 1.6 percent
yesterday. The Aussie headed for a 1.2 percent gain this week.  The kiwi dollar slid 0.2 percent to 80.79 U.S. cents after
reaching 81.11. It has risen 2.4 percent this week, the most
since the five days ended Dec. 2, 2011.  New Zealand’s Performance of Manufacturing Index rose to
59.2 last month from a revised 55.2 the prior month, according
the Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business NZ. A PMI reading
above 50 points indicates manufacturing is generally expanding.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks  rallied  1.5
percent, its second-biggest gain this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
