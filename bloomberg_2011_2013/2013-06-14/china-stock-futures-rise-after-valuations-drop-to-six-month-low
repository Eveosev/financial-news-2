China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in nine days after valuations for the benchmark index
dropped to a six-month low and U.S. retail sales beat forecasts.  Sanan Optoelectronics Co. (600703)  jumped 7.3 percent, leading a
measure of technology shares to its biggest advance among
industry groups.  China State Construction Engineering Corp. (601668) , the
largest housing contractor, advanced 2.3 percent after the value
of new contracts climbed in the first five months of the year.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.6 percent to 2,162.04
at the close, halting an eight-day, 7.6 percent loss. It traded
at 8.8 times 12-month estimated earnings yesterday, the lowest
since Dec. 6,  data  compiled by Bloomberg showed. The index
dropped 2.2 percent this week, capping a second week of losses.
The CSI 300 Index rose 0.7 percent to 2,416.77.  “The market is expected to rebound after the recent sell-off and some technical indicators show it’s oversold,” said
Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in
Shanghai. “We are not optimistic in the medium term as
liquidity is still tight and economic fundamentals are pretty
weak.”  The 14-day relative strength measure for the Shanghai
index, measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped
during a specified time period, was at 28.5 yesterday. Readings
below 30 indicate it may be poised to rise.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  slipped 0.2 percent, slumping for a 12th day
in the longest string of declines since at least July 1993,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Economic Data  Stocks tumbled yesterday after a three-day holiday as
government reports showed industrial production and exports
trailed economists’ estimates in May and on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will scale back bond purchases. The Shanghai
index has fallen 11 percent from this year’s high on Feb. 6 on
concern economic growth is slowing and amid speculation
regulators will resume initial public offerings after halting
them since October.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 22 percent
lower than the 30-day average, while its 30-day  volatility  was
at 15.9, compared with this year’s average of 19.1, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of information technology stocks climbed 3.7
percent, the biggest gain among the CSI 300’s 10 sub-indexes. It
has advanced 28 percent this year, the most among the industry
groups.  Debt Sale  Sanan Optoelectronics,  China ’s biggest producer of light-emitting diode chips, surged 7.3 percent to 21.12  yuan ,
rebounding from a 4 percent decline yesterday.  NavInfo Co. (002405) , a
maker of electronic maps, climbed by the 10 percent daily limit
to 14.87 yuan. Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., a manufacturer of
video surveillance equipment, gained 4.8 percent to 40.40 yuan.  China State Construction Engineering added 2.3 percent to
3.57 yuan after it said new contract values rose 19 percent from
a year earlier in the first five months of the year.  The nation’s  Finance Ministry  failed to sell all of the
debt offered at an auction for the first time in 23 months owing
to a cash squeeze, according to two traders at finance companies
that participate in the sales.  The ministry sold 9.53 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) of 273-day bills, less than the 15 billion yuan target, they said. The
seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, has more than doubled in the past month to 6.81
percent, as banks hoard cash to meet quarter-end  capital
requirements .  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.8 percent in  New
York  yesterday as better-than forecast U.S. economic data
outweighed concern that a slowdown in  Asia ’s biggest economy
will deepen.  Retail Sales  Retail sales in the U.S., China’s largest export market
last year, rose 0.6 percent last month, the biggest increase in
three months, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday. That
compared with a 0.4 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. economic recovery is good news for China as well
as the global economy,” Tan Chiheng, an analyst at Granite
Point Capital Inc. in  Boston , which invests in Chinese equities,
said in a telephone interview.  Foreign holdings of yuan-denominated shares may reach 4
percent in 2016, up from the current 1.5 percent, as the pace of
capital market liberalization accelerates, according to a
Deutsche Bank AG report dated June 12. The shares will be
included in one or more major global benchmarks in the next two
or three years, the report said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
