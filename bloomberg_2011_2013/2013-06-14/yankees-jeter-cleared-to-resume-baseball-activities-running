Derek Jeter got the go-ahead to
resume baseball activities and running, eight months after
breaking his ankle, the  New York  Yankees said.  The 38-year-old shortstop has been playing catch, hitting
off a tee and fielding ground balls at the Major League Baseball
club’s training facility in Tampa,  Florida .  Jeter, who was examined yesterday by his surgeon, may
return to the Yankees’ roster after the July 16 All-Star game,
which will be held at the New York Mets’ Citi Field.  Jeter was injured chasing down a groundball in the 12th
inning of a 6-4 loss to  Detroit  in Game 1 of the American League
Championship Series on Oct. 13.  The 13-time All-Star was cleared to return to action on
March 7 and played during spring training before feeling
discomfort.  Jeter batted .316 with an American League-best 216 hits
last season. His 3,304 career hits rank 11th all-time.  Also yesterday, the Yankees said they had agreed to
contract terms with Notre Dame third baseman Eric Jagielo, who
signed for $1.8 million. He was the 26th overall pick in last
week’s draft and one of three first-round selections by the
Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
