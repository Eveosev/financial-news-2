The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 10 basis points to 137.5 basis
points as of 8:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The measure, which had risen 12 basis
points this week as of yesterday, is poised for its biggest one-day decline since Sept. 14, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 10 basis points
to 127.5 as of 10:48 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark, which has ranged from 96.1
basis points to 134 basis points this year, is set for its
lowest close since June 10, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 6 basis points to 105
basis points as of 9:24 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The measure rose 12.2 basis points yesterday, its biggest
one-day jump since Sept. 20, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
