Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  will
pursue a multibillion-dollar price-fixing settlement over
retailer swipe fees as opposition to the deal reached a level
that would have allowed the card firms to walk away, according
to one of the companies.  Ajaypal S. Banga, president and chief executive officer of
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, told investors last month
that U.S. retailers accounting for more than 25 percent of total
credit card purchase volume had decided to opt out of the
settlement. Under the deal, which is subject to a judge’s final
approval Sept. 12 in  Brooklyn ,  New York , federal court, the card
firms and banks could have backed out if that threshold was
reached.  “The defendants as a group had the right to terminate the
settlement agreement because the volume threshold of 25 percent
was exceeded, but elected not to do so,” Banga said during a
July 31 conference call with investors.  Paul Cohen, a spokesman for  Foster City , California-based
Visa, the world’s largest payment network company, didn’t
immediately respond to a call today seeking comment. Visa CEO
Charles W. Scharf said in a July 24 call with investors that the
final figures for the opt-outs were still being calculated as of
that date.  K. Craig Wildfang, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, didn’t
immediately respond to request for comment.  The case is In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
