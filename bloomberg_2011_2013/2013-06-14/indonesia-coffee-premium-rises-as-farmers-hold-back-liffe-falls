Buyers of coffee from Indonesia, the
world’s third-biggest producer of the robusta variety, are
paying bigger premiums for their beans as futures fall and
farmers hold back supplies, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Indonesian beans for shipment in July and August are at a
premium of $200 a metric ton to the price on NYSE Liffe in
 London , the Winterthur, Switzerland-based coffee unit of
commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. said in a weekly
report e-mailed today. That’s up from $150 a ton last week.
Robusta coffee futures fell 4.9 percent this week.  “Differentials widen further with every dollar Liffe goes
lower,” Volcafe said, referring to the premium paid to obtain
physical coffee in relation to the futures price. Exporters are
“paying high prices” and farmers are holding back coffee, it
said.  Rainfall across most of the country’s coffee belt is
slowing bean deliveries from farms, Volcafe said. That may be
leading some exporters to try to delay shipments, it added.  In  Vietnam , the world’s top robusta grower, buyers are
paying a premium of $135 a ton to the exchange price, up from
$120 a ton last week, Volcafe data showed.  Robusta coffee for September delivery gained 1.6 percent to
$1,758 a ton by 3:07 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
