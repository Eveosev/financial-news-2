Societe Generale SA (GLE)  plans to move
more than half of its sales of structured notes to a subsidiary
that can issue collateralized securities by year-end, after
investors deserted the notes during the credit crisis.  SG Issuer is taking over from a special purpose vehicle
that was prohibited from selling secured notes, said Pierre
Lescourret, SocGen’s head of structuring for  Europe .  France ’s
second-biggest lender issued $93 million of notes this year
backed by collateral, including bonds and stocks, compared with
zero in the same period of 2012 and $1.6 billion of unsecured
notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors abandoned structured notes during the financial
crisis as they became wary of the prospect of bank defaults,
with the cost of insuring against losses on financial company
debt surging to a record in November 2011. The securities
typically package derivatives with unsecured bank bonds,
exposing buyers to the credit risk of sellers.  “Due to the European banking crisis in 2011 we wanted to
set up a way of issuing notes backed by collateral as a solution
to issuer credit risk,” Lescourret said in a phone interview
from Paris.  SG Issuer replaces Societe Generale Acceptance NV, an SPV
incorporated in the Caribbean island of Curacao that sold just
under half of the $27.5 billion of structured notes issued by
SocGen and its  units  since 1999, according to Bloomberg data.  Buyers of the new unit’s collateralized securities will pay
a fee to cover the services of Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp.,
the custodian for the collateral, and another charge for SocGen
to source the assets backing the notes, said Lescourret.  To contact the reporter on this story:
