The  Bank of Japan  should specify a
two-year limit for its unprecedented monetary easing to help
quell  bond-market  volatility, according to one of the central
bank’s board members.  BOJ  minutes  released in Tokyo today show that the
suggestion was made by the unidentified policy maker at a
meeting held on May 21-22. The bank could state that easing
“should be restricted to about two years” and then be reviewed
“in a flexible manner,” the board member said, according to
the record of the meeting. Takahide Kiuchi is the board member
previously  publicly identified  as favoring a time-frame of about
two years.  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is trying to jump-start the
world’s third-biggest economy without triggering a jump in
yields that makes the nation’s debt load unsustainable.  Japan ’s
10-year bond yields have swung from a record low of 0.315
percent to as much as 1 percent since the central bank announced
in April a plan to double monthly debt purchases to more than 7
trillion yen ($74 billion).  The minutes showed the policy maker’s views that the bank’s
communication about its easing plans “might be destabilizing
expectations for the bond market” and increasing volatility.  Swings in stocks, bonds and the yen threaten to undermine
confidence in the campaign by Kuroda and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to drive a return to sustained growth after 15 years of
deflation. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2.8 percent as of
11:26 a.m. in  Tokyo  after plunging 6.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
