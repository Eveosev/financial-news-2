Swedish buyout firm EQT Partners AB
has opted to take Springer Science+Business Media AG public
rather than sell it, the publisher said.  The company, which has become a German stock corporation in
preparation for the initial public offering, will be listed on
the Frankfurt stock exchange, Springer Science said in a
statement today.  An IPO “is the natural next step for the company,”
Springer Science Chief Executive Officer Derk Haank said in the
statement. It “will help us to serve our customers and drive
growth.”  The Berlin-based academic publisher, bought by EQT jointly
with the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. in 2009, said
earlier this month it plans to raise about 760 million euros ($1
billion) in an IPO and shares would start trading before the
summer break.  Manfred Wennemer, a former CEO of  Continental AG (CON)  who has
served as chairman on boards including  Hochtief AG (HOT)  and was named
to lead  Sulzer AG (SUN) ’s in March, was elected chairman of the
supervisory board, whose directors also include Bertelsmann AG
CEO Thomas Rabe and EQT partner Marcus Brennecke.  Haank, Chief Operating Officer Martin Mos and Chief
Financial Officer Ulrich Vest were named to the management
board.  As recently as Wednesday, EQT was said to be leaning toward
a sale of Springer Science to BC Partners Ltd. amid concern that
an IPO wouldn’t fetch the desired amount, according to people
familiar with the matter.  A spokesman for EQT declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
