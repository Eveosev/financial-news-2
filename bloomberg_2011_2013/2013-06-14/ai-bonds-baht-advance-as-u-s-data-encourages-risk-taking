Thai government bonds rose, pushing
the 10-year yield down by the most since July 2012, as better-than-expected U.S. retail data improved risk sentiment amid
speculation the Bank of  Thailand  will cut borrowing costs.  The baht strengthened for a third day as the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of shares climbed 1.3 percent. The 10-year yield
rose to a 20-month high earlier this week amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will trim monetary stimulus. The BoT’s monetary
policy committee judged the balance of risks tilting toward
growth rather than inflation, according to minutes of its May
28-29 meeting released on June 12.  “Thai yields have gone up quite a lot and these are quite
attractive levels for investors given the fact that the nation
has room to cut rates to support growth if necessary,” said
 Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten Securities Inc.’s fixed-income
business unit in Tokyo. “Risk sentiment is improving slightly
on the U.S. data and recovery in the stock markets.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 fell 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 3.81 percent as of
9:02 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate rose 18 basis points from a week ago and reached 4.01
percent on June 12, the highest level since September 2011.  A report yesterday showed U.S. retail sales rose 0.6
percent in May, compared with a 0.1 percent increase the
previous month and the median forecast of a gain of 0.4 percent
in a Bloomberg survey.  The baht strengthened 0.6 percent today and 0.2 percent
this week to 30.58 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell 29 basis points to 6.8
percent. It rose 14 basis points this week.  Inflation slowed for a fifth month in May to 2.27 percent,
the least since November 2009, official data show.  Investec Asset Management Ltd. holds Thai sovereign bonds
across the yield curve as the slowing inflation improves real
yields,  Mark Evans , an  emerging markets  fixed-income analyst in
London, said in an e-mailed reply to questions last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
