U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index poised for a weekly
decline, after a report showed  consumer confidence  unexpectedly
declined this month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1 percent at
1,638.42 as of 9:59 a.m. in  New York  after losing as much as 0.2
percent.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan June preliminary
index of consumer sentiment fell to 82.7 from a final reading of
84.5 the prior month, a report today showed. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey was unchanged at 84.5. Forecasts ranged
from 82 to 89. The index averaged 64.2
during the recession that ended in June 2009 and 89 in the five
years prior.  Investors have been scrutinizing economic data to determine
whether growth is strong enough to prompt the Fed to scale back
stimulus measures.  The  S&P 500  has slipped almost 2 percent since May 21 after
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may scale
back bond buying if the U.S. labor market “improves in a real
and sustainable way.” Three years of earnings growth and
stimulus from the Fed has helped push the gauge up 142 percent
from its bear-market low in 2009.  The Fed will hold its two-day policy meeting next week,
with Chairman Ben S. Bernanke scheduled to speak after the
central bank’s decision on June 19.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
