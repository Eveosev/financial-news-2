Manila Water  Co. Inc. is seeking to
increase rates by 5.83 pesos a cubic meter to help fund its 426
billion-peso ($9.9 billion) capital spending plan until 2037,
the provider to half of the Philippine capital said.  A public consultation was held yesterday by state regulator
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System to discusse the
price-increase proposal, Manila Water said in a stock exchange
filing.  New water rates may take effect as early as the third week
of July once the regulator completes its review this month,
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today, citing Emmanuel
Caparas, acting chief regulator at the MWSS Regulatory Office.  Maynilad Water Services Inc., the other provider in the
capital, is asking for an increase of 8.58 pesos a cubic meter
to recover its planned 692 billion-peso spending in the next 25
years, Inquirer said.  Shares of Manila Water, a unit of Ayala Corp., rose 2.1
percent to 34.80 pesos as of 10 a.m.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
