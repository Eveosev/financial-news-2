U.S. stocks fell after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its 2014 growth outlook for the
nation and urged the Federal Reserve to carefully manage its
exit from monetary stimulus plans.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index dropped 0.4 percent to
1,629.93 at 11:06 a.m. in New York.  The Washington-based IMF lowered its prediction for 2014 to
2.7 percent, from 3 percent growth predicted in April. It left
its U.S. growth forecast for this year unchanged at 1.9 percent.  The IMF sees the Fed maintaining large monthly bond
purchases until at least the end of this year and urged the
central bank to carefully manage its exit plan to avoid
disrupting financial markets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
