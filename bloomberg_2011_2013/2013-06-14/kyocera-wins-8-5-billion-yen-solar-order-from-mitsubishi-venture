Kyocera Corp. (6971)  won an 8.5 billion yen
($90 million) order for solar panels from a venture set up by
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and a Japanese agriculture association.  The Kyoto-based company will supply 30 megawatts of panels
to be installed at 80 locations, spokesman Masakazu Imamasu said
by phone from Tokyo, confirming an earlier report by the Nikkei
newspaper today.  The venture was set up in October to generate power from
solar panels on roofs of farm buildings, according to a
statement on June 3 by Mitsubishi and the National Federation of
Agricultural Cooperative Associations. They hold a 45 percent
stake each. JA Mitsui Leasing Ltd. owns 10 percent.  The venture plans to install 200 megawatts of solar panels
on rooftops by March 2015, Mitsubishi and the association said
in a July 25 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
