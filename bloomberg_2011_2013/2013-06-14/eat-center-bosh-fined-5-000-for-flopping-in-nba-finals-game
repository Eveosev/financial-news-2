Miami Heat center Chris Bosh was
fined $5,000 by the National Basketball Association for flopping
during the team’s 109-93 victory against the San Antonio Spurs
in Game 4 of their best-of-seven series.  Bosh scored 20 points as the defending-champion Heat tied
the series 2-2 heading into tomorrow’s Game 5 in San Antonio.
Bosh is averaging 12.7 points and 7.2 rebounds per game during
the playoffs.  The NBA announced the discipline for exaggerating a foul
yesterday in an e-mailed release.  The incident occurred in the second quarter of Game 4 as
Bosh tangled with Spurs forward Tim Duncan on a layup attempt by
San Antonio guard Gary Neal. As Duncan extended his arm, Bosh
fell onto the court, drawing an offensive foul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
