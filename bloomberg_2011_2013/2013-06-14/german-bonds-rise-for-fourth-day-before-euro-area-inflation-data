European  government bonds  rose, led
by the securities of higher-yielding nations such as Italy and
 Spain , amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  and other central
banks will maintain stimulus to keep borrowing costs low.  Spanish (GSPG10YR)  10-year bonds advanced for a third day after
 Standard & Poor’s  said the nation’s commitment to fiscal and
structural reforms remains strong.  Germany (GDBR10) ’s 10-year bunds rose
for a fourth day, while Belgian and Austrian bonds also
advanced. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who will lead the
central bank’s meeting next week, has said a reduction in asset
purchases wouldn’t mean an end to its record easing program.
Spain plans to sell debt due between 2018 and 2023 next week.  “The main driver of markets in recent weeks has been
speculation about what the Fed will do,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a
senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit Global Research in
Milan. “There’s speculation that next week the Fed will try to
smooth out a bit the recent reaction. If the Fed tries to
clarify a bit what its intentions will be, that could have a big
impact. This would be supportive for Spanish and Italian
bonds.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.59 percent at 4:31 p.m.  London  time after
climbing to 4.76 percent on June 11, the highest level since
April 9. The 5.4 percent bond due in January 2023 gained 0.21,
or 2.10 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,334) face amount, to 106.15.  Italian 10-year yields dropped seven basis points to 4.29
percent, and similar-maturity Portuguese rates slid 25 basis
points to 6.28 percent.  Fed Purchases  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs. Bernanke will have an opportunity to retune the
central bank’s message during a press conference on June 19
after the Fed’s two-day meeting.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed may push back
on expectations of a rate increase. Speculation the U.S. central
bank was moving toward reducing asset purchases saw bonds and
stocks slide around the world during the past month.  “The Fed wants to make sure that the very negative
reaction we’ve seen over the past few weeks doesn’t continue,”
said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at Societe
Generale SA in Paris. “It doesn’t want the market upset because
that would stop the nascent recovery in its tracks. This can
provide some respite for markets, helping European bonds.”  Bunds Advance  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell five basis points to 1.51
percent after climbing to 1.66 percent on June 11, the highest
level since Feb. 20. The yield on 10-year Belgian bonds slid
seven basis points to 2.32 percent, while similar-maturity
Austrian yields declined seven basis points to 1.91 percent.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest among euro-area markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and
Belgium, according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  S&P kept Spain’s credit rating at BBB- and left its outlook
on the long-term rating as negative. There is the potential for
a downgrade if political support for the reform agenda dwindles,
analysts Marko Mrsnik and  Frank Gill  wrote in a statement today.  Spain will auction bonds due in July 2018, April 2021 and
October 2023 on June 20, the nation’s debt agency said.  “The need of increasing its debt duration has probably
been the key factor behind the decision to tap eight- and 10-year bonds next week,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst
at Newedge Group in London, wrote in a note to clients. The
nation will probably sell about 4 billion euros, she wrote.  Italy’s government debt rose to a record 2.041 trillion
euros in April from 2.035 trillion euros in March, the central
bank said today in its public-finances supplement. Foreign
ownership of  Italian (GBTPGR10)  securities rose to 35.6 percent in March
from 35.2 percent in February.  Spanish bonds returned 5.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Spain Sovereign Bond
 Index. (BSPS)  Italian securities gained 2.6 percent, while German bonds
declined 0.9 percent, separate Bloomberg indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
