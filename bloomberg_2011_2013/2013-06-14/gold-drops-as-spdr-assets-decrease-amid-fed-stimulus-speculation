Gold futures rose as a U.S.
government report showed wholesale prices climbed in May for the
first in three months, increasing the appeal of the precious
metal as a hedge against inflation.  The producer-price index rose 0.5 percent after falling 0.7
percent in April, which was the biggest drop in more than three
years, Labor Department data showed. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey projected the measure would gain 0.1 percent.
Through yesterday, gold fell 18 percent this year after some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value, while
consumer costs rose the least in five decades.  “Suddenly, people are talking about inflation,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Today, the safe-haven appeal is back.”  Gold futures for August delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$1,386.60 an ounce at 9:34 a.m. on Comex in New York. Trading
was 40 percent below the 100-day average for this time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yesterday,  assets  in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded product backed by the metal, declined 6.3 metric
tons to 1,003.53 tons, the lowest since February 2009.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s largest gold producer,
said last week it will write down the value of its assets by as
much as A$6 billion ($5.8 billion) after the slump in prices.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 2 percent to $22.01
an ounce, heading for the biggest gain in more than a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
