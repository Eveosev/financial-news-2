Syria ’s inflation has accelerated to
40 percent and the economy has been hit hard by “terrorist
groups” supported by the U.S. and some European countries,
Central Bank Governor Adib Mayaleh said today.  Still, Syria can emerge from its economic difficulties and
“we’re standing on our feet and moving forward with
determination,” Mayaleh said in a phone interview from
Damascus.  Mayaleh didn’t respond to a question on whether Syria was
receiving financial aid from Iran and Russia, saying the two
countries were “friends.”  Mayaleh blamed “terrorist groups” for destroying the
country’s infrastructure with “support from the U.S., some EU
countries,  Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey.”  Syria’s crisis began with peaceful anti-government protests
that escalated into a civil war after troops loyal to Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on the demonstrators.
Assad’s government says its fighting extremists.  The unrest, coupled with economic sanctions imposed by the
U.S., EU and the  Arab League , has stifled economic growth and
dried up or severely slowed down investments, tourism and trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
