Qatar Airways Ltd. is set to place
an order for more  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliners at the  Paris Air
Show  next week as the planemaker seeks to build momentum for a
new version of the jet, people familiar with discussions said.  The Qatar purchase is a top-up to 30 787s the carrier
previously agreed to buy, said two people, who asked not to be
named because talks are private. The accord will spearhead a
series of Dreamliner sales at the industry gathering as Boeing
starts booking orders for a new model, the 787-10X, one of the
people said.  Boeing, which is battling Airbus SAS for wide-body orders,
is looking to overcome missteps on the Dreamliner, including a
three-month grounding of the global fleet because of an
electrical fault. The Chicago-based planemaker’s -10X, the
largest Dreamliner, goes head-to-head against the Airbus A350-900, which conducted its maiden flight today.  Tom Enders , chief executive officer of Airbus-parent
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., said yesterday that
“a few hundred” sales at the show for Airbus will include A350
orders. Among them are new commitments for the largest version,
the A350-1000 due from 2017, one person said.  A spokesman for Qatar Air wasn’t immediately available to
comment outside regular business hours in the Middle East.
Boeing had no comment, spokesman  Marc Birtel  said.  Boeing’s 787-10X has already won a commitment from
 Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  for 30 planes, pending confirmation it
will build the aircraft from 2018.  To contact the reporters on this story:
