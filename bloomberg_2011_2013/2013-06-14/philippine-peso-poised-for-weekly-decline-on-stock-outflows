The Philippine peso was headed for a
weekly drop as foreign funds sold local stocks on speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will scale back its bond purchases that have
spurred inflows to emerging-market assets.  The peso weakened beyond 43 to the dollar for the first
time in a year this week. Overseas investors sold $55 million of
Philippine shares from June 10 through yesterday, taking this
month’s net sales to $256 million, exchange data show. The
central bank yesterday kept its benchmark overnight borrowing
rate unchanged at 3.5 percent and refrained from amending the 2
percent rate on its special-deposit accounts after gross
domestic product grew 7.8 in the first quarter, the fastest pace
in the region.  “The peso has been doing terribly as the stock market has
dropped,” said Leong Sook Mei, Southeast Asian head of global
markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
 Singapore . “There is no need for rate cuts when the peso is
weakening and the economy is  Asia ’s best-performing.”  The peso slipped 1.3 percent this week and gained 0.6
percent today to 42.825 per dollar as of 11:12 a.m. in  Manila ,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc data. It touched 43.295
yesterday, the lowest level since June 8, 2012. The Philippine
Stock Exchange Composite Index has fallen 6 percent this week.  The currency has lost 4.3 percent this year after
appreciating 6.8 percent in 2012. The peso remains supported by
positive fundamentals, and the authorities will maintain a
“strategic presence” in the markets, central bank Governor
Amando Tetangco said in an interview to Bloomberg TV today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased 198 basis
points, or 1.98 percentage point, to 8.47 percent in the past
five days. The gauge fell 25 basis points today.  The yield on the 8 percent government bonds due July 2031
increased three basis points to 4.65 percent in the past five
days, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The
rate fell 10 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
