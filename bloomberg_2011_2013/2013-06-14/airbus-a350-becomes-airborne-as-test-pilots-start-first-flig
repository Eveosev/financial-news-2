Airbus SAS’s new A350 wide-body
returned from its maiden flight after a four-hour airborne test
of the long-range airliner, in a show of confidence that the jet
can enter service in late 2014 and challenge  Boeing Co. (BA)   Two test pilots and four engineers returned the A350 to the
airfield at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, southwestern
 France , shortly after 2 p.m., after they had performed the first
flight under the gaze of 12,000 spectators that included
workers, journalists and senior management.  The plane, which cost about 11 billion euros ($14 billion)
to develop, is aimed at competing with Boeing’s two best-selling
wide-body models, the new 787 Dreamliner, and the 20-year-old
777, for which Boeing is now promising a successor model, the
777X. The first flight came days ahead of the  Paris Air Show ,
the annual showdown between the two manufacturers, where long-range plane sales  are in the spotlight.  “We want more than 50 percent of this market and we will
have more than 50 percent of this market,” Airbus Chief
Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said of the estimated 6,000
wide-body plane sales up for grab over the next 20 years.  Seating Plan  At stake is leadership in twin-aisle planes, the workhorses
of intercontinental flying that Boeing pioneered and in which it
remains dominant. The A350-900, the first variant of three in
development, will be followed by the A350-1000 stretch in 2017
to challenge Boeing’s 777, as well as a smaller A350-800
competing with a smaller Dreamliner.  The 787 will span 210 seats to 320 in three variants and
the A350 270 to 350. The largest 777X version will be able to
carry more than 400 people.  Today’s flight handled as predicated, test pilot Peter
Chandler said after a 4 hour 6 minute round-trip.  “It felt more like an aircraft at the end of its flight-test program than one on its first flight,” he said, although
some glitches will need to be addressed.  Powered by  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  engines, the A350
reached 25,000 feet and a speed of Mach 0.8 knots as Airbus used
the flight to gather data needed to achieve certification within
about 14 months, flight test engineer Patrick Du Che said. The
flight test campaign is expected to clock around 2,500 hours.  Noise Advantage  A flight more than six years in the making was witnessed by
A350 program Director Didier Evrard, as well as Tom Enders, CEO
of Airbus parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  The weather in southern France was lightly clouded, and the
A350, painted in Airbus livery on a white fuselage, was escorted
by smaller aircraft, with its undercarriage exposed as it
disappeared into the sky.  “It was an impressive sight,” said Airbus sales chief
 John Leahy  after the plane had taken off at 10 a.m.. “I knew it
was going to be impressive but I was blown away. Did you hear
how quiet it was? People living around airports won’t even know
we’re taking off.”  Airbus employees waving blue and white flags gathered by
the runway, with local residents standing in fields among the
tall grass along the taxiway to get a view of the plane. The
A350 will be the last all-new aircraft the company showcases in
at least a decade, as both manufacturers will spend the next
years tweaking their existing line-up for  fuel efficiency .  The plane that took off today is one of five test airliners
Airbus will manufacture ahead of serial production next year.
Even before today the A350 had logged 2,800 test hours in a
simulator and about 3,000 hours in the so-called iron bird, a
mock-up of the main systems.  “No matter what simulation you do, you need to make it
real,” said Evrard, the program director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
