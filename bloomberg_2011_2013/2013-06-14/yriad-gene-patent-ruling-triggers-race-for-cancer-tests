Companies and a university are
moving to offer cheaper and broader genetic testing for breast
cancer risk to a growing group of women, following a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that ended  Myriad Genetics Inc.’s (MYGN)  monopoly
over DNA that vastly raises odds for the disease.  Within hours of the decision, the University of  Washington 
and  Ambry Genetics , a closely held company in  Aliso Viejo ,
 California , said they would immediately offer expanded testing
that included the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which Myriad has had
under patent since the late 1990s.  Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX)  said
it would sell testing for the genes later this year.  By invalidating key parts of Myriad’s patents, the court
has removed a bar that prevented labs using new technology from
developing and selling broader one-time tests that search for
all known cancer risks, including the BRCA genes, geneticists
said. It could also mean lower prices for the screening, which
can cost as much as $4,000 for Myriad’s most comprehensive
version of its BRCA cancer gene test.  The decision “removes the barriers to comprehensive cancer
genetic testing,” said  Elizabeth Swisher , a gynecologic
oncologist at the  University of Washington  in  Seattle .  “For patients who have cancer or a strong family history
of cancer, there is no reason you wouldn’t want to get the most
comprehensive test available” that would scan all cancer risk
genes in a single test, she said.  Raised Risk  Faster, cheaper DNA testing is revolutionizing medical
care. Nowhere has the impact been felt more strongly than in
breast cancer. A woman who tests positive using Myriad’s tests
carries as much as an 80 percent chance that she will get breast
cancer in her lifetime. Testing helps women take charge of their
medical future, providing options that can include preventative
surgery and more extensive monitoring.  While 348,000 U.S. women carry at least one of the BRCA
genes, fewer than 50,000 have been identified through testing,
according to a  2012 study . With the publicity surrounding the
 Supreme Court  case and actress Angelina Jolie’s May announcement
that gene testing led to her double mastectomy, many doctors and
genetic counselors say they have been flooded with calls from
women asking whether they need to be tested.  The bad BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the most common cause of
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, are present in roughly 1
in 400 women and give women an elevated risk of ovarian cancer
as well as a higher breast cancer risk.  One-Time Testing  As a result of the Supreme Court’s ruling yesterday, women
can now undergo one-time testing for a wide band of genes that
have been linked to breast and other cancers, said  Mary-Claire
King , the University of Washington geneticist who first proved
that a single gene could vastly raise  breast cancer  risk,
leading to the discovery of BRCA1.  That genes are products of nature and can’t be patented
“has been the view of geneticists for a very long time and now
it is the law of the land,” King said in a telephone interview.
“I fully expect that many firms will enter this market.”  The  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  issued a memorandum
following the ruling that ordered its examiners to reject patent
claims on isolated DNA, saying the high court ruling
“significantly changes the office’s examination policy.”
Further guidelines will be issued once the agency reviews the
decision, according to the memo signed by Andrew Hirshfeld,
deputy commissioner for patent examination policy.  While the University of Washington and Ambry previously
sold DNA tests that evaluated a variety of genes linked to
higher cancer risk, the screens couldn’t include the BRCA genes
because of Myriad’s patents. Women who needed additional genetic
testing beyond the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes had to go through
multiple rounds of often-expensive testing.  Quest Statement  “As the leader in women’s health and cancer diagnostics,
we are very interested in offering a BRCA testing service,”
Wendy Bost, a spokeswoman for Quest Diagnostics, said in an e-mail. “We now intend to validate and offer a BRCA1 and BRCA2
test service to physicians and patients later this year.”  Some quickly predicted that immediate competition for
Myriad’s tests was unlikely, helping to boost the company’s
shares. As more analysis of the decision was reported, the Salt
Lake City-based company declined, ending yesterday 5.6 percent
lower.  Today, the shares fell 14 percent to $27.59 at the close in
 New York , their biggest decline since January 2011.  Last year, Myriad had $496 million in  sales , largely from
its tests for the two genes. The testing business carries an 87
percent gross profit margin, Myriad said in December.  No Impact  “We don’t expect today’s decision to impact our business
operations,”  Ronald Rogers , a spokesman for Myriad, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. The Supreme Court opinion
doesn’t affect the vast majority of the company’s patent claims
on the tests for the two breast cancer genes, he said.  “The remaining claims are valid and enforceable,” Rogers
said, adding that Myriad offers “very high quality tests with
fast turnaround times and good  customer service .” The company
also plans to start offering its own cancer-wide gene risk test
this fall, which will analyze 25 genes that can put people at
higher risk for various cancers.  Ambry, which is offering a basic form of its BRCA test for
$2,200, posted a headline on its website soon after the decision
saying, “Your Genes Have Been Freed.” The company also will
include the BRCA genes for no extra cost in several broader
based cancer risk tests it already offers.  At the same time, the closely held  Gene By Gene Ltd. , based
in Houston, put out a statement saying it would offer BRCA
testing for $995 in the U.S.  ‘Happening Now’  “Anyone who says it will take a while for companies to
offer the test, or that it is uncertain that this ruling will
lower the cost, we now have proof that it won’t take a while
because it is happening as we speak,” said Sue Friedman,
executive director of  Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered , a
nonprofit group that filed a brief in the Myriad patent case.
“This will open up opportunity for other labs.”  The Supreme Court ruling and Jolie’s announcement in May
that she had both of her breasts surgically removed to prevent
cancer because she carries one of the BRCA genes will help
democratize cancer genetic testing and bring in more at-risk
patients for screening, doctors and genetic counselors said.  The developments have “put a light on an area of medicine
that has really been under recognized for years,” said  Ora Karp
Gordon , director of the GenRISK Adult Genetics Program at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in  Los Angeles , in a telephone
interview. “This is the most transformational, most monumental
spring for the whole world of genetics and genetic testing.”  Waiting List  At  Massachusetts General Hospital  in  Boston , the waiting
list for a healthy woman to see a cancer genetic counselor has
soared to five months from two months before the Jolie news,
said Kristen Shannon, who leads a team of eight cancer genetic
counselors at the Harvard-affiliated hospital.  The number of patient and doctor calls following the news
about the actress was so overwhelming that the hospital sent a
memo to all its affiliated primary-care doctors explaining which
woman should be referred for testing, she said.  It’s a similar situation at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.
There, doctors have been getting four times the number of calls
from women seeking tests and patients must wait until August to
get an appointment with a genetic counselor, Gordon said.  Calls have increased about 25 percent at the  University of
Pennsylvania  in Philadelphia, while Yale Cancer Center in  New
Haven ,  Connecticut , has gotten at least 100 calls from men and
women citing the Jolie news.  Delayed Testing  Jolie’s announcement has spurred many people to seek
genetic testing who had delayed it in the past despite having a
family history of cancer, said  Ellen Matloff , head of cancer
genetic counseling at the Yale Cancer Center.  “This is what we had wanted for years but couldn’t
generate the sustained interest,” Gordon said. “We did a lot
of community outreach, but we just couldn’t get people to pay
attention. Now we can’t keep up with the volume.”  Some of the calls are from “the worried well” who are
unlikely to be at high risk for carrying the gene, she said.  Testing low-risk patients without proper counseling can be
a waste of resource and cause unnecessary anxiety if patients
get an ambiguous result, doctors said. A negative result in a
patient with a family history of cancer, on the other hand, can
give a false sense of security since there are other genes that
can increase a woman’s risk for breast and ovarian cancer.  Gene History  “These are genes that have been around since 1996 and
should be used in clinical care. Yet people, even those in the
medical community, are acting as though BRCA 1 and 2 had just
been discovered,” said  Charis Eng , chairwoman of the genomic
medicine institute at the  Cleveland Clinic  in a June 11
telephone interview.  While the breast cancer test has been available for years,
Jolie’s case is one of the first examples where “the public has
seen a public figure, a woman of reproductive age, take the bull
by the horns and get herself tested and do preventative surgery
before anything happens to her,” said  Julia Smith , an
oncologist who runs the risk assessment program at the NYU
Cancer Institute.  While testing has been increasing, “there is no question
many woman haven’t been tested” who need to be, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
