Raw sugar rose in  New York  after
four sessions of declines as higher ethanol prices in  Brazil ,
the leading producer of the sweetener, spurred speculation
millers will use more cane to make the biofuel. Cocoa declined.  Ethanol futures yesterday reached the highest level since
May 8 on the BM&F Bovespa, Brazil’s futures exchange. Millers in
center south, the country’s main growing region, used 58 percent
of all cane processed to make ethanol rather than sugar in May’s
second half, data from industry group Unica showed. That was up
from 52 percent a year earlier.  “Ethanol production has picked up quite significantly in
the last period of Unica’s report, but it remains to be seen
whether this continues to be the case,”  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an
analyst at researcher F.O. Licht GmbH, said by phone today.
“The market has come down significantly, so it’s more or less
natural that there’s some recovery sooner or later, but I’m
rather pessimistic that this would be a sustained recovery.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October rose 0.3 percent to 16.58
cents a pound by 8:31 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August advanced 0.4
percent to $475.40 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Millers in center south will use 45.2 percent of the cane
harvest to make sugar in the 2013-14 season begun in Brazil in
April, according to Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty. That
is below a prior estimate of 47.6 percent and last year’s 49.4
percent, the company said in its second estimate for the season.  Cocoa for delivery in September declined 2 percent to
$2,263 a ton on ICE. Cocoa for delivery in July fell 2.3 percent
to 1,472 pounds ($2,303) a ton on NSYE Liffe.  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer of cocoa, will
refund exporters and processors buying undersized beans from
June 17 to July 31, industry regulator Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao
said today on its website.  The payments will vary from 58 to 130  CFA francs  per
kilogram, the regulator said. Refunds will apply to purchases of
cocoa of 116 to 140 beans per 100 grams.  Arabica coffee for delivery in September gained 0.1 percent
to $1.255 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for the same delivery
month rose 1.6 percent to $1,758 a ton in London.  “The market has been under pressure on improving
conditions in Ivory Coast, but has started to find some support
with industry buying like they did at the end of May, when the
market reached the 1,500 pounds-a-ton area,” Jerome Jourquin,
head of agricultural commodity derivatives at brokerage Aurel
BGC in Paris, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
