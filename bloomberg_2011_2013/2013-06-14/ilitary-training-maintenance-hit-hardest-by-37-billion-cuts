Pentagon operations and maintenance
spending will be hit hardest by the $37.2 billion of automatic
cuts known as sequestration, according to a report by the
Defense Department’s comptroller.  Military personnel cuts would account for $20.3 billion,
procurement accounts would be reduced by $9.8 billion, and
research funding would lose $6 billion. Construction, housing
and management funds would absorb the rest of the cuts.  The report is a more detailed breakdown of sequestration’s
impact, by appropriation account, than a document sent to
Congress earlier this week.  The previous  report , called “DD 1414, Base For
Reprogramming,” is being used as a baseline that defense
committees will review as they consider a Pentagon request to
move $9.6 billion between categories and mostly into readiness
accounts.  The new “Report on the Joint Committee Sequestration For
FY 2013” is a more explicit and clearer summary. It also
outlines how much unobligated money from previous years is
available in each program to mitigate the cuts.  Of the $9.8 billion in procurement cuts, the three largest
appropriations accounts to be reduced by sequestration are Navy
shipbuilding, Air Force aircraft and Navy aircraft, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
