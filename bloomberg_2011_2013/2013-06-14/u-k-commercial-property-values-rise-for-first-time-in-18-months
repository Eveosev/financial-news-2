U.K. commercial real estate values
rose for the first time in 18 months in May, led by increasing
demand for offices, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses climbed
0.01 percent from April, London-based IPD said in a statement
today. Total return, which combines changes in real estate
values and rental income, was 0.6 percent last month.  “It may seem like insignificant growth, but this is an
important milestone for the U.K.  property market ,” Phil Tily, a
managing director at IPD, said in the statement. “After the
double-dip recession and a fall in values of over 37 percent,
U.K. property has finally, painstakingly, clawed itself back to
growth.”  The commercial property market is improving as bank lending
increases and overseas buyers look beyond London to purchase
real estate.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said on June 4
that stimulus provided by the central bank meant there were
“good reasons to suppose that a gentler recovery is under
way.”  Office property values had a 0.2 percent gain in May and
retail and warehouse values were little changed, according to
IPD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
