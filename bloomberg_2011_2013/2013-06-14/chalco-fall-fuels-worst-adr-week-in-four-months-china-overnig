Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd. led
declines among Chinese companies traded in New York, helping
fuel the benchmark index’s biggest weekly slump in four months,
after the metal producer was cut from a Hong Kong stock index.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. sank 1.8 percent to 86.42 yesterday
for a weekly retreat of 4.2 percent. Beijing-based Aluminum
Corp., known as Chalco, tumbled 8.9 percent to the lowest level
since 2008, while  China Southern Airlines Co. (CEA)  dropped to the
lowest price since September.  Bona Film Group Ltd. (BONA)  plunged the
most this year while PetroChina Co. slid after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its price target.  The China-US gauge’s fourth retreat in five weeks has left
its members trading at  11.8 times  estimated profit on average,
the lowest level since April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
American depositary receipts of loss-making Chalco, China’s
biggest aluminum maker, traded at a discount to Hong Kong shares
after it was removed from the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.  “Expectations for a rebound in the Chinese economy weren’t
realized as seen from the latest economic data,” Qinwei Wang,
an economist focused on China at Capital Economics Ltd., a
London-based research firm, said in a phone interview. “Even if
we see a rebound in the near future after recent weakness in the
stocks, it won’t be strong due to the lack of notable recovery
signs in the economy. Big commodity producers won’t perform well
as China’s investment slows.”  ETF Sinks  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., retreated 2.7 percent to
$33.98, the steepest slump in two months. It lost 4.7 percent
for the week. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.6
percent to 1,626.73, falling 1 percent for the week.  Chalco’s ADRs slid to $8.37 in New York, taking its weekly
decline to 11 percent, the most since November 2011.  The company’s Hong Kong-traded stock was removed from the
Hang Seng China enterprises gauge effective after markets closed
yesterday, according to  statement  posted on the website of the
Hang Seng Indexes Co. May 10 after a quarterly review of its
components.  ADRs of China Southern, Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger
numbers, tumbled 5.5 percent to $21, the lowest price in nine
months.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil producer, fell 3.9
percent to $105.75, the lowest level since June 2010. The ADRs
of the Beijing-based company traded 0.8 percent  below  its Hong
Kong shares, erasing a 2.8 percent premium reached on June 13.
Each ADR is equivalent to 100 underlying shares in the Beijing-based company.  Goldman Sachs analyst Arthur Yan reduced the price target
for PetroChina to $129 on June 13 from $146.  Bona Tumbles  Bona Film, a Beijing-based filmmaker, plunged 7.6 percent
to $3.90, the lowest level since December 2011. Trading volume
on the stock was more than five times the daily average over the
past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The Hang Seng China gauge in Hong Kong dropped 0.2 percent
to 9,667.42, extending a 12-day decline that was the longest
since 1993. Its weekly loss of 5.1 percent was the biggest in 13
months. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 0.6 percent to
2,162.04, after falling for eight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
