International Automotive Components
Group SA, the auto-parts supplier owned by billionaire  Wilbur Ross , is seeking $115 million in a U.S. initial public offering.  The company, based in Luxembourg, didn’t say in its U.S.
regulatory filing today how many shares it would offer or at
what price. The offering size is a placeholder used to calculate
registration fees and may change.  International Automotive had delayed its IPO plans in 2011
because of market turmoil in the U.S. and Europe, people
familiar with the process said at the time. The company
generated sales of $4.73 billion in the 12 months through
March 30 of this year, with about half coming from  North
America , according to its filing today.  Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt, the
company said in the filing. International Automotive plans to
list on the  New York  Stock Exchange under the symbol IACG. Bank
of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are
leading the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
