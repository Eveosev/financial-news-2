Natural gas futures dropped in New
York, capping a third weekly decline, on forecasts of moderating
weather that would limit demand from  power plants .  Gas slipped 2.1 percent as mostly normal temperatures are
forecast in the eastern half of the U.S. through June 28,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .
The high in New York on June 19 may be 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27
Celsius), matching the day’s average, according to  AccuWeather
Inc . in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “We’re not seeing super-hot temperatures, so it doesn’t
look like prices are going to get that type of support,” said
 Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst for Price Futures Group in
 Chicago . “The weather is going to be the key for this market.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 8.1 cents to settle at
$3.733 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 34 percent below the
100-day average at 2:41 p.m. Prices have climbed 11 percent this
year and dropped 2.5 percent this week.  The discount of July to October futures widened 0.2 cent to
4.3 cents.  August $4 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were 4.7 cents higher at 30 cents per million Btu
on volume of 2,667 at 2:56 p.m. Puts accounted for 78 percent of
trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options
expiring in July was 27.50 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with

Fahrenheit, 4 below normal, AccuWeather said. Power generation
accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas demand, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  A report yesterday from the EIA showed stockpiles rose 95
billion cubic feet in the week ended June 7. Analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg predicted an increase of 96 billion. The
five-year average gain for the week is 84 billion.  Inventories totaled 2.347 trillion cubic feet, 2.4 percent
below the five-year average and 20 percent less than last year’s
total for the period.  “With the weather expected to be mostly neutral for the
next several weeks, there is a good possibility that gap between
current inventories and the five-year average could be
eliminated before the end of June,” Dominick Chirichella,
senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in  New York ,
said in a note to clients today.  Gas Rigs  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
fell by one to 353 this week, a report from Baker Hughes Inc. in
Houston showed today. The total is down 18 percent this year.  The U.S. raised its forecast for 2013 marketed natural gas
production to 70.01 billion cubic feet a day, topping 70 billion
for the first time, from last month’s estimate of 69.9 billion,
the EIA said June 11 in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.
Onshore output is projected to rise as Gulf of Mexico production
declines, according to the report. Supplies may climb 1.2
percent from last year.  Demand will average 70.04 billion cubic feet a day this
year, compared with last month’s prediction of 70.17 billion,
the agency said. Rising prices will reduce gas consumption by
electricity generators, the EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
