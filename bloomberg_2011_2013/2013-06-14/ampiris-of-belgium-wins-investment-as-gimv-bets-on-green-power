Lampiris SA, a Belgian green power
supplier, won 40 million euros ($53 million) of investment from
 Gimv NV (GIMB)  and Societe Regionale d’Investissement de Wallonie SA as
the nation’s investors bet on the expansion of clean energy.  Lampiris, based in Liege, will use the investment to fund
its growth as it seeks to become  Belgium ’s leading independent
supplier of gas and green electricity, Gimv, the Antwerp-based
investor, said today in a statement. With about 9 percent of the
gas and 6.5 percent of the  electricity market , Lampiris is
currently Belgium’s third-largest energy supplier, it said.  Gimv and the Walloon region investment company SRIW are
seeking to benefit from the country’s goal of boosting energy
from renewable sources to 13 percent of the total by 2020, from
about 4.2 percent in 2012, according to European Commission
data. Belgium gets most of its energy from oil, gas and nuclear
power, according to the European Union’s executive arm.  “By boosting the company’s equity, we provide it with the
opportunity to make the most of the many opportunities available
in a market that is changing rapidly,” Olivier Vanderijst,
chief executive officer of SRIW, said in the statement.
Lampiris, set up in 2003, supplies more than 770,000 accounts
with gas or green power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
