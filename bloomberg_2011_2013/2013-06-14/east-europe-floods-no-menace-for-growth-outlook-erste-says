Central and east European flooding
will have a “negligible” impact on regional economic growth as
advance preparations helped curb damage after devastating floods
11 years ago, Erste Group Bank AG analysts said.  Economic damage caused in recent weeks are “only a
fraction of those in 2002, which amounted to about 6 billion
euros ($8 billion)” for  Austria , the Czech Republic,  Hungary 
and Slovakia, Juraj Kotian, a Vienna-based fixed-income analyst
said in an e-mailed note today. “The negative short-term impact
on gross domestic product is negligible as production outages
were limited, with no major production plant being hit in CEE,”
and agriculture-related losses unlikely to exceed 0.1 percent of
GDP, according to the note.  Swollen rivers including the Danube and the Vltava sparked
the worst floods since 2002 in the region and  Germany .
Overflowing rivers killed 10 people in the Czech Republic while
tens of thousands had to evacuate to escape the water that
inundated cities and towns, shut down factories and disrupted
rail, road and river traffic.  Post-flooding repairs will have a slightly positive effect
on GDP in upcoming quarters, and governments are likely to
invest in flood-protection systems over the coming years, Kotian
said. Erste analysts aren’t changing their full-year GDP
forecasts, he said.  Erste sees the Hungarian economy expanding 0.2 percent this
year, projects a 0.3 percent contraction in the  Czech Republic 
and 0.5 percent economic growth in Slovakia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
