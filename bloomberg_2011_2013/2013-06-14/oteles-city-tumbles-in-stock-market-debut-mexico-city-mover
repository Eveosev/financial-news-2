Hoteles City Express SAB (HCITY*) , Mexico’s
third-largest hotel chain, tumbled in its first day of trading
after pricing its initial public offering at the bottom of its
projected range.  The shares fell 5.2 percent to 22.75 pesos at 1:11 p.m. in
Mexico City. The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican companies
slipped 0.2 percent.  Hoteles City raised 2.54 billion pesos ($200 million) in
its IPO, or as much as 2.92 billion pesos if underwriters
exercise an overallotment option, the Mexico City-based company
said in a filing today. The price per share was 24 pesos. In
earlier filings the company had estimated the shares would fetch
as much as 29 pesos.  The price “is evidence that demand wasn’t strong and
confirms our view that the offering multiples weren’t
attractive,” Jorge Placido, head of fundamentals-based analysis
at Vector Casa de Bolsa SA, said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
