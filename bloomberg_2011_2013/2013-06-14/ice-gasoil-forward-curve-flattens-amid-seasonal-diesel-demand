ICE gasoil contracts for the rest of
2013 moved into a flatter structure, reflecting expectations
that supplies will tighten because of summer demand for diesel
in  Europe .  The July contract traded today at a discount of about $1 a
metric ton to December gasoil, compared with $6.50 a ton on June
7. Front-month July futures traded at $891.75 a ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange at 1:44 p.m. London time, compared with
this year’s closing high of $1,030.75 reached on Feb. 8.  “Diesel consumption in Europe is highly seasonal and peaks
in summer,”  David Wech , managing director at JBC Energy GmbH in
Vienna, said today by phone. “Also, heating oil demand was
pretty high over the winter months this year due to cold weather
throughout most of Europe, and it makes sense to re-stock as
prices are reasonably low now.”  BNP Paribas SA yesterday recommended buying the front-month
ICE gasoil spread. Consumer re-stocking and “discretionary”
refinery run cuts due to narrow profit margins can support
higher prices, the bank said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
