Cattle futures slid to a three-week
low on speculation that demand for U.S. beef is slowing as
grocers fill orders for the summer holidays. Hog prices also
declined.  Meatpackers processed 3.5 percent fewer cattle in the first
five days of this week than the same period in 2012, according
to government figures. Wholesale  beef  fell 0.2 percent to
$2.0015 a pound as of midday, the lowest since May 1, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Independence Day  on July 4
is the most-popular day for outdoor grilling, according to the
Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association.  “For the most part, the beef trade remains rather
stagnant,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle
Brokerage LLC in Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in a report. “We could
see the market trade sideways early next week as retailers
finish Fourth of July buying.”  Cattle futures for August delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
settle at $1.18325 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $1.18025, the lowest for a
most-active contract since May 24. This week, the commodity fell
0.8 percent, the second straight decline.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slid 1.4
percent to $1.434 a pound.  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.6 percent to 96.75
cents a pound. The contract climbed 1.7 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
