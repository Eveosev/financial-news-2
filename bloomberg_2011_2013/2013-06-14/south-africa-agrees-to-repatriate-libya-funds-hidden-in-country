South Africa said it will track and
repatriate Libyan funds and assets that were hidden in the
country during the rule of dictator  Muammar Qaddafi .  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  reached the agreement after
talks with Libyan officials, including Usama al Abid, minister
in the office of Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zaidan, on June 4,
according to a statement from the South African finance
ministry. The repatriation will be done under United Nations
protocols.  Libya, which ousted Qaddafi last year, is seeking the
return of overseas assets after the value of its sovereign
wealth fund dropped. The Libyan Investment Authorityâ€™s assets
are about $57 billion, down from about $61 billion in 2008,
outgoing sovereign wealth head Mohsen Derregia said in March.  The country is also examining losses on derivative
contracts it entered into with Societe Generale SA and Goldman
Sachs Group that contributed to the declines, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
