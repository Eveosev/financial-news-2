(Corrects fourth paragraph to say rate increases are
negative for the stock market.)  The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  fell after a report
showing Brazilian inflation was higher than forecast rekindled
concern that policy makers will maintain the faster pace of
 interest rate  increases established at their last meeting.  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  led declines among homebuilders as the BM&F
Bovespa Real Estate Index fell for the first time in three days.
Retailer Lojas Americanas SA fell toward a nine-month low.
Steelmaker Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA fell the most
on the benchmark gauge.  The Ibovespa declined 0.9 percent to 49,944.39 at 11:29
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , extending the weekly drop to 3.3 percent. The
real weakened 0.7 percent to 2.1351 per dollar and swap rates
increased after prices as measured by the IGP-10 index climbed
0.63 percent in June, according to Getulio Vargas Foundation.
The median estimate among 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a 0.45 percent increase.  “Inflation is really resistant, so the central bank should
have to increase rates again, which is negative for the stock
market and for Brazilian companies, which have already been
struggling amid weak growth,”  Pedro Galdi , chief analyst at the
Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora, said by phone.  The central bank raised the target lending rate by a half-percentage point to 8 percent at its last meeting, surprising
most analysts who predicted a quarter-percentage point increase.
 Latin America ’s largest economy expanded 0.6 percent in the
first three months of 2013, below estimates of a 0.9 percent
expansion.  Gafisa slid 4.5 percent to 3.42 reais. Lojas Americanas
fell 1.8 percent to 15.31 reais. Usiminas, as Usinas
Siderurgicas is known, dropped 4.4 percent to 8.08 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
