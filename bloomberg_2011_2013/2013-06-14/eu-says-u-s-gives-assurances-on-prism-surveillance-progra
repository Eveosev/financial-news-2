The European Union said U.S.
Attorney General Eric Holder provided  “assurances”  about the
Prism surveillance program amid concerns over its impact on EU
citizens.  The EU’s questions about the once-secret program “have
been answered very clearly by Eric Holder,” EU Justice
Commissioner  Viviane Reding  told reporters today in Dublin after
a meeting with the U.S. official.  Reding had voiced “serious concerns” that the U.S. was
accessing and processing data of EU citizens using American
online service providers under the Prism program, according to a
June 10 letter to Holder obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Holder explained that under the Prism program, “there has
to be a court order, that it can only be done when there is a
serious presumption of crime and that it is not an invasive
overall spying on every citizen’s communication,” Reding said.
She said the two sides agreed to set up an EU-U.S. panel of
experts “in order to clarify together the remaining matters”
regarding the Prism program.  Reding said she also received “answers and assurances” on
a separate U.S. surveillance program to collect phone records of
Verizon Communications Inc. customers. The Verizon program is
“directed mainly toward U.S. citizens. It is about metadata,
not about content,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
