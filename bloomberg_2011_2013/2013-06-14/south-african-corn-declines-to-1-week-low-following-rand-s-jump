Corn in  South Africa  fell to the
lowest level in more than a week.  White corn for delivery in July retreated 2.1 percent to
2,266.80 rand ($229.23) a metric ton, the lowest closing price
since June 4, by the midday close on the South African Futures
Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in the same month
dropped 2.2 percent to 2,231 rand a ton.  The rand, which gained 2.6 percent against the  U.S. dollar 
yesterday, making imports of the grain cheaper, today swung
between gains and losses, adding as much as 0.2 percent and
falling as much as 0.9 percent.  Meal made from white corn is a staple food in South Africa
and the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed  in the
continent’s largest producer of the grain.  Wheat for delivery in July fell for a third day to 3,520
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
