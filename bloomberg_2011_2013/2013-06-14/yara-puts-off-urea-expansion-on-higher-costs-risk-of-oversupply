Yara International ASA (YAR) , the largest
publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer maker, postponed an
expansion of its Belle Plaine plant in  Canada  to stem rising
costs and prevent a surplus of urea.  The move was “primarily due to recent increases in
construction cost, both in Canada and  North America  generally,”
Chief Executive Officer Joergen Ole Haslestad said in a filing.
“There is also a significant risk of future nitrogen oversupply
in North America as new project initiatives are announced.”  Yara, based in Oslo, is adapting to lower prices for its
nitrogen fertilizer as Chinese exports of urea climb. The
planned expansion, which would add about 1.3 million metric tons
of urea production a year, remains an option for the company
once construction costs ease, Yara said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
