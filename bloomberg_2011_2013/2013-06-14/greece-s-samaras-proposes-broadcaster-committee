Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
proposed setting up a committee to recruit a small staff to
reopen the country’s state broadcaster and end an impasse with
his coalition partners that has threatened the stability of his
year-old government.  Under the proposal, a committee with cross-party support
would hire a small number of employees to immediately reopen the
broadcaster, known as ERT. A bill for a new state broadcaster
has already been submitted to parliament and may be voted on
next week, Samaras said in an e-mailed statement.  “I expect a responsible stance from the political leaders
so that the collaboration between us can continue unhindered,”
Samaras said in the statement.  The proposal by Samaras comes before a meeting scheduled
for June 17 with  Evangelos Venizelos  and Fotis Kouvelis, leaders
of Pasok and Democratic Left, junior partners in his coalition
government. The two parties provide him with the parliamentary
majority he needs to draw on the 240 billion euros ($320
billion) in aid from euro area countries and the  International
Monetary Fund .  The premier overrode objections from the coalition partners
and eliminated 2,600 jobs at ERT on June 11, saying a smaller
company would take its place.  An official from Pasok, who asked not to be named, said the
proposal from Samaras wasn’t enough.  To contact the reporter on this story:
