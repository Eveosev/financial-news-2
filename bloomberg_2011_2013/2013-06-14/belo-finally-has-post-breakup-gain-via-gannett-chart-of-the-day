Belo Corp. (BLC) ’s most steadfast
shareholders were made whole more than five years after the
media company got out of the newspaper business, and they have
Gannett Co. to thank.  Belo owned the  Dallas  Morning News and other papers before
a separation in February 2008. The publishing operation became
A.H. Belo Corp., which had been the corporate name before the
initials were dropped in 2001. Belo was left with television
stations and cable-news channels.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, Belo’s shares traded for
more than their pre-breakup price yesterday, when they climbed
28 percent. That hadn’t happened since the first week after the
separation. The catalyst was a $1.5 billion takeover offer from
Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and owner of 23 TV stations.  Although A.H. Belo also rose yesterday, the 0.3 percent
gain was too small to lift the stock above the price where it
began trading. Its decline since becoming a stand-alone company
was 58 percent, as the chart shows. A.H. Belo and Belo are both
based in Dallas.  Gannett, based in McLean,  Virginia , agreed to buy Belo for
$13.75 a share. The offer is 7.6 percent more than the stock’s
adjusted price at the time of the breakup, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Belo might have risen above the adjusted price even without
the deal, according to  Edward Atorino , an analyst at Benchmark
Co. in New York. His 12-month estimate for the stock was $13,
and he reaffirmed the projection four days ago in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
