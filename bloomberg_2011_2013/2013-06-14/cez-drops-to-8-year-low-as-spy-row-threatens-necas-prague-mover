CEZ AS fell to an eight-year low as
a spy scandal threatens the government of Prime Minister Petr Necas, stoking concern the Czech Republic’s biggest utility will
be levied with new taxes if the opposition comes to power.  The shares lost 1.7 percent to 515 koruna by the close in
Prague, falling for an eighth day to the lowest since July 2005,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Turnover was 288
percent of the daily average from the last three months. The  PX
index (PX)  closed 0.1 percent lower.  Necas has refused to quit after police charged officials
including his head of office and military intelligence chief
with organizing an illegal surveillance operation. The
opposition Social Democrats, emboldened by an opinion-poll lead
a year before elections are normally due, called a June 18 no-confidence vote. The party has said it seeks to impose special
taxes on energy, finance and telecommunications companies.  “The recent government scandal is a major risk for CEZ as
it could force the prime minister out and new elections would be
coming,” John Milton, a Budapest-based director at Ipopema
Securities SA, said in e-mailed comments. “The opposition said
it will levy big taxes on the energy sector.”  Telefonica Czech Republic AS, the country’s biggest phone
company, slumped 2.8 percent, the most since April 9, to 290
koruna. CEZ shares have tumbled 24 percent this year, trailing
an 11 percent decrease for the PX Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
