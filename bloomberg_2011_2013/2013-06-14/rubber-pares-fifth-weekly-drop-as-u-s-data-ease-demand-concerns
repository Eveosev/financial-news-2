Rubber rebounded from a nine-month
low, paring a fifth weekly drop, as better-than-expected U.S.
retail sales and jobs data eased concerns demand may weaken for
the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in November gained as much as 2.4
percent to 236.8 yen a kilogram ($2,493 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, after reaching the lowest settlement
since Sept. 7 yesterday. Futures have lost 4.2 percent this
week, extending this year’s drop to 22 percent. They traded at
235.4 yen at 11:13 a.m. local time.  Data today may show U.S. industrial output expanded in May,
adding to evidence that the world’s largest economy is
improving. Reports showed yesterday the biggest increase in
retail sales in three months and fewer-than-expected jobless
claims.  “Rubber was bought back as the U.S. data halted a slump in
global stocks and a rally in the yen,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  The yen traded at 95.02 per dollar after jumping to 93.79
yesterday, the strongest level since April 4, weakening the
appeal of the contracts denominated by the Japanese currency.
It’s poised for a fourth-straight week of gains versus the
dollar, the longest since July 2012.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 1.1 percent to 86.50 baht
($2.80) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.3 percent to 17,795  yuan  ($2,899) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
