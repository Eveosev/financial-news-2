Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
cocoa producer, will refund exporters and processors buying
undersized beans to allow them to resume purchases and
shipments, industry regulator Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao said.  Refunds will apply to purchases of cocoa batches containing
116 to 140 beans per 100 grams (3.5 ounces) made June 17 to July
31, the Abidjan-based CCC said on its website today. The
payments will vary from 58  CFA francs  (12 cents) to 130 CFA
francs per kilogram (2.2 pounds).  Shippers and grinders asked for bigger discounts for
batches of more than 115 beans per 100 grams, the CCC said.
Processors and traders had said the price paid for beans from
the smaller of two annual harvests that runs from April to
September didn’t match the quality of beans for sale, Lome,
Togo-based lender  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , which finances the
trade in Ivory Coast, said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  “The discounts will apply mostly to mid-crop beans and it
shows that there was a massive pressure from traders and
processors on the government,”  Edward George , head of soft
commodities reasearch at the bank, said by phone today. “This
is a positive development for cocoa flow, but we will need to
see how arrivals pan out.”  Small Beans  Farmers in Ivory Coast say they can’t sell supplies from
the mid-crop because dry weather left beans too small. The
country will allow shipments of a maximum of 120 beans per 100
grams, the Ministry of Finance said on April 2. Sizes from a
246-farmer cooperative in the eastern town of Abengourou are on
average 140 to 150 beans per 100 grams, Leon Adou Edoukou, head
of the group, said on May 8.  The refund was agreed June 6 “in the interest of
guaranteeing producers a stable revenue and to allow exporters
to resume their buying and export activity,” the board wrote.
“No discount is allowed on the guaranteed field-side price.”  Cocoa for  delivery  in July fell 1.9 percent to 1,477 pounds
($2,313) a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  and earlier today dropped
to 1,469 pounds, the lowest price for that contract since April
9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
