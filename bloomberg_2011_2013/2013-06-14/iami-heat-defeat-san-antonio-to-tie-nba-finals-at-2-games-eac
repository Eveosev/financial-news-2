The Heat bounced back from their
worst postseason defeat to tie the National Basketball
Association Finals at two games apiece and ensure that the
series returns to Miami.  LeBron James had 33 points and 11 rebounds, and Dwyane Wade
had 32 points, as the defending champion Heat topped the host
San Antonio Spurs 109-93 to even the best-of-seven series at two
games apiece.  Wade had 10 of his points as the Heat outscored the Spurs
28-17 in the fourth quarter last night, one game after losing by
36 points to San Antonio.  “We came in yesterday and really worked hard,” Wade said
in a televised interview. “Offensively, we just played
basketball. We just want to come out and play that way again.”  Game 5 will be June 16 in San Antonio, and the teams will
return to  Florida  for Game 6 on June 18. The Heat will also host
a decisive Game 7 on June 20 if necessary.  Chris Bosh added 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Heat,
who did not have any player score as many as 20 points in the
first three games of the series. Wade had a total of 43 points
in the series before Game 4.  Tim Duncan had 20 points to lead the Spurs and Tony Parker
ignored a strained right hamstring to score 15 points in the
first half, then went scoreless in the final two periods at the
AT&T Center in San Antonio.  Thirteen Steals  Miami had seven blocks and forced the Spurs, who had a
record-low four turnovers in the June 6 series opener, into 19
turnovers while committing only nine. The score would have been
much more lopsided if not for the Spurs hitting eight of 16 3-pointers.  Wade recorded six steals, while James and Bosh had two each
for the Heat, who had a total of 13 to five for the Spurs.  After a roller-coaster first half in which each team had a
10-point lead, the Spurs and Heat went into halftime tied 49-49.
Parker and James each had 15 points in the first half.  The Heat led by five points heading into the fourth
quarter. Miami extended its lead to 100-85 as Wade scored eight
straight points for the Heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
