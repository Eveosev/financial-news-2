U.S. stocks fell, extending a weekly loss, as the  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2014 American growth forecast and warned that tapering of Federal Reserve stimulus may be risky if not handled properly. Treasuries and commodities rise, while the yen rallied.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.6 percent to 1,626.73 as of 4 p.m. in  New York , extending its weekly decline to 1 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields decreased two basis points to 2.13 percent and German 10-year bunds rose for a fourth day, pushing the yield down five basis points to 1.51 percent.

The IMF lowered its prediction for 2014 U.S. growth to 2.7 percent from 3 percent and said “effective communication” on the Fed’s exit strategy and careful calibration are needed to avoid volatility in  interest rates . The gains in government debt underscored growing speculation that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke next week may damp expectations for a rate increase and indicate a measured reduction in bond-buying.  “We’re hitting a period of higher volatility,” Bryan Novak, who helps oversee about $650 million at Chicago-based Astor Asset Management LLC, said in a telephone interview. “Interest rates need to rise, but while you have an economic picture where growth is around 2 percent, you don’t have a lot margin of error to work with in terms of interest rates,” he said. “The market is going to focus heavily on every word that the Fed says.”  $3 Trillion  Almost $3 trillion has been erased from the value of global equities since Bernanke said May 22 the central bank could scale back stimulus efforts should the jobs market outlook show “sustainable improvement.”  The  S&P 500  jumped 1.5 percent yesterday, its second-biggest gain of the year.

Bernanke  scheduled to speak after the central bank’s decision on June 19.  ‘All Eyes’  Consumer confidence  in June eased from a six-year high as progress in the labor market supported Americans’ views of the economic outlook. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment declined to 82.7 in June from 84.5 the prior month that was the highest since July 2007, a report today showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was unchanged at 84.5.  “What investors are aware of is so much of this recovery is based on Fed stimulus packages and the idea of the Fed continuing to put liquidity in the system,” Eric Thorne, who helps oversee about $6 billion at  Bryn Mawr  Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr,  Pennsylvania , said in a phone interview. “All eyes are on the Fed in terms of what policy might be like three to six months from now. Our take on it is that the Fed is unlikely to step in with any kind of potential damper. The Fed will not be anxious to raise interest rates any time soon.”  Economic Data  Industrial production, which measures output at mines and utilities in addition to factories, climbed 0.2 percent in May after a 0.5 percent drop the previous month, according to the median of 85 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
