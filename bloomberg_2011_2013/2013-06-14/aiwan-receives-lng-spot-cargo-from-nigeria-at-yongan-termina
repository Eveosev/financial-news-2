CPC Corp.,  Taiwan ’s state-run energy
company and importer of liquefied natural gas, received a spot
cargo from Nigeria at its Yongan terminal, according to ship
tracking data.  The British Diamond, with a capacity of about 152,000 cubic
meters, arrived yesterday at the port of Yongan in southern
Taiwan, ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg
show. The tanker sailed from Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s Bonny Island
terminal, where it loaded the supercooled gas and departed on
May 16.  CPC has no long-term LNG purchase contracts with Nigeria
LNG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Taipei-based
company has a 3 million metric-ton-a-year receiving facility at
Taichung and a 7.4 million-ton terminal at Yongan.  Nigeria LNG, Africa’s largest exporter of the fuel, lifted
a force majeure on supplies on June 12 after  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  resumed gas deliveries to its plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
