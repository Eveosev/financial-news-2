Russia ’s benchmark equity gauge
snapped thee days of declines, rebounding from the lowest level
in more than a year.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6 percent to 1,289.10 by 10:42 a.m.
in Moscow, paring its fifth weekly loss to 4.1 percent. The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex climbed to 33.8 from
31.4 yesterday, the closest since April to a level of 30, which
signals a rebound to some analysts.  Russian equity indexes will surge between 20 percent and 30
percent by the end of 2013 on higher earnings and dividend
payouts, Vladimir Potapov, chief executive officer at VTB
Capital Investment Management, said in an interview June 11.
Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, traded near the highest
level in more than three weeks at $96.56 a barrel in  New York  as
U.S. retail sales increased the most in three months in May,
while the number of jobless claims dropped last week, according
to data yesterday.  “Good data in the world’s biggest economy has a positive
impact on the investor sentiment toward the Russian market,”
Vladimir Savov, an equities strategist at Otkritie Capital in
Moscow, said by phone. “We’re bouncing back today.”  The dollar-denominated RTS Index, which entered a  bear
market  last week, rose 1.2 percent to 1,277.31.  Urals crude ,

May to the fastest pace in 21 months, according to data last
week.  This week’s central bank meeting was the last scheduled

takes over June 24 as chairman. The Economy Ministry lowered
this year’s growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 3.6 percent in
April.  “We’re expecting a rate cut next month,” Savov said. “If
we don’t see one, it’ll have a negative effect on the market.”  The world economy will expand 2.2 percent, less than a
January forecast for 2.4 percent growth and slower than last
year’s 2.3 percent, the  World Bank  said in a report on June 12.
It lowered its prediction for developing economies and sees the
euro region’s gross domestic product shrinking 0.6 percent.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested the

billion of debt a month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on  interest rates .  Alrosa Rises  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials was
