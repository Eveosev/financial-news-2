Immigrating from Scotland to the
U.S.,  Andrew Carnegie  took his first job at age 13 as a bobbin
boy, toiling 12 hours a day, six days a week at a cotton
factory.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  He later made a fortune in the railroad and steel
industries and spent much of his life figuring out how to give
his money away. “The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced,”
he wrote in “Wealth.”  Leaving your heirs vast sums only encouraged them to live
dissipated, idle lives. It was also no good giving the poor alms
-- you needed to make ladders for them to climb out of their
misery.  The accumulated riches of the new capitalists should be
used for the greater good of the community, Carnegie decided,
and he devoted his wealth to creating libraries, museums,
schools and scientific research.  I spoke with Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corp.
of New York and formerly president of the New York Public
Library and  Brown University , during the Good Talk series at
Bloomberg. In considering philanthropy, we focused on the
following topics:  1. American Giving  2. Paine’s Individualism  3. Action, Not Motivation  4. Laboratory for Nation  5. Acid Cynicism  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
former editor of Harper’s magazine. He hosts “The World in
Time” interview series for Bloomberg News.)  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans  and  Craig Seligman  on
 movies .  To contact the writer on the story:
