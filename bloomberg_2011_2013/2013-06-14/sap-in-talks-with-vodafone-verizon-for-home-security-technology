SAP AG (SAP) , the biggest maker of
business-management software, is in discussions with phone
companies including  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  about providing software to help
run home security systems.  SAP sees connected devices for homes and businesses as a
growth engine as more appliances become available that can
connect to each other, as well as the Internet, and collect data
on their usage, SAP’s head of mobile Sanjay Poonen said in an
interview today.  “The amount of spending on this is going to get higher and
higher,” Poonen said. “The industries where this is happening
are industries where SAP is historically very strong.”  Ericsson AB Chief Executive Officer  Hans Vestberg  said in
February that machine-to-machine service revenue will exceed
$200 billion by 2017. Ericsson, the world’s largest maker of
wireless networks, and SAP are working together to build
technology for connected appliances, the companies said in
February. The talks with phone companies are part of this
initiative, Poonen said.  Telecommunications companies are increasingly looking for
ways to interconnect refrigerators, security systems,
thermostats and cars with mobile devices as connected appliances
and vehicles become more common.  Sarah Ryan, a Vodafone spokeswoman, and Marion Kessing, a
spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, and Verizon Communications
spokesman Bob Varretoni had no immediate comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
