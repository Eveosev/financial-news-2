South Korea’s National Pension
Service, the nation’s biggest investor, plans to allocate more
funds to overseas equities as it seeks to boost returns.  The agency, which had 406 trillion won ($360 billion) in
assets as of March, will raise the weighting of overseas stocks
to 10.5 percent of its assets in 2014, the Ministry of Health
and Welfare, which oversees the NPS, said in a statement today.
That compares with the 2013 target of 9.3 percent. The fund is
keeping its target for domestic equities unchanged at 20 percent
and aims to pare domestic bond holdings to 54.2 percent of
assets next year from 56.1 percent targeted for 2013.  “It’s inevitable for us to turn to overseas stocks for
higher profits as we’re unable to actively invest in domestic
equities because we possess” a 6 percent stake of the domestic
stock market already, said Lee Hyung Hoon, director of the
national pension fund policy division at the health ministry.  Buying more international equities may expose the pension
fund to overseas fund flows that have dragged the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index by 10 percent through yesterday from May 22.
That’s the day when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said the central bank could scale back asset purchases
if it’s confident in sustained economic improvement.  South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  index sank 5.6 percent in that time.
The benchmark gauge added 0.4 percent at the close in Seoul
after a three-day, 2.6 percent slump. It trades for 8.6 times
projected 12-month profit, compared with the developing-nation
gauge’s 9.8 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Fund Outflows  Lower appetite for risky assets prompted international
investors to sell a net $2.8 billion of South Korean equities
 this month , the data show. Net sales of $867 million yesterday
were the most since August 2011.  The NPS aims to raise the proportion of alternative
investments including infrastructure, property and private
equity to 11.3 percent of assets in 2014, according to today’s
statement. That’s up from the 10.6 percent objective for this
year. The fund plans to keep its target for overseas bonds
unchanged at 4 percent.  “Increasing the portion of foreign equities looks to be an
effort carried out to diversify the agency’s investment
portfolio,” Han Sang Soo, a Seoul-based fund manager at Samsung
Asset Management Co., which oversees $114 billion. “The fact
that it has cut the portion of domestic bonds and boosted the
figure in alternative investment indicates that we may see a
rise in the country’s interest rate in the future.”  Won, Yen  The central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 2.5 percent yesterday after a surprise cut in May aimed at
boosting an economy hit by a drop in the yen.  Japan ’s currency
has slumped about 17 percent against the won since the start of
October, hurting the competitiveness of South Korean exporters
versus Japanese rivals.  South Korea’s  economy  grew 0.8 percent in the first quarter
from the previous three months as the government front-loaded
spending. While the economy is on a sustained recovery trend,
heightened volatility of the Japanese yen poses a risk, the Bank
of Korea said in a June 13 statement.  The NPS cut on May 29 its five-year target for investment
returns to account for slowing growth in an economy that grew
last year at the slowest pace since 2009. The government lowered
its forecast for 2013 gross domestic product on March 29 to 2.3
percent from 3 percent.  Japanese Pensions  The South Korean pension fund’s latest five-year asset
allocation plan calls for the agency to increase  stocks  to more
than 30 percent of assets by the end of 2018 from 26.7 percent
in 2012, according to a May 29  statement  from the Ministry of
Health & Welfare. The fund is targeting returns on stock, bond
and property investments of 6.1 percent for 2014-2018, down from
6.6 percent announced last year for 2013-2017, according to that
statement.  The NPS is targeting bonds to take up less than 60 percent
of assets by 2018 from 64.8 percent last year, the May statement
showed. The South Korean fund’s plan to buy more stocks and
reduce bonds follow a similar move by Japan’s public pension
fund to favor higher-yielding assets as it prepares to fund
retirements in the world’s most elderly population.  The proportion of assets held by the Government Pension
Investment Fund in Japanese bonds will be cut to 60 percent from
67 percent, the nation’s health ministry said on June 7. The
weighting of local shares will be increased to 12 percent from
11 percent currently, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
