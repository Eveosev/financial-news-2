Consumer confidence  in June eased
from a six-year high as progress in the labor market supported
Americans’ views of the economic outlook.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
 index  of consumer sentiment declined to 82.7 in June from 84.5
the prior month that was the highest since July 2007, a report
today showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was
unchanged at 84.5.  Steady hiring gains coupled with rising equity prices and
property values are underpinning Americans’ confidence. Further
improvement from the 175,000 jobs added last month may be needed
to help accelerate the consumer purchases that make up about 70
percent of the economy.  “The stock market peaked in late May, so you may be seeing
some of that being reflected in the number,” said  Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New
York , who projected a drop in the gauge to 82.5. “In general,
the consumer is in a relatively good position.”  Forecasts in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 82 to 89. The
index averaged 64.2 during the recession that ended in June 2009
and 89 in the five years prior.  Bloomberg Comfort  The Michigan survey follows the weekly Bloomberg Consumer
 Comfort Index (COMFCOMF) , released yesterday, which slipped to minus 31.3
for the period ended June 9, a two-month low, from minus 29.7.
It reached a five-year high of minus 28.9 in late April.  The decline in the Michigan survey this month was centered
in the current conditions index, which takes stock of Americans’
views of their personal finances. The measure dropped to 92.1
from 98 in May, which was the highest since August 2007.  The index of expectations six months from now climbed to
76.7 this month, the highest since November, from 75.8 in May.  Steady job gains and lower borrowing costs may be lifting
Americans’ spirits and encouraging them to spend, benefiting
retailers such as  St. Paul , Minnesota-based  3M Co. (MMM)   “We do expect some modest improvement as we go through the
year based on a view that the economy is going to continuously
show some improving resilience,” David Meline, chief financial
officer at 3M, said at a June 12 conference.  Retail sales  rose 0.6 percent in May, higher than forecast
and the biggest increase in three months, Commerce Department
figures showed yesterday.  Payroll Gain  Employers added 175,000 jobs last month, the Labor
Department said last week. Hiring gains averaged 189,200 in the
first five months this year compared to 182,750 in all of 2012.  The labor market gains haven’t been enough to convince
Federal Reserve officials to alter accommodative monetary
policy, which is helping keep  interest rates  low and attracting
buyers of big purchases such as autos and homes.  The rate on a 30-year fixed home loan, while rising for a
sixth period to 3.98 percent in the week ended June 13, has
remained below 4 percent since the end of March 2012,  Freddie
Mac  reported. It reached a record-low 3.31 percent in late
November, according to the figures that date to 1972.  Consumers surveyed for today’s confidence report expect an
inflation rate of 3.2 percent over the next 12 months, up from
the May forecast of 3.1 percent. Over the next five years,
Americans expect a 3 percent rate of inflation, an increase from
the 2.9 percent projected last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
