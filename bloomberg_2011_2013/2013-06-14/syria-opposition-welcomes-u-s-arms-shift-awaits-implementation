The U.S. decision to arm the Syrian
opposition is a “good” step and should be implemented as soon
as possible, a senior member of the Syrian National Coalition
said.  “We welcome the U.S. step,” Abdelbaset Sieda said in a
phone interview from  Stockholm  today. “We are waiting for its
execution.” He said the decision “came very late” and Syria
could have avoided escalating violence, an increase in Islamic
extremism and the spillover of the conflict into other countries
had there been a “firm” U.S. position from the start.  Another member of the coalition, Najib Ghadbian, said in a
statement posted by the group on its Facebook page that the U.S.
support should be “strategic and decisive in order to force an
end to the violence and to achieve a political transition and
improve chances of a successful Geneva II conference.”  The U.S. is stepping up assistance to opponents of Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad, including aid that would have
“direct military purposes on the ground,”  Ben Rhodes , U.S.
President  Barack Obama ’s deputy national security adviser, said
yesterday, without elaborating.  Russia , which has backed Assad,
and the U.S. are also pushing for peace talks in Geneva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
