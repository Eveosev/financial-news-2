Canadian  stocks  were little changed,
following the biggest gain in seven weeks, as a rise in utility
shares offset a decline among raw-materials producers.  Just Energy Group Inc. added 2.4 percent. Niko Resources
Ltd. fell 2.3 percent. OceanaGold Corp. and Novagold Resources
Inc. rose at least 1.7 percent as the price of the precious
metal added 0.8 percent.  The  Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 4.12 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,281.25 at 10:12 a.m. in Toronto.  Data today showed factory sales fell at the fastest pace in
more than three years in April a widespread drop led by slower
oil-refinery production and metal output.  The Bank of Canada predicts the economic expansion will
rotate to exports and investment from consumer and government
spending even amid what it calls the slowest export recovery
since World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
