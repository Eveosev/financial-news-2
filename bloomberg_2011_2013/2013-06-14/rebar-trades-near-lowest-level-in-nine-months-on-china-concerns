Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near a nine month low as investors remained
concerned that economic growth is slowing in the world’s biggest
steel consumer.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined as much as 1.2 percent to 3,382  yuan  ($551) a
metric ton, the lowest since Sept. 7. The contract traded at
3,420 yuan at 11:16 a.m. Futures are little changed in a
holiday-shortened week.  Chinese stocks tumbled yesterday after a three-day holiday
as government reports showed industrial production and exports
trailed economists’ estimates in May. The  average spot price  for
rebar declined 0.9 percent to 3,393 yuan a ton yesterday, the
lowest since Sept. 7, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  “A sense of weakness is permeating the  spot market ,
reflecting bearish sentiment among traders over the outlook for
the building material,” Huang Fulong, analyst at Citic
Securities Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in China
gained 1 percent yesterday to $112 a dry ton, according to The
Steel Index Ltd. The steel making ingredient fell to $110.40 a
dry ton on May 31, the lowest since October.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
