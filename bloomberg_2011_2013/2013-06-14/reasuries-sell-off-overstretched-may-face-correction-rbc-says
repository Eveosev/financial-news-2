The recent decline in Treasuries has
gone too far and a small change in investor sentiment may spur a
reversal, according to  Michael Cloherty , at Royal Bank of
Canada’s  RBC Capital Markets .  U.S 10-year  yields  fell two basis points to 2.13 percent at
8:45 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
The yield rose to 2.29 percent on June 11, the highest level
since April 2012. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Fed policy makers next gather on June 18-19 and Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to hold a press conference after
the meeting. The central bank is buying $85 billion of Treasury
and mortgage debt a month, and has kept the  target  for overnight
lending between banks at almost zero since December 2008.
Bernanke said on May 22 the Fed could reduce purchases if the
employment outlook shows sustainable improvement.  “The sell-off is a bit overstretched and that only needs
to see a modest change in sentiment to get a correction,”
Cloherty, the head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital
in  New York , wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “The Fed’s
communication strategy will shift to sending the message that
tapering does not mean a rapid transition to higher Fed funds
rates,” Cloherty wrote.  RBC Capital, one of 21 firms that trade directly with the
Fed, said it expects the central bank to announce tapering in
October. If tapering stops in April, policy makers are likely to
raise the Fed funds rate in the third quarter of 2015, according
to the report.  The 10-year yield will be 2.10 percent at the end of June,
rising to 2.33 percent by year-end, according to median
economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey from June 7 to
June 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
