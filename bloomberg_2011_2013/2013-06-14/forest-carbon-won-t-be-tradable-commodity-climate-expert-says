Emissions reductions created through
forest protection never will become a tradable commodity, and
private investors are beginning to realize that, a consultant
for the Third World Network said.  Forest carbon can’t be measured as accurately as CO2
discharges from industrial projects, Kate Dooley, who advises
the environmental group on climate change issues, said today in
Bonn. Under the  United Nations’ Reduced Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation  program, or REDD,
developing nations protect and manage their forests in exchange
for funding from developed states to support their efforts.  “If you think that REDD can be established as a carbon
market, if you think that forest carbon can be measured to the
level of accuracy to satisfy investors to invest in it as a
carbon market, I think that there’s a lot of disappointment in
that,” she said in an interview at the UN talks in the German
city. “Governments will drive this and the private-sector
interest in forest carbon is really falling away.”  Greenhouse-gas discharges caused by deforestation represent
about 20 percent of the world’s total emissions, according to
the UN. Nations have been discussing since 2008 how to
incorporate REDD into global action on climate change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
