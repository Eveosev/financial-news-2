The number of  diesel  cargoes booked
for export to Europe from the U.S.  Gulf Coast  is set to climb
after output of refined oil products was the highest in at least
23 years, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter 12 Medium Range tankers for loading to
June 26, the average of estimates from seven shipbrokers
specializing in the trade showed this week. That’s three more
vessels, each normally carrying 38,000 metric tons of the fuel,
than in a corresponding survey last week.  Production of distillate fuel oils on the Gulf Coast was
the  highest  since at least January 1990 in the week of May 31,
according to figures from the U.S. Energy Department, which
classifies the area as PADD 3. Refinery restarts in the Midwest
will lift capacity by more than 300,000 barrels a day, boosting
Gulf Coast distillate exports, Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a report June 10.  “The U.S. is producing too much diesel and has to get rid
of it,” Ehsan Ul-Haq, an analyst at KBC Energy Economics in
Walton-on-Thames,  England , said by phone yesterday. “Demand
from the  Middle East  is also taking diesel out of the
Mediterranean, and European buyers will replace this with diesel
from the U.S.”  Hire costs for tankers on the Gulf Coast-to-Europe voyage
gained for a fifth session in six yesterday, climbing 4.1
percent to 89.64 industry-standard Worldscale points, according
to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London .  Six of the projected bookings have been arranged and the
rest are anticipated, the latest survey showed. Thirty tankers
will be seeking cargoes, compared with 32 in the previous
survey, according to the shipbrokers.  The survey is based on the Houston-to-Amsterdam route, a
benchmark for the trade that takes about 17 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. The table below
details numbers of ships booked, likely to be hired and
available for charter for the two weeks from the stated dates.  *T                             June 12     June 5      Change
