The average price of Beijing’s
luxury homes excluding town houses jumped to the highest in 17
months in May, as wealthy buyers favored bigger properties under
the government’s purchase restrictions, a local agency said.  Apartments more expensive than 50,000  yuan  ($8,155) per
square meter (10.76 square feet) sold for 53,329 yuan on
average, 5 percent higher than in April and rising for the
fourth consecutive month,  Yahao Real Estate Selling & Consulting
Solution Agency  said in an e-mailed report. Total sales surged
28 percent to 3.55 billion yuan, the realtor said.  New-home prices in Beijing rose by 3.1 percent in April
from the previous month, the biggest gain among the nation’s
four first-tier cities, as the capital’s property curbs, the
country’s strictest, failed to deter homebuyers, according to
 SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  Those curbs have included minimum down
payment requirements for second homes of 70 percent and a ban on
single-person households from buying more than one residence.  “The super-rich buyers now like bigger, high-end
properties more” as the government curbs make it more difficult
to buy a second home, Gao Shan, Yahao’s deputy general manager,
said in the report. “The scarcity of core urban land resources
is driving up the value of luxury homes.”  Thirty five out of 56 luxury projects that were already
open to subscription managed to sell 323 units last month in
Beijing, compared with 325 apartments in April, according to
Yahao. No new luxury projects became available in May as local
officials rejected presale permits for projects deemed too
expensive and developers delayed sales, according to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
