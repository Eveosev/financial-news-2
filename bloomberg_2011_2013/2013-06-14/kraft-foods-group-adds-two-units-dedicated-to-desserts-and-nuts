  Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT) , the North
American grocery business that separated from the snacks
enterprise, said it will add two standalone business units to
focus its brand-building work.  A meals and desserts division will market brands including
Kraft Mac & Cheese and Velveeta dinners, Stove Top stuffing,
Cool Whip and Jell-o, the Northfield, Illinois-based company
said today in a statement. The second  unit  will center on so-called enhancers, such as A.1. steak sauce and Grey Poupon
mustard, and snack nuts like Planters. The other units center on
beverages, cheese, refrigerated meals and foodservice.  The expansion to six total business units will reduce the
complexity of managing a disparate portfolio while increasing
focus on brand-building, the company said. The new units begin
operation July 1 and will report the first results at the end of
the third quarter.  “We’ve focused heavily on turbocharging our iconic
brands,” Chief Executive Officer Tony Vernon said in the
statement.“We’re taking an important step to strengthen our
focus.”  The meals and desserts unit will be run by Michael Osanloo,
who currently manages Kraft’s grocery unit, the company said.
Jane Hilk, senior vice president of marketing for Oscar Mayer,
will run the Enhancers and snack nuts unit.  Kraft Foods declined 0.8 percent to $55.56 at 11:25 a.m. in
New York. Through yesterday, the shares had risen 23 percent
this year, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
