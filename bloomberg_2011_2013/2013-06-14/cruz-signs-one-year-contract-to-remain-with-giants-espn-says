New York  Giants wide receiver  Victor Cruz  will sign a one-year contract worth $2.879 million to
remain with the National Football League team next season,
according to ESPN.  The 26-year-old restricted free agent told ESPN that he
will sign the deal -- a mandatory offer under the NFL’s labor
agreement -- while he pursues a long-term contract with the team
before the start of training camp next month, according to the
network.  Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon declined in an e-mail to
comment on the report.  Undrafted out of the  University of Massachusetts , Cruz had
a team-leading 1,092 yards receiving and 10 touchdown catches
last season. That followed his first full year, in which he
caught nine touchdown passes and had 1,536 yards receiving, a
franchise record for a single season.  Giants owner  John Mara  announced in March that the team was
assigning a first-round status to the Pro Bowl wide receiver,
allowing New York to match any offer or accept a first-round
pick as compensation.  The Giants had the right to reduce Cruz’s tender to
slightly more than $600,000 had he not signed the tender today,
ESPN said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
