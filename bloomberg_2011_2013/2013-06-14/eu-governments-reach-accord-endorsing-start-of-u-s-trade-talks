 European Union countries authorized
the start of talks with the U.S. on a free-trade agreement after
bowing to French demands to exclude the film industry, Irish and
Dutch officials said.  EU governments gave the European Commission, the bloc’s
regulatory arm, a mandate for negotiations with the U.S. Trade
Representative to expand the world’s biggest economic
relationship. The goal is to remove tariffs, ease regulatory
barriers and expand access in investment, services and public
procurement.  Trade ministers from the 27-nation EU struck the accord
today in Luxembourg after a 13-hour meeting that was chaired by
Ireland, current holder of the bloc’s rotating presidency.  With the EU in a recession, the U.S. in a slow recovery and
the World Trade Organization in deadlock over efforts to open
markets, European and American policymakers are seeking
commercial deals with individual countries or groups of nations
to spur growth. Trade will feature at a June 17-18 meeting of
Group of Eight leaders in the U.K.  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Europe’s biggest
economy, said she would throw her “full political weight
behind” a free-trade pact between the EU and the U.S.  “We need big projects together that unite us,” Merkel
said in an interview today in Berlin. “We ought to use this
window of opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
