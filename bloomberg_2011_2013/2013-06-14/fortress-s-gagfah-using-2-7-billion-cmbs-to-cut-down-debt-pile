     June 14 (Bloomberg) -- Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the German residential
landlord that faced more than 3.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion)
of debt repayments this year, said it’s issuing a 2 billion-euro
commercial-mortgage backed security to pay most of its
obligations.  The second-largest owner of German homes, priced the 5-year
CMBS at an average interest rate of 2.76 percent, compared with
4.32 percent for the loan being refinanced, the Luxembourg-based
company said in a statement today. The German Residential
Funding loan had been set to expire in August.  “Refinancing at such attractive terms puts us in a great
position and enables us to shift focus on our core business,”
Gagfah Chief Executive Officer Thomas Zinnoecker said in the
statement.  Gagfah, controlled by New York-based  Fortress Investment
Group LLC (FIG) ,  has for the past year sought to refinance debt taken
on during the credit boom that preceded the global financial
crisis. The company abandoned a plan to sell a quarter of its
apartments to pay a loan used to buy homes in Dresden after it
was able to borrow 1.1 billion euros from  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
in February.  Bank of America in May sold bonds backed by that loan in
the first public CMBS deal in  Europe  this year. Gagfah still has
another 150 million euros of debt due in October.  Gagfah rose as much as 5.8 percent to 9.70 euros in
Frankfurt trading, the most since March 22. The stock was
trading at 9.60 euros as of 2:54 p.m.  Fortress owns 66 percent of Gagfah, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Gagfah owns about 144,000 apartments in
cities such as Dresden and Berlin. Deutsche Annington Immobilien
AG,  Germany ’s biggest residential landlord, owns about 180,000
apartments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
