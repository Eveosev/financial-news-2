Corn fell, capping the biggest
weekly slump since April, on signs of easing global demand as
farmers complete planting of a projected record crop in the
U.S., the world’s top exporter. Wheat and soybeans declined.  Export  sales  of corn in the week ended June 6 slid to
149,460 metric tons, the lowest since January, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. Farmers may  harvest 
14.005 billion bushels, 30 percent more than a year earlier,
boosting global  production  by 12 percent to a record, the agency
said on June 12. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecast
yesterday, citing the U.S. recovery from last year’s drought.  “Global supplies are on the rise, and that has reduced
demand for U.S. corn,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness
for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “The  weather forecasts  for warm
temperatures and regular rains should improve U.S. crop
potential. We are shifting to a more plentiful supply outlook.”  Corn futures for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to
close at $5.33 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. This week, the price dropped 4.6 percent, the most since
the five days ended April 5.  Goldman cut its price forecasts for corn to $4.75 and $11 a
bushel for soybeans in three, six and 12 months. The previous
estimates for the latter two periods were $5.25 for the grain
and $12.50 for the oilseed.  Soybean futures for delivery in November slipped 0.2
percent to $12.9825. This week, the price dropped 2.4 percent.
The U.S. harvest will surge 12 percent this year to a record
3.39 billion bushels, according to the USDA.  Corn and soybeans for July delivery rose as farmers
withheld remaining supplies from last year’s harvest that was
reduced by drought, Grow said.  For July, corn advanced 1.8 percent to $6.55 and soybeans
gained 0.4 percent to $15.165.  Wheat futures for July delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$6.8075 a bushel. This week, the price dropped 2.2 percent as
harvesting advances across the U.S., the largest exporter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
