Genetically altered  Monsanto Co. (MON) 
wheat found in an Oregon field in April hasn’t been found on any
other farms or in commerce, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said.  The department has interviewed the farmer who owns the
field as well as the vendor who sold the seed and is continuing
interviews with about 200 area growers, the USDA said today in a
statement. Monsanto said last week its investigation is pointing
toward an isolated occurrence.  “As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of
anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more
than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single
farm,” the department said in updating its investigation into
the source of the rouge wheat.  The wheat showed up in Oregon eight years after St. Louis-based Monsanto ended field tests. It was found growing on about
1 percent of the farmer’s 125-acre (51-hectare) field, and he
submitted it to  Oregon State University  for testing after an
application of Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide didn’t kill it.  Since it was announced May 29, Japan,  Korea  and Taiwan
postponed imports of U.S. white wheat as they study what further
action may be required, while Monsanto, the world’s largest seed
company, is facing several lawsuits over the market impact of
potential contamination.  Wheat futures, which entered a  bear market  in January
because of rising global supplies, have fallen 2 percent since
the May 29 announcement of the Oregon contamination, closing at
$6.8875 a bushel today in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
