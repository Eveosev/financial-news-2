Japanese  stocks  rebounded from
yesterday’s plunge as U.S. data beat estimates and concerns
eased the  Federal Reserve  will soon reduce stimulus. Shares also
gained after Nomura Holdings Inc. and Fidelity Worldwide said
the country’s market would climb to new highs.  Nissan Motor Co., the country’s second-largest carmaker,
added 0.7 percent. Real-estate shares led advances as all but
three of the 33 Topix index  industry groups  rose. Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd., the nation’s No. 2 maker of heavy equipment,
climbed 4.3 percent after removing its president and ending
merger talks with Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co.  The Topix added 1.2 percent to 1,056.45 at the close in
 Tokyo , after climbing as much as 3.2 percent. The gauge rose for
a first day in four, paring this week’s loss to less than 0.1
percent. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average, which fell into a  bear
market  yesterday after retreating more than 20 percent from a
May 22 high, increased 1.9 percent to 12,686.52, after jumping
as much as 3.6 percent.  “Psychologically the market feels like we’re nearly done
with the correction,” said Juichi Wako, a Tokyo-based
strategist at Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage. “It’s a good
sign the rise in long-term  interest rates  didn’t harm the  U.S.
economy . It’s leading to a sense of security in the market.”  The Nikkei 225 plunged on May 23 and entered a bear market
yesterday. Shares have fallen amid a strengthening yen,
disappointment about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s delay in
implementing a growth strategy and concern the Fed will scale
back stimulus.  With more than $500 billion wiped from  Japan ’s  market
capitalization  from the May high through yesterday, brokerages
and investors are seeing buying opportunities.  Bullish Stance  “Assuming that Abenomics has not been defeated, we see no
reason to become bearish on Japanese stocks, and recommend a
bullish stance,” analysts led by Hiromichi Tamura at Nomura
wrote in a report yesterday. The brokerage increased its year-end estimate for the Topix to 1,500 from 1,350, while boosting
the outlook for earnings per share to 82.5 from 75.  Earnings for Topix companies will jump 53 percent this
fiscal year to 78.85 yen a share, according to analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. After retreating 18 percent since May 22,
the gauge is trading at 13.4 times estimated earnings, compared
with 16.6 in May and the three-year average of 14.6. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, where earnings are expected to rise
11 percent this year, trades for 14.8 times forecast profit.  Rally Intact  “There are reasons to be optimistic that further weakness
will be temporary and that the peak is not behind us,” Alex Treves, head of equities Japan for Fidelity Worldwide, which
manages about $248 billion, said by e-mail. “The key drivers of
the rally remain intact, valuations are still reasonable and
earnings are projected to recover to 2007 highs.”  Even after the correction, the Topix has climbed 22 percent
this year, making it the best-performing major equity gauge.  Japan’s broader measure has swung an average of 3.5 percent
daily since May 22. Its 30-day historic  volatility  reached 41.80
today, the highest level since the 2011 earthquake.  Shares advanced even as the yen strengthened against the
dollar for a fourth day. The currency traded at 94.97 as of 3:10
p.m. in Tokyo, gaining versus its major peers and poised for a
weekly advance against all 16, as the most volatile  currency
markets  in a year spurred investors to buy assets considered
less risky.  Kawasaki Heavy gained 4.3 percent to 319 yen. The firm
fired Satoshi Hasegawa as president and said it ended talks to
merge with Mitsui Engineering, two months after denying the two
companies had entered discussions to combine.  Explanation Requested  The Tokyo Stock Exchange said today it asked Kawasaki
Heavy, which yesterday appointed Shigeru Murayama, head of the
company’s aerospace business, as its new president, to explain
why it revised its April 22 filing, which had said reports of
merger talks weren’t true. Mitsui Engineering sank 5.5 percent
to 137 yen, the biggest decline on the Nikkei 225.  Trend Micro Inc. added 6.3 percent to 3,070 yen after the
maker of anti-virus software said it began supplying systems to
a unit of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.  Zappallas Inc. (3770)  slumped 11.4 percent to 68,300 yen, the
biggest fall on the Topix, after the maker of content for mobile
phones forecast a 32 percent decline in profit.  Futures on the  S&P 500  lost 0.1 percent, after the gauge
added 1.5 percent yesterday as retail sales climbed the most in
three months and jobless claims dropped. Stocks and Treasuries
also rose yesterday as the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed
may “push back” on expectations for higher borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
