Energy rigs in the U.S. gained this
week as producers deployed more horizontal and directional
equipment to cut drilling times and boost crude production.  Oil rigs  advanced by seven to 1,413, data posted on  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website showed. The  gas count  fell by one to 353,
the Houston-based field-services company said.  Total rigs  rose
by six to 1,771.  The rig count, which has declined for five straight
quarters, may have hit a bottom as producers respond to a
rebound in oil and gas prices this year. The count is up 23 this
quarter. Drilling permits in the 30 U.S. states monitored by
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  climbed 2.7 percent in May after a 7.9 percent drop
in April.  “We’re at the bottom, and we’ve turned the corner,” James Williams, president of WTRG Economics in  London ,  Arkansas , said
by telephone today. “As long as oil prices hold anywhere near
their current level, we’ll see incentive for drilling from
 Oklahoma  on north to the big plays in North Dakota.”  U.S. oil output slipped 1 percent to 7.22 million barrels a
day last week, EIA data show. Production reached 7.37 million
barrels a day in the week ended May 3, the most since 1992.
Stockpiles gained 2.52 million barrels to 393.8 million.  Crude for July delivery rose $1.16, or 1.2 percent, to
settle at $97.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices have increased 17 percent in the past year.  Directional Rigs  Oil-targeted directional rigs, used by producers to produce
multiple wells off the same drilling pad, rose by three to 176
this week, the highest level since Baker Hughes began keeping
the statistic on Feb. 4, 2011. Horizontal rigs focused on oil
rose by three to 840, and vertical rigs climbed by one to 397.  “Most of the increases are coming from horizontal and
directional drilling, and you don’t have to move those rigs as
far to get them redeployed,” Williams said. “That means we’re
seeing generally more productive wells because you can do more
in the same amount of time.”  Drilling permits increased the most last month in  Ohio ,
where they rose by 98, according to London-based Barclays.
Wyoming gained 91 and  Kentucky  added 44.  “We believe the increase in permit activity represents a
consistent rise in U.S. land drilling activity which we expect
to accelerate into” the second half of the year, James C. West,
an oil services and drilling analyst at Barclays’s investment-banking unit in New York, said in a research note yesterday.  Natural Gas  Natural gas for July delivery declined 8.1 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $3.733 per million British thermal units
on the Nymex, up 50 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 95 billion cubic feet in the
week ended June 7 to 2.347 trillion, 2.4 percent below the five-year average, the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday. Supplies were 20
percent below year-earlier inventories.  Louisiana gained the most rigs this week, adding three to
109. West Virginia lost the most, falling by two to 22.  Rigs on land  gained eight to 1,694, a one-month high. Rigs
in  inland waters  were unchanged at 23. The offshore rig count,
primarily in the  Gulf of Mexico , lost two to 54.  Canadian energy rigs climbed for the fifth straight week,
adding 24 to 176, following a seasonal drilling pattern.  To contact the reporters on this story:
