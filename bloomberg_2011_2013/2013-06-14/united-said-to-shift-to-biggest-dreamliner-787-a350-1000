United Airlines (UAL)  is in talks to buy
the largest versions of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner and Airbus
SAS’s A350, making it the first U.S. carrier to fly the new
long-haul jets, people familiar with the matter said.  The carrier will modify a 2009 order to take 25 wide-body
A350-1000s instead of the smaller -900 variant as once planned,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
discussions are private. United also will convert options for a
couple dozen A350s and Dreamliners into firm orders, with the
Boeing jets being the new 787-10X model, the people said.  United’s possible shift is a boost for both planemakers
ahead of next week’s  Paris Air Show . Chicago-based Boeing is
targeting the new Dreamliner to compete with the A350-900, while
Toulouse, France-based Airbus is touting the -1000 over its U.S.
rival’s 777, the world’s largest twin-engine jetliner.  Switching to  A350-1000s  would increase the value of
United’s 25 order conversions by 15 percent to $8.3 billion,
based on list prices before the discounts that are typical in
the industry. The -1000s seat  350 passengers  in a typical three-class configuration, compared with 314 for the  A350-900 . The
787-10X will seat about 43 more people than the 250 to 290
passengers on the 787-9, Boeing has said.  United hasn’t settled on an allocation of the options being
converted to 787-10X Dreamliners and A350s, the people said.  New Aircraft  United, a unit of United Continental Holdings Inc., is
stocking up on new aircraft as it looks to replace its oldest
Boeing 747s and expand overseas. The carrier has been in talks
with Airbus about buying A350-1000 jets since last year, people
familiar with the matter said in October.  Boeing hasn’t published a price yet for the 787-10X.
 Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  agreed last month to take 30 of the
787-10X Dreamliners in an order split with Airbus whose
valuation implied a catalog price of about $279 million.  “We don’t comment publicly on our conversations with
customers,”  Marc Birtel , a Boeing spokesman, said yesterday
when asked to comment about the talks with United. Mary Anne Greczyn, a spokeswoman for Airbus, declined to comment.  Planemakers are courting almost 30 airlines worldwide that
are exploring placing large orders collectively valued at about
$185 billion,  Howard Rubel , a New York-based equity analyst with
Jefferies LLC, said yesterday in a report to clients.  Pending Deals  Some of the pending deals will close during the Paris show,
with other campaigns dragging into next year, Rubel said. The
expo begins June 17 and is the industry’s biggest annual
showcase for new models.  As the A350 completed its four-hour maiden voyage returning
to southwestern  France  yesterday, Airbus executives vowed to
challenge Boeing’s supremacy of the wide-body market.  “We want more than 50 percent of this market and we will
have more than 50 percent of this market,” Airbus Chief
Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said of the estimated 6,000
wide-body plane sales up for grabs over the next 20 years.  United is the only U.S. carrier to fly the composite
plastic Dreamliner so far, and has 49 of the smaller Boeing 787
models on order, according to its most recent quarterly
regulatory filing. Six of them have been delivered so far, and
two more are scheduled for delivery before year’s end.  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  and  Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA)  are the
only other U.S. airlines with A350s on order.  The Wall Street Journal reported June 13 that United might
be a customer for the 787-10X.  To contact the reporters on this story:
