Cattle futures dropped for a third
straight day on speculation that demand for U.S. beef is slowing
as grocers fill orders for the summer holidays. Hog prices also
declined.  Meatpackers processed 3.9 percent fewer cattle in the first
four days of this week than the same period in 2012, government
data show. Wholesale  beef  fell 0.6 percent to $2.0063 a pound
yesterday, the lowest since May 6, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  Independence Day  on July 4 is the most-popular day for outdoor grilling, according to the Hearth, Patio
and Barbecue Association.  “For the most part, the beef trade remains rather
stagnant,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle
Brokerage LLC in Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed report.
“We could see the market trade sideways early next week as
retailers finish Fourth of July buying.”  Cattle futures for August delivery slumped 0.4 percent to
$1.186 a pound at 10:29 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
heading for a second straight weekly decline, down 0.5 percent.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slid 0.4
percent to $1.44875 a pound.  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.6 percent to 96.75
cents a pound. The contract is still up 1.6 percent for the
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
