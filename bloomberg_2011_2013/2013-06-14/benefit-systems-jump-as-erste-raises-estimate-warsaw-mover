Benefit Systems SA, a Polish
provider of employee-perk programs, headed for the highest in
almost two months after Erste Group Bank AG raised its price
estimate by 22 percent and maintained its buy recommendation.  The  shares  gained 4.8 percent to 264 zloty, the highest
level on closing basis since April 17, by 12:25 p.m. in Warsaw,
valuing the company at 635 million zloty ($201 million).
Turnover was 224 percent the daily average from the last three
months. Erste raised its price estimate for the company to 306
zloty from 250 zloty.  Benefit Systems seeks to diversify from its flagship
Multisport card, which its clients buy to reduce gym fees for
their employees, by starting a cinema tickets program as well as
catering subscriptions. The Warsaw-based company also invests in
fitness clubs by granting loans and buying stakes.  “Benefit continues its fast pace of top line growth,
supported mainly by the acquisition of new clients for core
products,” Marek Czachor, a Warsaw-based analyst at Erste, said
in a report today. “The development of new business lines
currently burdens the operating results, but we believe that
this will create extra value in the coming years.”  Erste expects Benefit’s new investments to lead to an
improvement of the company’s margins in 2015. Benefit Systems
has gained 15 percent in 2013, compared with a 2 percent advance
in Warsaw’s WIG Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
