Treasuries advanced for a second day
as some investors dismissed as overblown speculation that the
Federal Reserve was about to slow its bond-buying stimulus
program aimed at holding down borrowing costs.  Ten-year notes extended gains after climbing the most
yesterday in almost four months and rose for the first week
since April. The benchmark yields fell from 14-month highs
reached this week as investors weighed whether the economy is
 accelerating  enough for the Fed to consider cutting stimulus.
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said slowing won’t mean an end to
easing. The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets June 18-19.  “The market has found a new range and is content to trade
it going into the FOMC meeting next week,” said Michael Lorizio, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston .
“Cooler heads prevailed as far as the pace of the economy and
the Fed’s comfort level with where the economy is going.”  U.S. 10-year  yields  dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.13 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They slid eight basis
points yesterday, the most since Feb. 25. The price of the 1.75
percent note due in May 2023 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face
amount, to 96 5/8.  The benchmark yield lost four basis points this  week . It
touched 2.29 percent June 11, the highest since April 2012.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields fell one basis point to 3.31
percent. They climbed to 3.43 percent on June 11, also the
highest since April 2012, and decreased three basis points on
the week.  Refining Expectations  “The market is in the process of refining Fed policy
expectations,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . Investors are
curtailing “expectations for the Fed to be more aggressive on
the tapering front,” Lyngen said.  Hedge-fund managers and other large investors  reversed 
their bets on 10-year note futures for a fifth straight week,
taking a net-short position, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or wagers that prices will
fall, on the futures outnumbered long positions by 9,195
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade for the week ended June
11.  Last week, traders were net-long 19,684 contracts.  Foreign Holdings  Foreign holdings of Treasuries fell in April by the most
since June 2006, according to the Treasury International Capital
report released today in  Washington .  Total holdings of U.S.  government securities  fell by $69.6
billion, or 1.2 percent, to $5.67 trillion.  Foreign official holders, such as  central banks  and finance
ministries, reduced their holdings by $28.5 billion, or 0.7
percent, to $4.06 trillion, while all other overseas investors
reduced their positions in the debt by $41.1 billion to $1.61
trillion, the data show.  Bernanke will hold a press conference after policy makers’
two-day meeting next week.  The Fed chief, in testimony to Congress’s Joint Economic
Committee on May 22, said the central bank “expects a highly
accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate
for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends
and the economic recovery strengthens.”  The central bank will reduce its buying to $65 billion a
month at its Oct. 29-30 meeting, according to the median
estimate last week in a Bloomberg survey of 59 economists.  Changing Flow  Changing the flow of purchases does not necessarily yield a
smaller central-bank balance sheet, Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said in a May 29 speech. “Even if we were to adjust
the rate of monthly purchases, the ultimate size of the Fed’s
balance sheet would depend on the point of cessation,” he said.  The Wall Street Journal reported the Fed may push back on
expectations of a rate increase.  The central bank through its purchases has increased its
 assets  to $3.4 trillion. It’s currently buying $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgage securities a month, and has kept the
 target  for overnight lending between banks at almost zero since
December 2008.  The Fed purchased $1.46 billion of Treasuries today
maturing from February 2036 to May 2043. Investors offered $2.7
billion of the securities to the central bank. The Fed has
purchases  scheduled  next week totaling as much as $12.8 billion.  IMF View  The  International Monetary Fund  sees the central bank
maintaining large monthly bond purchases until at least the end
of this year and urged policy makers to carefully manage their
exit plan to avoid disrupting financial markets.  Unwinding a policy of record-low interest rates and bond-buying will be challenging, the IMF staff wrote in its annual
assessment of the  U.S. economy . The Washington-based
organization cut its American growth forecast for 2014 to 2.7
percent, from 3 percent.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE Index was at 78.45, after rising to 84.75 on
June 6 and June 10, the highest level in almost a year. It has
averaged 62 over the past 12 months.  Demand fell at Treasury auctions this week of $66 billion
of three-, 10- and 30-year debt amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may cut back on bond buying.  Investors placed $2.96 of offers for each dollar of debt
sold this year at the U.S. government’s $971 billion in auctions
of Treasury notes and bonds, compared with a record bid-to-cover
ratio of $3.15 in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Treasuries lost 1.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to the Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds
declined 0.9 percent, while Japanese government securities
returned 0.3 percent.  Ten-year yields will increase to 2.35 percent by Dec. 31,
according to the median forecast of 76 analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . Thirty-year yields will end the year at 3.4
percent, analysts projected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
