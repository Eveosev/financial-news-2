Edcon Holdings Pty Ltd., a South
African clothing retailer owned by Bain Capital Partners LLC,
has been granted the local franchise rights to German fashion
brand Tom Tailor and U.K.-based footwear label Dune.  The first stand-alone Tom Tailor and Dune stores will open
in August in the Johannesburg suburb of Sandton, Edcon said in
e-mailed statement today. Denim concessions from Hamburg-based
 Tom Tailor Holding AG (TTI)  will be opened in 25 Edcon-owned Edgars
stores from July, while store-in-store Dune outlets will be
opened in four Edgars shops in November.  “It is our constant aim to bring our customers a wider
choice of international fashion brands that are of high quality
and are affordable to the local market,” Chief Executive
Officer Jurgen Schreiber said in the statement.  Last year Edcon got South African franchise rights to U.K.-
based Arcadia Group Ltd.’s Topshop and Topman fashion chains.  Earlier this month Edcon posted a wider annual loss as
changes in stores and management disrupted sales. Trading space
at Edcon, which owns chains including Jet, CNA, Boardmans and
Red Square, may grow between 5 and 6 percent in the year through
March 2014, Schreiber said June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
