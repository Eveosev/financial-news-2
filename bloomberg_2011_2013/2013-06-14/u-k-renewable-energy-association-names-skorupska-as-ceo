The U.K. Renewable Energy
Association, the industry’s main lobby group, named former  RWE
AG (RWE)  official Nina Skorupska as its new chief executive officer.  Skorupska will replace Gaynor Hartnell as CEO on July 29,
the association said today in an e-mailed  statement . Hartnell
said in March that she would step down to pursue other
interests.  Skorupska worked for National Power in the 1990s, and
became the first woman to manage RWE Npower’s Didcot B power
station. More recently, she served as chief technology officer
at RWE’s Essent NV Dutch unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
